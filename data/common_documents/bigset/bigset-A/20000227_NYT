SUDDENLY, A KIWI SWEEP IS LOOKING MORE THAN LIKELY
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ After an America's Cup week in which the
lasting images will be those of an Italian crewman laid low by a
blow to the head, and the Prada Challenge's silver boat Luna Rossa
in relentless and fruitless pursuit of Team New Zealand's powerful
NZL 60, perhaps only one more symbolic picture is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   That would be the sight of a broom lashed to the masthead of the
Kiwi yacht, for with three races down in the best-of-9 finals _ a
trio of victories for the crew of NZL 60, who have been dominant in
every aspect of the game _ the Italians are in serious danger of
being swept.
</P>
<P>
   The Prada crew was granted a temporary stay of execution Sunday
when racing was canceled, for the third time since the cup match
began, because of a lack of breeze on the Hauraki Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   But races are still scheduled for Tuesday and Thursday of this
week, and if they go off as scheduled, and the Italians cannot
reverse their fortunes, they will not last to see the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   When the finals started last Sunday, after Prada had earned the
right to tangle with the Kiwis _ after a four-month-long
challenger's regatta in which they posted a 31-8 record, including
a dramatic triumph over Paul Cayard's America One in the series
final _ a sweep by either team seemed impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Now, unless Prada can demonstrate the speed and skills that
brought them face to face with the New Zealanders, it appears
unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   Tactically, the Kiwis have been superb, winning all three starts
thus far and taking command of the day's events at the outset of
each contest. In all yacht racing, but especially in boat-to-boat
match racing, controlling the start is critical. It is something
the New Zealanders have spent countless hours on in the lead-up to
the cup, and it shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've put a lot of effort into pre-starts because we do think
they're important,'' said Russell Coutts, the Team New Zealand
helmsman and skipper. Before the cup finals, much was made of the
lack of a Kiwi defense lead-up with outside competition, and how it
might prove detrimental. Such talk, clearly, was unfounded. In
fact, the Kiwi sailor Tom Dodson said, the New Zealander's second
boat, with the back-up helmsman Dean Barker in control, has given
Coutts a more difficult time in practice than anything presented by
the Italians.
</P>
<P>
   The Kiwis have parlayed their early leads into insurmountable
advantages by showing an uncanny ability to sniff out the first
wind shift on the inaugural leg, and pulling away from there. In
the first three races, they have led around every mark on every leg
of every race.
</P>
<P>
   The Tactician Brad Butterworth, who was the brains aboard the
winning Kiwi boat in San Diego in 1995 and has resumed his role
with this edition of Team New Zealand, is now 8-0 in cup finals. In
Saturday's Race 3, as usual, Butterworth was nonchalant about the
move that put NZL 60 ahead for good, his call to head to the left
of the course at the outset of Leg 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were 19 seconds ahead but the left was quite favored,'' he
said. ``As soon as the boats tacked, the breeze came in from the
left and the lead turned into 30 seconds. It would've been really
difficult to pass if you were behind and that's the way we read
it.''
</P>
<P>
   With good starts and sound tactics, the Kiwis would already be
hugely favored to keep Prada without a victory. But combine those
with a fast, maneuverable boat, and the deal is nearly sealed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've tried a lot of different things, and a lot of them are
on the boat,'' America One's Paul Cayard said about the New
Zealanders' yacht. ``It's a bit longer than Prada and well suited
to match racing. It's fast upwind and quick to tack. They've given
Coutts a good tool.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's innovation all over it that none of us picked up on,''
the Nippon Challenge skipper Peter Gilmour added, referring to the
Kiwis' so-called millennium rig, longer waterline and knuckle bow,
among other subtle workings. ``It's amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   The consensus now is that the Kiwis are the total package, and
that the 30th running of the America's Cup has joined the realm of
foregone conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   If that is so, the greater question is not whether the Italians
are on the verge of being swept to sea, but how long it will take
the collective challengers to raise a campaign that might truly
test the defender's all-around prowess. &QL;

DEFYING EXPULSION
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Fla, Md., Cuba, Switzerland) CUBAN ENVOY IS DEPORTED AFTER(ADDS Cuban response in 7th graf) 
 (DW) 
 By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Cuban diplomat ordered expelled last week by
the United States on spying charges gave up his diplomatic immunity
Saturday and challenged U.S. officials to arrest him so that he
could prove his innocence.
</P>
<P>
   But the FBI thwarted the attempt by the diplomat, Jose
Imperatori, to argue his case from a jail cell by taking him
straight to Ronald Reagan National Airport for a flight to Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman for the State Department, James Rubin, said that
Imperatori would be flown to Cuba from Canada on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Imperatori, who was not handcuffed, did not say anything as he
was escorted from his apartment by FBI agents.
</P>
<P>
   The extraordinary confrontation _ coming at a time when the
United States and Cuba are embroiled in a dispute over whether to
return a Cuban boy to his father in Cuba or allow him to stay with
relatives in Miami _ broke the normal standards of diplomatic
conduct, by which diplomats who become entangled in charges of
espionage and are told to leave the country would depart
voluntarily. Imperatori had said earlier through his lawyer that he
would not voluntarily leave the United States by Saturday
afternoon, the deadline he had been given. As a result, Rubin said
Saturday night, Imperatori ``has been expelled from the United
States for not voluntarily departing by the appointed time.''
</P>
<P>
   In Havana, the Cuban foreign in-H ister, Felipe Perez Roque,
expressed admiration for Imperatori, say- ing his handling of the
expulsion ``is reason for Cuba and its inhabitants to be proud.''
Imperatori was identified by the Cuban interests section, which
represents the Cuban government in the United States, as the
diplomat who was accused of having been in contact with the
American immigration official charged last week with spying.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba has insisted that Imperatori did nothing wrong and met with
the official on routine business.
</P>
<P>
   Imperatori's lawyer, Kurt L. Schmoke, a former mayor of
Baltimore, said at Imperatori's apartment in Bethesda, Md., that
Imperatori would cooperate with any investigation and would be
willing to return to the United States to testify in the spy case.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the Cuban interests section, Fernando Remirez de
Estenoz, said at a news conference Saturday that the arrest of the
American immigration official and the expulsion of Imperatori were
connected to the custody battle over the Cuban boy, Elian Gonzalez.
The State Department has called such a link ``utter nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   The arrest and expulsion order, Remirez said, took place just
days before a court case concerning the boy, although the United
States contends that the charges involving Imperatori and the
American official ``went on for a year.''
</P>
<P>
   The immigration agent, Mariano M. Faget, is a senior official in
the Miami office of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
Remirez said that the accusations made against Imperatori and Faget
were false.
</P>
<P>
   Imperatori said in a letter to the head of the diplomatic
mission, Remirez:
</P>
<P>
   ``I am addressing you to submit my resignation, as of this
moment, to my position and functions in our beloved interests
section and to the prerogatives therein. I have decided to stay in
America, assuming all the necessary risks and consequences, to
struggle against the slanders that hurt my honor, and that of the
interests section in Washington and my own homeland.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement read by Felix Wilson Hernandez, the deputy chief
of the diplomatic mission, Imperatori said: ``I have become the
victim of a major slander. I have been wrongly accused of doing
intelligence work in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   He said one factor compelling him to waive his diplomatic
immunity and stay in the United States was his wish to disprove the
accusations against Faget.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government had issued an expulsion order for Imperatori
last Saturday, giving him until 1:30 p.m. Saturday to leave or face
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Although he could have avoided arrest by staying inside the
interest section _ an embassy in all but name that operates under
the auspices of the Swiss Embassy in Washington _ he chose instead
to spend Saturday at his apartment, where it would be easy to
arrest him. Schmoke pointedly gave out the street address and
apartment number at a televised news conference saturday .
</P>
<P>
   Imperatori was first accused of espionage after the FBI arrested
Faget and charged him with espionage on Feb. 17

 MANY SNITCHES STILL DOING CRIME  
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DENNIS WAGNER AND PAT FLANNERY 
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
(Phoenix) - Salvatore Gravano, the Mafia underboss turned
government snitch, may be the most notorious example of a growing
problem for America's justice system: protected witnesses who
return to crime under the noses of law-enforcement agents.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano joined the federal Witness Protection Program nine years
ago after his arrest in connection with 19 murders, loan-sharking,
illegal gambling and other crimes.
</P>
<P>
   His testimony put Gambino family boss John Gotti and 39 others
behind bars, making heroes of FBI agents, federal prosecutors and
Gravano himself.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities now believe his transition from mobster to mole did
not produce a model citizen. They say the former hit man directed a
syndicate dealing in Ecstasy, a designer drug, with the help of a
suburban White supremacist gang.
</P>
<P>
   So why didn't officials know?
</P>
<P>
   Gravano's 1991 plea agreement says he is subject to prosecution
for all past crimes if he engages in future illegal activities. It
also provided for Sammy ``the Bull'' to get a new name (Jimmy
Moran), a new home (Tempe) and a new life as a construction
contractor.
</P>
<P>
   At sentencing, the judge praised the mobster for a ``commendable
and remarkable contribution'' to society and for his commitment to
a crime-free life.
</P>
<P>
   After Gravano's release from prison five years ago, he helped
convict Vincent ``the Chin'' Gigante, and he agreed to testify in a
jury-tampering trial scheduled to begin this April.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI in return sought to protect Gravano and his secret life.
In July, after The Arizona Republic discovered Gravano in the
Phoenix area, agents in New York and Phoenix pressed the newspaper
not to publish a story.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano agreed to an interview in which he boasted of a
friendship with government agents. Gravano said he was being
monitored by U.S. marshals, and he spoke of regular phone contact
with FBI agents. He said that was a reason he felt safe despite a
purported $1 million price placed on his head by La Cosa Nostra.
</P>
<P>
   THE GOVERNMENT WITNESS &QL; 
Joe Valiquette, spokesman for the FBI's New York office, said it
would be a mistake to think agents were overseeing Gravano despite
their contact. Valiquette stressed that Gravano had left the
Witness Protection Program, was no longer on parole and was not on
the bureau's payroll.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FBI has not been protecting Mr. Gravano,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   In court Thursday, Gerard Gravano told a judge his dad was still
``dealing with the FBI.''
</P>
<P>
   Salvatore Gravano lawyer Larry Hammond said his client has been
``punctilious in the performance of his duties'' for federal
officers but would not comment on his relationship with the Justice
Department.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Marshals Service would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Morrissey, former chief U.S. marshal in Phoenix, rejected
the notion that agents have befriended Sammy Gravano or visited him
on vacation, as Gravano has claimed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe that,'' said Morrissey, who retired while
Gravano was in prison here. ``I would say that's absolute bunk.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who once headed the Drug Enforcement
Administration in Arizona, said he doubts that anyone ``looked the
other way'' or gave the former mobster immunity. Rather, he said,
it is likely that Gravano's ``semi-secret role'' with the
government created confusion and communication breakdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you don't know a snitch is dealing,'' Arpaio added.
``He's making cases and working on the side.''
</P>
<P>
   There was another unusual aspect to the arrest of Gravano, his
family and about 30 others: The FBI did not take part in the
eight-month investigation or the raids.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, despite Gravano's ongoing role as a federal witness,
Justice Department officials were not apprised of the operation
until three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis K. Burke, special assistant attorney general, said
Gravano's fate would hinge, in part, on ``his further use within
the federal system.'' Burke also acknowledged that it was odd that
FBI officials had not been given an early call.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Napolitano insisted that she never had
misgivings about the FBI's links.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we followed standard operating procedure,'' the former
U.S. attorney for Arizona said. ``I was not concerned that the FBI
or any other federal agency would do anything inappropriate with
the information they had.''
</P>
<P>
   CORRUPTED JUSTICE? &QL; 
Critics point to Gravano as the most infamous evidence of a system
corrupted by unholy alliances.
</P>
<P>
   ``How the FBI could not observe any of these illegal acts right
under their watchful eyes _ while they're protecting their (top)
informant _ just doesn't pass the smell test,'' said James Ridgeway
de Szigethy, a writer who runs a Mafia Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Boston attorney Elliot Weinstein described Gravano as a
``high-profile example of our government's misuse of cooperative
witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Bad guys lie, cheat and steal until they get caught, he said,
until they get ``flipped'' by the government. Then they lie about
other bad guys in court. And, when it's all over, they go back to
lying, cheating and stealing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where's the bright line between sanctioning criminal
misconduct and not pursuing criminal misconduct?'' Weinstein asked.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Cutler, a New York lawyer who represents Gotti, said
Gravano is typical of informers who have committed crimes that were
as bad or worse than those they informed on.
</P>
<P>
   ``(They) make sweetheart contracts with ambitious prosecutors
(who) must put their man in jail,'' he said. ``In order to do that,
they'll make a pact with anyone for whatever they want to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   Cutler said government agents give the cooperative witness a
lenient sentence, then ``relocate him in some unsuspecting
community and absolve him of what he did wrong. . . . They are true
to no one but themselves. Greed is their idol. But then, when
they're called before the man, they say, `Who, me?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department could change the policy, he said, but
prosecutors don't want to.
</P>
<P>
   Cutler said he plans to appeal Gotti's conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Hochheiser, a Brooklyn lawyer, said he expects his
client to beat the government on charges of jury tampering in
Gotti's 1987 trial, because the prosecution's chief witness is
Gravano.
</P>
<P>
   Hochheiser said he doesn't believe the authorities allowed
Gravano to commit crimes in Arizona. Rather, he expects to use
Gravano's deception of the FBI as proof that Gravano has no
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Muller, an executive assistant U.S. attorney in New York,
would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   A ROGUES GALLERY &QL; 
Michael Black, a Phoenix lawyer, said he believes it is not
uncommon for law-enforcement officers to look the other way when an
important snitch violates the law.
</P>
<P>
   The result: A hidden crime wave ignored or allowed by
authorities. Some examples, here and nationwide, are legend.
</P>
<P>
   Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega sold narcotics information to
U.S. officials even as he protected major cocaine cartels.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, informer Michael Sanders helped convict Timothy Ring in
the robbery-murder of a Phoenix armored-car driver. Ring was an FBI
informer.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, Sanders was arrested with others who, posing
as bounty hunters, killed two Phoenix area residents.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, ``Hurricane'' Maria Polkowski arranged at least 50
drug buys and was paid $560,000 by the DEA. The fact that she
routinely perjured herself came out when a corrupt agent cut a plea
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Long, a Phoenix pilot, was on the DEA's payroll for
eight years before anyone learned that he had laundered $75 million
in Colombian drug money.
</P>
<P>
   Law-enforcement agents admit that the use of paid snitches and
``flipped'' criminals can be treacherous but insist that the
practice is a necessary evil.
</P>
<P>
   Most agencies have strict policies that prohibit fraternization
with snitches and prohibit any crimes except those performed to
further an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, rules quickly become gray. Informers are capable
liars and actors. Many are bright and charismatic. They work with
law officers who rely on them to bring down criminals.
</P>
<P>
   PROTECTED BY THE FEDS One of the most glaring examples involves
James ``Whitey'' Bulger and Stephen ``The Rifle'' Flemmi, longtime
Boston Irish mob members indicted in 1995 on charges ranging from
racketeering to extortion.
</P>
<P>
   They worked for years as top informers until their handler, FBI
agent John J. Connolly Jr., retired in 1990. Connolly was indicted
in December for what prosecutors say was granting criminal carte
blanche to Bulger and Flemmi.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, U.S. District Judge Mark Wolfe's ruling condemned the
FBI's overall informer policies and practices in the bureau's
Boston office.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf traced the problem to then-Attorney General Robert
Kennedy's fixation with infiltrating La Cosa Nostra in the
mid-1960s, when Flemmi was recruited as an informer. For the next
25 years, he and Bulger ran their rackets while the FBI turned a
blind eye to it. &QL;

community and absolve him of what he did wrong. . . . They are true
to no one but themselves. Greed is their idol. But then, when
they're called before the man, they say, `Who, me?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department could change the policy, he said, but
prosecutors don't want to.
</P>
<P>
   Cutler said he plans to appeal Gotti's conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Hochheiser, a Brooklyn lawyer, said he expects his
client to beat the government on charges of jury tampering in
Gotti's 1987 trial, because the prosecution's chief witness is
Gravano.
</P>
<P>
   Hochheiser said he doesn't believe the authorities allowed
Gravano to commit crimes in Arizona. Rather, he expects to use
Gravano's deception of the FBI as proof that Gravano has no
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Muller, an executive assistant U.S. attorney in New York,
would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   A ROGUES GALLERY &QL; 
Michael Black, a Phoenix lawyer, said he believes it is not
uncommon for law-enforcement officers to look the other way when an
important snitch violates the law.
</P>
<P>
   The result: A hidden crime wave ignored or allowed by
authorities. Some examples, here and nationwide, are legend.
</P>
<P>
   Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega sold narcotics information to
U.S. officials even as he protected major cocaine cartels.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, informer Michael Sanders helped convict Timothy Ring in
the robbery-murder of a Phoenix armored-car driver. Ring was an FBI
informer.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, Sanders was arrested with others who, posing
as bounty hunters, killed two Phoenix area residents.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, ``Hurricane'' Maria Polkowski arranged at least 50
drug buys and was paid $560,000 by the DEA. The fact that she
routinely perjured herself came out when a corrupt agent cut a plea
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Long, a Phoenix pilot, was on the DEA's payroll for
eight years before anyone learned that he had laundered $75 million
in Colombian drug money.
</P>
<P>
   Law-enforcement agents admit that the use of paid snitches and
``flipped'' criminals can be treacherous but insist that the
practice is a necessary evil.
</P>
<P>
   Most agencies have strict policies that prohibit fraternization
with snitches and prohibit any crimes except those performed to
further an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, rules quickly become gray. Informers are capable
liars and actors. Many are bright and charismatic. They work with
law officers who rely on them to bring down criminals.
</P>
<P>
   PROTECTED BY THE FEDS One of the most glaring examples involves
James ``Whitey'' Bulger and Stephen ``The Rifle'' Flemmi, longtime
Boston Irish mob members indicted in 1995 on charges ranging from
racketeering to extortion.
</P>
<P>
   They worked for years as top informers until their handler, FBI
agent John J. Connolly Jr., retired in 1990. Connolly was indicted
in December for what prosecutors say was granting criminal carte
blanche to Bulger and Flemmi.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, U.S. District Judge Mark Wolfe's ruling condemned the
FBI's overall informer policies and practices in the bureau's
Boston office.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf traced the problem to then-Attorney General Robert
Kennedy's fixation with infiltrating La Cosa Nostra in the
mid-1960s, when Flemmi was recruited as an informer. For the next
25 years, he and Bulger ran their rackets while the FBI turned a
blind eye to it. &QL;

 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Phoenix) - Salvatore Gravano never said he was a changed man.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the nation's most infamous mob turncoat had moved to
Arizona and started a construction business. Yes, he got along with
the neighbors, who sometimes stopped by with a cup of coffee from
Starbucks.
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter found him living in Tempe, the 54-year-old, who
once admitted to 19 murders, even grinned as he gave an interview.
He soft-pedaled the chance that his old mob buddies would track him
down and knock him off.
</P>
<P>
   But even in repose, Gravano was still Sammy ``the Bull,'' as he
said in an exclusive Arizona Republic interview in July: ``I'm
Sammy. Sammy to the core.''
</P>
<P>
   With Gravano in jail again, accused of running an Arizona
syndicate that reportedly employed White supremacist gang members
to sell drugs, those comments seem eerily prescient.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have my values changed?'' Gravano said during the interview.
``No. You can't change what you are inside. A leopard doesn't
change his spots.''
</P>
<P>
   Sammy's spots were indelibly imprinted growing up on the tough
streets of Bensonhurst in Brooklyn. It was there that he earned his
nickname when neighborhood wiseguys admired his grit in a fight
with two older boys over a stolen bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you see this Sammy?'' one of the men remarked, according
to Gravano's biography, Underboss, written by Peter Maas. ``He's
like a little bull.''
</P>
<P>
   Sammy the Bull was born.
</P>
<P>
   An undiagnosed dyslexic, Gravano had trouble in school, was
often held back, and fell in with a bad crowd. He ran with a
notorious Brooklyn youth gang, the Rampers, and tells of a fellow
gang member being shot through the midsection as the pair fled in a
stolen car.
</P>
<P>
   The man survived, and Sammy graduated from tough kid to mobster.
For nearly 30 years, Gravano rose through the Mafia ranks,
committing burglaries, robberies and hijackings. He ran gambling
operations, fixed construction contracts and engaged in
loan-sharking. When all else failed, he pulled a gun.
</P>
<P>
   THE FIRST MURDER
</P>
<P>
   In Underboss, Gravano recalled his first killing:
</P>
<P>
   ``As the Beatles song played, I became a killer. Joe Colucci was
going to die. . . . I pointed the gun at the back of his head.
Everything went in slow motion. I could almost feel the bullet
leaving the gun and entering his skull. It was strange. I didn't
hear the first shot. I didn't seem to see any blood. . . . I shot a
second time in the same spot. This time, everything was different.
I saw the flash. I smelt the gunpowder. The noise was deafening. I
saw his head jerk back, his body convulse and slip sideways.''
</P>
<P>
   Gravano earned promotion after promotion, eventually serving as
underboss to Gambino crime family kingpin John J. Gotti.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, mob bosses were protected by the code of
silence, omerta. Old-style mobsters would do prison time before
giving up their leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But with the new mob came new rules. It started with the Valachi
Papers, in which Genovese family soldier Joe Valachi revealed the
American Mafia's family structure and organization.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano had been loyal to Gotti but began to turn after hearing
his boss trash him on FBI wiretaps. After a secret meeting with
prosecutors, Gravano would change sides and testify against the
``Teflon Don.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Maas book, Gravano said he would have stuck with Gotti if
the boss had just apologized.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he had done that, I would have never cooperated with the
government, not in a million years. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``And if I lost everything and didn't want to play this game
anymore, I would have taken myself the (expletive) out.''
</P>
<P>
   Gravano was instrumental in convicting Gotti, who was sentenced
to life in prison for murder and racketeering. Gravano went on to
testify in nine trials and is credited with helping convict 39 mob
figures and their pals, perhaps crowning him as the most successful
government witness in the history of American organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   After being released from a federal prison in Arizona in 1995,
Gravano entered the Witness Protection Program and had cosmetic
surgery. Gravano said he soon quit the program because there were
too many restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't have contact with your family or anybody,'' he
said in the interview.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't exactly keep a low profile. He went on TV to promote
his book. Underboss, Sammy the Bull Gravano's Story of Life in the
Mafia was later made into a TV movie.
</P>
<P>
   The tabloids had fun with Gravano as well, calling him ``Mafia
stool pigeon'' and the ``pint-size gangster,'' referring to his 5
feet, 6 inches height.
</P>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD CALLS In the July interview, Gravano also claimed he
was offered an acting job on The Sopranos, an HBO show dramatizing
the inner workings of the New Jersey mob. The script called for
Gravano to appear as a hit man, then get killed off. He turned it
down.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was as thrilled with Sammy as Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Garofalo is suing Gravano for $50 million in the death of
her father, Edward. Garofalo told the New York Daily News that
Gravano's arrest showed he is a danger to society.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man has fooled the government and continues to fool the
government,'' she said. ``He testified just to make their case
stick, and now the joke is on them.''
</P>
<P>
   In his Arizona Republic interview in July, Gravano acknowledged
that he has other enemies more likely to use a gun than a law book.
He said there was an ``open contract'' on his life but downplayed
the chances of being killed by the mob.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Gravano said he was friendly with FBI agents and
U.S. marshals, who would drop by on vacations to Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Gravano reasoned, the mob's security had been breached
by government agents, who would surely hear of any plan to kill
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mob is smart enough that when they do something, they want
to get away with it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gravano had plastic surgery _ repairs to his boxer's
nose and some minor liposuction _ strangers still recognized him on
the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``They come right over to me,'' Gravano said. ``Some shake my
hand and congratulate me for what I did. Some want an autograph.''
</P>
<P>
   He estimated that more than 300 Phoenix area residents knew his
real identity and said sometimes he even told people his name.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano said he ruined a business deal by revealing his identity
to a prospective partner, adding, ``We thought it was ethical and
right to let them know.''
</P>
<P>
   All the while, Gravano refused to live in fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've grown up in a lifestyle,'' he said. ``There's 30,000 cops
in New York. Every time you go out, you don't know if you're coming
back. . . . I was a boxer. I know what it's like to get hit. I know
what it is to fight. And you lose your fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could go to Montana and live 20 years in a cabin and be
scared to death. Or I can live here, where I'm happy, five years. I
choose to live here.''
</P>
<P>
   He added with a smile, ``When it happens, it happens. If they
start shooting, then I'll be a little scared.''
</P>
<P>
   Since leaving witness protection, Gravano, who'd adopted the
name Jimmy Moran, began operating a pool installation and
construction business in  &UR; Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   When interviewed, he said he arose each morning at 5 and put in
a 12-hour day. He said he had always been a workaholic with ideas
racing through his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the wheeling and dealing, the business, the
whirlwind,'' he said. ``I think up deals every other minute.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was an avid chess player, often went fishing and
sometimes watched baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano also said he enjoyed talking to young people. If federal
authorities are correct, Gravano was talking to them about more
than earned run averages.
</P>
<P>
   He stands accused of financing and operating a ring that
distributed as many as 30,000 tablets per week of the designer drug
Ecstasy. Authorities say that to peddle the drug, Gravano employed
a White supremacist youth gang known alternately as the Devil Dogs,
White Power and Hitler's Youth.
</P>
<P>
   The gang has terrorized minorities in the East Phoenix area in
recent years, and numerous members have been jailed.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Gravano's family, including his wife, Debra, his two
children, Gerard, 24, and Karen, 27, and Karen's live-in boyfriend,
David Seabrook, 32, were among the 36 people arrested Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Until their recent arrests, the Gravanos had been living a quiet
life in the East Phoenix area. Gravano helped remodel his wife's
expensive Tempe house and often chatted with the neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbor Vince Zajdzinski described Gravano's wife as very
sociable. He said Karen Gravano and David Seabrook recently had a
baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had a problem here,'' he said. ``We're talking very
respectable people. The only problems people would have with them
is through business.''
</P>
<P>
   Zajdzinski believed that Gravano would never put his family in
danger, especially after reading Gravano's book, which praised
family ties.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Gravano lived in a modest Tempe one-bedroom
apartment to keep his family away from potential assassins. Though
he told people he was divorced, it was just a cover story to keep
his wife safe.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Gravano's son Gerard is a chip off the old
bull. He sports several tattoos attesting to his familial love,
including one on his back reading ``Blood's Thicker Than Water''
and one on his stomach reading ``Bull.''
</P>
<P>
   During his initial appearance last week in Maricopa County
Superior Court, Gerard Gravano backed up his father when the
prosecutor noted that Gerard was the son of Sammy.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my father! He's a hard-working man,'' the younger
Gravano said.
</P>
<P>
   He called the drug charges against them ``petty'' and said they
were rich enough that they did not need to peddle drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's cooperated 100 percent with everybody,'' the younger
Gravano said. ``He's dealing with the FBI.''
</P>
<P>
   `NATURE OF THE LIAR' Some scoff at the image of Gravano as a
concerned family man.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Cutler, a lawyer for Gotti, told the New York Times, ``We
always said that the nature of the liar and reprobate would never
change. And so it was no shock, to me, that he would do what he
does best, make money by peddling pills to children and put his own
family in harm's way.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was interviewed in July, Gravano spoke indignantly about
the treachery of others.
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate his unique brand of honor, Gravano told a story
about Gotti and his trying to decide what to do about a Mafia
associate who was working with the police.
</P>
<P>
   Gotti wanted to enlist a homosexual who could destroy the
traitor's credibility by accusing him of being gay. Gravano was
horrified.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `No, John, we don't do that. We're family. He's
one of us. We should just go kill him.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gravano views his homicidal history in a cultural context, like
the moral relativism of war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched a guy (on TV) who dropped a bomb on Hiroshima,'' he
said. ``Killed 100,000 people in one day. What's that about?''
</P>
<P>
   Gravano also boasted that each of his murders was coldblooded.
It may seem repugnant to mainstream American values, but he adhered
to the oath.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never killed anybody in a fit of rage,'' Gravano says.
''Everybody I killed was planned. I'm a hit man, not a serial
killer. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these things, I didn't want to do. I felt I did the
right thing in La Cosa Nostra. I was loyal to the life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I was even a good person within the mob. I was
fair.'' &QL;

DIRTY-AIR PENAL TIES TO KICK IN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY JO PITZL  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Phoenix) - For the first time, the Phoenix area's failure to
clean up air pollution is triggering federal penalties on business
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Environmental Pro tection Agency hammer falls Thursday,
and Arizona Public Service Co. will be the first business to feel
the sting of the historic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   APS must remove 2 pounds of particulates from the urban at
mosphere for every pound its expanded west-side power plant is
expected to produce.
</P>
<P>
   Particulates called PM10, be cause their size is 10 microns or
less, are tiny bits of soot and grime that can lodge deep in the
lungs. Primary sources of PM10 are unpaved roads and lots, agri
cultural activities and construc tion.
</P>
<P>
   The utility is prepared to pave streets and road shoulders to
reduce pollution.
</P>
<P>
   It could be a short-lived pen ance: The EPA notified Arizona
officials Friday that it intends to rule by early April whether a
new Phoenix area particulate-fighting plan meets federal clean-air
standards. If it does, the sanctions will be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the onset of sanctions with real bite is not a happy
occasion, even if they do prove to be temporary, said Ed Fox, a
vice president of Pinnacle West Corp., APS' parent company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think having sanctions issued against the Phoenix area
for one month is anything to be proud of,'' said Fox, a former
director of Arizona's Department of Environmental Quality.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona and Maricopa County environmental regulators said that
they hope the EPA, which last year rejected the Phoenix area's
particulate clean-up plan as too weak, will accept the new plan and
that sanctions will end before many businesses are af fected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's really a short-term bump in the road,'' said
Nancy Wrona, director of the air quality division at the Arizona
Depart ment of Environmental Quality.
</P>
<P>
   Still, starting Thursday and until further notice from the EPA,
large businesses that re quire a permit to expand or open new
operations will be subject to the sanctions. This likely will
affect APS and possibly the Salt River Project, both of which plan
to expand power plants in the Phoenix area. However, the SRP's
application likely won't come up for approval by early April.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, a thumbs up on the particulate-fighting plan from
the EPA may only delay the day of reckoning. The Arizona Center for
the Law in the Public Inter est, a non-profit watchdog group,
intends to sue if the EPA ap proves the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Anderson, a lawyer with the center, said the Phoenix
area's plan lacks the most strin gent pollution controls, as re
quired by law.
</P>
<P>
   Among those measures are the adoption of cleaner-burning die sel
fuel, mandatory scrapping of old diesel trucks with high partic
ulate emissions and a halt to such farm practices as tilling and
mulching when winds exceed 25 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a long time to think about this,'' Anderson said of
the Phoenix area's battle with particulate pollution. ``We (in the
Phoenix area) have never, ever been in attainment since the Clean
Air Act amendments of 1990.''
</P>
<P>
   If a lawsuit is filed and the center prevails, the penalties
would be worse. Business sanc tions would resume, and, five months
later, the federal govern ment would be obliged to cut off
Arizona's federal freeway dol lars.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Feuerherd of the Arizona Lung Association said it's the
same old game of ``pay me now or pay me later'' when it comes to
air pollution controls.
</P>
<P>
   Two measures that could help prevent a lawsuit are before the
Arizona Legislature, Feuerherd said, although the bills are all but
dead. One would introduce CARB diesel, a cleaner-burning fuel than
what's currently in use. Another would add biodiesel to the state's
list of alternative fu els, a move favored by many school
districts. They want to use biodiesel in buses to meet the state's
alternative-fuel mandate.
</P>
<P>
   Feuerherd predicts a wave of ``frenetic construction activity''
between now and next year, when he figures the center's case will
be won and tougher sanctions kick in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is an open-and-shut case,'' said Feuer herd, the
Lung Association's pro gram director. ``People have their heads in
the sand, or maybe in the dust storm. They don't under stand the
health effects of what they're doing.'' &QL;

RECEIVERS GET PLENTY OF ATTENTION AT COMBINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK C. GIRARDOT  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS -- When professional football historians look back
on 2000 there's a good chance they'll remember it as the year of
the receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Who would blame them?
</P>
<P>
   After all, the group of wide receivers invited this year's
scouting combine may be the best ever assembled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really can't speak about each individual specifically,''
said Bill Walsh, Vice President and General Manager of the San
Francisco 49ers. ``But, this group is really among the all-time
best. Quarterbacks were in abundance last year, but this year it's
wide receivers.``
</P>
<P>
   In all, 45 receivers are taking part in the four-day scouting
combine, an event that gives NFL teams an opportunity to scout the
top talent before April's college draft. UCLA is represented by
Danny Farmer. USC's Windrell Hayes and R. Jay Soward are also in
attendance.
</P>
<P>
   Of the three, there's a good chance that Soward and Farmer will
be taken in the first round. How well they do on a variety of
physical and psychological tests administered today and Monday will
determine just how early each goes.
</P>
<P>
   Don't count Hayes out of the early rounds either.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is another opportunity to show that I can play with
anybody,'' Hayes said. ``I haven't had the opportunity yet to show
what I can do. I'm going to go out and show that I can do anything
they can do -- if not better.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Soward, who grew up in Rialto, a variety of factors could
affect his fortunes. Saturday he spent several hours in an area
hospital being X-rayed from head to toe.
</P>
<P>
   One NFL scout, who asked not to be identified, said Soward's
performance so far has been less than stellar.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's real flake,'' the scout said. ``That could hurt him
here.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, others Saturday continued to mention Soward in the
same breath as the creme of the crop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think there'd be 4 or 5 guys taken in the first
round,'' Tampa Bay head coach Tony Dungy said. ``Warrick is going
to go high; Burress; Soward; Farmer. I think those are going to be
some of the play makers that come out of here.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Farmer, a Loyola High graduate, said he was pretty
comfortable with the entire process, mainly because he's been
getting a lot of help from his father.
</P>
<P>
   It's probably pretty good help as Farmer's father, who grew up
in La Puente, played professionally for the Chicago Bears and
Detroit Lions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been through it and he helps me out a lot,'' Farmer said.
``It's different though. Back then they didn't have this. He got a
call from a radio station (telling him he'd been drafted).`` As for
the combine: ``He just kind of said to be myself and things will
happen for the best,'' Farmer said.
</P>
<P>
   By the numbers, Farmer, Soward and hayes had relatively similar
1999 seasons. Soward played in 11 games, caught 51 passes for 655
yards and four touchdowns. Hayes played in 10 games, caught 55
passes for 720 yards and four touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer's season was shortened by injury to nine games. He caught
29 passes for 573 and scored 3 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   While it's likely the Cleveland Browns will take Warrick with
the first pick, both he and Cleveland General Manager Dwight Clark
praised the quality of this year's receiver class.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of them man,'' Warrick said. ``I know they are a
great bunch of guys, because if they wasn't, they wouldnt' be
here.''

<P>
   Clark spoke more specifically about the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we decided not to go with (Warrick as) the first one, I
think we could still get a starter,'' Clark said. ``After you watch
these guys on tape and them you talk to them, you fall in love.
Today, I've been falling in love every 15 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanford quarterback Todd Husak, who is attending the combine,
made his way through the lobby of the Crown Plaza Saturday
unmolested by reporters who didn't recognize him. He stopped
briefly to take in the scene and remark on a group of wide
receivers he had just met.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny seeing all these guys like Warrick and Burress,''
Husak said, with a grin. ``From a fan standpoint these are the top
guys here -- seeing all these guys is pretty cool.''

BILL WOULD HELP FINANCE FOOD USED AS MEDICINE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   (Phoenix) - Christian Conner is 3, clutching fistfuls of rubber
snakes and asking for more ce real.
</P>
<P>
   But he can't have more than the quarter-cup he had at break
fast. His mother tries to appease him with, ``Here, have some
juice.''
</P>
<P>
   The toddler has phenylketon uria, a rare genetic metabolic
disorder that forces him to follow a strict low-protein diet or
else be mentally retarded.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, miles from Christian's Chandler home, lawmakers will
debate just who should pay for the costly formula and special foods
that keep the little boy from losing his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, efforts like Arizona's are under way to make
insurance companies cover the cost of the medically necessary foods
such people as Christian need to stay intact.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Susan Gerard, R-north central Phoenix, introduced a bill
this session to force insurance companies to pay half, with a cap
of $4,000 a year. It goes before the full House on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   California and Montana re cently passed similar bills, though
without caps. Advocates are pushing national legislation as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ludicrous that we have to go to the Legislature to make a
medical insurance company pay for a medical treatment,'' says Susan
Cox, a genetics counselor for the University of Arizona-Phoenix
Genetics Program.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the only recognized treatment, and it is considered
the standard of care. Yes, it happens to be food, but if you feed
them a normal diet, they are retarded or dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Insurance companies nation wide have balked at paying for the
formula, saying it is more a food supplement than medicine. In
Arizona, insurance lobbyists have agreed to Gerard's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 115 people in Arizona have metabolic disorders, mostly
phenylketonuria, or PKU.
</P>
<P>
   Sufferers lack the enzyme that breaks down an amino acid called
phenylalanine, or PHE, which is found in all proteins in varying
amounts. In their bodies, PHE builds to toxic levels, attacking the
central nervous system and causing neurological damage.
</P>
<P>
   Protecting their brains de pends on sticking to a diet of
virtually no protein. No meat. No dairy products. Limited amounts
of most everything else.
</P>
<P>
   Because they can eat so little, their only chance at survival is
a formula containing a protein sub stitute, calories, vitamins and
minerals. It costs $18 to $80 a can, depending on the disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Christian's mother weighs and measures the little food her son
can eat, writing it down in a daily log. She pays $5.59 for a loaf
of low-protein bread and $7.75 for a pound of low-protein macaroni.
</P>
<P>
   And, three times a day, Chris tian drinks a foul-smelling for
mula that gives him what he needs to grow.
</P>
<P>
   It will be like this for the rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Jenise Holyoak, 29, of King man, was diagnosed with PKU when she
was 3 weeks old. She goes through $30 of formula a day, a great
expense for a first-grade teacher with a husband still in college.
</P>
<P>
   Gerard's bill awaits House ap proval after weeks of wrangling
with insurance lobbyists. The bill also must be approved by the
Senate, where Sen. Russell Bow ers, R-Mesa, tacked a similar
proposal to a big insurance-reform bill.
</P>
<P>
   Formula for children diag nosed through the state's new born
screening program is provided for free until age 21. After that,
patients pay for it, as well as the food.
</P>
<P>
   Cox estimates the yearly cost for kids under 1 is $2,500, $4,500
for ages 1 to 4, and $9,900 for older kids, teenagers and adults.
</P>
<P>
   The formula and food can be used only under a doctor's super
vision. The formula is what keeps sufferers alive, Conner says; the
foods _ ordered through the mail from a handful of compa nies
worldwide _ helps fill their stomachs and gives them some semblance
of a normal life.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Burgess of Bullhead City has a paternal uncle with PKU who
is mentally retarded and living in a group home, the result of
poorly treated PKU. So, when Burgess' daughter, Lauren, 5, was
diagnosed with PKU, he and his wife vowed to keep her on a strict
diet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not counting the formula, she would probably eat less in a
whole day than you or I eat in a whole meal,'' Burgess says.
</P>
<P>
   But Lauren is a happy child, playing with her sisters, Ashley,
8, and Sydney, 2. She is in kindergarten but reads at a sec
ond-grade level.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has to have the formula to sustain a quality life,''
Burgess says. ``Just like the guy who has to have insulin, she
needs it.''
</P>
<P>
   PKU has more than 220 muta tions, some more severe than others.
Doctors began screening newborns for it in the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Diagnosed early and treated right, the first generation of PKU
sufferers are living normal lives as adults, going to college, work
ing and raising families.
</P>
<P>
   At first, doctors put PKU pa tients on the strict diet until age
8, figuring their brains were developed enough by then not to be
damaged. Later studies showed those patients continued to lose
brain cells.
</P>
<P>
   Holyoak's mother once saw a young girl with PKU, huddled in a
wheelchair and drooling. She decided not to take her daughter off
the diet despite doctors' as sertions that it would be OK.
</P>
<P>
   At a Tucson clinic, Cox works with two teenagers from Mexico
with PKU who were not diag nosed until they were 4 and 6. They are
severely mentally re tarded, unable to speak and prone to seizures.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Christian is fine, full of giggles and climbing on a
bright play set.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he weren't on diet, it would be a different story,'' his
mother says.
</P>
<P>
   Christian can have 288 milli grams of PHE a day. A half-cup of
Honey Nut Cheerios has 106 milligrams of PHE, and one ear of corn
on the cob has 213.
</P>
<P>
   His mother makes 2-inch patties of mushrooms and baking mix that
contain 50 milligrams of PHE. She orders a low-protein 8-inch pizza
for $6.39.
</P>
<P>
   None of it tastes very good.
</P>
<P>
   As Christian grows, his allot ment of PHE will not. As a man, he
will eat the same amount of food he ate as a toddler.
</P>
<P>
   Christian sits on the couch, knees to his chest and drinking a
bottle of the formula. Adult suf ferers often drink the formula
through straws from closed con tainers because of the smell.
</P>
<P>
   Christian doesn't complain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all he's ever known,'' Conner says.
</P>
<P>
   Christian's brother, Dylan, 1, does not have the disorder. Chris
tian notes that Dylan gets scram bled eggs for breakfast while he
eats low-protein porridge.
</P>
<P>
   One night at dinner, Christian's father put a platter of chicken
on the table. The little boy quickly announced, ``I can't have
that.'' &QL;

INVESTORS TELL STORIES OF GREED, FEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVID GREENBERG 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Back in April 1997, while fixing machinery at a
Chatsworth business, Jerry Womack grumbled about why he was still
working as a repairman since he made $350,000 in the stock market
just the week before.
</P>
<P>
   The shop owner said he asked Womack how he, too, could get a
piece of the Wall Street pie. And so began the career of Jerry
Womack, investment guru - and authorities say conman, who bilked
$16 million from investors mainly in the San Fernando Valley and
Ventura County areas.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next two years, the 50-year-old resident of Las Vegas
attracted nearly 400 more investors, enticed through word of mouth
and a series of rousing seminars at Simi Valley's Clarion Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he presided over the meetings, he looked down from the
podium as though Moses himself was delivering a sermon to his
disciples,'' said a West Hills woman, who invested $26,000 she had
saved for her retirement from her aerospace job.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like, Oh, golly gee! I can't wait to give him more
money to make me wealthier. He was believable. He had people
salivating.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you could liken this to a religious revival meeting, he
would have had them running down the aisle, crying and kissing his
feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Womack was running a pyramid scheme rather than
a legitimate investment enterprise. The West Hills woman lost
$16,110 of her nest egg - and most of the other investors lost
money, too.
</P>
<P>
   Now Womack is scheduled to stand trial March 14 on nine federal
counts of wire fraud - charges he denies.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Patrick Maginnis, who previously has called Womack a
``very charming individual'' with no criminal record, did not
return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   With a booming stock market and Womack's charming pitch, it was
easy to get caught up, said several investors who spoke on the
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   They gave Womack small amounts of money at first, then more as
he mailed them professional-looking balance sheets that boasted of
profits. Those investors said they shared news of their good
fortune with friends and relatives, who became investors
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   A Moorpark business manager said he cashed out his 401(k) plan
and refinanced his house so he could invest $150,000 - an amount
Womack claimed grew to $580,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, I'm a pretty cautious guy,'' said the man, who wound
up losing $35,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The temptation) was based on a cadre of people that you've
met that were in the fund, based on their professionalism and their
vocation. The guy was always visible. He had meetings and there
were hundreds of people there. The facade is there, but that
doesn't mean the substance is there.''
</P>
<P>
   During the meetings, investors said, Womack used his charm to
successfully pitch the Womack Dow Principal - his strategy for
recognizing stock trends so brokers could buy low and sell high
within a day's time, reaping fast profits.
</P>
<P>
   Womack bragged that he had two to four traders on the floor of
the New York Stock Exchange, investing in the Dow Jones industrial
average's 30 stocks solely for him, court documents show.
</P>
<P>
   And for a minimum $2,200 investment, residents could join Iris
Limited Partnership. Under the agreement, Womack would get 30
percent of the net profits, plus an additional 5 percent for
administrative expenses, records show.
</P>
<P>
   A Pasadena real estate broker said he gave $56,000 to Womack and
was told that his investment had grown to $285,000. In fact, the
59-year-old lost $48,000 - and his 84-year-old mother lost $50,000
of the money she invested with Womack.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very hard-earned money,'' said the broker. ``She saved
everything she could. It was part of her retirement money. I feel
worse about her losing her money than I do about mine.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is at the end of her earning potential power. It's money
that she really needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Court documents said that instead of investing the money as he
agreed to do, Womack spent it lavishly on himself and his family.
</P>
<P>
   He had a posh home in Las Vegas - complete with a fountain and a
gazebo - along with luxury cars, a boat and expensive jewelry, the
documents said. He bought his second wife a Florida home and gave
her $250,000 cash and five parcels of land in South Carolina as
part of their divorce settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Third wife Linda Lee got a Mercedes-Benz, jewelry and other
gifts before their brief 1999 marriage, records show. Womack also
gave $214,600 to her ex-husband, Rick Lee, to bolster his failing
online pornography business.
</P>
<P>
   Court records also said that Womack did pay $2 million to $3
million to investors from February 1999 through April 1999. And
since his arrest on Oct. 15, authorities have recovered about $1
million in cash and assets.
</P>
<P>
   Even before his arrest, investors were getting concerned about
their money. Meetings that previously had resembled pep rallies
turned into shouting matches, with investors demanding answers, as
well as their money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Womack began to offer a multitude of excuses over a period of
time as to why he would not be able to repay the investors their
monies due. Womack never claimed to have lost any money, always
claiming that the profit and original investment was located in an
account in New York,'' the FBI said in court documents. ``Womack
always furnished various explanations as to why he could not access
the funds.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, documents said, only a couple dozen of the investors
- most of whom signed up early on - received more money than they
put in.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never promised a specific return. He just told you what he
had done in the past and he would emphasize that he had doubled his
money every six months,'' said a Ventura County businessman who
invested more than $100,000 with Womack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greed and fear played a role in every single person who is
(now) honest with himself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fear that if we crossed Jerry, he wouldn't give us our
money. And it was greed - that we wanted to get as much as we can
get,'' he said. ``In retrospect, I feel it was pretty stupid to
allow myself to get carried away like that.''

DE LA HOYA BRINGS COLEY TO HIS KNEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Derrell Coley said he was going to knock out Oscar De
La Hoya Saturday &UR;  &LR; night. The way he fought, he would have had
trouble with Oscar de la Renta.
</P>
<P>
   For three rounds, De La Hoya did what he wanted with Coley at
Madison Square Garden before running into a combination early in
the fourth that ended with a stunning right that momentarily seemed
to put the four-time world champion in trouble. But when the
journeyman from Washington who had promised a knockout tried to
deliver it, he ran into a left hook that wobbled him badly and
changed his approach.
</P>
<P>
   When he came out for the fifth round, Coley was no longer trying
to land the big hook that he once hoped could change his life.
Instead, he was trying to avoid the one that could change his
profile _ but the moth can avoid the flame for only so long. In
Coley's case, it took barely six more minutes before he was burned
out, ending slumped on one knee as referee Wayne Kelly counted him
out at exactly three minutes of the seventh round.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the sixth, Coley already had run into a string of
left hooks, the last two causing him to do a stutter step to his
corner that Deion Sanders would have admired. He was not yet out,
but there was no more fight in him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt very strong,'' De La Hoya said. ``My jab was really
snapping out there. I was very patient early because he was boxing
a lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said I'd fight four times this year and get four knockouts.
No disrespect to Derrell Coley. He was just the first up. This is
just the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Halfway through one more round, it was the end for Coley not
long after he blew his nose and a red plume of blood flew out.
Seconds later, Coley's right eye began to close and it was stalking
time, not talking time, for De La Hoya (32-1, 26 KO) and he well
understood it.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the end of that seventh round, De La Hoya drove home
a left to Coley's liver and the D.C. welterweight sank to one knee.
As Kelly counted, Coley made no effort to get up, not because he
was unwilling, but because he was unwell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have got up, but I didn't have it in me,'' said Coley
(34-2-2). ``I wasn't strong enough. I was too weak.''
</P>
<P>
   Barely able to breathe and nearly blind in one eye, Coley stayed
where it was safe for 10 more seconds and then his long night with
De La Hoya was over.
</P>
<P>
   Across the ring, De La Hoya was promising this was only the
beginning. If he ends up fighting a rematch with Felix Trinidad,
the only fighter to beat him, it now will come June 10 in Las Vegas
at 150 pounds, give or take a pound. If not, he will take on
undefeated former lightweight champion Shane Mosley June 17 in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Derrell Coley will be happy not to be there.

GATTI FLATTENS GAMACHE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was supposed to be a boxing match. It turned out
to be a mismatch.
</P>
<P>
   Even before former two-time world champion Joey Gamache got into
the ring Saturday &UR;  &LR; night at Madison Square Garden to face Arturo
Gatti, the issue had been decided: At the weigh-in Friday, only
three-quarters of a pound separated them, 36 hours later, 14 pounds
did. Once it became clear the junior welterweight from Lewiston was
fighting a 160-pound middleweight, what followed was sadly, and
nearly tragically, predictable.
</P>
<P>
   Barely two minutes into the bout, Gamache went down for the
first time, falling flat on his back and out of the ropes onto the
ring apron by a straight right hand from the 27-year-old former IBF
junior lightweight champion.
</P>
<P>
   Gamache's greatest ally had always been his legs, but they
wobbled beneath him when he got up. They were all that could have
saved him Saturday &UR;  &LR; night, and in less than two minutes they were
gone. Soon after, so was Gamache.
</P>
<P>
   Gamely, he got up and tried to attack, but Gatti was too strong
and Gamache too impaired to avoid what was coming. Gamache landed
three sizzling left hooks despite being all but out on his feet,
but although they snapped Gatti's head back, they did not carry
enough ammo to stop him. When he got close enough to land a left to
the body and a stinging left to the head, Gamache tumbled onto his
back a second time before the first round was over.
</P>
<P>
   Although he got up again, Gamache was like a man lost in a Maine
blizzard. He was blind and lost, wandering into deeper woods with
every step.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew after the first round I was too strong for him,'' said
Gatti (31-4, 26 KO), a fact that was to be expected when one guy
enters the ring weighing 160 pounds and the other 146.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow he survived that round, survived even a shot from Gatti
after the bell, but 41 seconds into the second round, Gamache's
boing career came to a terrifying end when Gatti nailed him with a
stunning three-punch combination: a right uppercut on the chin, a
big left hook to the face, and a final right hand to the jaw that
sent Gamache collapsing flat onto his back again.
</P>
<P>
   Before he landed he was out, his body limp and unable to break
its own fall. The back of his head slammed so hard into the canvas
it bounced back up 6 inches or more before falling to earth a
second time. By the time it landed, Gamache was asleep.
</P>
<P>
   Four doctors tried to revive him. Dazed and unseeing, Gamache
finally turned to one and said, ``Sit me up!''
</P>
<P>
   They did and within seconds he laid back down, the lights above
him swimming, his eyes seeing the black lights only a man who has
been concussed ever sees.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he revived himself again and told the physician, ``Get
me up.''
</P>
<P>
   The doctor refused at first, saying he had to take him out of
the ring on a stretcher. Gamache cried the game warrior's last cry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't put me on a stretcher,'' he said, and the four doctors
kneeling next to him agreed to let him try to walk. After he stood
up, long minutes after first lying still as midnight, Gamache took
a few tottering steps, like a baby first learning how to move
across a room alone.
</P>
<P>
   He weaved right and left, something he would have been better
served doing when Gatti was still throwing punches. Slowly, he
seemed to right himself until he finally was allowed to slip
through the ropes upright, avoiding one last indignity in a boxing
career filled with much glory and four nights of pain.
</P>
<P>
   This was the fourth and final loss of Gamache's long career, one
that has brought him 55 wins and two world titles. Saturday night,
though, boxing brought him what it brings everyone who tries it in
the end.
</P>
<P>
   It brought him embarrassment and unconsciousness and the kind of
bad beating a matchmaker should have been arrested for. It brought
him to St. Vincent's Hospital for a CAT scan, too.
</P>
<P>
   Gamache thought he had a chance to win Saturday &UR;  &LR; night. Maybe he
did if the dice hadn't been loaded with 14 pounds of dead weight.
Once they were, the rest was just a matter of time.

   PITTSBURGH _ Their chances of playing beyond April 9 are slim,
and their roster is full of triage extras from ``ER'' and ``Chicago
Hope,'' but the Bruins wrapped up an uplifting weekend here
Saturday &UR;  &LR; night with a 2-2 tie against the Penguins that chipped
them an inch or two closer to the final playoff berth in the
Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   There was Friday night's 3-0 win over the Capitals in
Washington, perhaps Boston's best 60 minutes of the season. Here,
their skating was noticeably slower and their shot total sliced in
half, but it was a respectable tie _ a league-high No. 17 this
season _ that enabled the Bruins to capture 3 of 4 available points
in a span of 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to be much more positive,'' said veteran
defenseman Don Sweeney, who had a key assist on Sergei Samsonov's
first-period goal that provided a 1-0 lead. ``No question we are
playing better. The guys certainly care about what's going on here,
and we're trying to get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Enhancing their lifted spirits was the look of the out-of-town
scoreboard. Camped in 12th place when the night began, the Bruins
looked up late in the third period and saw that the Rangers,
Sabres, and Canadiens all had lost. If they could have beaten the
Penguins, it would have been one giant step toward getting back
into respectable position. The tie was a baby step, but an
important one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three of 4 points, on back-to-back nights,'' said team captain
Ray Bourque. ``It wasn't easy (against the Penguins). But 3 out of
4, with the traveling . . . hey, we battled, and it wasn't our best
game, but we got some help with the teams ahead of us that lost.
Not bad.''
</P>
<P>
   When they pulled into D.C. Thursday night, all of North America
was still abuzz over the two-handed stick clobbering Marty McSorley
had dealt Donald Brashear Monday night in Vancouver. They had lost
that night to the Canucks, and also two nights later to the
Edmonton Oilers. Two more losses, especially if they had been as
dispiriting as the flattenings north of the border, could have
effectively ended their season.
</P>
<P>
   But with better legs and the fine netminding of rookie John
Grahame, who has secured the No. 1 goalie job unless Messrs. Byron
Dafoe and Rob Tallas show up with the jaws of life, they at least
propped themselves up enough to make this week's Fleet matches with
Ottawa, Montreal, and Philadelphia something more than
post-``Disney on Ice'' exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're what now, a point behind Montreal and Buffalo?'' said
head coach Pat Burns. ``This is going to be a critical week for us.
We have to be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday &UR;  &LR; night, for the third straight game, the Bruins managed
to pop in the first goal. Like on Friday night vs. the Capitals, it
was Samsonov who delivered the lead, connecting on a left circle
wrister after Sweeney feathered over a soft relay. It was only the
second time this season that Samsonov has connected for goals in
back-to-back games _ the other time being in mid-December.
</P>
<P>
   The Penguins pulled even, 1-1, when Pat Falloon connected with
13:37 gone in the second. When Tyler Wright banged one home for a
2-1 Pittsburgh lead early in the third, the drop in Boston's
emotions was palpable.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the second period, we backed off,'' said Burns, who
implemented a new game plan on the run in the second half, a change
to a slightly more aggressive forecheck that eventually paid
dividends. ``I was back there, practically on my knees, pleading
with 'em, `Keep pressin', keep pressin'.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Cameron Mann, who had also assisted on Samsonov's goal, had the
point-saving equalizer at 4:15 of the third, potting a short
forehander after Jean-Sebastien Aubin first turned away a Shawn
Bates doorstep backhander.
</P>
<P>
   Grahame finished with 32 saves, seven more than Aubin, and 6-8
were sparkling stops, especially his block of a Hans Jonsson shot
with 35 seconds left in OT. On a 3-point weekend, Grahame was
probably responsible for 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, if he keeps us in it like that, we can battle,'' said
Burns. ``And if not, well, we don't have the firepower. It's that
feeling you get, `C'mon, guys, he'll keep us in there, just go out
there and get one.' ''

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The fear hit me that first night as I lay awake in bed, alone in
the dark. I couldn't get comfortable, and my legs screamed out for
straightening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't do this,'' I thought. ``I can't do this for a whole
week. This is a dumb idea.''
</P>
<P>
   A month earlier, I strutted into the office of Jim Hayes, coach
of the UT-Arlington wheelchair-basketball team, to discuss the idea
of joining the Movin' Mavs. Hayes agreed, only asking that the team
be portrayed as athletes and not victims.
</P>
<P>
   I had casts put on both knees, forcing me to spend 24 hours a
day for a week without use of my legs so I could try to understand
what they endure.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as I wrestled with my anxiety, I had another problem. I had
to go to the bathroom, but my wheelchair wouldn't fit through the
door.
</P>
<P>
   So I developed the butt scoot. It consisted of sitting on the
cold tile floor, looking over my shoulder and using my hands to
pull myself backward along the floor to the toilet.
</P>
<P>
   The next day at practice, Hayes greeted me with a powerful
handshake. His grip is rough, like grabbing a cheese grater, but
then these hands once pushed a wheelchair 205 miles in 25 hours
from Austin to Arlington in a fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes asked me how things were going, and I told him of my
growing prowess at the butt scoot. He laughed unsympathetically,
adding, ``Welcome to our world.''  &LR; subheds:AMAZING GRACE  &LR; body:Two
and a half weeks before the National Collegiate Wheelchair
Basketball Tournament, the Movin' Mavs' scrimmage has turned almost
nasty.
</P>
<P>
   Linh Bowie sends T.K. Dannelley sprawling, and the clatter of
his chair across the floor sounds as if someone dropped a drawer
full of silverware.
</P>
<P>
   Enoch Ablorh, recognizing the mood swing, rolls to the sideline
and snags his elbow pads. Fouls are being called and vehemently
disputed. Enoch, the team's captain, fakes left, spins 180 degrees
and attempts a pass to the low post, only to have it slapped back
in his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't use that same old pass,'' Valdez Bradley yells as
punctuation. ``We all know that one. You'd better try something
new.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, there's a cymbal-like crash, and everyone pauses
until they figure out who it is. Brad Ness, a powerful 6-foot-4
Australian, rolls off the court, short a couple of spokes.
</P>
<P>
   And this is practice.
</P>
<P>
   It's amazing to see how well these guys handle their lightweight
aluminum-framed wheelchairs _ aggressive yet beautiful, filled with
rapid starts and stops, 360-degree turns followed by reverse 360s.
</P>
<P>
   Their upper bodies are sculpture-perfect, muscle crafted through
honest labor. All the scene needed was symphony music and slow
motion to accentuate the graceful movements of their chairs dancing
across the hardwood.
</P>
<P>
   The Movin' Mavs have won five national championships since their
first season in 1989-90, and the competition for starting jobs
among the 12 players is one of the most intense in collegiate
wheelchair sports. Of the 12 college teams, only No. 1 Illinois and
Wisconsin-Whitewater are expected to compete with UTA for the
national championship.
</P>
<P>
   The Movin' Mavs also compete against semipro teams, many
sponsored by NBA teams, including the Mavericks. The National
Wheelchair Basketball Association has 250 to 300 teams in three
men's divisions, and it has a women's division and a junior
division.
</P>
<P>
   During another practice, I notice Valdez Bradley salvaging
pieces from used and battered wheelchairs. He said it's a
necessity. He has never had a custom chair, which would cost $1,200
to $2,400, so he's trying to convert a chair built for a one-legged
player into a two-legged chair to match his 6-foot-1 frame.
</P>
<P>
   He finishes wrapping plastic tape around one of the backrest
posts and asks Campbell Message for a lighter. He uses the lighter
to slightly melt the tape so it won't unravel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got shot when I was 18 and had sciatic nerve damage,'' said
Valdez, 23. ``I got shot in my back a couple times.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of times?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, like four.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Where was this?''
</P>
<P>
   ``New Orleans,'' Valdez said. ``The police report said it was
robbery, but they never took anything. So I'm thinking it was a
case of mistaken identity or something.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an inspirational story,'' Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   Valdez responded with a laugh. ``Yeah,'' he said, ``a story of
how you can get shot and banged up and get a scholarship out of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did they get the bullets out of your back?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say they don't take them out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you set metal detectors off?'' Campbell asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nah,'' Valdez said. ``I thought I would.''  &LR; subheds:LEARNING
TO COPE  &LR; body:One day, I was stuck at a curb facing the street when
22-year-old Eddie McGee happened by.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie had his left leg amputated when he was 11, after cancer
invaded his knee. He is the kind of guy who would give you the axle
pins from his chair, which he did for me when we built my chair.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Eddie helped me figure a way off the curb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pop a wheelie,'' he said, ``then push your way forward till
your back wheels come off.''
</P>
<P>
   I attempted a wheelie but maintained altitude only long enough
for gravity to throw me off the edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like that?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Eddie replied, ``that's called falling off a curb.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked him what he thought of what I was doing, and he quickly
reassured me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone should have to do it, at least for a day,'' he said.
``Then they'd think twice the next time they parked in a
handicapped spot.''
</P>
<P>
   The office where I work is accessible from the parking lot.
There are ramps and a wide seeing-eye door, but what good is access
if your chair doesn't fit through the restroom door? No one should
have to butt-scoot across the company bathroom tile and stretch to
reach a sink with his face a foot away from the urinal.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes said people in wheelchairs have to come to terms with
their situations. During my week in a chair, I came nowhere near
those terms. It broke my heart that I couldn't play with my
9-month-old son, Ashton, as we had a week earlier. I was frequently
frustrated, especially when I got stuck trying to wheel through
grass, and unjustly vented at my fiancee, Stephanie. I was living
real life, in which babies cry and lovers quarrel, and I wasn't
dealing with it well at all. I wondered if I would have the inner
strength to come to terms if my situation were permanent.
</P>
<P>
   Before my final practice, I asked Jim Hayes how he helps his
players cope.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes, 50, has come to terms with a broken neck he suffered
while celebrating his 18th birthday. He tried jumping into Benbrook
Lake from a barge, but his foot slipped and he landed in two feet
of water.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, life expectancy after a serious neck injury was six
years, Hayes said, but he survived through participation in
wheelchair athletics.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a couple innate things just built into this program
that deal with \Rcoming to terms\S,'' he said. ``One, you will
notice from time to time a lot of arguments going on, on the court.
And I have the experience to know that you've got to let that
happen because they're venting. The other thing that's critical
about this, and the program forces this to happen, is it builds a
bridge between `Damn, I wish I could walk' and `OK, what do I do
now?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Schulte, 21, the most valuable player of the 1999 national
tournament, copes by focusing on his basketball skills, which have
earned him a spot on the United States Paralympic Team. He also
played in an exhibition during this year's NBA All-Star weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's got a disability. Some people's are just more, you
know, obvious,'' Paul said. ``I know of a lot more people who have
more mental handicaps than I do physical ones, and I play on a
wheelchair-basketball team.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul said he was fortunate his accident happened when he was
young. A head-on collision at 35 mph left a 10-year-old Paul with
lower vertebrae injuries. His lap belt held him in place but gave
his spine whiplash.
</P>
<P>
   ``My life before that, I remember it, but it's like a dream, and
so I still dream in my dreams that I can walk,'' he said. ``I don't
think you're ever completely over something like this, when you're
such a minority, when you're so different from 90 percent of the
world, you don't ever completely get over it. And some days, things
happen that remind me that I'm disabled.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some people this really brings down their confidence
because they think of what they can't do, what they can't do, what
they can't do. The real trick is to find something that you can do
and work at it and excel, because that's what drives you, you know:
Getting better at things and developing their talents.''
 &LR; subheds:THE FINAL STEP  &LR; body:My talents had improved slightly,
though I wasn't close to competing at this level. I never felt more
fatigued in my 26 years, but I did get even with the family dog for
using me as a scratching post. I ran over his squeaky chew toys.
</P>
<P>
   I was glad when it was my last day in a wheelchair, but I also
felt sadness and guilt about walking away from the team. Hayes
spoke softly about what he now called ``our story'' and how he
hoped the national wheelchair tournament would never have as many
teams as the 64-team NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's the important thing,'' he said. ``Somewhere, every day,
a young kid and his family have to deal with the reality that life
has changed forever. It's our story; it's their story. What do we
do now?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can show you that in that short time frame an individual
doesn't know whether he's going to live or die. And, after a
certain period of time, the individual is going to wish he were
dead because he will compare it to everything he's always been and
all the hopes of daddy for him to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be have been true in the 1930s and '40s, that life
was going to be short and it was going to be pretty miserable. But
that was before wheelchair basketball. We hope that you may scare
some young kid into not jumping off in that lake and breaking his
back. Or reminding some young kid to buckle up or to put the helmet
on before climbing on the motorcycle or to just be a little more
cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the one sport where it would not break my heart to
never have another player for those reasons. But we're going to
have them, it's going to happen, and I thank God everyday that the
university has seen the wisdom of a program like this.''
</P>
<P>
   After practice, with the setting sun peeking through the cracks
in the window paint, Eddie McGee cut loose my casts at center
court. I tried to stand, but my knees buckled twice. Linh Bowie
laughed and told me to take it slow. I brushed the plaster powder
from my leg hairs and shook their hands.
</P>
<P>
   We left, me pushing my wheelchair, this time from behind;
Stephanie, my fiancee, pushing my son, Ashton, in the stroller;
Eddie on his crutches; and Linh in his chair.
</P>
<P>
   I thought of the riddle of the Sphinx and how fortunate we are
when surrounded by good people. The riddle asks: What walks on four
legs, then two and then three? The answer: Man, who crawls as a
baby, then walks and finally walks with a cane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tobias,'' Hayes called out, ``take care of that baby.'' nn

 TWO RANGERS PLAYERS SHARE CHRISTIAN
FAITH (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) By T.R. SULLIVAN
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ R.A. Dickey had a right to be bitter,
resentful and angry at the Rangers, the world and life in general
in the summer of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   An All-America pitcher from Tennessee, 1996 Olympian and
first-round draft pick, Dickey was just a couple hours away from
receiving an $825,000 signing bonus from the Rangers when his dream
world came to a crashing and painful halt. The Rangers received a
medical report showing Dickey had no ulnar collateral ligament in
his right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   For those scoring at home, pitchers normally can't throw without
the ligament. Those who tear it, like Kerry Wood, have to undergo
``Tommy John'' surgery and have to sit out an entire season.
</P>
<P>
   As devastating as the news was, Dickey now says it was ``one of
the greatest blessings I've ever received in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   He says that even though that blessing included the Rangers
withdrawing their $825,000 offer and signing Dickey for $60,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the money I might have lost is not worth what's really
come out of the situation,'' Dickey said. ``I think I'm blessed.
It's miraculous that I'm even able to throw. I don't know many
people who are born without an ulnar collateral ligament who can
throw 90 miles per hour. God's done miraculous things in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickey sincerely believes that and it's an underlying reason why
he and minor-league teammate Jonathan Johnson have founded Honoring
Thy Father, a Christian outreach organization and support group.
Foremost among their goals is to show athletes can compete at the
highest levels of professional sports and still be a witness for
Christ.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not up to us to change people,'' said Johnson, a pitcher
and another former Rangers No. 1 draft pick who has had a difficult
time as a professional. ``That's God's job. We just want to be an
example and hope that through our example we can make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reggie White \Ran All-Pro defensive end\S is the best example
I can think of. He says, `Hey, I'm one of the biggest and baddest
guys on the field and I'm still a Christian.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Said Dickey, ``Look at Kurt Warner, a guy like that who is bold
enough to step up and say, `I'm a Christian.' People see that and
say, these are the kind of heroes we need.''
</P>
<P>
   Most athletes wait until they make millions of dollars before
they start charitable organizations. Johnson and Dickey were
thinking about this as far back as 1994, when they both were on the
U.S. national team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to invest in the future,'' Johnson said. ``It scares
me when I turn on the television and see so much violence in our
elementary and high schools. God has given me this platform as a
baseball player, if I can show people I'm a real man in a real job,
that can give somebody something to look up to.''
</P>
<P>
   They do so in different ways.
</P>
<P>
   Witness. They have taken their message to school, athletic and
church youth groups. They have a Web site, and Dickey has been on
``Hour of Power'', the nationwide television show that has the Rev.
Robert Schuller as host.
</P>
<P>
   Benevolence. Honoring Thy Father is trying to raise $15,000 to
build a church in Mexico in the off-season. Dickey, Johnson and
other athletes plan on doing the actual construction.
</P>
<P>
   Fellowship. Honoring Thy Father consists of about 30 players
from different teams _ St. Louis Cardinals outfielder J.D. Drew and
Boston Red Sox pitcher John Wasdin are among them _ who call on
each other for support and keep each other accountable for their
actions.
</P>
<P>
   But Dickey made one thing clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have tended to see Christian athletes as soft and
non-competitive,'' Dickey said. ``That's not true. J.J. and I are
competitive, we want to get to the big leagues and stay there. The
difference is we're obedient to something greater.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickey, overcoming his missing ligament, has slowly climbed his
way through the organization. To preserve his arm, the Rangers have
switched him to relief. He still throws 91 miles per hour with a
combination ``knuckler-splitter'' that has become his trick pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, the Rangers' top draft pick in 1995, is 35-39 with a
4.48 earned-run average in five minor-league seasons. He has made
two appearances with the Rangers but mostly has been stuck the past
three years at Triple A in Oklahoma City with a combined record of
15-18 and a 5.87 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a constant battle for me, wondering why I'm not up
there,'' Johnson said. ``I wonder why these guys are in the big
leagues and I'm not. I was a No. 1 draft pick; I was drafted ahead
of them. But I work as hard as I can and pitch as best as I can. I
was blessed with talent, and it would be a sin not to use the
talent He's given me.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I know God has a plan for me and I have to make myself
available to him.'' nn

CLIPPERS END LOSING STREAK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Clippers win.
</P>
<P>
   Say it again?
</P>
<P>
   Nah, even though the only team that's been dragging more than
the Clips must be found at the Iditarod, they've tasted victory a
whopping one dozen times now.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday's 78-77 victory over the Atlanta Hawks (22-31)
before 14,375 at Staples Center is a fine excuse for putting
several numbers to bed.
</P>
<P>
   This triumph ends a 13-game losing streak, the last 11 defeats
pinned on interim head coach Jim Todd. It also is the Clippers'
first victory in February and the first since they've slipped past
the New Jersey Nets exactly four weeks ago. It's their third win in
the last 30 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why it doesn't happen every night I don't know,'' Todd said,
``but we'll get it together.''
</P>
<P>
   Derek Anderson had 21 points to lead the Clippers (12-45).
Isaiah Rider, who has led the Atlanta renaissance since the Hawks
decided against trading him, scored 14 of his 16 points in the
second half. Rider, who is to team chemistry as Chapter 7 is to
your next home loan, nailed a 20-footer to bring the Hawks all the
way back from a 14-point, third-quarter hole and tie the score at
77 with 1:07 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Lamar Odom made 1 of 2 free throws to give the Clips their final
78-77 edge with 22.5 seconds remaining. The Hawks gagged on their
closing position, and the streak was history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get up for a team like Sacramento and Seattle,'' Hawks
coach Lenny Wilkens said, ``and we've gotta get up for this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Odom (10 points, 12 rebounds, 7 assists) just had to get up,
period. The Clipper rookie started at point guard, but seemed a
longshot for duty after throwing up at the morning shoot around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something just told me to play,'' said Odom, whose only
apparent illness was a 4-of-16 performance from the field. ``This
has to be the biggest win of the entire season since it's been so
long since the last one.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Clippers, beating the Hawks stirred up a win-lose
situation. Thanks to last summer's sign-and-trade event involving
free-agent Clipper Lorenzen Wright, the Clips have two first-round
picks that belonged to Atlanta. The most attractive of the pair is
a protected pick that's based on the Hawks' record this season. But
if Atlanta's pick is one of the first nine, the Hawks keep it and
the Clips have it next season. Anything 10 or beyond belongs to the
Clippers this year.
</P>
<P>
   By virtue of two consecutive road victories - including a Friday
night upset at Seattle - the Hawks had the 11th-worst record in the
NBA. If draft-lottery Ping-Pong balls obey the odds, the Clippers -
who figure to lose a pair of starters via free agency this summer -
will be in business.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't exactly play with great skill Saturday, making just
37.6 percent of their field-goal attempts. They also were
outrebounded, 52-44, but weren't prepared to quibble over the
scoreboard numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed this to sleep a little better at night,'' Odom said.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: After 13 defeats in a row, the Clippers decided to Tar
Heel themselves. As expected, they signed and suited up point guard
Jeff McInnis, rescuing the ex-North Carolina player from the CBA's
Quad City Thunder. McInnis, 25, left UNC after his junior season in
1996. And it wasn't exactly shocking that the Clips also brought
back forward Pete Chilcutt (Carolina, '91), who did a 10-day tour
of duty with the team earlier this season.

DE LA HOYA STOPS COLEY IN SEVENTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK - The first step on Oscar De La Hoya's road to
redemption might not have been as spectacular as he would've liked.
</P>
<P>
   But it was thorough.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya, steely eyes fixed on Derrell Coley from the opening
bell, gr adually chopped down his reluctant opponent before finally
putting him away with a single - and immensely painful - left hook
to the belly at the end of the seventh round before 13,814 on
Saturday at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya lost only one round on the card of one judge in what
amounted to another mismatch.
</P>
<P>
   Now, De La Hoya (32-1, with 26 knockouts) must wait to see
whether he will have the opportunity to avenge his disappointing
loss to Felix Trinidad last September.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad is scheduled to fight David Reid on Friday in Las
Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   If Trinidad wins, he will face De La Hoya on June 10 in New York
or Las Vegas if the camps can reach terms. If Reid wins, De La Hoya
is expected to face Shane Mosley on June 17 at Staples Center in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the Trinidad fight was the best thing that could've
happened to me,'' said De La Hoya, who reiterated that he believes
he should've been given the decision in the September fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It changed me, the way I fight, the way I train, the way I
look at boxing. That's why I'm training like I have. I haven't been
like this in years.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from a moment in the fourth round when De La Hoya appeard
to be hurt by a right to the head, Coley (34-2-2, 24 KOs) never had
a chance in the scheduled 12-round welterweight bout.
</P>
<P>
   He admitted afterward that he was overwhelmed and he fought like
it: He spent more time fending off the bigger, tougher and much
more talented Angeleno than fighting him.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, it was difficult for De La Hoya to land big
punches and devastate his opponent as he had hoped after losing to
Trinidad by run ning the final three rounds of a fight he had
dominated, a regrettable act that drew harsh criticism from the
public and media.
</P>
<P>
   He hurt Coley in the best round of the fight, the fourth. De La
Hoya survived a barrage of punches - the only meaningful flurry
from Coley - and then wobbled his opponent with a left hook. He was
unable to finis h it at that point but it became clear then that
Coley was doomed.
</P>
<P>
   The process was slow and painful. De La Hoya landed more solid
punches to the head. By the end of the fight, his left hook had
closed Coley's battered right eye.
</P>
<P>
   However, it was consistent, mean-spirited punches to the body
that ultimately brought on Coley's demise. The punch that ended it
landed squarely in the middle of Coley's stomach, which made a
loudly pro De La Hoya crowd wince when it was shown repeatedly on
replays.
</P>
<P>
   Coley, who said later that he had the wind knocked out of him,
dropped to his knees and refused to stand up by referee Wayne
Kelly's count of 10. Put simply: He had had endured enough
punishment from a far superior fighter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's the case,'' Coley said when asked whether he
was reduced to surviving. ``I wasn't as strong as I thought coming
into the fight . I weighed 145 (actually 147, the same as De La
Hoya) before the fight and 150 today. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I was too small, not strong enough. Oscar overpowered me.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, De La Hoya, who was virtually unmarked, gave himself
a 7 1/2 on scale of 1 to 10 for his performance.
</P>
<P>
   However, he fought the kind of fight he says he'll fight for the
remainder of his career: He imposed his imposing will on his
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fighter you saw tonight is who I am,'' he said. ``I'm not
going to change for anybody. I'm not going to box anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I'm going to fight smart. And I have things to work
on, moving more at the waist, using my jab more. But it's no more
Mr. Nice Guy . I'm going to let them adjust to (begin ital)my(end
ital) style instead of me adjusting to theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya could end up as the WBC welterweight champ if
Trinidad vacates the title and the sanctioning body awards him the
belt, although he has said he's not particularly interested in it.
</P>
<P>
   No, his attention is focused on Trinidad and Mosley and his
climb back to the top of the boxing world.
</P>
<P>
   He wouldn't say which of the two he'd rather face but did allow
for the possibility of facing both this year.
</P>
<P>
   However, a knowledgable source said a ``working'' agreement
between De La Hoya and Trinidad has been reached on a two-fight
deal, with the first fight at a catch weight of 151 pounds, about
midway between the welter weight and junior middleweight limits.
</P>
<P>
   The fighters would fight on June 10 and again in September and
make $40 million each.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter to me who I fight,'' De La Hoya said. ``...
All I know is I'm going to be in good shape and (begin
ital)he's(end ital) going to have to adjust to my style.''
</P>
<P>
   In preliminary bouts, Arturo Gatti (31-4, 26 KOs) knocked down
Joey Gamache (55-4, 38 KOs) three times en route to a brutal
knockout 31 seconds into the second round of a scheduled 10-round
junior welterweight bout between former world champions.
</P>
<P>
   Gamache, floored for the third time with a vicious three-punch
combination, lay on the canvas for several minutes before getting
up.
</P>
<P>
   Gatti, who weighed in at 141 on Friday, weighed the middleweight
limit of 160 at fight time. Gamache weighed 141 on Friday but
gained only five pounds by Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   And, in one of the more entertaining fights of the night, Mia
St. John (16-0, nine KOs) of Calabasas defeated Kristin Allan (3-1,
three KOs) of Russellville, Mo., by majority decision over four
competitive rounds to remain undefeated.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a real tough country girl,'' St. John said. ``I
outskilled her.''

USC TAKES A HARD FALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC's odds of making the NCAA Tournament are about
as remote as saying Brian Scalabrine will trip and fall going for
an inbounds pass with seven seconds remaining, and the season
hanging in the balance against Oregon .
</P>
<P>
   Well, considering Scalabrine did stumble on perhaps the most
important p ossession of the year, anything must be possible. But
don't expect the Trojans to be gathered around a TV on Selection
Sunday, after a devastating 80-77 loss to Oregon on Saturday before
4,355 at the Sports Arena.
</P>
<P>
   All along, USC (14-12, 7-7) said it had to win four of its final
five games to be included in the NCAA Tournament field. Now the
Trojans must win their final four games. That's difficult under any
circumstances, but extremely unlikely when one of those games is at
No. 1-ranked Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   USC's situation is so frantic that injured forward Sam Clancy
(broken right foot) said he will try to come back for Thursday's
game at Stanford, one game earlier than planned. More on that
later.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to win four of the last four,'' Scalabrine said.
``Our goal can still be accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   But teammate Brandon Granville was already aware of the
circumstances mi nutes after the loss to the Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to win every game, but Stanford will be tough,''
he said. ``I don't know, we'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though USC plays Stanford on Thursday, it still might not
be enough time to forget how they lost to Oregon. The Trojans
trailed, 78-77, with 9.7 seconds left after a three-point play by
Scalabrine.
</P>
<P>
   Then came a gift. Oregon guard Alex Scales took the inbounds
pass, and immediately passed the ball to point guard Darius Wright
under the USC basket. Wright took his eyes off the ball, however,
and it slipped through his fingers and went out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   That gave the Trojans possession with exactly seven seconds
left. Granville, standing under the basket, threw a pass to
Scalabrine at the top of the 3-point arc.
</P>
<P>
   But Scalabrine tripped and fell to the ground, and Oregon's
Julius Hicks grabbed the loose ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I tripped on. I just fell down,'' Scalabrine
said. ` `More than likely, I was going to pass to David
(Bluthenthal). It was our game to win and we didn't. Things didn't
work out.''
</P>
<P>
   USC coach Henry Bibby was unhappy Granville even threw the pass
to Scalabrine, since he was double-teamed on the play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bluthenthal was open under the basket,'' Bibby said.
``(Scalabrine tripping), that's neither here nor there. Both Oregon
guys went to Brian. We had someone open under the basket.''
</P>
<P>
   That was all news to Granville, who said, ``I don't think
(Bluthenthal) was open. I just know what I saw.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans still had a chance to tie the game after Hicks made
two free throws with 5.2 seconds remaining, but Granville's
3-pointer at the buzzer was short.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave the game away,'' Bibby said.
</P>
<P>
   There were several other miscues that had the Trojans shaking
their heads:
</P>
<P>
   (bullet)With Oregon ahead, 76-74, Trepagnier dribbled the ball
off his foot with 28 seconds left. ``I gave the game away,''
Trepagnier said.
</P>
<P>
   (bullet)With the score, 74-74, and under a minute remaining,
Oregon center Flo Hartenstein knocked away a Granville pass to set
up Wright's 15-footer that gave the Ducks the lead.
</P>
<P>
   (bullet)USC led, 67-61, with 4:55 remaining, but immediately
allowed Hicks to score inside, gave up a 3-pointer to Alex Scales
and allowed a three-point play by Frederick Jones.
</P>
<P>
   It took all of 1:51 for Oregon (19-7, 10-5) to score eight
straight points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we had them there, but once again, our defense broke
down,'' Scalabrine said.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks' victory was even more unexpected because leading
scorer A.D. Smith suffered a slight concussion four minutes into
the game and did not return. Scales more than made up for his
absence, scoring 30 points on 11-for-16 shooting, including four
3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   Scalabrine scored a career-high 29 points, and Bluthenthal added
24, but Granville and Trepagnier were a combined 4 for 18.
</P>
<P>
   As for Clancy, he dressed for the game, even though there was no
intention to play him. Clancy participated in pre-game warm-ups and
worked on some post moves, saying he felt no pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt good,'' he said. ``If we didn't have to win our last
four games, I might wait. It makes it more urgent.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Laguna Beach High's Travis Hanour, a 6-foot-5 shooting
guard, attended the game as part of his official visit to USC this
weekend. . . . Other recruits at the game included 6-8 forward
David Hamilton of Compton, who has left Auburn, and has two years
of eligibility left; Compton Centennial forward Ellis Myles and
Mater Dei center Jamal Sampson and point guard Cedric Bozeman.

BAD ENDING TO KINGS' TRIP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE -- The Kings were only 60 minutes from home when they
took a really wrong turn.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday was the final game of their longest trip in seven years
and all you need to ask about the 6-3 loss to the San Jose Sharks
was, ``Sean O'Donnell kicked the puck into his own net?''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't change anything in the standings. The Kings are still
sixth in the Western Conference and play only seven more road games
all year.
</P>
<P>
   But on a night when Ziggy Palffy was sidelined with neck and
back problems and the Sharks' Owen Nolan seemed to score every time
down the ice, it was a frustrating end to a successful trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just tried to kick it out of the way and it went in,'' said
O'Donnell, the usually solid member of the second defensive unit.
``I went up to (goaltender) Jamie (Storr) afterwards to apologize
and he said Nolan would have scored anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell goal, which was credited to San Jose's Mike Ricci, cam
e with 42 seconds left in the second period and gave the Sharks a
4-2 lead. Originally it was given to Nolan and would have been his
third of the night. Hats rained down from the crowd of 17,483 at
San Jose Arena and no one asked for a refund when Ricci got it
instead.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan's two goals give him five against the Kings in three games
here this season. Needless to say the Kings are winless in those
games .
</P>
<P>
   ``Nolan is like no one else in the league,'' Kings captain Rob
Blake said. ``He is the best combination of speed and power. He
skated past me on his first goal and muscled his way in on the
second. He was on his game and we weren't. We been playing well,
but we made too many mistakes tonight.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings (30-25-7) came in with seven victories in their last
nine games and nine in the last 12. That streak was enough to pass
the Sharks (25-30-8) in the Western Conference playoff race. But
the Kings found themselves in too many penalty killing situations
against the Sharks. They killed off a 5 on 3 early in the second,
but Nolan scored with four seconds left in the second infraction.
</P>
<P>
   And they didn't have Palffy, who was cross-checked across the
back of the neck during the second period Friday. He says he will
play Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough not to be in there tonight,'' said Palffy, who
had 17 points in the Kings previous 12 games. ``We wanted to go out
on a high note. But we're still playing well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings erased a 1-0 San Jose lead in the first minute of the
second period when Jaroslav Modry batted in a blast by Blake.
</P>
<P>
   Modry was playing in place defenseman Garry Galley, who suffered
a strained neck in Friday's victory against the Canucks.
</P>
<P>
   Just three minutes later Jozef Stumpel, who had two goals vs.
Vancouver gave the Kings a 2-1 goal with his 11th of the year. The
streaky Stumpel opened the month with a goal in five consecutive
games then went six straight without.
</P>
<P>
   Stumpel scored after a blast from Marko Tuomainen, who was playi
ng on the first line in place of Palffy.
</P>
<P>
   But the rest of the second period belonged to Nolan. He entered
the game as the league third leading scorer with 70 points and tied
the game at the 6:29 mark. He skated past Blake in the Kings end
and took two shots at Storr. The second went in.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan's second came on the power play, his league-leading 16th
with the man advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks added a fifth goal, by Vincent Damphousse at 5:27 of
the third period on assists from Marco Sturm and Scott Hannan.
</P>
<P>
   Just 25 seconds later, the Kings' Glen Murray beat Sharks'
goaltender Steve Shields for his 22nd goal. It cut the lead to 5-3,
but Ronnie Stern scored an empty netter with five seconds left for
the final marg in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely have raised the bar the past few weeks,'' Blake
said. ``But it's all playoff hockey the rest of the way. There are
20 games left. No more like this.''

WATSON SILENCES HIS CRITICS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Victims of unfair criticism have not been easy to
find at Pauley Pavilion this season. Criticism, yes. Unfair, no.
</P>
<P>
   Earl Watson might be one, though. A UCLA basketball player to
feel sorry for.
</P>
<P>
   Watson, the squarely constructed junior from Kansas City, spent
most of the year as the Bruins' point guard, charged with dribbling
the ball upcourt and passing it to someone in shooting range.
</P>
<P>
   It's a simple job if that's what you're good at. He wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Not that many of the Bruins' critics cared. The team was losing,
and Watson was bound to take the blame, because as a quarterback in
short pants he was completing as many passes to the peanut vendors
as to teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that he was playing out of position. When the manager
puts a natural-born catcher at shortstop, it's the skipper who
should get the heat for all those blown double plays, but it's the
player who winds up hearing the boos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody's taken unfair criticism,'' said teammate
Ryan Bailey, who's entitled to his opinion. ``But especially Earl,
because the point guard's everything.''
</P>
<P>
   That might be about to change.
</P>
<P>
   Watson's role has been adjusted, with new starter Bailey sharing
the point-guard responsibilities and freshman Jason Kapono bringing
the ball up now and then, and the result has been pleasing for
Watson and UCLA. The Earl-bashers have to smile, too.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday afternoon at Pauley, amid the less-than-deafening roar
of a crowd of 9,759, Watson led the Bruins with 19 points,
completing his highest-scoring back-to-back games of the season. No
coincidence, the Bruins' 69-59 victory over Oregon State gave them
their first back-to-back wins of the Pac-10 season.
</P>
<P>
   Watson and the Bruins are feeling better about their chances of
making the NCAA Tournament as a result.
</P>
<P>
   To hear them tell it, Watson and Bailey aren't sure exactly how
the role change came about, though they know it began when Bailey
replaced Billy Knight in the starting lineup for the Bruins'
home-court victory over USC six games back.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Watson has been able to spread his wings, or at
least play on the wings, crash the backboards and curl off screens
for outside shots with new freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great scorer, and when he's playing primarily point
guard he's only looking to pass,'' Bailey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's at peace with his game right now,'' said UCLA assistant
coach Michael Holton, who coaches the guards.
</P>
<P>
   Holton downplays the role change and credits Watson for most of
the improvement, which has seen him put up a season-high 22 points
against USC and against Oregon on Thursday night, and cut his
turnovers by more than 50 percent without substantially reducing
his assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really has accepted that less is more, he's accepted not
needing to make the highlight play, just playing steady,'' Holton
said. ``He's kind of slowed things down. It's been great to see him
respecting the fundamentals and having some success. The way he's
playing is having a positive effect on everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important there be no connotation that he's been demoted
because something wasn't working,'' Holton said. ``He's freer now,
so he can do the things he's always been good at doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson was a point guard for two years at Kansas City's
Washington High, but his education at the position was interrupted
when he came to UCLA, where Baron Davis played the point until last
spring. This season amounted to on-the-job training.
</P>
<P>
   Which hasn't been easy for Watson or those watching him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Criticism motivates me,'' Watson said. ``I hope nobody thinks
they're hurting my feelings when they criticize me.''
</P>
<P>
   There's been plenty of criticism to go around as the Bruins have
stumbled into a position where - even after their best week in a
long time - they must win three of their last four games to have a
shot at the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   But at least Watson should escape the talk shows' wrath after
scoring 41 points against the Oregon schools. As if he deserved it
all along.

REMEMBERING ANOTHER BRUTAL NIGHT IN HOCKEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ My first reaction when I saw the videotape of
Marty McSorley cracking his stick on the head of Donald Brashear
wasn't the same as most viewers.
</P>
<P>
   It was sickening. But I'd seen worse.
</P>
<P>
   Worse than a premeditated stick to the head? Worse than an
obvious attempt to injure an opponent, in a game long concluded?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, worse.
</P>
<P>
   It was March 11, 1979. The Los Angeles Kings were in the early
stages of the Triple Crown era. Marcel Dionne, Dave Taylor and
Charlie Simmer comprised one of the most powerful lines in the
game, and the team was having some incipient success. But there was
one thing the Kings absolutely could not do.
</P>
<P>
   They could not beat the Philadelphia Flyers. Not figuratively,
not literally. The Broad Street Bullies routinely brutalized the
Kings, the yin to their yang, much as a young Mike Tyson once went
through opponents. The Flyers had honed a vicious style of play to
a sharp edge, winning two Stanley Cup titles (1974, 1975) while
also pushing the league's tolerance of violence beyond anyone
imagined possible.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings came into that game having gone 18 games against the
Flyers without a win (0-14-4). But beyond the losses, the Kings had
tired of turning the cheek. They skated into the Philadelphia
Spectrum that day determined to stand up to the Flyers.
</P>
<P>
   And it was the most god-awful spectacle you've ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   Did you happen to see that videotape on the news of a recent
prison riot? That's what the first period was like. Pure carnage.
Fights erupted like brush fires. One would end and another would
start before the officials could get anyone into the penalty box.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings had rented a goon, Randy Holt, earlier in the season
in anticipation of this, and he earned his paycheck by drawing a
NHL record 67 penalty minutes in one period, the biggest chunk of
the 372 minutes of penalties assessed in that one period six
minors, 16 majors and 28 misconducts.
</P>
<P>
   But I don't recall anything Holt did.
</P>
<P>
   No, I recall a young Dave Taylor drawn into several brutal
fights, and Dionne, blood trickling down his face from under his
helmet, throwing fists with Flyer goon Paul Holmgren, and a polite,
passive defenseman named Randy Manery being pummeled by two Flyers
in a corner some 30 feet away from the main event. And 17,077
Spectrum fans cheering wildly.
</P>
<P>
   I recall the MASH-like scene afterward, all of the bloody tape,
jerseys and towels lying on the floor of the Kings locker room as
trainer Pete Demers tried to attend to too many cuts. And I also
remember what Flyers captain Bobby Clarke said afterwards, that
fighting was part of the game.
</P>
<P>
   As resentful as any Kings player or fan might have felt at the
time, Bobby Clarke was absolutely right. He was right then, and he
would be right now.
</P>
<P>
   Hockey's been dealing with the violent side of its image since
long before the Bullies. Before there was Dave ``The Hammer''
Schultz, there was Terrible Ted Lindsey, whose elbows and sticks
always found unpadded body parts. All the '70s Flyers did was
provide a handy target for critics.
</P>
<P>
   The season after that mess, former Kings owner Jerry Buss tried
to legislate fighting out of the game during a meeting of the
league owners before the 1980 All-Star Game. His motives were pure
he truly believed hockey was as exciting as basketball when the
emphasis was on skating and shooting were all. Considering where
Wayne Gretzky took the game, Buss was psychic.
</P>
<P>
   But you can't legislate peace in a violent game unless you put
everyone in a skirt, and that's one reason why the league will
always have to deal with violent episodes. Indeed, the
McSorley-Brashear incident can be traced to anti-fighting edicts.
</P>
<P>
   Each time the league has put its foot down on fighting, it
created other problems. Hockey fights may be ugly and bloody and,
like that night in Philly, occasionally grotesque. But they rarely
do as much damage as a two-handed slash on the outside of a knee or
a jab of the top end of the stick in the ribs.
</P>
<P>
   The hit that put Paul Kariya on ice a few seasons ago was a
perfect example of an opponent looking for a way to take a player
out of a game. Kariya and the Mighty Ducks would have been much
more fortunate if Gary Suter had simply dropped his gloves and
started swinging.
</P>
<P>
   Fights like that night in Philadelphia, or that 1990
Kings-Oilers game that produced 86 penalties, may cause critics to
cluck, but nothing like they have over McSorley's stick.
</P>
<P>
   So in that vein, McSorley is most guilty of poor aim. If he
takes a hack at Brashear's thigh, it's a postscript on just another
regular season game. (And if Bruins coach Pat Burns doesn't send
McSorley on the ice in the last 30 seconds, the whole thing never
happen.)
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it takes on a life of its own as an example, right or
wrong, of why the NHL doesn't appeal to some sports fans and why
the Westminster Kennel Dog Show earns higher Nielsen ratings.
</P>
<P>
   The last time I remember a controversy like this was in 1982,
when Kings coach Don Perry asked noted pugilist Paul Mulvey to
retaliate for a fight. Mulvey said no, and the resulting hubbub
backed the league into a similar corner.
</P>
<P>
   All we'll hear the rest of this season is sanctimonious NHL
officials decry what McSorley did and make sure his career is
finished. But it won't stop stick play any more than a ban on guns
will curtail murder.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, the Kings lost that 1979 game in Philly, 6-3. Their
winless streak against the Flyers would last 8 years and 32 games
(0-27-5), finally being snapped with a win on Feb. 13, 1983.
</P>
<P>
   I can't remember if there was a fight or not.

 &HT;    Hanoi Hilton taught much
 &HT;    By Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sixty-two years ago in Camilla, Ga., just south of
Albany, Orson Swindle started a life's journey that led him to
share a cement pad with presidential candidate John McCain in the
infamous Hanoi Hilton.
</P>
<P>
   Raised by his grandmother, Swindle was a product of small town
Southern values that helped him survive a 6 1/2-year ordeal as a
prisoner of war (nearly a year longer than McCain endured).
</P>
<P>
   Swindle, a Marine pilot, was shot down on his 205th mission in
North Vietnam on Nov. 11, 1966. He was released two weeks before
McCain and was there to greet McCain when he limped off an airplane
at the naval air station in Jacksonville in March 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Swindle can answer the question that many Americans are asking
these days: How would those torturous years, those endless painful
nights, those daily brushes with death, affect McCain as president?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's facing human failure, knowing when you're down that you
will get up and try again and fail again,'' Swindle says. ``You
come to understand about redemption.''
</P>
<P>
   Swindle says McCain approaches his fellow man with stark
honesty. He accepts people's flaws. He sees more than one side of
people.
</P>
<P>
   Swindle still chokes up when he discusses his experience as a
POW, not over the memory of the torture he endured, but over
``submitting,'' as he puts it, to the enemy. He feels incredibly
guilty over his occasional inability to endure. McCain writes
similarly of that guilt feeling in his book, ``Faith of My
Fathers.''
</P>
<P>
   He won't discuss McCain's experience, but Swindle recalls one
form of torture he endured more than once. (McCain alludes in his
book to Swindle's withstanding ``rope torture,'' and calls him one
of his three POW ``brothers.'') After beating and interrogating him
for sleepless days and nights, Swindle's tormentors would use
parachute cord to tie tourniquets above Swindle's elbows until the
blood was cut off and he couldn't move his fingers. Then they'd
line up, three men on each side, pulling his elbows up his backbone
until his shoulders were dislocated. Then they would wrap the cord
around his whole body, tie ropes around his thumbs and lift him off
the ground by his thumbs. When that was done, they'd beat him
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were defining moments,'' Swindle says in a near whisper.
</P>
<P>
   A moment later, Swindle's voice is filled with energy about
McCain's candidacy: ``John will be a president who knows human
limitation like no other _ that gives him an accepting, inclusive
philosophy.''
</P>
<P>
   Swindle served from 1985 to 1989 as assistant secretary of
commerce in the Reagan administration. Before that, he was head of
the Farmers Home Administration in Georgia. Now he's a federal
trade commissioner in Washington. Aside from McCain, he admires
Ronald Reagan more than any contemporary politician. But he does
not admire so-called Christian conservatives. ``They are neither,''
he says by phone from his office.
</P>
<P>
   After the Clinton election, McCain accepted the Democratic
president's invitation to appear with him at the Vietnam Memorial.
GOP leaders and veterans, including Swindle, advised against his
appearing with a ``draft dodger'' president. But McCain thought
that honoring Vietnam veterans was the greater issue. McCain once
gave a eulogy at the funeral of a friend who was an anti-war
activist, Swindle notes, adding, ``Every life has positive
dimensions to John.''
</P>
<P>
   Swindle won't say if he disagrees with McCain on any issues. For
him, principles count for more than positions on the ``15 issues
that glow in the dark'' in any given election year.
</P>
<P>
   The issues will change, Swindle says, but POW lessons about
human failure and triumph never will.

 &HT;    Preventing another Columbine
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DECATUR, Ga. _ If you walk into the middle of Shamrock Middle
School wearing a blindfold, then take it off to study the signs on
the corridor walls, you might think you're in the heart of
scholastic darkness.
</P>
<P>
   The signs warn students to stay in line _ or else. They spell
out rules: ``Three bullying threats: expulsion.'' They warn against
distributing drugs: ``Violators will be imprisoned.'' They list the
``parole proof crimes: murder, rape, aggravated sodomy,'' for 12-
through 14-year-old students to ponder on their way to class.
</P>
<P>
   How many of their parents thought they'd see the words ``rape''
and ``sodomy'' on middle school walls?
</P>
<P>
   Shamrock is not a seedy, dangerous school _ far from it. If you
turn from the signs to walk through the orderly classrooms, filled
with neatly dressed students, or stroll around the surrounding
Decatur neighborhood of pleasant ranch houses, the signs seem even
more striking.
</P>
<P>
   They are one glaring part of the fight to prevent heinous school
crimes like last spring's Columbine massacre in Littleton, Colo.
Just last week, a 12-year-old pulled a loaded .380 handgun on
another student in the crowded cafeteria of a Fulton County middle
school. Many schools have resorted to scare signs or metal
detectors or surveillance cameras.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the way it is today,'' Shamrock Principal Tom Davis
says with regret, by way of explaining the scare-'em-straight signs
on his walls. ``It's nothing like when I was a kid in school.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet these measures, while easy to understand and media-genic,
may not offer the only _ or the best _ hope at preventing violence
at school.
</P>
<P>
   Shamrock and other schools, in addition to employing the
``hardware approach,'' also have launched a new strategy to make
schools both safer and happier in the long run: what might be
called the human approach. This tack relies on less visible, but
perhaps more effective measures, such as developing mentor
programs, broadening anti-bullying policies, bolstering the ranks
of school psychologists and giving ``resource officers'' _ school
police _ the interpersonal skills of guidance counselors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't search every knapsack in every car, wondering if
there might be a shooting in the parking lot before school,'' says
Bill Modzelski of the Safe and Drug-Free Schools Program of the
U.S. Department of Education. ``So we have to depend on prevention
_ getting to the roots of the problem. And that means awareness of
the kids' family structure, drug and alcohol problems, making sure
someone takes responsibility to know if a child is happy or sad.
Schools are so big now, kids pass through and nobody knows they're
there.''
</P>
<P>
   HUMAN VS. HARDWARE
</P>
<P>
   Metal detectors are uncommon in metro Atlanta, but they are
credited with sharply reducing violence in New York City. Warning
signs and surveillance cameras are widely used locally, and while
they may well be helping to limit violence, they also add an
oppressive air to schools.
</P>
<P>
   Some students resent that cameras ``make everyone feel like a
suspect,'' in the words of an Illinois high school girl who sent an
e-mail to a chat room on school violence. And the camera will never
be invented that can peer into a young person's mind. Witness the
shooting at suburban Atlanta's Bear Creek Middle School, in 1994.
On camera, security officers actually saw one boy ambush another,
wounding him in the knee, but it happened so fast there was nothing
that could be done to prevent it.
</P>
<P>
   The locked-down mentality has even reached elementary schools.
Dr. Stephen Pastan, 43, of Atlanta was taking his children to his
old private grade school in suburban Washington when a guard
stopped him at the door, issued him I.D. tags and tried to make him
accept an adult escort to tour the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like visiting IBM _ I was put off,'' Pastan says.
``Maybe I'm naive about the real dangers but I worry about our
children growing up without knowing what it is to feel free.''
</P>
<P>
   In the chatroom run by the Raleigh-based Center for the
Prevention of School Violence
</P>
<P>
   (www.ncsu.edu/cpsv/), Chris Bresky, senior class president of
Clackamas (Ore.) High School, addressed the desire for a more human
approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Metal detectors, cameras and K-9 task forces will not scare
violence away from the students, it will only scare the students;
if the violence is in the students it will get inside the
schools,'' Bresky writes. ``The key is to connect with students,
raise awareness through speakers, plays, candlelight vigils that
there is violence out there and it can happen in their school.''
</P>
<P>
   AN UNDERSTANDING EAR
</P>
<P>
   Programs that stress the human approach are in effect to some
degree throughout the metro Atlanta area. But it's DeKalb County _
which began a forceful anti-bullying policy in 1997, two years
before it became state law _ that's building a national reputation
for innovation. The system's multifaceted security efforts were
mentioned in Time magazine in the coverage of the Columbine
tragedy, and are due to be spotlighted in a documentary on the A&AMP;E
channel in March.
</P>
<P>
   Although the wall signs at Shamrock, a DeKalb County school,
helped curtail a bullying problem a few years ago, Garry McGiboney,
director of student relations for DeKalb schools, says it's the
less obvious, more subtle, human programs that will make the
schools happier and safer in the long haul.
</P>
<P>
   Russel Parris agrees. The Shamrock student's grades _ and
attitude _ have improved since he's received weekly mentoring
visits at school from Fred Reese, an employee of a nearby BellSouth
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I need to get something off my chest, my mentor's
there,'' says the 13-year-old, one of the 10 percent of Shamrock's
1,057 students who are mentored. ``He tells me, `Don't get mad,
don't hit him, even if he was messing with you first.' It's good
advice.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Haygood, 13, adds: ``I can talk from the heart to my
mentor, and I don't come in all mad-crazy wanting to blow up the
school.'' She smiles as she says this. She just means normal modern
frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Principal Davis feels that mentoring helps students vent
anxieties that might otherwise explode. ``That's one of the
underlying reasons we have a safe school,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   DEKALB'S INNOVATIONS
</P>
<P>
   You could see the human approach at work at DeKalb's Soapstone
Center for the Arts the other day. A group of students age 9 to 18
was creating their own anger-management play to tour DeKalb
schools. Just when the actors were about to erupt into staged
fights, they stopped short _ took a deep breath, slipped on dark
glasses and repeated the play's clever, cautionary tag line, ``Get
in the cool zone!''
</P>
<P>
   DeKalb schools have broadened the definition of bullying to
include not just physical intimidation but ``any kind of harassment
that isolates a child,'' says DeKalb schools spokesman Spencer
Ragsdale. ``Teachers are trained to look not only for the obvious
victims of bullying, but to reach out to the kid who isn't picked
for teams, who eats lunch alone. That's where the pain starts.''
</P>
<P>
   Policies on bullying are posted on the county's Web page
(www.dekalb.k12 under ``What's New'') along with findings from a
Norwegian study on bullying that was discovered on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   DeKalb's school district also has been the most aggressive
locally in enforcing the new state anti-bullying law, expelling at
least 12 students since August and sending them for a semester or
two to alternative schools where the student-teacher ratio is
lower, and the number of psychology-based courses, such as
decision-making and anger management, is higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids have access to so much violent entertainment, spend so
much time in a world where conflicts are resolved with a gun,''
says Kevin Dwyer of the National Association of School
Psychologists. ``That's why adolescent bullying, which has always
been with us, escalates so much more dangerously now than it did in
1960 or even 1980.''
</P>
<P>
   A CRUCIAL GAME OF HOOPS
</P>
<P>
   The human approach to preventing violence is not limited to
DeKalb. Across the nation, school cops are making more effort to
connect, to understand students' feelings, says Curt Lavarello,
head of the police officers' Florida-based national association.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Burke, resource officer at Lawrence (Mass.) High School _
where a girl recently slashed another girl's face with a knife _
tells of joining in on an after-school basketball game and getting
to know a boy who was almost frighteningly silent and intense.
After months of gentle encouragement the boy revealed his secret:
He took off his shirt to display a back full of ugly welts.
</P>
<P>
   There was more. The father who whipped him also had sexually
abused him.
</P>
<P>
   Burke, his voice cracking with emotion, says, ``There's
tremendous pressure in these kids today. You need to help them get
it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecting with students who hurt and healing them is more
likely to occur when psychologists are a visible force in the
schools, says Dwyer.
</P>
<P>
   Dwyer, author of a widely respected study on the warning signs
for school violence, says that when there is a ratio of at least
one psychologist per thousand students _ as there are in only six,
mostly northeastern states _ the reductions in violence are
considerable.
</P>
<P>
   The high ratio of psychologists and their active involvement in
the curriculum of Tampa schools, under the banner Project Achieve,
was credited for reducing violent incidents in those schools by 80
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia ranks in the middle of the states, with about one
psychologist per 2,000 students.
</P>
<P>
   It's the victims of bullies _ not the bullies themselves _ who
are most likely to commit the high-profile acts of school violence,
DeKalb's McGiboney has found.
</P>
<P>
   ``The common thread in these incidents is that the child feels
isolated or ostracized,'' he says. ``That feeling may begin at
home. A 13-year-old kid left in his room with a ton of
entertainment equipment, or dropped at the mall to hang out all
afternoon _ that's not independence. That's isolation. Parents need
to talk to their kids and offer support before that anger grows.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, reaching parents _ persuading them that bullying isn't a
necessary rite of passage to toughen a kid's hide _ is almost as
big a challenge as reaching students, McGiboney says. When
addressing parents' groups, he begins by asking how many were
bullied as youngsters, and almost everyone's hand goes up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I ask, `How many still think about that bullying today?'
and nearly every hand stays up,'' McGiboney says. ``I think that
makes my point.''

   COLOMBIA-TALKS (Bogota, Colombia) _ Officially, peace talks
between the Colombian government and the largest rebel group are
stalled, with no date set for them to resume. Yet just the other
day, the government's chief negotiator boasted that ``we have
advanced further this month than in 40 years of conflict.'' That
apparent paradox is the result of an unusual new twist to efforts
to negotiate an end to a civil conflict that has killed 35,000
Colombians in the past decade. By Larry Rohter.

 &HT;    FOR GOVERNORS, INTERNET TAXES STILL JUST A HOPE
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While most governors want to begin taxing goods
purchased through the Internet, they probably will have to wait
until next year for a federal green light, the chairman of the
National Governors' Association said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Because 2000 is an election year, ``nothing will likely pass
this year,'' Utah Gov. Michael O. Leavitt told reporters at the
association's winter meeting here.
</P>
<P>
   But if holiday online purchases skyrocket as expected next
Christmas, political pressure will grow to allow states to collect
taxes on interstate electronic purchases, just as they do on local
store purchases, he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Internet-based companies generally do not collect and remit
sales taxes on purchases made by customers who live in other
states. Sales taxes generate more than $150 billion a year in
revenues, about a third of all state state revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Governors are not only worried about shrinking their tax base,
but also about the risk of encouraging shoppers to abandon Main
Street tax-paying merchants for ``dot.com'' companies.
</P>
<P>
   As governors talk among themselves about how to tax Internet
sales, Leavitt said, they must ask themselves: ``Do we create a
level playing field, or do we create a special privilege for one
avenue of retailing?''
</P>
<P>
   Maryland Gov. Parris Glendening, a Democrat and the group's vice
chairman, estimated that four out of five governors want to collect
online sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue is controversial. For example, Virginia Gov. James
Gilmore, a Republican, opposes online sales taxes, saying the
Internet has created so many jobs that state revenues from income,
corporate and property taxes are more than compensating for any
lost sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes, a Democrat, said he wants to ``proceed
with caution'' to avoid slowing the Internet economy. ``This is a
whole new phenomenon,'' he said, which means political leaders must
study it closely before acting.
</P>
<P>
   Leavitt, who is a Republican, said the tax issue would not be
debated in public forums during the meeting because the governors
want to remain in a low-key mode until after March 21. That's when
the 19 members of the congressionally appointed Advisory Commission
on Electronic Commerce hold their final meeting. The commission is
charged with making legislative recommendations to Congress by
April 21.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Congress imposed a three-year moratorium on new taxes
on Internet transactions. The ban expires in October, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The governors, who convened on Saturday, will meet Monday with
President Clinton and Tuesday with members of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The theme of the four-day gathering is the ``new global
economy,'' with sessions intended to stimulate ideas about such
topics as ensuring broadband access and establishing Internet sites
to provide government information and services to the citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are well aware that the digital, global economy is one
without any boundaries, and therefore challenges the very
foundations on which governments are based,'' Glendening said. ``We
must work toward redefining the way that we offer services
efficiently to citizens and re-examine the way we govern overall in
this new 24-hour, 7-day-a-week economy.''

requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-to,
and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the nonfiction
list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

subdivisions of nonfiction can change from week to week, reflecting
changes in book buying.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; OUT OF THE WOODS: Stories &LR;  By Chris Offutt. Scribner, $11.
These lean tales dwell on romantic obsession, but the love object
isn't a man or woman but the state of Kentucky, whose haunted
landscape captivates the wary, mostly poor characters. The result
is ``a magical book,'' Leon Rooke wrote in The New York Times Book
Review in 1999. ``Offutt's obvious kin among contemporary American
writers are Richard Ford and Tobias Wolff.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; COLERIDGE: Darker Reflections, 1804-1834 &LR;  By Richard Holmes.
Pantheon, $18. The concluding volume of the author's two-part life
captures the ``brilliant, animated, endlessly provoking'' Coleridge
as he slips in and out of opium addiction and melancholy while
riveting audiences as a world-class talker and lecturer. This
account of the Romantic poet's final three decades, chosen by the
editors of The New York Times Book Review as one of the best books
of 1999, uses his own remorseful journals to flesh out a portrait
of a tormented, unstable artist whose later works included
``Biographia Literaria.'' The reviewer Penelope Fitzgerald said
``the extraordinary quality of this biography'' is ``felt on every
page.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LITTLE NOVELS OF SICILY: Stories &LR;  By Giovanni Verga.
Steerforth, $12. These earthy 19th-century tales, translated by
D.H. Lawrence, explore the strained relationship between helplessly
ignorant peasants and the exploitive landowners whose vineyards and
pastures they work. The stories ``have that sense of the wholeness
of life ... and the magnificent and thrilling vitality of major
literature,'' The New York Times Book Review said in 1925.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FOR THE TIME BEING &LR;  By Annie Dillard. Vintage, $12. The author
explores the age-old question of how an all-merciful, all-powerful
God can allow evil to exist in the world. Last year the reviewer
Wendy Lesser found this to be a troubling, perhaps doomed, inquiry
that founders ``nobly, courageously and with the best of
intentions.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LIFE BEFORE DEATH &LR;  By Abby Frucht. Scribner, $12. In this
lighthearted novel about _ of all things _ death from cancer, the
relentlessly cheery narrator, a 40-year-old single woman, splits
her remaining time between the dreary present and a wished-for
future. In 1997, Molly Giles said the author's ``fluid, sensual
style ... perfectly captures her heroine's longings.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CAIRO: The City Victorious &LR;  By Max Rodenbeck. Vintage
Departures, $14. Part travelogue, part history, this affectionate
account explores the physical and human topography of an ancient
city that has reinvented itself many times. The book conveys the
city's ``unique charm'' and ``should greatly enhance any vacation
or business trip to Cairo,'' Edward Mortimer wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THURGOOD MARSHALL: American Revolutionary &LR;  By Juan Williams.
Times Books/Random House, $16. The first black Supreme Court
justice is portrayed as a dedicated lawyer (he won Brown vs. Board
of Education in 1954) and a lifelong champion of civil rights who
became embittered in his later years by the court's swing to the
right. ``The book is a strong piece of journalism crammed with
fascinating detail,'' David K. Shipler said in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In  &UR; THE WORLD OF BENJAMIN CARDOZO: Personal Values and the
Judicial Process &LR; , by Richard Polenberg (Harvard University,
$19.95), another eminent jurist is depicted as a hopeless moralist
whose adherence to higher ideals guided his decisions, first on the
New York state Court of Appeals and then on the Supreme Court.
Cardozo emerges as ``witty, sweet tempered, gentle ... and as
self-doubting as a judicial saint can be,'' Jeffrey Rosen wrote in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE LAST LOVELY CITY: Stories &LR;  By Alice Adams. Washington
Square/Pocket $12.95. These tales are populated by lonely
middle-aged women searching for love and, for the most part, coming
up empty. Last year the reviewer Susan Bolotin said the stories
explore ``what happens to people who have no experience being alone
but no success being together.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE SAFEGUARD OF THE SEA: A Naval History of Britain, 660-1649 &LR; 
By N.A.M. Rodger. Norton, $17.95. Drawing heavily from the archives
of the Royal Navy, a historian chronicles Britain's growing mastery
of the seas, which was essential to the nation's survival, and
provides copious detail on strategy, ship design and the officers
and men who served the crown. ``The result is a masterpiece,''
Geoffrey Parker wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE SALESMAN &LR;  By Joseph O'Connor. Picador USA, $14. Billy
Sweeney is a guilt-ridden ex-teacher who takes revenge on the
ringleader of a gang who raped his daughter, only to develop a
bizarre emotional bond with the sociopath. Last year James Saynor
called this a ``brutal yet contrite novel.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GOOD KING HARRY &LR;  By Denise Giardina. Fawcett/Ballantine,
$12.95. This novel's narrator is King Henry V of England, who
chronicles his nine-year reign and his youthful devotion to a
peasant girl named Merryn. ``The unfolding of this unlikely romance
... is as satisfying as the best of BBC's Masterpiece Theater
series,'' Barbara Tritel said in 1984.

</P>
<P>
   HARLEM-MUSEUM (New York) _ The Studio Museum in Harlem has long
been a respected if taken-for-granted presence in the New York art

</P>
<P>
   TIPPING-BOOK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Malcolm Gladwell proposes a
fascinating and possibly useful theory in ``The Tipping Point: How
Little Things Can Make a Big Difference'': namely that ideas,
attitudes and behaviors tend to spread contagiously in the same way
as some infectious diseases. By Christopher Lehmann-Haupt.
</P>
<P>
   TV-BROWN-REVIEW (Undated) _ To the North's abolitionists John

   HEALTHCARE-ONLINE (Undated) _ Healtheon/WebMD has riveted
investors as its stock price rode a roller coaster while the
company announced a dizzying array of mergers and alliances to link
patients, doctors and insurers online with just about every player
in the vast industry. The plan is to promote self-help for patients
while saving untold time and money by eliminating paperwork and
insurance company phone centers. But analysts say the company must
start delivering on its promises, before investors lose confidence.
By Milt Freudenheim.
</P>
<P>
   MICROSOFT-RESEARCH (Redmond, Wash.) _ Many of the world's
computer laboratories are cutting budgets and narrowing their focus
to research that promises more immediate product applications and
financial payoffs. But Microsoft Research will grow by as much as
20 percent in the next year, and part of its work deals with
technologies that are not expected to result in products or profits
for many years. By John Markoff. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Y2K-LEAP-COMPUTERS (Undated) _ Because computers have
encountered far fewer year 2000 date failures than anticipated, the
assumption is that computer users also fixed nearly all the
potential leap-year faults as they were spending billions on year
2000 precautions. By Barnaby J. Feder.
</P>
<P>
   DIGITAL-TV (Washington) _ Under threat from the chairman of the
Federal Communications Commission, the cable television and

<TEXT>
<P>
   It is show-me time for Healtheon/WebMD.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet-based company has riveted investors the last year,
as its stock price rode a roller coaster while Healtheon announced
a dizzying array of mergers and alliances. This month alone,
Healtheon has used its stock in $5.7 billion worth of takeover
deals for three companies.
</P>
<P>
   And backers and partners like Microsoft, Rupert Murdoch's News
Corp. and DuPont have lent credibility to Healtheon's ambitious
talk of transforming the nation's unruly, fragmented health system
into a digitally disciplined online universe. The vision is to link
patients, doctors and insurers online with just about every player
in the vast industry, promoting self-help for patients while saving
untold time and money by eliminating paperwork and insurance
company phone centers. But now comes the time when analysts say the
company must start delivering on its promises, before investors
lose confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey T. Arnold, the 30-year-old Atlanta marketing
entrepreneur who started WebMD in October 1998 and became chief
executive of Healtheon/WebMD after the companies agreed to merge
the following May, has heard Wall Street's message _ that it is
time to start demonstrating that Healtheon is more than an
acquisitive holding company.
</P>
<P>
   After more than 80 deals in 18 months, ``we now have the assets
in place to execute,'' Arnold said. ``We will put everything we've
got into making this work.''
</P>
<P>
   But Healtheon/WebMD's potentially volatile stock poses risks for
investors, in the view of Dr. Bruce Hochstadt, a health care
analyst at Thomas Weisel Partners, a merchant bank based in San
Francisco. The stock was above $100 last May, before the announced
merger of Healtheon and WebMD, then traded as low as $30 last
August. But the share price is up 60.8 percent since the beginning
of the year. The shares closed at $60.3125, down $2.4375, Friday in
Nasdaq trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the 900-pound gorilla in Internet health care; there
is not much room for error,'' Hochstadt said. ``Once investors
caught wind that things were moving slower than expected or were a
little stalled, some wouldn't have the tolerance to stick around.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Healtheon is not a stock play for the impatient, as
it tackles a daunting task that analysts say may take years to
accomplish. By most projections, the company will not become
profitable until at least 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to slow down, take stock and actually execute some
of the necessary integration of the purchases,'' said Mike Davis, a
research director in Denver for the Gartner Group, a technology
consulting firm. ``They have to merge into a consolidated
organization and culture. That's where most companies fail. It's
not going to be easy.''
</P>
<P>
   In deals this month alone, Healtheon bought the Medical Manager
Corp., a profitable company that provides office management
software for doctors; CareInsite, an Internet company that was
Healtheon/WebMD's biggest competitor in the physician-to-insurer
linkage field; and the OnHealth Network, a Web site that provides
health care information for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   It was the stock price that has made possible the many
acquisitions _ more than six dozen so far _ and it was the shares
that attracted a $930 million investment last month by the Janus
Capital Corp. ``Janus is considered to be very smart money,''
Hochstadt said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the company has been spending about $250 million a year
_ investors call it the burn rate _ working capital should not be
an immediate problem. Besides the $930 million infusion from Janus,
Healtheon/WebMD says it has nearly $800 million in unspent
commitments from some of its stakeholders and corporate partners.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold, the chief executive, said that by June, Healtheon/WebMD
would make online connections available to 400,000 doctors, 900
insurance companies, 46,000 pharmacies and 4,500 hospitals. The
Healtheon piece of the operation, based in Santa Clara, Calif., has
close to 1,000 software programmers and computer engineers working
full steam on producing the links under the supervision of Pavan
Nigram.
</P>
<P>
   Nigram is a computer wizard originally hired by Jim Clark, the
Silicon Valley billionaire who previously founded Silicon Graphics
and Netscape. Nigram was given the technical challenge of bringing
reality to Clark's dream, conceived four years ago, to somehow
capitalize on the nation's health care economy.
</P>
<P>
   Since Healtheon went public a year ago, Clark has moved on to
less world-shaking Web-based ventures like helping rich people
manage their money and consumers store family photos. Clark is
still on the board, however, and still owns Healtheon shares worth
$700 million at current prices. And one of his initial concepts
remains central for Healtheon: playing a gatekeeper role in the
daily transactions of the nation's medical money machine.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, online transactions _ medical bills, drug
prescriptions, lab results and so on _ may cost as little as 25
cents each, compared with $8 or $10 currently for transactions by
paper, fax or phone. UnitedHealthcare, a unit of the UnitedHealth
Group and a minority owner of Healtheon/WebMD, is encouraging the
300,000 doctors in its networks to submit bills and check patient
coverage online. At least 100,000 are already doing so, a
UnitedHealthcare official said.
</P>
<P>
   The potential market is a mind-boggling 30 billion health care
transactions annually. They include hospital and doctor bills,
insurance approvals, drug prescriptions, lab reports and referrals
to specialists.
</P>
<P>
   The first task, Arnold said, is to connect the nation's myriad
disparate computer systems to the Internet and to make them
accessible with Web-browser software _ an effort likely to get a
big push as new federal regulations take hold over the next two
years. Under a 1996 law, the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act, all external transactions between hospitals,
doctors and insurers must be in standardized electronic language,
with safeguards to protect patients' privacy and prevent
unauthorized access.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every health care company says it needs a Web strategy,''
Arnold said. ``We will provide them with the technology that meets
the Hippa requirements,'' he said, referring to the 1996 law.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Healtheon acquired a crucial piece of this capability with a
deal in January to buy the electronic billing company Envoy from
the Quintiles Transnational Corp. for $2.5 billion in Healtheon
stock. Envoy is a profitable business, dominating the small
fraction of the country's medical bills that are delivered
electronically, from computer to computer. But it is not the Web _
yet.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say that electronic transactions, alone, are not
sufficient to wring costs from the nation's medical system. As long
as health care providers continue to do most of their business the
old-fashioned, more expensive way by using paper, fax and the
phone, there are costly inefficiencies _ even if the information is
subsequently converted to digital form for transmitting online,
said Janice Young, another research director at the Gartner Group.
</P>
<P>
   And while Healtheon, as evidence of a trend, says it counted 1
million transactions online to insurance companies and laboratories
in a single month last fall, some analysts have calculated that
fewer than 100,000 of those actually originated as computerized
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are waiting to see the number of doctors actually using the
Internet,'' said William McKeever, an analyst at PaineWebber
Securities. ``They run the gamut from just signing up to visiting a
physician portal to using the Internet for transactions.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin J. Wygod, chief executive of Medical Manager and
CareInsite, who will be co-chairman of Healtheon/WebMD when the
sale of his companies is completed, is a big promoter of the online
business model. ``We can change the entire continuum of care and
reduce not only the administrative expense but the actual cost of
care by getting the right information to the doctor when he is
seeing the patient,'' Wygod said.
</P>
<P>
   Wygod said that health insurers like United, and several that
signed on with CareInsite in New York, New Jersey and
Massachusetts, would be key to overcoming the reluctance of doctors
to try new systems. He predicted that the health insurers
themselves would be lured by the potential online cost savings,
which he said might allow the insurers to eliminate thousands of
employees who now deal with doctors by phone and process faxes.
</P>
<P>
   Since most doctors do business with a number of health plans,
their interest in going online is likely to be greater if they can
deal with more than one insurer on the same Web site. In New York,
for example, CareInsite has contracts with Empire Blue Cross and
Blue Shield, HIP, and Group Health Inc., and Healtheon serves
United.
</P>
<P>
   But Young at the Gartner Group said that in some regions,
dominant health insurers were developing their own online systems _
and thus might hesitate to share access to doctors with
Healtheon/WebMD.
</P>
<P>
   Besides transactions, which Arnold said would generate about
half the revenue, the company is placing other bets. It has a big
staff of writers and doctors producing up-to-date health care
information for consumers and to attract physicians to its news and
information Web site, WebMD.com. The site's producers also create
broadcast material to which the News Corp.'s Fox television unit
has acquired syndication rights.
</P>
<P>
   Mimicking the America Online model, the WebMD.com site can
generate advertising revenue and ``carriage'' fees from health care
companies that doctors and consumers link to through the WebMD.com
portal. For example, Medibuy, an online supplier of medical
products and services, is paying $45.5 million for such a link. In
addition, Healtheon/WebMD will get royalties from online sales from
partners like the CVS drugstore chain. But for analysts, the big
questions remain how quickly and how well Healtheon/WebMD will be
able to integrate not only the nation's bewildering health care
system but, first, the many pieces of its own far-flung,
two-chairman empire.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Wygod, the other co-chairman will be W. Michael Long.
Long sold his financial technology consulting company, Continuum
Inc., to the Computer Sciences Corp. for $1.4 billion, in 1996 _
which is why he was available in 1997 when Healtheon's venture
capital backer went looking for someone to bring focus to the hazy
plans Clark had spun for the company.
</P>
<P>
   Besides having three entrepreneurial types atop the company
seeking management cohesion, Healtheon/WebMD also has an
integration challenge that is purely geographic. Arnold remains in
Atlanta, where the WebMD business is based. Long still lives in
Austin, Texas, though he spends considerable time at the Healtheon
operations in Santa Clara. Wygod lives near San Diego, far from
Medical Manager and CareInsite, which are based in Elmwood Park,
N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing the enormity of the task before him,
Healtheon/WebMD's Arnold tends to speak in measured tones about his
prospects. When Jim Clark was wooing early investors, he used to
talk about a revolution in health care that would eliminate $250
million of waste from the $1.3 trillion system. Arnold speaks more
modestly about evolution.
</P>
<P>
   The company will ``work with the current systems: they can keep
doing it by phone, paper and fax,'' Arnold said. ``We are just
asking for access.''
</P>
<P>
   A foot in the door, in other words. A very big foot.

<P>
   Deeply offended by the sexually explicit magazine covers
spreading across newsstands, a watchdog group called Morality in
Media last month lobbied the Kroger supermarket chain to conceal
explicit cover lines like this one on Cosmopolitan: ``Sex Tricks
Only Cosmo Would Know: 20 Earth-Quaking Moves That Will Make Him
Plead for Mercy _ and Beg for More.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the targeted magazines, besides Cosmopolitan: Glamour,
Mademoiselle and Redbook.
</P>
<P>
   Redbook? The inclusion of the member of that prim cadre of
magazines known as the Seven Sisters, which are aimed most intently
at married women with children, might come as a surprise to readers
who still associate it with tuna casserole recipes, diet tips and
articles about calcium supplements, not the ``steamy sexercises''
in the February issue.
</P>
<P>
   But the move shows how the world has changed for the 97-year-old
Hearst magazine and the heretofore sacrosanct sisterhood of women's
magazines and how they are feeling the same pressures that have
prompted many U.S. consumer magazines to heat up frank sexual
discussion to spur sales in the magazine market.
</P>
<P>
   These seven titles, most of which were founded a century ago _
Redbook, Ladies' Home Journal, Good Housekeeping, McCall's, Family
Circle, Woman's Day and Better Homes &AMP; Gardens _ have long been
known for their coverage of such domestic subjects as
child-rearing, recipes, health and home decoration. Unlike Glamour,
Cosmopolitan and Mademoiselle _ which seek younger, unmarried urban
women as readers _ the Seven Sisters are known as ``women's
service'' magazines and were in the past traditionally aimed at
stay-at-home mothers with hungry children and distracted,
overworked husbands.
</P>
<P>
   Redbook and Ladies' Home Journal are the only two that now
regularly include the more explicit sexual content. But their shift
toward sexier stories _ the February Ladies' Home Journal, for
example, featured a new sex column, and Redbook's February issue
had sex-oriented features like ``What Your Sex Dreams Say About
You'' and also started a sex column, ``Red Hot Sex,'' with its
March issue _ reflects only a part of the changing dynamics of the
magazine industry, which can best be described in a shorthand
equation known to marketing executives the world over: Sex sells.
</P>
<P>
   Most magazines have become more aggressive about luring
consumers at the newsstand, because consolidation at both the
wholesale and retail level has slowed sales for most magazines. In
Redbook's case, the magazine even runs different headlines on
issues going to subscribers and issues for sale on the newsstand.
On the March issue going to subscribers, the top headline reads
``Intimate Secrets of Women Men Love''; on the newsstand, where
headlines have to be eye-catching, that line reads ``Sex Secrets''
_ in capital letters _ ``of Women Men Love'' and there is an extra
headline advertising the ``New! Sex Column.''
</P>
<P>
   Virtually the entire women's service category has suffered from
shrinking circulation in recent years. Each issue of Woman's Day,
published by Hachette Filipacchi, sold 10 million copies on the
newsstand 20 years ago, but both newsstand and subscription sales
now amount to 4.1 million copies. Since 1994, Ladies Home Journal
is down to 4.5 million from 5 million; Redbook is down to 2.8
million from 3.2 million; Good Housekeeping 4.6 million from 5.1
million; Woman's Day to 4 million from 4.6 million; and McCall's to
4.2 million from 4.6 million. Family Circle and Better Homes &AMP;
Gardens have remained flat, at 5 million and 7.6 million,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   But there has been a brutal cut in the Seven Sisters'
circulation. The legislation against American Family Publishers and
Publishers Clearing House has soured consumers on the notion of
buying their magazine subscriptions from sweepstakes houses. Since
most of the Seven Sisters have relied in the past on attracting a
majority of subscribers through sweepstakes campaigns,
subscriptions are down.
</P>
<P>
   So they are retooling their images. The 117-year-old Ladies'
Home Journal had a first in its February issue: a sex column,
``Behind Closed Doors,'' which according to the magazine's table of
contents ``takes a new look at making love _ and making it
better.'' A recent cover line on Ladies' Home Journal included
``Grown-Up Sexxx: He Needs It, You'll Love It.''
</P>
<P>
   Myrna Blyth, the editor in chief, said that the service category
had always featured sex on some level, but that now there is an
effort to write saucier headlines to attract consumers. The January
cover of Ladies' Home Journal featured this headline at the top:
``Make Love: Have the Best Sex of Your Life _ Tonight!'' and,
inside, an article titled ``101 Ways to Sex Up Your Marriage.''
(The issue, however, also featured articles titled ``When a Cold
Won't Go Away'' and ``Food Journal: Three Delicious Skillet Recipes
That Get Dinner on the Table in Thirty Minutes.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``We have used sex as a cover line, or in a title for a
relationship article, for a long time,'' Blyth said. ``But one
thing that is interesting now is that we are living in an
optimistic period. People want to have fun in their lives and sex
is seen less as a problem and more as a reward, as enjoyment, than
ever before. So there is a difference in how we promote those
articles on the cover now.''
</P>
<P>
   Samir Husni, a professor of media studies at the University of
Mississippi and a close observer of the magazine industry, said
that one reason the women's service magazines are featuring more
sex is that they are keeping pace with the rest of the field. ``The
Seven Sisters are all general interest magazines, and now you have
targeted women's magazines like Elle and Jane that are nibbling
away at their circulation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Redbook has made the biggest effort to adjust its image and
position and has added more sexual content under the guidance of
Lesley Jane Seymour, the editor in chief.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to pull away from the rest of the Seven
Sisters,'' Seymour said. ``We are moving it slightly younger, to
fill that gap between the younger fashion magazines and the older,
full-fledged Seven Sisters.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Redbook, Seymour pointed out, has run sex stories for decades.
But now every issue features a prominent headline at the top of the
cover, touting some new sexual position or trend. The October 1999
issue featured a cover story titled ``Intimacy Required! The Move
That Brings You Closer'' and inside ran step-by-step instructions
for ``Redbook's Hot New Sex Position,'' the
``guaranteed-to-make-him-moan'' Passion Flower. (``Sit in the
center of your bed facing each other,'' the instructions begin.
``Wrap your legs comfortably around his body so that you are
sitting on his thighs.'')
</P>
<P>
   And judging from the headlines a decade ago, Redbook has
certainly amped up its sex play on the cover. The headlines that
ran most prominently on covers in 1989, for example, were ``Our
Award-Winning Diet: Drop a Dress Size Fast'' and ``Nails Now ...
Gorgeous Newest Colors, Shapes, Tips.''
</P>
<P>
   Seymour said she had changed Redbook to reflect the way women's
lives have changed, and that her reader is less a housekeeper for
her children than a fashion-conscious working woman who happens to
have children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to move Redbook between the young fashion
magazines which are totally me-oriented, and the older magazines
which are totally oriented toward your family,'' Seymour said. ``If
you notice, when you get to a magazine like McCall's, it's suddenly
all about family. Redbook is for the young working mom with kids
and all those things she has to juggle and who still cares about
herself. Our best readers come to us post-Glamour and post-Cosmo.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Husni characterized the shift: ``Redbook is trying to
position itself for the woman who believes there is life after
marriage. Or, sorry, sex after marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the Seven sisters, however, are rushing to publish
guides to new erotic zones or architectural drawings of sexual
positions. Jane Chestnutt, the editor in chief of Woman's Day, said
the readers of her 65-year-old publication remained concerned about
strengthening their parenting skills, not their _ as suggested in a
recent Redbook article _ pubococcygeal muscles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our readers make it clear that what they want is romance, not
sex,'' Chestnutt said. ``They are busy and their husbands are busy,
and they've got kids and they don't have enough time to be with one
another. So we give them ideas to strengthen their relationships,
and we believe they can take care of the rest themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Levine, the editor in chief of Good Housekeeping _ who
began her career at Woman's Day and was editor in chief of Redbook
_ said that change is inevitable, even at the vaunted women's
service magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember that many of these magazines were formed around the
turn of the century when women didn't even have the vote,'' she
said. ``They have to evolve. But life is clearly very different
than it was five years ago, or 10 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Levine pointed out that even the term ``Seven Sisters'' is an
outdated marketing canard invented by advertising executives _
mostly men _ in the 1950s. And she said that she herself had
wondered if the magazines' decline in readership had anything to do
with the fact that women no longer like to perceive of themselves
as housewives.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a magazine that is 115 years old, you have to
wonder about that,'' she said. ``But I don't think readers'
interest in those things is dying out at all. Every few years you
have a whole new generation that needs to learn those things.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're always going to have to know how to get the spot out
of,'' Levine paused before alighting on a word that would not imply
housewifely duties _ then said, ``a spot out of your dress.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Internet, a phenomenon that has filled the pages of
newspapers and magazines since 1995, is now emptying a few of their
newsroom cubicles.
</P>
<P>
   Beautyscene.com, Business.com, Cybergold.com, Drspock.com,
Goodhome.com, Office.com, Petopia.com, Rivals.com, VoxCap.com,
Women.com. The names are new enough to befuddle even the most
dot-com obsessed observer, but they are becoming irritatingly
familiar to newspaper and magazine editors, as one seasoned
journalist after another is lured away to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The sites listed above, for instance, have recently attracted a
Los Angeles bureau chief from The Wall Street Journal, a New York
Times copy editor, a Seattle Times sportswriter, an assistant city
editor at The San Francisco Chronicle, a Chicago bureau chief from
Business Week, a business writer and a copy editor from The San
Jose Mercury News, the beauty director of Elle, a Fortune columnist
and the editor of American HomeStyle and Gardening.
</P>
<P>
   A more complete list, including better-known sites like
Forbes.com, CNN.com, America Online, Salon.com, Slate and
TheStreet.com, and Internetcentric magazines like The Industry
Standard, Red Herring and Fast Company, might fill an entire column
of newspaper type. If journalists from trade publications and
recent journalism school graduates were thrown in, the names and
their associated dot-coms would fill a whole page.
</P>
<P>
   Publications in the West Coast high-technology centers like
Seattle, San Francisco and San Jose are particularly vulnerable, as
are those covering financial news, technology, sports, health and
beauty _ the niches that draw the biggest and most devoted online
audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Even journalists closely acquainted with the unproven financial
strategies of many sites have taken the leap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six months to a year ago, I wouldn't have dreamed that I would
be leaving The Journal and doing anything like this,'' said Peter
Gumbel, the departing Los Angeles bureau chief of the Dow Jones
newspaper and the incoming editor of Business.com, a business
information site created by eCompanies of Santa Monica, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an opportunity The Journal couldn't provide,'' Gumbel
added. ``I had this image of my daughter saying to me in 20 years'
time, `What did you do in the Internet revolution, Daddy?' If I had
to stand there and say, `Nothing special, dear ...'''.
</P>
<P>
   Then Gumbel, a former foreign correspondent, added that he had
found the technology revolution just as transforming as the
collapse of communism, which he had covered. Only this time, he
asked himself, ``Do I want to be an observer or a participant?''
So, at 42, Gumbel is pocketing a fistful of stock options in his
new company and preparing to be editor in chief of an enterprise
whose journalists are mostly yet to be hired and whose editorial
product is yet to be shaped.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine industry, too, has been losing people for several
years, most recently the head of one of the top magazine companies.
</P>
<P>
   John Heins, the chief executive of Gruner &AMP; Jahr Publishing _ a
unit of Bertelsmann that publishes Family Circle, McCall's and
Parents _ took a job as a vice president of sales and international
operations at Netscape, a unit of America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Heins said that he had been exploring ways to bring Gruner &AMP;
Jahr up to Internet speed when he became intrigued with Internet
culture. ``I became fascinated by the industry,'' he said. ``I
wanted to be in the middle of it.''
</P>
<P>
   At Gruner &AMP; Jahr, he found it hard to keep the dot-com raiders
from his staff. ``We have had an incredible number of cases where
you have a person making $60,000 a year who gets lured away with
$100,000 and stock options,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The exact number of Internet journalism jobs is impossible to
pin down. But Marsha Stoltman, who is vice president and general
manager of conferences for Editor &AMP; Publisher and ran a recent
session on interactive newspapers, said the migration from old
media to new media ``has yet to peak.''
</P>
<P>
   Editors like Michael R. Fancher of The Seattle Times and David
Yarnold of Knight Ridder's San Jose Mercury News, while
acknowledging some irritating losses, see the phenomenon as part of
a broader dynamism within the newspaper industry _ driven by a
booming economy and old media's need to hire for its own Internet
sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``The total loss last year was 11 people,'' Yarnold said about
his newspaper, ``and 11 people out of 400 or more does not
constitute a crisis or a brain drain.'' With the newsroom expanding
by 26 people _ including 16 technology reporters _ the newspaper is
on a hiring binge.
</P>
<P>
   Still, aware of the high premium that Internet companies place
on journalists who know their world, he said that The Mercury News
pays technology reporters a premium of perhaps 10 percent more than
it does other reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The lure of dot-com companies, he said, is less salary than
stock options, which could be worth hundreds of thousands _ unless
the company crashes.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Outing, who has covered Internet journalism for years for
Editor &AMP; Publisher Interactive, does not have as sanguine a view as
Yarnold. ``Is it a real brain drain?'' he said. ``My perception is
that it is. It's hard to quantify.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the real impact is likely to be felt by the
smallest newspapers. ``They get people right out of college,'' he
said. ``They don't pay well. When I got out of college _ this was
1978 _ the major alternatives were public relations or technical
writing. One of the offers I got was a technical writing position,
which paid double the newspaper salary. I took the newspaper job
because it was more exciting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now would a kid coming out of college take a newspaper job
because of the glamour? I doubt it, because the dot-coms are
glamorous themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey Cowan, dean of the Annenberg School for Communication
at the University of Southern California, estimated that 10 percent
of the journalists who graduated in June went to Internet concerns.
But, he added, ``The dot-coms are paying in the high 40s and low
50s, whereas the print outlets are paying their entering
journalists in the high 20s.''
</P>
<P>
   Andy Wang, who began teaching this year at the graduate school
of journalism at the University of Missouri after four years in
online journalism, said, ``Clearly the students have no desire to
get a fact-checking job with Esquire when they can get $50,000 plus
options at a Web site.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web sites that are most attractive to magazine employees
tend to be those that cover beauty, home design and decoration and
finance. In 1999, almost a dozen editors left women's magazines
like Glamour, Allure, Cosmopolitan and Vogue to join beauty retail
sites like Eve.com, Beautyjungle.com, Beautyscene.com and
Sephora.com.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, Jean Godfrey-June, the beauty director of the
Lagardere magazine Elle for six years, left the magazine last
August to become Beautyscene.com's editor in chief, and Elle was
not able to fill the post until January.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Turshen, editor in chief of Goodhome.com, left his job last
September as editor in chief of American HomeStyle and Gardening,
published by Gruner &AMP; Jahr. Turshen said the attraction Net sites
associated with home design is their depth and retail
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you presented rooms and merchandise in a magazine, well,
you had rooms and merchandise,'' he said. ``On a Web site, you can
present a room full of ottomans, and the viewer can buy
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   At The Seattle Times, which lost people to Microsoft in the
mid-1990s and to MSNBC.com three years ago, the last year has been
marked by attrition of a different sort. ``Only a handful of the
people who left went to interactive media,'' Fancher said. ``In our
case, the drain is not to new media, it's to traditional media in a
very competitive market.''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, people are joining sites they wrote about just
weeks before, a situation that makes some journalists
uncomfortable. One who was undeterred was Jodi Mardesich of the
Time Warner magazine Fortune. In a column on Fortune's Web site
last week explaining why she was leaving Fortune's Silicon Valley
bureau for Drspock.com, she wrote: ``What if I could write about a
topic that's meaningful to me and create something valuable at the
same time?''
</P>
<P>
   But some defectors return. Danny O'Neil was a summer intern in
The Seattle Times' sports section in 1997 before he headed for the
Internet, eventually landing at ESPN.com. Last year, he came back
to The Times to cover high school sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came back for less money,'' he said. ``I want to write. In
my experience, people in the Internet are looking for scores. They
don't digest long articles. They go from one file to another
without reading more than four paragraphs.'' &QL;

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Four years ago Tuesday, on Feb. 29, 1996, malfunctions in
computers that did not recognize that year's leap day forced
Belgium to close its stock exchange, stopped the Arizona State
Lottery from selling tickets and locked all the doors at Johnson
County Community College in Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Such experiences led to warnings during the height of the Year
2000 computer preparations in 1998 and 1999 not to forget that 2000
was also a leap year. Experts had been predicting that on Feb. 29,
2000, breakdowns might be especially burdensome if businesses and
governments had not yet fully recovered from computer malfunctions
that were widely expected to strike in January.
</P>
<P>
   The betting now, though, is that the government's Year 2000
command center, which reopened Monday after a month's hiatus, might
be a good place Tuesday for a peaceful nap. Because computers have
encountered far fewer Year 2000 date failures than anticipated, the
assumption is that computer users also fixed nearly all the
potential leap-year faults, too, as they were spending billions on
Year 2000 precautions. And programmers are thought to be better
prepared than ever to spot and quickly fix any date problems they
missed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real threat is gone,'' said Howard Adams, an information
technology analyst at Giga Group, a research and consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   There is still widespread debate on just how great the threat
ever was. Clearly, many computers would have been unable to
interpret dates with the year expressed by just the two digits 00 _
the Year 2000 problem _ had they not been repaired. And some
experts like Peter de Jager, a Canadian consultant, contend that
even though the repair effort consumed $200 billion or more, the
global total of Year 2000-related date malfunctions has already
topped a million.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the number, though, the great majority have been
problems so minor that they could be dealt with without their ever
coming to the public's attention or overwhelming the computer
staffs of the companies experiencing them. Many problems that
became public, like Internet sites suddenly displaying dates like
1900 or even 19100, produced giggles rather than harm.
</P>
<P>
   Other breakdowns were too isolated to cause concern, as when 800
slot machines failed in Delaware and toll roads around Sao Paulo,
Brazil, could not provide valid receipts.
</P>
<P>
   Through the end of January, just 21 companies had asked the IRS
for permission to delay tax payments without penalties because of
Year 2000 problems, under a special rule adopted late last year,
said Daniel Boone, an IRS spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   There were Year 2000 problems that might have been serious under
different circumstances, like the failure of a reporting system for
radiation levels at Japan's Shika nuclear plant. Around the world,
numerous building security systems froze, including one at the
Canadian government's National Defense Headquarters in Ottawa.
France was unable to communicate with a military satellite and, in
perhaps the most widely reported breakdown, the Pentagon was unable
to process images from a spy satellite.
</P>
<P>
   One clear example of how disruptive Year 2000 could have been,
had no one taken precautions, involved a credit card payment system
made by Cybercash, in Reston, Va. A small number of the 100,000
restaurateurs and other small businesses that use Cybercash did not
update their system software and unwittingly billed their customers
day after day for the same transaction. Some consumers who monitor
their credit card balances online noticed the problem quickly and
got their bills corrected. But many more did not find out until
opening their monthly bills and finding hundreds or even thousands
of dollars in erroneous charges.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``The easy part was stopping the charges, once we found out on
Jan. 13, but we still haven't settled everything,'' said Tzu Ming
Yang, owner of the Kawasaki Japanese Seafood restaurant in
Baltimore, which uses the Cybercash system. He said that Kawasaki
had issued more than $82,000 in credits to customers based on
records from National Data Corp., its processor. But because
processors like National Data and banks issuing credit cards are
both part of the accounting chain, the dates when the transactions
are credited may vary, and some consumers ended up in disputes over
finance charges, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
   Yang said it was too soon to try to assign blame. Because of
special rules aimed at discouraging Year 2000 litigation passed
last year by Congress, lawyers say it will be spring at the
earliest before lawsuits emerge involving the Cybercash breakdowns
or any others.
</P>
<P>
   So far, courts are saying that the law does not apply to suits
filed by companies seeking reimbursement from insurers for the
millions of dollars the companies spent avoiding possible Year 2000
losses. GTE, Xerox, Kmart and Nike are among the major companies
that filed such suits last year, all of which are in the early
pretrial stages.
</P>
<P>
   No one now expects the litigation toll to reach the $1 trillion
figure once bandied about. But the number of lawsuits is expected
to increase in the coming months, said Ronald N. Weikers, a
Philadelphia lawyer who has closely tracked Year 2000 legal
developments.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Computer experts now say that 2000 will be remembered mostly as
the occasion for a thorough housecleaning and updating that left
them primed for a rapid expansion of e-commerce and other new
electronic technologies.
</P>
<P>
   With leap day shaping up as a nonevent, the major remaining
question related to Y2K seems to be whether the lessons learned,
and the investments made, will be fully exploited. And on that
point, there are plenty of skeptics.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of every 100 companies that want to leverage their Y2K
work, about 15 will really do it,'' predicted Adams, a former
computer manager at Bank of America who has followed Year 2000
computer problems for Giga Group since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But some experts say the lasting effects may be greater than the
skeptics expect, just as the success in dealing with Year 2000
flaws was. Thousands of businesses and government agencies now have
up-to-date, streamlined systems, top managers with a better
appreciation of information technology's vital role, and better
understanding of their suppliers' operations.
</P>
<P>
   Some ad hoc Year 2000 groups, like the High Technology
Consortium, a group of nearly 40 companies like Intel, Motorola,
Hewlett-Packard and Cisco Systems, have already met to discuss how
to continue their coordinated efforts to deal with matters like
contingency planning and maintaining continuous links with
suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals and human services agencies that teamed up in Bell
County, Texas, to create a list of ``medically fragile'' residents
to monitor during the rollover, are seeking grants to continue and
extend their database to cover up to 10,000 people, including area
residents with mental health problems.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, even if companies are tempted to fall back into bad
programming and maintenance habits, insurers are likely to pressure
them to shape up, said Harris Miller, executive director of the
Information Technology Association of America. ``The same things
that helped companies deal with Y2K set them up to practice good
security, which insurers want so they can avoid payouts for
breaches,'' Miller said.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A small, but intense disturbance along the Maine coast will
cause a period of heavy rain in central and eastern New England on
Monday. In western sections, enough chilly air will sweep in to
cause wet snow, which may accumulate 6 inches or more in the Green
and White Mountains. Since the jet stream disturbance will be
changing its orientation over the Northeast, clearing will be slow
along the southern New England coast. Winds will be blustery from
the northwest with gusts over 30 mph from Pennsylvania to the
Middle Atlantic shores.
</P>
<P>
   The South will be bright and very pleasant though not as warm as
recent days. High pressure stretching from the Ohio Valley to the
upper Great Lakes will sponsor mainly sunny skies and seasonably
mild conditions in most of the Mississippi Valley. A surge of
warmer air into the Dakotas will promote clouds and gusty winds.
Brisk winds from the south will reach 30 mph over the central
Plains.
</P>
<P>
   An elongated cold front moving east of the Rockies will produce
periods of wet snow along the west slopes of the mountains from
western Wyoming through eastern Utah and into southwest Colorado.
Valley showers are likely in this same region. Meanwhile, high
pressure building into California will cause sunny and more
pleasant conditions after morning fog lifts. The Northwest Coast
will turn dismal as a warm front sends steady rain into Oregon and
showers along the Washington shoreline. Snow levels will rise in
the Cascades. Winds will reach gale force later Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Balmy in Buffalo
</P>
<P>
   In spite of frozen Lake Erie just a few miles away, the mercury
rose to 71 degrees on Saturday afternoon in Buffalo establishing a
new all-time record for February. The previous record of 70 was set
just three years ago on February 21, 1997. In a city where the joke
is that there are two seasons, winter and the Fourth of July,
Buffalo can manage to bask in winter warmth when a persistent wind
from the south sets in. Indeed for three days, a balmy breeze has
blown. The air descended from the hills of northwest Pennsylvania
adding a few extra degrees, enough to eclipse the record.

HOW IDEAS CAN BE SERIOUSLY INFECTIOUS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes at end of review.) 
(nk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Malcolm Gladwell proposes a fascinating and possibly useful
theory in ``The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big
Difference'': namely that ideas, attitudes and behaviors tend to
spread contagiously in the same way as some infectious diseases.
</P>
<P>
   But what makes his book so appealing is the way he approaches
his subject. Instead of breathing heavily and shouting the
implications of his theory, he follows the precept of his subtitle
and explores the little things that make a big difference.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, at one point he cites an essay by the psychologist
George Miller, ``The Magic Number Seven,'' which investigates human
memory and explains why telephone numbers are limited to seven
digits. Elsewhere he introduces us to people like DeeDee Gordon, a
market researcher who specializes in spotting new fads among
teen-agers, and Mark Alpert, who happens to know more about
products than the combined staff of Consumer Reports.
</P>
<P>
   In one chapter Gladwell explains how the people who produced
``Sesame Street'' went about surmounting the weakness of television
as a teaching medium. In another he describes a series of
psychological experiments, among them one in which some people cast
in the roles of prisoners and guards acted out the worst excesses
of their real-life counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   What do all these investigative tidbits in ``The Tipping
Point,'' which grew out of an article Gladwell wrote for The New
Yorker, illustrate? Quite a lot, it turns out. Analyzing how his
epidemics work, he concludes that they ``are a function of the
people who transmit infectious agents, the infectious agent itself
and the environment in which the infectious agent is operating.''
</P>
<P>
   Analyzing these three elements, he arrives at what he calls
``The Law of the Few,'' ``The Stickiness Factor'' and ``The Power
of Context.'' The Law of the Few holds that only certain kinds of
people can transmit effectively.
</P>
<P>
   These are Connectors, Mavens and Salesmen. Paul Revere, for
instance, was all three rolled into one, Gladwell suggests: Revere
knew what the British were up to (Maven); he knew the right people
to tell (Connector); and he knew how to tell them effectively
(Salesman).
</P>
<P>
   But also his message was inherently important, which means it
had a high Stickiness Factor. And it prompted an effective
reaction, which suggests a strong Power of Context. Under these
perfect circumstances Revere's word spread contagiously; it tipped
the balance of colonial behavior, and the British soldiers marching
on Lexington were met with revolutionary resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing Gladwell's theories boiled down to their essence in this
manner may make it clear why they are more appetizing when
garnished with his ``for instances.'' All the same, their
implications are powerful. Correctly applied they could be used to
run businesses more effectively, to turn products into runaway best
sellers and perhaps most important to alter human behavior.
</P>
<P>
   What sort of behavior does he have in mind? In addressing this
question, Gladwell turns either coy or modest, depending on how you
read him. By piecing together different sections of ``The Tipping
Point,'' you can draw one particularly startling conclusion, that
nothing less than crime might be eliminated as a problem.
</P>
<P>
   But Gladwell never comes right out and says as much.
Illustrating his theory of context, he cites what criminologists
have called the Broken Windows theory, which, he says, may explain
why Mayor Rudolf Giuliani's campaign to eliminate squeegee men and
other minor blights on the quality of life in New York City was
followed by a major drop in crime statistics. Elsewhere he points
out with several striking illustrations that humans are more
influenced by the circumstances under which they experience things
than they are by their inherent characters.
</P>
<P>
   Finally he cites studies suggesting that even such an extreme
act as suicide is often less autonomous than we think and more a
result of infectious communication.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he never arrives at the conclusion that crime might be
attacked through a campaign to alter behavior. Instead he saves his
fire for teen-age smoking, which, he argues, is proving completely
resistant to present scare tactics and should instead be attacked
by lowering the nicotine content of cigarettes (or reducing their
stickiness, so to speak). Even in a book composed in the charmingly
patchwork fashion that ``The Tipping Point'' is, you are left with
the impression that the author has veered from his most important
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Still, what Gladwell has to say is instructive. If he hasn't got
all the answers, he certainly offers a fresh way of looking at the
problems. He concludes: ``Look at the world around you. It may seem
like an immovable, implacable place. It is not. With the slightest
push _ in just the right place _ it can be tipped.''
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, he entertains you by describing new places you
might stand to gain some leverage on what you want to tip.

<P>
   The first time I taught a writing class I was scared stiff. This
was at a private school where I was filling in for a teacher who
had left suddenly in the middle of the semester. Nothing I had done
before _ editing a magazine, publishing five novels _ prepared me
for trying to explain how I'd done it or, more daunting still, to
translate what I worked at every day into curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   I was a cook with nothing to measure with and no recorded
recipes. Whatever I knew about constructing a piece of fiction lay
in an unsorted jumble in what a shrink would call the unconscious
but I prefer to think of as the cellar. This was the place I dipped
into optimistically whenever I needed something.
</P>
<P>
   If I had been asked how you build characterization or indicate
motive, I would have been at a loss. I was like the centipede who,
when asked which foot it moved first, froze. How could I teach
others to write? Well, you can't really teach people how to write,
can you? They either have it or they don't.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the English department tried to reassure me: You can
do it, therefore you can teach it. After all, the school was
desperate. So teaching writing wasn't going to be like teaching
calculus or even photography. Since it was considered one of the
arts, a soft discipline, it wasn't necessary to have an advanced
degree or even any training in the art of teaching. In other words,
I was meant to wing it, to make it up as I went along.
</P>
<P>
   The five teen-agers I met in a bright and cozy classroom
abutting a highway near the Charles River wore expectant faces.
What to do? ``Write a story,'' I said, aware of how incredibly hard
it is to write a story, harder than a novel. Every piece must fit
snugly; each word must carry the weight of three or four words
spoken aloud, carelessly.
</P>
<P>
   The students did their homework. They came back with stories
about extraterrestrials or about young people waking up in the
morning, walking barefoot across a cold floor while smelling the
coffee brewing below, then into the bathroom to look at themselves
in the mirror and wonder who they were and why they were here. It
didn't take long to realize that they were making the same mistakes
over and over again. I wasn't teaching them anything.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose I asked them all to do the same exercise, like scales
for a singer? So I made up an exercise as arbitrary and demanding
as solfege, gave them a word limit, 600, and sent them off. I
thought they would chafe at being reined in, having their
imaginations severely clipped. But they surprised me by asking for
another exercise and another. They were like first-graders
completing a page in an arithmetic workbook and getting a gold star
for it.
</P>
<P>
   Making up these prose drills forced me to start organizing and
classifying the elements of fiction that lay in that messy heap.
This was salutary for me, and I began to see that about half the
student's battle is learning basic skills, while the other half
involves tapping into imagination, memory and a singular view of
life and the world, a view no one else shares until you put it into
words.
</P>
<P>
   My assignments sounded simple enough, but they were hard to
bring off with style and conviction. One was an emotional childhood
memory, to be told in the present tense, using the language and
perceptions of a child, to be followed the next week by the same
memory, this time in the past tense and from the point of view of
an adult who, presumably, has learned something in the meantime.
</P>
<P>
   From that time, 1975, I've taught writing at one place or
another, always using exercises that focused on isolated elements
of the craft, like dialogue, plot, point of view, characterization,
revision, language. (The students hated the one in which they were
not allowed to use any adjectives or adverbs, but it made them
realize how strong verbs and nouns are, especially when they stand
alone.) Along the way there were those suspicious of my black
magic; the headmaster of another school described my fiction
workshop in a memo to the faculty as ``poison candy.'' I didn't
know which to object to more strenuously _ the poison part or the
candy.
</P>
<P>
   You can teach almost anyone determined to learn them the basics
required to write sentences and paragraphs that say what you want
them to say clearly and concisely. It's far more difficult to get
people to think like a writer, to give up conventional habits of
mind and emotion. You must be able to step inside your character's
skin and at the same time to remain outside the dicey circumstances
you have maneuvered her into. I can't remember how many times I
advised students to stop writing the sunny hours and write from
where it hurts: ``No one wants to read polite. It puts them to
sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea that people aren't always what they seem was a
startling notion to more beginning students than I like to
acknowledge. I thought everyone knew that a person who smiles all
the time may very well have a troubled and even murderous heart.
This in turn leads to an analysis of what it means to be a) cynical
and b) skeptical, and how, if you're going to write fiction it's
more productive to be b than a.
</P>
<P>
   If you're going to write fiction that's even vaguely
autobiographical _ and which of us hasn't? _ in trying to decide
what to put in and what to leave out, don't consider what your
friends, neighbors and especially your immediate family are going
to think and or say, assuming, that is, that they ever read what
you write. You don't want to hurt people deliberately; if you've
got the proper skills, you can disguise most people so they won't
recognize themselves.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There's a sureness to good writing even when what's being
written about doesn't make all that much sense. It's the sureness
of the so-called seat of an accomplished horseback rider or a
sailor coming about in a strong wind. The words have both muscle
and grace, familiarity and surprise. If forced to choose one writer
of the 20th century who has these qualities most abundantly, I
would name Vladimir Nabokov, who makes me want to take back
everything I said about adjectives, except that each of his is
chosen as carefully as an engagement ring: ``On her brown shoulder,
a raised purple-pink swelling (the work of some gnat) which I eased
of its beautiful transparent poison between my long thumbnails and
then sucked till I was gorged on her spicy blood.''
</P>
<P>
   You can't teach that kind of sureness; it comes only after
writing every day, sometimes for years. The stock questions _ ``How
will I know when to stop?'' ``How much detail is enough?'' _ can
only be answered by ``You'll know,'' trusting that as they acquire
skill their mean self-editors are developing real muscle.
</P>
<P>
   You can't teach someone who is tone deaf how to sing. But those
people don't turn up for singing lessons. Students learn pretty
fast whether or not they can carry a tune. When they can't, they
leave the class.
</P>
<P>
   And there's this to teaching: It's a public act. You're on,
people listen to you, watch you, endow you with an authority you
don't deserve. Most good teachers have a streak of the theatrical,
myself not excluded. My mother wanted me to be a musical comedy
actress-singer and to this end sent me to a celebrated singing
teacher who had trained a good many Broadway and concert hall
voices.
</P>
<P>
   I took lessons from this woman until I appeared triumphantly as
Papagano in my girls' school production of ``The Magic Flute.'' It
was, I confess, a high point in my life almost as exhilarating as
the sale of my first short story.
</P>
<P>
   My most recurrent anxiety dream is not about writing but about
getting up onstage and realizing I haven't learned my solo. The
writer ultimately took over from the singer, and I'm not at all
sorry about that. After 45 or so the singing voice begins to thin
and waver. A writer's voice, God willing, is clear and strong until
she's carried out feet first.

A BUSINESS STUNT MISSES THE MARK 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Sun Microsystems' chairman, Scott McNealy, is
well known for his merciless teasing of Bill Gates and Microsoft.
(McNealy likes to point out, for instance, that while both he and
Gates attended Harvard, only McNealy graduated.)
</P>
<P>
   But one recent attempted prank against Microsoft appears to have
fallen short.
</P>
<P>
   For the Feb. 17 public event to roll out Microsoft's ambitious
Windows 2000 operating system, Sun marketing executives had hired a
fleet of 20 bright yellow trucks used by the pest-control company
Western Exterminator.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was to pay the drivers to circle the San Francisco
Moscone Convention Center during the Microsoft event inside. The
idea was to draw attention to a news report that there were still
63,000 ``bugs'' in the Microsoft program when it was shipped to
customers _ even though the Microsoft executive in charge of
Windows 2000, James Allchin, had sent an open letter to customers
earlier in the week denying the report.
</P>
<P>
   Near the appointed hour, the trucks were lined up a few blocks
away from the Convention Center. But the mission was aborted after
the Western Exterminator manager learned that it was McNealy's
company, rather than Gates' Microsoft, that had hired the trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned about Gates' reaction, the manager called in his
fleet. ``He could buy the company and close it,'' he was reported
as saying of Gates.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the moribund marketing stunt, a Sun
Microsystems spokeswoman, Susanne Vagadori, said ``If you want an
on-the-record response it would be along the lines of, `Yeah,
wouldn't that be an appropriate and amusing joke on Microsoft?'
That's sort of why we looked into it.''

ACCORD ON DIGITAL TV TECHNOLOGY STILL LACKS HOLLYWOOD'S INPUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Under threat from the chairman of the Federal
Communications Commission, the cable television and
consumer-electronics industries have said, once again, that they
have solved a vexing problem slowing the transition to digital TV.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue is still not fully resolved. It is the second time
the two organizations have made such an announcement. And just like
the last one, this agreement is notable as much for what it does
not include as for what it does.
</P>
<P>
   The arcane but critical problem concerns how to connect a
digital television set to a digital cable box. No appropriate
digital connector exists. But because more than two-thirds of the
nation's television viewers subscribe to cable, digital sets must
be cable-compatible if the transition is ever to succeed. The
television sets available today are not.
</P>
<P>
   The two industries have been arguing over this issue for two
years. Last month, FCC Chairman Bill Kennard angrily warned that if
they did not solve the problem by April, the commission would
impose a regulatory solution of its own.
</P>
<P>
   That led to the announcement on Wednesday, which brought
congratulatory remarks from Kennard and the leaders of the two
industries. But little mention was made of a lingering, underlying
problem: Hollywood and the industries have not decided on a
copy-protection standard, making the whole agreement hollow, in the
view of some analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood will not release digital copies of current movies for
use on cable unless they are protected against the making of
multiple copies. Though current analog programming has long been
available for copying on videocassettes, such copies degrade over
time. The studios fear releasing digital versions of films into
general circulation because those can be copied endlessly without
degradation.
</P>
<P>
   A sense of deja vu hangs over all of this.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1998, a few months after the problem was first
disclosed, Kennard wrote a sharp letter to the cable industry and
the set makers, demanding they solve it by Nov. 1 of that year.
``These compatibility problems must be resolved quickly to ensure
that American consumers are able to enjoy the benefits of digital
television starting this fall,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   He and others in government were anxious to speed the transition
to digital television because at the end of the phase-in period,
all the older, analog stations now broadcasting are to be turned
off, with those parts of the airwaves reclaimed and auctioned for
other uses.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, on Nov. 2, 1998, the cable and consumer-electronics
industries announced an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Kennard called it ``an important milestone.'' And
Decker Anstrom, who was head of the National Cable Television
Association, promised: ``This will help ensure that digital TV sets
compatible with cable will be available in retail stores by
November 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was one problem: The industries had no copy-protection
plan to address Hollywood's concerns.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, Kennard said he knew that at the time
but decided ``this was an evolutionary process, and they had at
least made some progress.'' The industries pledged to solve this
and other remaining issues quickly.
</P>
<P>
   But by the start of this year _ a month after the
cable-compatible digital TVs were supposed to have reached the
stores _ Kennard said he was fed up with the delays and issued his
warning. Solve the problem by April, he said, or the FCC will solve
it for you.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1998, the two industries chose which sort of cable
they would use, a digital connector known as Firewire. On
Wednesday, almost 16 months later, they said they had worked out
the related software issues and the protocol for transmitting
on-screen program guides for the digital broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   But once again, they had not resolved the copy-protection
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro said once again that the industries would resolve it
soon. Meanwhile, he added, even without copy protection, digital-TV
viewers should be able to receive nonpremium cable fare using the
technology agreed upon so far. Starting now, he said, the
cable-compatible sets can be designed, and the copy protection
software can be added later in the design process, before the sets
reach the market.
</P>
<P>
   Others in the industry said that the sets should arrive in
stores 12 to 18 months from now (though the Sony Corp. says its
versions will be available this year.) But there is no guarantee
that Hollywood will agree to copy protection protocols in time.
</P>
<P>
   Most consumer-electronics companies have settled on a standard
known as 5C, for the five companies that devised it: Hitachi,
Intel, Matsushita Electric, Toshiba and Sony. It allows a movie to
be transmitted with a marker that will allow it to be copied
freely, copied just once or not copied at all. Hollywood and the
cable companies must agree on how movies are to be marked.
</P>
<P>
   The cable industry has added 5C as the standard for its
digital-cable boxes, and several television manufacturers are
building it into their sets. But the major Hollywood studios have
not agreed on whether or how the 5C system will be used.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with executives at two studios show widespread
disagreement on the issue. 20th Century Fox, for example, the
studio owned by News Corp., does not think 5C is secure enough.
Other studio executives who may be comfortable with the technology
resent the idea that the industries have decided to deploy it
before they have worked out arrangements with the studios.
</P>
<P>
   Some studios, one senior executive said, ``are concerned that
this is being rolled out before all the standards have been set,
and that gives them much less flexibility in negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   One senior electronics executive said his industry was
essentially playing chicken with Hollywood. ``They will just have
to take 5C,'' he said. ``We're forcing the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with all that still in play, Kennard praised the industries
on Wednesday, saying their announcement would ``jump-start the
digital revolution for television.'' In his interview, he also
vowed to ``keep pressing them on this.''
</P>
<P>
   Some others were less enthusiastic. Susan Ness, an FCC
commissioner, said, ``We can't declare victory when the game's only
at halftime.'' And the National Association of Broadcasters, which
has been agitating about this issue for years because its member
stations want their programs to be available to cable subscribers,
said: ``The agreement is a sham.''

OLD-FASHIONED REPORTING, NEW MEDIUM 
LINDBERGHS EXPRESS DISMAY OVER BIOGRAPHY

<P>
   In many ways, the world-beating scoop last week by
TheSmokingGun.com, which revealed that the ``Who Wants to Marry a
Multimillionaire?'' groom, Rick Rockwell, was once the subject of a
restraining order, says a lot about the fledgling Internet's place
in the new order of American journalism.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also a classic tale of basic gumshoe reporting. The
site, largely unrecognized until its ``Multimillionaire'' score, is
edited by William Bastone, 38, an investigative reporter for The
Village Voice, and Daniel Green, 36, a freelance reporter and
editor.
</P>
<P>
   Bastone said he and Green started the Web site three years ago
on a monthly budget of about $500 and the idea that it would be a
good place to display the raw materials of journalism _ police
reports, lawsuits, affidavits and the like. They discovered they
could greatly increase traffic by displaying documents from major
news stories _ for example, the recent arrest of Sean Combs _ and
by persuading news sites, search engines and Web portals to set up
links to the site.
</P>
<P>
   Their work on the Rockwell case started as most investigative
projects do: a gut feeling. A friend told Green that he thought the
groom was worth a closer look, and Green took it from there. He
searched Web sites and directories, and one person he interviewed
suggested he check court files in California.
</P>
<P>
   Green looked in San Diego, where Rockwell lives, and found
nothing. But he figured that since Rockwell had been an
entertainer, he must have spent time in Los Angeles, and there he
found the 14-page restraining order that had been imposed on
Rockwell. Then he confirmed that the Rockwell in the court document
was the same one on the Fox television show.
</P>
<P>
   An article was posted on the site with the documents and then
daily newspapers were informed. The page was cited in several news
accounts and traffic soared, with more than 1 million visitors to
the site in one day, usually what the site attracts in a month.
</P>
<P>
   The site's profile has grown since it was incorporated in 1998.
Playboy.com established a link to it, and it does regular features
in New York magazine. An advertising company now sells banner
space, and the site had 1999 revenue of $60,000 to $70,000. And the
owners are now on to other stories. On Thursday, they offered a
look at Darryl Strawberry's probation report.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to come up with our second act,'' Bastone said
with a laugh. ``We're telling people we might take a hard look at
that kid on `Malcolm in the Middle.'''

   Lindberghs Express Dismay Over Biography
</P>
<P>
   At 99 and immobilized by strokes, Anne Morrow Lindbergh's is a
voice that is silent on the topic of an unauthorized biography that
explores her peripatetic life and marriage to the aviation pioneer
Charles A. Lindbergh.
</P>
<P>
   Not so the Lindbergh family, which has let it be known that they
are so disturbed with the form of Susan Hertog's recently published
book, ``Anne Morrow Lindbergh: Her Life'' (Nan A. Talese/Doubleday)
that they moved to prevent the author from using any excerpts from
Lindbergh's previously published diaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a great deal of anger and resentment,'' said
Reeve Lindbergh, the youngest daughter of the Lindberghs, who noted
that she had not read the book but was upset that Hertog had
published a traditional biography instead of a ``feminist study''
of the women and relatives in the aviator's life. Her mother, she
said, did not want a biography written about her during her
lifetime and surely would not have cooperated in such an effort.
</P>
<P>
   Those objections are also shared by another biographer, A. Scott
Berg, who said that when he undertook his long research project
about Charles Lindbergh with the support of the family he was
assured that Hertog was doing a book on ``the Lindbergh women.''
</P>
<P>
   Berg said that if the framework of the book had changed, Hertog
should have approached the family to explain what she was doing.
</P>
<P>
   For Hertog, the family's resistance meant that she had to
rewrite portions of the book to excise diary entries, delaying
publication of her first book for almost two months until late in
the Christmas season.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the very beginning,'' she said, ``I told the Lindberghs
that I was writing a biography, and in fact Reeve was very
encouraging and introduced me to her mother, and Mrs. Lindbergh
invited me back 10 times, and we have years of correspondence.''
</P>
<P>
   She offers documents showing that in 1992, she sent a letter to
Reeve Lindbergh describing the thrill of obtaining a contract ``for
my biography of your mother.'' Hertog said the family may have
objected to her interpretations of the Lindberghs' political views
or her description of ``Charles' six-year extramarital relationship
with another woman, which I was able to verify.''

   Quiz Show Draws More Women Contestants
</P>
<P>
   Still concerned that lack of diversity among the contestants is
the one flaw in the otherwise idyllic success of ``Who Wants to Be
a Millionaire,'' Michael Davies, the show's executive producer,
said he was gratified by the initial results of an on-air appeal
for more women and minority viewers to enter the selection process.
</P>
<P>
   After Sunday night, he was edging toward elation. For the first
time, the show featured all female contestants, four in all.
</P>
<P>
   That raised the proportion of women contestants since the appeal
to almost 40 percent. It had been only about 11 percent before Feb.
1, the night the show's host, Regis Philbin, made the unusual
announcement that the program was encouraging people who were not
white males to sign up.
</P>
<P>
   The show still has not had a single black make it to the chair
opposite Philbin, though the overall number of contestants has now
reached 119. Davies acknowledged he was ``fairly depressed'' about
the lack of racial diversity on the show, but was more hopeful than
ever because, since the February appeal, two blacks have been among
the 10 finalists who compete during the show to make to it to the
``hot seat.''
</P>
<P>
   Only three had made it that far during the show's first three
months on the air.
</P>
<P>
   Davies said he had retailored some of the show's questions to
include what he called more ``female material.'' This has included
more female names among those that contestants have been asked to
arrange in some form of chronological order to make it to the
actual game. Similarly, he said, the questions have been adjusted
in subtle ways to include names from black culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to try to do more,'' Davies said. ``I think this
problem will end soon.''

 &HT;    McCAIN MOUNTS VIRGINIA DRIVE
 &HT;    Moving in the Washington (w) and political (p) categories.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALEXANDRIA, Va. - Sen. John McCain of Arizona stepped up his
presidential campaigning in Virginia on Sunday in an effort to hand
Texas Gov. George W. Bush his first Republican primary defeat in
the South.
</P>
<P>
   With a major TV advertising campaign and last-minute personal
appearances, McCain sought to bring core Republican conservatives
into the coalition of moderates, veterans and high-tech interests
that have lifted his presidential campaign to unexpected heights.
</P>
<P>
   His TV ad, running in the northern Virginia, the state's most
populous region, presented him as ``a proud Reagan Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the McCain surge, Bush enjoys the backing of the GOP
establishment in Virginia, including Gov. James Gilmore, Sen. John
Warner and former Gov. George Allen, the most popular figure in
state Republican circles and a current Senate candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor also has a county-by-county organization in
Virginia that is focusing on mustering the core Republican vote.
</P>
<P>
   The state GOP's first open and binding presidential primary was
supposed to have been little more than a victory lap for Bush. In
his previous Southern encounter with McCain in South Carolina, the
Texas governor won convincingly.
</P>
<P>
   Since McCain's surprise victory in Michigan last week, however,
the polls in Virginia have narrowed, prompting a major push by
McCain in the final days before Tuesday's voting. A recent poll
shows Bush's once-commanding lead over McCain narrowing to 8
points.
</P>
<P>
   And the round of local TV appearances by McCain Sunday morning
suggested a bruising battle in the Old Dominion state.
</P>
<P>
   Unapologetic, McCain said he would continue using a telephone
campaign against Bush that criticizes the Texas governor for
speaking at the conservative Christian Bob Jones University and not
disavowing anti-Catholic statements of its founder.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to tell the facts,'' McCain said in an
interview on WRC-TV in Washington. ``If Gov. Bush wishes to go to
Bob Jones University ...peopleople should know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's chief campaign strategist, Karl Rove, appearing on
Fox-TV's ``Fox News Sunday,'' called the McCain campaign's
telephone calls ``a sleazy, anonymous smear phone campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   But McCain sought to make an issue of telephone calls made in
Michigan by the Virginia-based tele-evangelist Pat Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of thing we will have nothing to do with,'' McCain
said of the prerecorded Robertson calls, which referred to his
campaign chairman, Warren Rudman, as ``a vicious bigot.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-six nominating convention delegates are at stake in the
Virginia primary. But, more importantly, Virginia can help provide
the winner with momentum for Super Tuesday contests in California,
New York and 10 other states on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was traveling to Seattle on Sunday. Washington's primary
also is Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain adjusted his schedule in an effort to capitalize on
narrowing polls in Virginia. He had a rally outside his campaign
headquarters in Alexandria before traveling to Virginia Beach.
</P>
<P>
   In previous primaries, McCain has benefited from overwhelming
support from independent and Democratic-leaning voters.
</P>
<P>
   But in Virginia, he is trying to court a core of about 300,000
party regulars by claiming the mantle of Ronald Reagan, the
political icon of the modern Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain strategy in Virginia has also focused on independents
and Democratic leaning voters of northern Virginia, where a
high-tech industry has grown up around the America On Line
headquarters, and military veterans in the coastal areas.

DIGITAL COMMERCE: THE CONSUMER INTERNET MARKET AND ITS B2B COUSIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DENISE CARUSO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The latest entrant in the Internet economy's continuing game of
buzzword bingo is ``business to business,'' predictably shortened
to ``B2B.''
</P>
<P>
   B2B is just what the name implies: businesses selling to other
businesses, using the Internet to cut transaction costs and
increase efficiencies. It is a $1.76 billion market that, according
to Forrester Research, will reach more than $1 trillion in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Those of us who have been around the industry since before
Internet Time welcome this new fixation _ actually, we welcome
anything remotely resembling focus in this wacky business
environment _ but we also find it amusing, in that Yogi Berra,
``deja vu all over again'' kind of way.
</P>
<P>
   And we are a little wistful that it did not happen sooner.
Because a good case can be made from even the most recent past that
any successful consumer technology must first be forged in the hot
fire of the business environment. That has not been the strategy
employed by many consumer e-commerce and media companies.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1990, the PC industry pioneer David E. Liddle opened the
inaugural Digital World conference _ an event based on the radical
notion that media, communications and digital technology were on
the verge of converging _ with a caveat: to leapfrog the stolid
business market for the glittering horizon of a consumer market was
not a wise strategy.
</P>
<P>
   That is because all technology-based consumer goods, he said,
must go through three phases.
</P>
<P>
   The first is an appeal to enthusiasts who love the technology
for its own sake.
</P>
<P>
   In the second phase, which would be today's B2B, someone figures
out how to use the technology in his or her work.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this stage, controls start to become standard _ it is
important that it works in the way you expect it to,'' he said.
``There's kind of a social covenant between the producer and buyer
where your investment is repaid in terms of productivity or some
other valued metric.''
</P>
<P>
   Cameras and cars and PCs, for example, all started their life
cycles with as many variations as there were manufacturers. As
people started using them for work, manufacturers began migrating
shutters and gas pedals and menu bars to predictable, if not
standardized, locations where they behaved in mostly predictable
ways.
</P>
<P>
   A product only moves to the third, or consumer, phase, Liddle
said, when it becomes cheap and widely available, no longer just a
tool of someone's trade, but a discretionary purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Liddle was recently nominated to the board of The New York Times
Co.
</P>
<P>
   B2B products that succeeded in the consumer market were able to
do so because manufacturers took seriously the social covenant with
their business customers, working to provide them with tangible
value. The resulting standards made the products both easier to use
and cheaper to build, thus more attractive to a mass market.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the technology standards embraced by the largely
consumer-focused Internet industry have long been in place. Today's
Windows-based operating systems, along with TCP/IP, the Internet
protocol, and HTML, the lingua franca of the Web, are ubiquitous.
And yet, the consumer Internet market is something of a mess.
</P>
<P>
   Hackers are waging war on consumer Web sites, stealing credit
card numbers, planting destructive software on the computers of
unwilling accomplices. Why? Because they can; there was no
financial incentive for anyone to invest early in the technologies
and common-sense customer care that would have kept them out.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, successful Internet companies like Amazon.com,
eBay, RealNetworks and Microsoft are electronically spying on
people's browsing habits, sometimes installing software on
consumers' computers without permission. Some companies even track
their customers' movements through the network, collecting and
selling personal information.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because they can, and because consumers have not yet
realized the need or exercised sufficient market influence to stop
them.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, financial institutions are lobbying Congress for
``digital signature'' legislation that would release them from
traditional requirements to provide consumers with legal documents
on paper. Instead, the companies want to deliver documents like
mortgage lending agreements online. Why? Because it would cut
costs.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that absent their possession of such documents _ for
whatever reason _ consumers relinquish their claim to legal
recourse.
</P>
<P>
   And so it goes. While consumers are thus besieged, it seems that
the only social covenant held truly sacred by many consumer Net
companies is with their investment bankers.
</P>
<P>
   Consider how things change in the business-to-business Internet.
</P>
<P>
   For example, B2B companies are ``certainly going to make money
off information'' in much the same way that today's consumer
companies hope to by siphoning personal data, says Larry Downes, an
expert in business-to-business practices on the Internet and the
co-author of the book ``Unleashing the Killer App,'' published by
the Harvard Business School Press, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you've captured 40 percent of a virtual commodities
market,'' Downes points out, ``you can collect some very
interesting data about your customers to create future products.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference, he says, is that the B2B strategy is based on
enhancing, not demolishing, customer relationships.
</P>
<P>
   ``You aren't stealing information from your customers; you
aren't violating their rights,'' he says. ``You're doing it to
serve them. These B2B communities are relatively small, so they are
very sensitive about doing things that would be against the
interest of their customers.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, he says, America Online or Yahoo ``have millions of
transient customers who turn over very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Downes says B2B companies' smaller scales means their
reputations are much more valuable than the number of transactions
they do.
</P>
<P>
   This is apparently not so for consumer Internet companies. In
the hopes of eking out another book or CD purchase or two by
sacrificing their customers' privacy, or saving a little money by
not having to mail out legal notices or adequately secure their
systems, they seem more than willing to risk the wrath of _ and
eventual abandonment by _ their customers.
</P>
<P>
   But Downes is convinced it will not be long before people find a
way to create a kind of ``consumer proxy'' on the Internet _ their
own little B2B application, as it were. Then watch how quickly the
consumer Internet moves to mend its ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business-to-consumer would be business-to business if
consumers were speaking with one voice,'' says Downes. ``Right now
it doesn't operate that way, but when people can band together as
consumers and act on their collective will, then these companies
won't be able to afford the risk.''

OMNICOM AND GREY SHORE UP FAST-GROWING MEDIA BUSINESSES WITH
REORGANIZATIONS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two giant agency companies _ the Omnicom Group and Grey
Advertising Inc. _ are making changes in fields outside the realm
of traditional advertising. The moves are indicative of the
additional emphasis being placed on fast-growing services like
media as well as the increasing importance of segments of the mass
market like youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   On the media front, Omnicom, the world's largest agency company
in revenue and second largest in billings, will reorganize its
various planning and buying shops, which handle media accounts with
total billings estimated at $17.5 billion to $18 billion, into two
worldwide networks. The centerpiece of the realignment, to be
formally announced Monday, is the amalgamation in the United States
of many media tasks that had been handled separately at the three
largest Omnicom agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're building two networks with different cultures,'' said
Daryl Simm, chief executive at the Omnicom Media Group in New York,
the media division of Omnicom. He offered a preview of the plans in
a telephone interview on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   One network, Optimum Media Direction, ``will reflect the
heritage and scale of our global advertising agencies, with a
sensibility of service,'' Simm said, adding that the other, PhD,
``will reflect the culture of our independent and entrepreneurial
media companies.''
</P>
<P>
   The reorganization creates an American unit for Optimum Media
Direction, named OMD USA, that will pool resources like broadcast
media buying and research for BBDO Worldwide, DDB Worldwide and the
TBWA/Chiat/Day unit of TBWA Worldwide. OMD USA will buy commercial
time on local and national television and radio outlets with
billings estimated at $4.1 billion; total Optimum Media billings
are estimated at $15 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Optimum Media began in Europe in 1996 and now operates in 30
countries including Australia, Britain, Canada, France, Germany,
Hong Kong and Italy. Its expansion to the United States had been
widely anticipated but was delayed amid discussions that lasted
about a year regarding its scope and structure.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to keep in mind we have about 90 clients'' coming
together at OMD USA, Simm said. ``Steve, Dan and Annette spent what
I would say is a very careful amount of time to make sure each was
on board.''
</P>
<P>
   That reference was to the three executives being named to top
posts at OMD USA. Steve Grubbs, 47, executive vice president for
national television buying at BBDO New York, will be managing
partner and chief executive. Dan Rank, 45, who had been director
for local and national broadcast at Optimum Media, the DDB media
unit, will be managing partner for national broadcast. And Annette
Cerbone, 46, who had been in charge of the corporate media group at
TBWA/Chiat/Day, will be managing partner for local broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   All told, about 250 employees of BBDO, DDB and TBWA/Chiat/Day
will join OMD USA. The employees at the three agencies who handle
media planning will remain at their respective agencies, as will
executives like Page Thompson, worldwide media director and
president of Optimum Media at DDB, and Monica Karo, corporate media
director at TBWA/Chiat/Day.
</P>
<P>
   Trade publications had speculated that OMD USA would also take
on the media buying functions for the smaller Omnicom American
agencies like GSD&AMP; M in Austin, Texas; Goodby, Silverstein &AMP;
Partners in San Francisco; and Martin/Williams in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   That, however, is not the case, Simm said, adding that the
status of the media operations of those agencies ``remains
unchanged.'' He declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   The other media network, PhD, will oversee autonomous agencies
like Advanswers and Creative Media in the United States, Harrison
Young Pesonen &AMP; Newell in Canada and New PHD in Britain. David
Pattison, 43, who had been chief executive at New PHD in London,
will be chief executive at PhD.
</P>
<P>
   The American agencies that will be part of PhD handle media
chores on accounts with billings estimated at $1.5 billion; total
PhD billings are estimated at $2.5 billion to $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to Grey, the world's eighth-largest agency company in
revenue and ninth-largest in billings, two specialty units are
being merged to form an agency with 110 employees handling accounts
with estimated billings of $310 million for clients like GT
Interactive, SFX Entertainment and Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Grey Entertainment, founded in 1974, which specializes in
entertainment marketing, is being merged with G Whiz, founded in
July 1999, which specializes in marketing to children and
teen-agers. The merged agency will be named _ what else? _ G Whiz
Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, a merger of two such disparate shops seems as
logical as merging agencies devoted to, say, health care
advertising and direct marketing. But the combination makes sense,
said Edward H. Meyer, chairman, president and chief executive at
Grey, because ``today, much of entertainment marketing is targeted
to teens, kids and young adults.''
</P>
<P>
   At G Whiz Entertainment, Barbara Martino, 38, will be president
and chief executive and Gerry Logue, 45, will be vice chairman. She
had been president at G Whiz, the smaller of the two agencies, and
he had been president at Grey Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   The entertainment marketing operations of the merged agency will
be overseen by Rob Jacobson, 35, senior vice president and senior
creative director, and Steven Yorra, 41, senior vice president and
account services director. Both had held similar posts at Grey
Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   The general youth marketing operations of G Whiz Entertainment
will be overseen by Brett Howlett, 38, senior vice president and
creative director, and Doug Zarkin, 29, vice president for client
services. Both had held similar posts at G Whiz.

   ``ROBIN HOOD WAS RIGHT'' &QL; 
By Chuck Collins and Pam Rogers (Norton, $28.95) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wait! Don't mail those checks yet. Collins and Rogers have
advice about charitable giving that will help you donate your money
with thought and purpose rather than with guilt and self-interest.
Americans gave $109 billion to charity last year, yet one in four
top earners gave nothing, the wealthy gave smaller portions of
their assets than did the poor, and only 13 percent of the money
went to direct public benefit through human service programs (most
went to churches, the arts, elite private universities and
hospitals). Here, the authors attempt to redefine modern
philanthropy in order to affect change _ instead of focusing on the
immediate symptoms of social or economic problems, they want our
dollars to chip away at the CAUSES of those problems. Collins and
Rogers are dedicated, energetic, knowledgeable and frankly, a bit
daunting in their zeal. But you'll learn something if you listen to
them. As Alfre Woodard writes in her preface, ``Robin Hood was
right. And he had a damn good time.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
``HAWKE'S COVE'' &QL; 
By Susan Wilson (Pocket, $23.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here's one for the ``Bridges of Madison County'' crowd, another
novel that attempts to parlay yearning and denial into a bad but
bittersweet bestseller. A young journal-keeping woman named Vangie
retreats to her grandmother's farm in a small coastal town (note
the title) to recover from the death of her baby and to wait for
news of her husband, who is overseas fighting in World War II. It's
not long before a down-on-his-luck stranger named Joe shows up, and
we know what that means. Vangie hires him to work on the farm, they
drink tea and lemonade, they watch each other through lowered
lashes, they swim (``There is,'' Wilson writes, ``a strange
intimacy in swimming . . .''), she spreads ointment on his
blistered hands. When Vangie's husband is declared missing in
action, she and Joe have a hot night together in the hayloft, but
word comes the very next morning that the husband is still alive.
Denial commences. Years pass. Violins play. Their children grow up
and get nosey. Have you been here before? You betcha. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``FOREVER LIESL'' &QL; 
By Charmian Carr (Viking, $23.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We were hoping to find some dirt here, but according to Carr,
there was precious little of it on the set of ``The Sound of
Music.'' Until now, the only relief from the unrelenting sweetness
of the film was an anecdote about Christopher Plummer, who played
Baron von Trapp and who allegedly hated the movie so much he called
it ``The Sound of Mucus.'' But Carr, who played the von Trapp
daughter Liesl, debunks that story, saying that Plummer himself
denies it (he did despise the song ``Edelweiss'' and tried to have
it tossed from the film). Mostly, this book is a cheerful report on
a cheerful experience, with some funny moments on the side. When
she attended the Mexican premiere (the film was called ``La Novicia
Rebelde,'' or ``The Rebellious Novice''), the unsuspecting Carr was
taken to a bullfight. The matador dedicated the bull to her, and
she watched in horror as the bull was tormented by the matador and
the matador was then run over by the bull. She visited the matador
in the hospital, as Liesl certainly would have done if she'd been
there. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``THE VISION OF EMMA BLAU'' &QL; 
By Ursula Hegi (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hegi's new novel is a family saga that begins in the early
1900s, when scrappy teenager Stefan Blau comes to America from
Germany (specifically from Burgdorf, which figures into Hegi's
earlier books, ``Stones From the River'' and ``Floating in My
Mother's Palm''), and sets out to make his fortune. After a fire in
the New York restaurant where he works, he leaves the city and goes
to a small town in New Hampshire because a fellow immigrant has
told him it reminded him of Germany. There, Stefan marries twice
and loses both wives to the births of his children before he
returns to Burgdorf to bring back and marry Helene Montag, his
childhood friend and the character through which Hegi explores the
difficult adjustment of the German immigrant. Serving as a backdrop
for the story is the Wasserburg, the grand and glorious apartment
building that Stefan builds, which reflects the fortunes of his
family. Hegi's characterization is superb, part of a story that is
as well-constructed as the Wasserburg itself.  &QL;

IBM TO INTRODUCE ADVANCE IN CHIP MANUFACTURING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (rk) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Technologists for International Business Machines Corp. will
describe new details this week of a next-generation chip-making
system that uses beams of electrons, rather than lightwaves, to
etch circuits onto chips.
</P>
<P>
   The company believes the technology will make it possible in the
future to shrink individual circuits to a size nearly as small as
atoms.
</P>
<P>
   The new system, which IBM is developing in cooperation with
Nikon Corp., has created excitement in the semiconductor industry
as word of it has spread in recent months. There have been growing
concerns that current lithographic systems _ which project
lightwaves to etch circuit patterns on silicon wafers _ may be
reaching fundamental physical limits.
</P>
<P>
   The new details will be presented by Hans C. Pfeiffer, who is an
IBM researcher at the company's semiconductor research center in
East Fishkill, N.Y. He will make his report at an industry
conference sponsored by SPIE, the International Society for Optical
Engineering, this week in Santa Clara, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Although the semiconductor industry has already developed
techniques for using ever-shortening wavelengths of light to reduce
circuit size in the chip-making process, each new generation has
required tremendous engineering feats. The cost of lightwave
etching is rising to levels that may soon be prohibitive.
</P>
<P>
   Electron beam systems have been explored in chip-making research
efforts for decades. But the new IBM system, which is known as
Prevail, for Projection Reduction Exposure With Variable Axis
Immersion Lenses, could represent a significant advance in
throughput _ the speed at which silicon wafers can be processed.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, IBM has used so-called e-beam manufacturing systems
in making specialized semiconductor chips used in its mainframe
computers. But the company has acknowledged that those systems
could not process wafers quickly enough to be economically viable
in mainstream chip applications.
</P>
<P>
   With lightwave etching, the circuitry can be projected at once
onto the surface of the chip. With electron-beam etching, past
systems have required millions of circuits to be etched, in effect,
a line at a time. But IBM's new system can project a pattern of
electrons to etch many lines of circuits simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been thinking very hard about the next big step
forward in throughput,'' Pfeiffer said in a telephone interview on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance with Nikon was announced last year after Nikon
executives expressed confidence the technology could be
successfully commercialized.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started working with Nikon they were very concerned
that this would ultimately not work out and they would be
embarrassed,'' Pfeiffer said. ``Only when we reached certain levels
of performance were they ready to announce this to the world.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged the two companies had not yet completed a
working model based on their technical advances, but said he
believed such a step was now possible.
</P>
<P>
   IBM and Nikon are in a race in this field with Lucent
Technologies. Lucent is partnering with the semiconductor equipment
makers Applied Materials and ASM Lithography NV to build a similar
electron beam system, which is named Scalpel.
</P>
<P>
   The systems function in a manner similar to _ but much more
sophisticated than _ the electron beam technology that is used to
rapidly scan the images appearing on television screens and desktop
computer monitors. The systems could advance quickly enough to
begin to play a role within the next two generations of chip-making
gear, according to IBM officials.
</P>
<P>
   That would be a faster transition than has been assumed until
now by the semiconductor industry, which has planned for lightwave
etching to be the principal technology through the next two and
possibly three generations of semiconductor manufacturing,
beginning in 2007.
</P>
<P>
   ``Optical is hitting real-world limits,'' said Richard Doherty,
the president of Envisioneering, a Seaford, N.Y., computer industry
consulting firm. ``Ultimately, electron beam systems will be a
replacement technology.''
</P>
<P>
   The IBM-Nikon Prevail system is based on the ability to steer a
small electron beam through a series of magnetic lenses that can
achieve the same ultrasharp resolution on the edges of the
projection field as in the center of the field.
</P>
<P>
   Making a working system requires the ability to control a
remarkable dance in which the wafer and the mask containing the
circuit pattern are continuously moved while the electron beam is
switched on and off as it shifts from circuit to circuit.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the new romantic comedy ``Grapevine,'' a group of thirtyish,
preternaturally good-looking men and women live in Miami, gaze
directly into the camera and explain the tangled, ever-changing
lines of love and friendship that connect them. What they don't say
is: We are so self-absorbed we make the women of ``Sex in the
City'' look like a band of Mother Teresas.
</P>
<P>
   There's something to be said for self-absorption, of course; if
a character doesn't like himself, who will? But it's hard to build
a series around relentless navel gazing and a narrative gimmick
that creates more talk than action.
</P>
<P>
   The show's creator, writer and director, David Frankel, has
given himself a tricky high-wire act. That act works with
effortless charm whenever Steven Eckholdt is on screen as the
central character, a restaurant owner named David. And the entire
show tumbles off the wire as soon as his character disappears.
</P>
<P>
   Eckholdt (who played the friend who lived in Los Angeles in last
year's smart but failed sitcom ``It's Like You Know'') is so
winning he almost rescues the series from itself. At the start he
looks into the camera, gives a warm but slightly abashed smile and
tells us about Susan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Susie's elevator doesn't always go all the way to the
penthouse,'' he says. ``She happens to be the marketing director of
a cruise line, but could easily have been a clown. I've been in
love with her since the day we met.'' Obviously he finds those
qualities more charming than most viewers will, but we're convinced
that he's convinced, which makes him engaging and likable even when
he's wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The other characters and their extended circle of guest friends
(who also talk to the camera), can become unintentionally annoying,
though. Susan (Kristy Swanson) really is an airhead and a meddler
in other people's lives. Matt (David Sutcliffe), a hotel manager
who doesn't appear until next week's episode, is colorless. Hardest
to take is David's brother, Thumper (George Eads), a sports
broadcaster described by David as a guy with no professional
qualifications beyond being ``handsome, charming'' and full of hot
air.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God for television,'' says Thumper, whose job on the
local news allows his second career as a womanizer to flourish.
Let's face it, viewers are never going to believe in a character
named Thumper unless he's Bambi's pal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grapevine'' is a good sign that CBS is at least trying to
shake its geezer image, but its sense of hipness is tame. Where
``Sex in the City'' takes its characters' upscale lives and
arrogance for granted without apologies, ``Grapevine'' assumes an
ingratiating tone. And despite its MTV speed, the dialogue is often
a staid he said, she said descended from ``When Harry Met Sally.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I came this close to kissing her,'' David tells the camera
about Susan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came this close to slapping him,'' she says of the same
moment.
</P>
<P>
   Three episodes of the series' scheduled six-week run were
available for review. Next week Thumper dates Matt's ex-wife,
Yancy, until Susan tells Matt to give the marriage another try, but
not before she has fixed up Matt with Gina, who once had a bad
experience with Thumper. Despite its sporadic charm and captivating
leading actor, ``Grapevine'' doesn't give viewers a good enough
reason to follow this group as it goes around in circles.

BRITAIN'S PRUDENTIAL CONSIDERS BID FOR RIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Prudential PLC, the British insurance company, is
considering a bid of as much as 4 billion pounds, or $6.4 billion,
for its rival, the Equitable Life Assurance Society, executives
close to the company said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Prudential is weighing its options after a rash of consolidation
in the insurance industry in Britain including the $12 billion
merger of CGU PLC. and Norwich Union PLC last week, which created
an insurance giant that comes close to surpassing Prudential as
Britain's largest insurer.
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear when Prudential might approach Equitable
Life, but the executives noted that no bid was imminent and that
the company could still decide to abandon the effort.
</P>
<P>
   Financial services companies and insurers throughout Europe are
scrambling to find merger partners to cut costs and to be able to
add size and muscle to repel bids from larger institutions. Though
Prudential ranks as Britain's largest insurer, it remains tiny
compared with some of its European counterparts like Allianz of
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Equitable Life might have became a ripe target
last week after it lost an all important appeal in High Court here
that effectively forces the company to pay as much as $324 million
for guaranteed annuities.
</P>
<P>
   Prudential is going through a transition of its own as Jonathan
Bloomer assumes the chief executive post, replacing Peter Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomer, who was the company's chief financial officer, is keen
to shake up Prudential, an executive close to the company said.
Bloomer was responsible for leading the creation of Egg, an
Internet bank, in 1998 that Prudential financed and is now worth
$6.4 billion. Just this week Prudential announced that it planned
to sell a quarter of its stake in Egg in a initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   Executives close to Prudential said it had hired Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter as its adviser, though a spokesman for the investment
bank declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Prudential could not be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Nash, managing director of Equitable Life told Bloomberg
News he was unaware of Prudential's interest. ``We have had no
approach from the Prudential and would not welcome one,'' he said.
``Our belief is that mutuality is in the best interests of our
members.'' News of a possible bid was reported today in several
British papers.

A HARD-TAPPING TRIBUTE, HOBBYHORSES INCLUDED 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bill Irwin, as urbane a clown as ever, did a Whoopi
Goldberg, changing costumes between acts. While host of a program
aptly titled ``The Elegance of Tap and the Comedy of Tap,'' he also
pretended he could tap dance only with the aid of kneepads and a
harness that kept him from toppling over the nonexistent
footlights.
</P>
<P>
   Among his co-conspirators last Friday night at Town Hall were a
trio of Russians encased in hobbyhorses who cantered around
hilariously and gleefully. Buster Brown, at 86 still the master
hoofer, added his elegant skimming steps. Jennie Nau, an
eighth-grader from Florida, brought cheerleader freshness to the
toe dancing she did in her tap shoes.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Committee to Celebrate National Tap Dance Day,
headed by Al Heyward and Carl Schlesinger of the New York
Foundation for the Arts, organized the one-night program, a prelude
to the annual Tap Extravaganza at Town Hall on May 28.
</P>
<P>
   Gimmicks were part of the evening, but that is par for the
course. Tap is not only style and technique, it is also a form of
personalized expression.
</P>
<P>
   The wild-ranging event last Friday was part of a lively
ethnic-dance series being presented by Town Hall. The inclusion of
tap is no surprise. In Europe tap is considered an ethnic export,
peculiarly American. The Russian trio learned from American tap
teachers in Moscow. Jerry Ames, the veteran performer whose silvery
rhythms, with Rolf Barnes at the piano, infused his class act, had
just returned from teaching in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin has been called a new vaudevillian, which means that he
has a healthy respect for the old vaudevillians and that he does
know how to tap, rubber-leg style. Brenda Bufalino, another
veteran, was his teacher. She put on her usual excellent display of
complex, close-to-the-ground rhythms.
</P>
<P>
   Loosely speaking, the evening was divided between those who
favor percussion tap, in which sound is primary, and those who set
the entire body in motion, often describing character. The
sophisticated jazz style of the Frank Owens Trio (Owens, Lisle
Atkinson and Bernice Brooks) provided most of the music.
</P>
<P>
   The choreography that Susan Hebach and Jennifer MacQueen did for
the Tap Collective had everyone (including Cintia Chamecki, Lynn
Schwab and Sherry Stregack) doing their arm-swinging thing.
Individuality in performance was everything. Jess Jurkovic, Tim
Ferguson and Terry Vinyard were their musicians.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel and McCain had Winston Samuel and Ralph McCain,
deceptively urban in their caps and T-shirts, delivering polished
cool in their singing and tap dialogue, choreographed by Luther
Fontaine. Nau took with relish to the high-kicking mix of ballet
and tap by Robin Dawn.
</P>
<P>
   The team of Sergey and Vasiliy consists of Sergey Kusyakov and
Vasiliy Myshletsov. They are wonderful clowns who went to circus
school in Moscow, and their comedy sacrifices nothing to basic
technique. Yelena Tishunova was the filly who joined them in
Myshletsov's choreography.
</P>
<P>
   Chamecki, a Brazilian, wore the heavy shoes of the current
percussion stylists but shared the fluency of her Brazilian
musicians, Tomas Marsh and Tisza Coelho. Nicole Hockenberry and Amy
Browne Smith, with Andy Wasserman at the piano, were sparkling,
wholesome dancers. Sam Seimiya offered a change of pace. He had an
extraordinary way with understatement, even while building up his
rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   Heather Cornell's choreography for Manhattan Tap, with Keith
Saunders as pianist, was a sure-fire hit. A sexy, hip-swinging
quartet, Charon Aldredge, Mari Fujibayashi, Rhythm Kaneko and
Olivia Rosenkrantz, offered a powerhouse display, which included a
chair-sitting number. Melissa Giattino and Richard Schwartz had a
winning zaniness in the musical comedy numbers choreographed by
Schwartz.
</P>
<P>
   Baraki Wilder, who succeeded Savion Glover in ``Bring In da
Noise, Bring In da Funk,'' made an unscheduled and virtuosic
appearance with a solo that introduced Jason Samuels. Samuels, a
big man with a big talent, gives the current new urban style and
its powerful steps his own unpredictability. Shoehorn (Michael
Conley) is more predictable simply because his specialty is a
signature, playing the saxophone as he taps. In all, it was a true
variety show, and Irwin did a fabulous job.

NEW LEADERS WANT A HIGHER VISIBILITY FOR A HARLEM MUSEUM 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By HOLLAND COTTER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The revitalization of 125th Street, one of
Manhattan's premier commercial boulevards, is well under way. Shops
are looking smart; Old Navy and Starbucks have arrived. And beyond
commerce there are major changes at one of the street's cultural
landmarks, the Studio Museum in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   The museum, just over three decades old, has long been a
respected if taken-for-granted presence in the New York art world.
But with the recent hiring of a new director and deputy director,
both from the center of the art world, its visibility is sure to
increase.
</P>
<P>
   The new director is Lowery Stokes Sims, 51, a curator of
20th-century art at the Metropolitan Museum of Art for more than 20
years. The new deputy director for exhibitions and programs is
Thelma Golden, 33, who resigned as a curator at the Whitney Museum
of American Art in 1998 when a curatorial restructuring put into
effect by its director, Maxwell L. Anderson, left her without a
slot.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction in the art world to the Studio Museum appointments has
ranged from high enthusiasm to consternation, which is not
surprising given the complex nature of the museum itself.
</P>
<P>
   Founded during the social upheavals of the 1960s, it is small
and ethnically defined. It is the country's only accredited museum
devoted to African-American art and as such is a monument to black
cultural accomplishment. It has documented the history of
African-American art when few other institutions were doing so and
has provided support for generations of artists who were excluded
from the larger art world.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years that larger world has begun, however
tentatively, to change. Mainstream museums have started to produce
historical shows of black art. Opportunities have broadened for
African-American art professionals. And after the multiculturalist
thinking of the 1990s, traditionally defined notions of racial
identity and ethnic group have been thrown into question.
</P>
<P>
   How a museum stays flexible enough to respond to these changes
while retaining a sense of its original mission will be one of the
museological questions of the new decade. The arrival of Sims and
Golden in Harlem comes at an interesting and difficult moment and
has already produced repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   To a museum named for a specific community, Sims and Golden
bring the glamour of high-powered institutions elsewhere. Their
hiring marks a potentially far-reaching break in the Studio
Museum's pattern of training and promoting its curators and
administrators from within.
</P>
<P>
   Their move uptown also leaves a significant gap in the art
world. The departure of Sims from the Metropolitan and Golden from
the Whitney has taken black curators from two of the city's leading
museums, which might well be seen as a step backward in the
far-from-resolved battle to break the art world's color barrier.
</P>
<P>
   For Sims and Golden the new assignments bring professional
challenges. Sims switches from her experience as a curator to the
untested role of fund-raiser, and both move from rich museums to
one of slender resources. At the same time the two women appear to
make a complementary team, well-balanced in their differences.
</P>
<P>
   Sims has a doctorate in modern art and a record of scholarly
shows at the Met, including surveys of Hans Hofmann and Stuart
Davis. She began there 27 years ago with a job in the education
department and gradually rose through the ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Golden, for whom things have happened faster, is well known
internationally for her intense interest in new art. (She was
originally scheduled to organize this year's Whitney Biennial.) She
is also still associated in many minds with her important Whitney
exhibition ``Black Male'' (1994-95), which played in provocative
ways with stereotypes of African-American masculinity.
</P>
<P>
   That show was critically pummeled but brought a large, racially
mixed audience to the Whitney. And it sparked rancorous reactions
among certain African-American artists, many of them of an older
generation, who found the deliberately ambiguous use of black
stereotypes irresponsible. Their anger was also directed at some
artists Golden favors, among them Kara Walker, whose potent wall
pieces include satirical images of slaves.
</P>
<P>
   The fracas had many ideological and personal elements.
Resentment was perhaps particularly keen because Golden's Whitney
job involved acquiring work, and she was perceived as being in a
position to help shape the historical picture of African-American
art in the museum, which she did.
</P>
<P>
   In addition she has a staunch and powerful ally in the art
patron Peter Norton, who provided much of the money for ``Black
Male'' and has put his weight as a collector behind the careers of
artists she endorsed. Norton resigned as a museum trustee when
Golden left, and she subsequently worked for his foundation as a
special projects curator.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   With her new appointment in Harlem, speculation rose that Norton
would become more involved with the Studio Museum. (He has been a
donor in the past.) Those observers who disagree with his taste and
hers and fear his influence view the alliance with apprehension.
Others, however, feel that his support of the new administration's
progressive aims would help bring a new vigor to the institution.
</P>
<P>
   When asked recently about the extent of Norton's future
involvement, Sims responded: ``Our board of trustees has four empty
chairs, and our nominating committee is considering candidates.
That's all I can say.''
</P>
<P>
   However that arrangement works out, Sims and Golden have already
begun to formulate ideas for the directions they mean to take.
</P>
<P>
   Sims says that certain essential features of the museum will not
change, notably the artist in residence program, which has been its
most consistently dynamic element. Many well-known artists got
their start here, including Chakaia Booker, Willie Birch, Leonardo
Drew, David Hammons, Kerry James Marshall, Alison Saar and Nari
Ward.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for extensive physical renovations, started by the
previous director, Kinshasha Holman Conwill, who is now director
emeritus, will go forward more or less as planned, with completion
projected for 2002. They include adding an auditorium, a cafe, a
new 125th Street facade and two galleries for the display of the
permanent collection.
</P>
<P>
   Sims and Golden both point to collection building as a priority.
``The trend of African-Americans getting involved in collecting and
donating art is just starting,'' Sims said, ``so it would behoove
the museum to catch that wave.'' A temporary exhibition of objects
from the holdings will open March 9.
</P>
<P>
   She said she also hoped to attract new audiences, both from the
neighborhood and beyond. The number of visitors annually is now
around 100,000, a fraction of what the Met can pull for one of its
blockbusters. ``There are plenty of people in New York who don't
know we exist,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That is one reason Golden is there. ``The first thing I wanted
to do was hire Thelma,'' Sims said. ``I gave her the title of
deputy director of exhibitions and programs because I wanted
programming to be strong. It has a big impact on membership.''
</P>
<P>
   Golden welcomes the role. ``I'm passionate about art and
artists,'' she said, ``and public programs to me are as important
as exhibitions. I'm as interested in music and literature and dance
as I am in the visual arts.'' She envisions the museum as a place
for performances, film screenings, literary readings, publishing
ventures and a historical archive, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She also plans to extend the museum's activities into the
diverse neighborhoods that make up Harlem. ``This is an amazing,
complicated community,'' she said. ``It's engaged in a commercial
revitalization, but it still struggles to define itself within the
city around issues of class and race. There are great spaces,
streets that feel like Europe and quirky, abandoned industrial
sites.'' She refers to the area collectively as ``a work of art in
the public realm.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of community was central to the Studio Museum's
origins. Sims and Golden are reappraising it. ``The museum was
founded when the mainstream wasn't paying attention to
African-American art. As an institution, it was a response to that
neglect,'' Sims said. ``Then in the 1980's the mainstream woke up
and started to take notice, so it's time for us to re-examine our
mission.''
</P>
<P>
   Golden said, ``I think all museums are community based, but how
the community is defined is wide.'' For her, the Studio Museum
belongs to ``the Harlem community, the African-American community,
the art community, the media community, the international
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Both women are considering ways to position the museum more
firmly in an international context. Sims mentions the possibility
of bringing portions of African biennials, such as those in Dakar
and South Africa, to New York.
</P>
<P>
   And both say that the definition of ``African-American artist''
needs to be broadened. Historically, Sims said, the term has been
so politicized that important kinds of art, notably abstraction,
have been overlooked, even disparaged in favor of more politically
specific work.
</P>
<P>
   Golden echoed the thinking of many young artists today when she
said: ``The definition of blackness as it relates to art has
changed and moved around. Exactly how it's changed hasn't quite
landed, though it is certainly a more self-defined category now.''
</P>
<P>
   While the museum's schedule will not fully reflect the thinking
of the new team for a couple of years, a few things have been
settled on. One is a scholarly survey of African-American
abstraction from the 1960s and '70s. Another, for this summer, is
the traveling show titled ``Beads, Body and Soul: Art and Light in
the Yoruba Universe,'' which the Studio Museum will share with the
Museum for African Art in SoHo.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the Studio Museum's expanding scope, African-American
art will remain its focus. ``There will always be a need for
institutions like this,'' Golden said, ``because they are special.
Like alternative spaces, they galvanize a certain kind of energy.
Some people might say of me that I've always worked within a museum
context, as if I were at an alternative space.''
</P>
<P>
   Sims added: ``African-American artists who are growing are going
to need to be nurtured. That's essentially what we have to do. And
despite the much-vaunted concept of globalism, I personally feel we
all still need a sense of our uniqueness on this planet, and that's
where a Studio Museum comes in, where people know that their
culture is being promoted and preserved, and where they can always
go.''

capsule reviews of new books:
</P>
<P>
   ``ROBIN HOOD WAS RIGHT'' &QL; 
By Chuck Collins and Pam Rogers (Norton, $28.95) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wait! Don't mail those checks yet. Collins and Rogers have
advice about charitable giving that will help you donate your money
with thought and purpose rather than with guilt and self-interest.
Americans gave $109 billion to charity last year, yet one in four
top earners gave nothing, the wealthy gave smaller portions of
their assets than did the poor, and only 13 percent of the money
went to direct public benefit through human service programs (most
went to churches, the arts, elite private universities and
hospitals). Here, the authors attempt to redefine modern
philanthropy in order to affect change _ instead of focusing on the
immediate symptoms of social or economic problems, they want our
dollars to chip away at the CAUSES of those problems. Collins and
Rogers are dedicated, energetic, knowledgeable and frankly, a bit
daunting in their zeal. But you'll learn something if you listen to
them. As Alfre Woodard writes in her preface, ``Robin Hood was
right. And he had a damn good time.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
``HAWKE'S COVE'' &QL; 
By Susan Wilson (Pocket, $23.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here's one for the ``Bridges of Madison County'' crowd, another
novel that attempts to parlay yearning and denial into a bad but
bittersweet bestseller. A young journal-keeping woman named Vangie
retreats to her grandmother's farm in a small coastal town (note
the title) to recover from the death of her baby and to wait for
news of her husband, who is overseas fighting in World War II. It's
not long before a down-on-his-luck stranger named Joe shows up, and
we know what that means. Vangie hires him to work on the farm, they
drink tea and lemonade, they watch each other through lowered
lashes, they swim (``There is,'' Wilson writes, ``a strange
intimacy in swimming . . .''), she spreads ointment on his
blistered hands. When Vangie's husband is declared missing in
action, she and Joe have a hot night together in the hayloft, but
word comes the very next morning that the husband is still alive.
Denial commences. Years pass. Violins play. Their children grow up
and get nosey. Have you been here before? You betcha. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``FOREVER LIESL'' &QL; 
By Charmian Carr (Viking, $23.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We were hoping to find some dirt here, but according to Carr,
there was precious little of it on the set of ``The Sound of
Music.'' Until now, the only relief from the unrelenting sweetness
of the film was an anecdote about Christopher Plummer, who played
Baron von Trapp and who allegedly hated the movie so much he called
it ``The Sound of Mucus.'' But Carr, who played the von Trapp
daughter Liesl, debunks that story, saying that Plummer himself
denies it (he did despise the song ``Edelweiss'' and tried to have
it tossed from the film). Mostly, this book is a cheerful report on
a cheerful experience, with some funny moments on the side. When
she attended the Mexican premiere (the film was called ``La Novicia
Rebelde,'' or ``The Rebellious Novice''), the unsuspecting Carr was
taken to a bullfight. The matador dedicated the bull to her, and
she watched in horror as the bull was tormented by the matador and
the matador was then run over by the bull. She visited the matador
in the hospital, as Liesl certainly would have done if she'd been
there. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``THE VISION OF EMMA BLAU'' &QL; 
By Ursula Hegi (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hegi's new novel is a family saga that begins in the early
1900s, when scrappy teenager Stefan Blau comes to America from
Germany (specifically from Burgdorf, which figures into Hegi's
earlier books, ``Stones From the River'' and ``Floating in My
Mother's Palm''), and sets out to make his fortune. After a fire in
the New York restaurant where he works, he leaves the city and goes
to a small town in New Hampshire because a fellow immigrant has
told him it reminded him of Germany. There, Stefan marries twice
and loses both wives to the births of his children before he
returns to Burgdorf to bring back and marry Helene Montag, his
childhood friend and the character through which Hegi explores the
difficult adjustment of the German immigrant. Serving as a backdrop
for the story is the Wasserburg, the grand and glorious apartment
building that Stefan builds, which reflects the fortunes of his
family. Hegi's characterization is superb, part of a story that is
as well-constructed as the Wasserburg itself.  &QL;

capsule reviews of new books:
</P>
<P>
   ``ROBIN HOOD WAS RIGHT'' &QL; 
By Chuck Collins and Pam Rogers (Norton, $28.95) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wait! Don't mail those checks yet. Collins and Rogers have
advice about charitable giving that will help you donate your money
with thought and purpose rather than with guilt and self-interest.
Americans gave $109 billion to charity last year, yet one in four
top earners gave nothing, the wealthy gave smaller portions of
their assets than did the poor, and only 13 percent of the money
went to direct public benefit through human service programs (most
went to churches, the arts, elite private universities and
hospitals). Here, the authors attempt to redefine modern
philanthropy in order to affect change _ instead of focusing on the
immediate symptoms of social or economic problems, they want our
dollars to chip away at the CAUSES of those problems. Collins and
Rogers are dedicated, energetic, knowledgeable and frankly, a bit
daunting in their zeal. But you'll learn something if you listen to
them. As Alfre Woodard writes in her preface, ``Robin Hood was
right. And he had a damn good time.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
``HAWKE'S COVE'' &QL; 
By Susan Wilson (Pocket, $23.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here's one for the ``Bridges of Madison County'' crowd, another
novel that attempts to parlay yearning and denial into a bad but
bittersweet bestseller. A young journal-keeping woman named Vangie
retreats to her grandmother's farm in a small coastal town (note
the title) to recover from the death of her baby and to wait for
news of her husband, who is overseas fighting in World War II. It's
not long before a down-on-his-luck stranger named Joe shows up, and
we know what that means. Vangie hires him to work on the farm, they
drink tea and lemonade, they watch each other through lowered
lashes, they swim (``There is,'' Wilson writes, ``a strange
intimacy in swimming . . .''), she spreads ointment on his
blistered hands. When Vangie's husband is declared missing in
action, she and Joe have a hot night together in the hayloft, but
word comes the very next morning that the husband is still alive.
Denial commences. Years pass. Violins play. Their children grow up
and get nosey. Have you been here before? You betcha. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``FOREVER LIESL'' &QL; 
By Charmian Carr (Viking, $23.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We were hoping to find some dirt here, but according to Carr,
there was precious little of it on the set of ``The Sound of
Music.'' Until now, the only relief from the unrelenting sweetness
of the film was an anecdote about Christopher Plummer, who played
Baron von Trapp and who allegedly hated the movie so much he called
it ``The Sound of Mucus.'' But Carr, who played the von Trapp
daughter Liesl, debunks that story, saying that Plummer himself
denies it (he did despise the song ``Edelweiss'' and tried to have
it tossed from the film). Mostly, this book is a cheerful report on
a cheerful experience, with some funny moments on the side. When
she attended the Mexican premiere (the film was called ``La Novicia
Rebelde,'' or ``The Rebellious Novice''), the unsuspecting Carr was
taken to a bullfight. The matador dedicated the bull to her, and
she watched in horror as the bull was tormented by the matador and
the matador was then run over by the bull. She visited the matador
in the hospital, as Liesl certainly would have done if she'd been
there. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``THE VISION OF EMMA BLAU'' &QL; 
By Ursula Hegi (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hegi's new novel is a family saga that begins in the early
1900s, when scrappy teenager Stefan Blau comes to America from
Germany (specifically from Burgdorf, which figures into Hegi's
earlier books, ``Stones From the River'' and ``Floating in My
Mother's Palm''), and sets out to make his fortune. After a fire in
the New York restaurant where he works, he leaves the city and goes
to a small town in New Hampshire because a fellow immigrant has
told him it reminded him of Germany. There, Stefan marries twice
and loses both wives to the births of his children before he
returns to Burgdorf to bring back and marry Helene Montag, his
childhood friend and the character through which Hegi explores the
difficult adjustment of the German immigrant. Serving as a backdrop
for the story is the Wasserburg, the grand and glorious apartment
building that Stefan builds, which reflects the fortunes of his
family. Hegi's characterization is superb, part of a story that is
as well-constructed as the Wasserburg itself.  &QL;

SERIOUS ABOUT RESEARCH, MICROSOFT HAS TIME FOR A GAME
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ When Rick Rashid, Microsoft's vice president
for research, utters, ``Set your phasers to stun,'' he isn't
preparing to launch one of his company's famous take-no-prisoners
assaults on some hapless competitor.
</P>
<P>
   A soft-spoken expert in operating systems design, Rashid joined
the company nine years ago when Microsoft's chief technology
officer, Nathan Myhrvold, set about to create a world-class
advanced research laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   But like many computer hackers, Rashid also happens to be a
passionate ``Star Trek'' devotee and hard-core computer gamer. So
in what little spare time is left to a Microsoft Corp. vice
president, Rashid began more than three years ago to satisfy his
hacker urges by programming an ambitious prototype for a computer
game.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, at its Gamestock event to be held here, Microsoft is
preparing to unveil the fruits of Rashid's hobby, a new ``massively
multiplayer'' Internet game called ``Allegiance.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a pure, unadulterated space-war game with impressive 3-D
graphics and a plot sure to seduce any Trekkie. The game, which
requires a powerful desktop computer, a fast graphics accelerator
card and an Internet connection, can be played simultaneously by
thousands of computer users.
</P>
<P>
   ``Allegiance'' also reveals something about the character of the
research laboratory. The lab was conceived by Microsoft's chairman
and co-founder, Bill Gates, in 1991 as a way to give the company a
competitive edge and to counter the widespread industry view of
Microsoft as an imitator rather than an innovator.
</P>
<P>
   More than just another product, ``Allegiance'' reveals the
freewheeling, uninhibited nature of a research center peopled by a
world-class collection of scientists, engineers and hackers.
</P>
<P>
   Today many of the world's computer laboratories are cutting
budgets and narrowing their focus to research that promises more
immediate product applications and financial payoffs. But Microsoft
Research will grow by as much as 20 percent in the next year, and
part of its work deals with technologies that are not expected to
result in products or profits for many years.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, under Rashid's direction, Microsoft Research embraces
almost the full breadth of computing and software.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a huge amount of flexibility about what we do,'' he
said. Indeed, the lab's projects frequently cross the line between
traditional categories like basic and applied research.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I want to create a small team to do a start-up development
project, then spin them off into the product organization, we can
do that,'' Rashid said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because of this freedom, the group has managed to hold
on to its talent. While Microsoft as a whole has a 7.4 percent
worker turnover rate and the rate in Silicon Valley has risen to 15
percent annually, at Microsoft Research, turnover has stayed below
1 percent, an almost unheard-of number for a high technology
research laboratory during the peak of the Internet start-up boom.
</P>
<P>
   The research investment _ in part evident in two new four-story
office buildings full of researchers here on the sprawling
Microsoft campus _ appears to be paying off.
</P>
<P>
   Among computer science researchers, the company is beginning to
win respect for making serious investments in basic research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft Research is very strong in fields such as computer
graphics, databases and operating systems,'' said David Patterson,
a computer science professor at the University of California at
Berkeley. ``It is also clear that they are a formidable competitor
for researchers on the market.''
</P>
<P>
   The direction of Microsoft Research has changed little in the
year since Myhrvold, an extroverted physicist, abruptly left
Microsoft on a sabbatical from which people both inside and outside
Microsoft expect he will not return.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing we miss is Nathan's laughter in the hallways,''
said Rashid, who was at Carnegie Mellon University and already one
of the nation's leading computer scientists when Myhrvold recruited
him in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Although some research here in fields like algorithms and
quantum computing is likely to have no commercial payoff any time
soon, most of the researchers are pursuing projects designed to
nurture Microsoft's increasingly diverse businesses over the next
three to five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a huge opportunity to make an impact here,'' said
Daniel Ling, an electrical engineer and former IBM computer
designer who is director of research at Microsoft and Rashid's
second in command.
</P>
<P>
   Ling and Rashid became friends back in the early 1970s, while
freshmen at Stanford University. Now, three decades later, the two
have created a research culture in which experiments can be
transformed into commercial products that will end up in millions
of offices or under Christmas trees. That potential clearly
motivates many of the researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Bahl, an expert in wireless networking who came to
Microsoft from Digital Equipment Corp. several years ago, is
working on a product for expanding wireless data networks into
public places like airports and shopping malls. ``I do see it as
more than a research project,'' he said. ``I have to make people
believe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Allegiance,'' which will soon be running on hundreds of
thousands, perhaps millions of computers, is another example of
that urge to transform projects into products. It also illustrates
the intertwined history of software games and computer research.
</P>
<P>
   While a graduate student at the University of Rochester in the
mid-1970s, Rashid and a fellow student, Gene Ball, wrote one of the
first networked computer games. Known as ``Alto Trek,'' it was
among the first programs written for the Xerox Alto, a
then-revolutionary computer designed at Xerox's legendary Palo Alto
Research Center (PARC).
</P>
<P>
   The University of Rochester, which is near the Xerox campus in
Rochester, was one of the first sites at which the Altos were
installed. In an interview in his cramped Microsoft office, which
is littered with ``Star Trek'' memorabilia, Rashid recalled that
there was just one catch: The machines arrived with no software _
not even an operating system. But they did come with an
experimental version of an early local area network known as
Ethernet, and ``Alto Trek'' was written to take advantage of that
technology to enable players to compete without being in the same
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alto Trek'' quickly became so popular that it would overload
the fledgling network at PARC during lunch time and after work.
</P>
<P>
   Many years later, Rashid dug up an old copy of the program and
decided that he would rewrite it using Microsoft's most advanced
graphics technology, known as DirectX. With Ball, who now works in
Microsoft's user interface group, he added modern PC graphics to
the original program. The results were so impressive that Rashid
was able to persuade Microsoft's game division to finance
development of the project.
</P>
<P>
   Now that ``Allegiance'' is ready for the Internet, Rashid is
turning his full attention once again to other research. But that
doesn't mean an end to science-fiction-inspired passions to take
computer research where no hacker has gone before.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a framed poster that sits unobtrusively on the floor in
a corner of his office sums it up best: ``Everything I need to know
in life I learned in `Star Trek.'''

`JOHN BROWN': MADMAN OR MARTYR, HE ENDURES AS AN ANTISLAVERY
CHAMPION
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   To the North's abolitionists John Brown was a martyr. To many
Southerners he was a fanatic murderer. ``John Brown's Holy War,''
Monday night's 90-minute account of his committed life and
memorable death, finds justification for both opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Through his years of scraping out a living as a tanner in the
Pennsylvania wilderness and then in Ohio, Brown was an antislavery
man. Fired up by religious zeal, he risked his life guiding black
fugitives across the Ohio River on the Underground Railroad. And he
went further than most abolitionists in sharing family meals with
black guests and calling them ``Mr.'' and ``Mrs.''
</P>
<P>
   Emotional stability, Monday night's historians agree, was not
one of Brown's qualities, but there was never any question about
the force of his faith. He declared, at 37, ``Here before God, in
the presence of these witnesses, I consecrate my life to the
destruction of slavery.''
</P>
<P>
   His pledge found a field of action after the Kansas-Nebraska Act
of 1854, promoted by Southern legislators, gave settlers the right
to decide whether slavery would be allowed in the heretofore free
territories. Five of Brown's sons, all abolitionists, settled in
``bleeding Kansas,'' where the abolitionists were outgunned by
proslavery vigilantes from Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Brown joined his family in the battle from the Brown
homestead, leading a band that killed five men in what became known
as the Pottawatamie Massacre. ``Brown's men split open heads, cut
off arms,'' says Monday night's narrator. A historian calls it
``coldblooded murder.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Northern press Brown became a celebrated guerrilla
fighter, traveling in quest of money and guns and meeting
personages like Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau and
William Lloyd Garrison. His sympathies, however, were with the more
radical abolitionists, and in 1859 he led a group that included his
sons, fugitive slaves, free blacks and college students in his
famous raid on the federal arsenal at Harper's Ferry in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   He was defeated in a bloody battle, but his fame increased, and
he capitalized on it for the sake of his cause. A historian says,
``He understands, as almost no American does at the time, the value
of the newspapers, the value of propaganda.''
</P>
<P>
   Was he crazy? A biographer sums up: ``He was obsessed; he was
fanatical; he was monomaniacal; he was a zealot and psychologically
unbalanced.'' But the diagnosis ends with a question: ``Does all of
that add up to madness?''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the answer, when his lawyer tried to have him declared
insane, he denounced the idea, martyrdom having far more attraction
than an asylum. Brown was hanged in December 1859, only months
before the outbreak of the Civil War, and the song that
immortalized him goes marching on.

<TEXT>
<P>
   A recent deal between Starbucks and the urban delivery
specialist Kozmo.com _in which Starbucks will essentially set aside
space in its coffee shops for Kozmo _ may be the first example of
an established retailer offering its floor space and personnel to
an e-commerce company. But it is unlikely to be the last.
</P>
<P>
   Industry executives and analysts predict that such agreements
will come rapidly in the next few months, as Internet retailers
struggle to address two of their most glaring vulnerabilities _
customer acquisition costs and returns _while continuing to close
the gap between virtual and traditional stores.
</P>
<P>
   The agreements will take many forms. The convenience-store chain
7-Eleven, for instance, plans to install Internet-ready ATMs, which
might eventually let customers order goods from Web retailers and
have them delivered to the store.
</P>
<P>
   And in such arrangements, customers might also be able to return
Internet goods to the stores. Package handling companies like Mail
Boxes Etc. are already starting to handle returns and exchanges on
behalf of Internet retailers. Other national chains, like
drugstores and gas station convenience marts, might also add such
services as a side business.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, any retailer with a national presence and a strong
distribution and warehousing system is a prime candidate to join
with e-commerce sites, analysts predict. Customers who enjoy the
convenience of the Web might also prefer knowing that if anything
goes wrong with a purchase, they can find a real person at a real
store to make it better.
</P>
<P>
   ``The need for this is huge,'' said Tim Washer, director of
interactive research with NFO Interactive, a market research
company. ``What it's about is reducing the risk of shopping online.
Offering a retail presence will really facilitate that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kozmo executives stressed those points in announcing the deal
this month. ``We'll be able to ride on Starbucks' coattails, and
give our customers an incredible sense of confidence,'' said Joseph
Park, chief executive of Kozmo, which offers free one-hour delivery
of goods purchased on its Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   Kozmo, which operates only in Boston, New York, Washington,
Seattle and San Francisco so far, specializes in delivering videos,
books, food and convenience goods.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, Kozmo will pay Starbucks $150 million over five
years for the right to place return boxes in Starbucks stores. The
boxes will initially be used for rental videos, games and DVDs, but
will eventually be available for other products, as well, like
disposable cameras ready for processing or defective items being
returned for a refund. In addition, Starbucks will promote Kozmo
and train its sales staff to answer questions about the Internet
company. Kozmo, in turn, will deliver Starbucks coffees and teas by
the pound _ and eventually perhaps hot beverages, too.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership, which is to include joint marketing, will
immediately raise Kozmo's credibility with consumers, predicted
Chris Vroom, e-commerce analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston.
And it will also give Kozmo an efficient way to reach new
customers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Vroom said Internet retailers typically spent about $100 to
acquire each customer _ an exorbitant amount, because the average
customer will spend only about $200 at a given site in a lifetime.
A $30 million annual outlay to Starbucks will swell Kozmo's
customer acquisition costs in the short term, he said, but in the
long term it could pay off, given Starbucks' huge clientele.
</P>
<P>
   ``Starbucks can put a Kozmo logo on coffee cups that 10 million
customers a week will buy,'' Vroom said. ``That's a powerful
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more powerful is the ability of such partnerships to
provide e-commerce customers an easy way to return goods _ not
simply rental items, but, more important, goods deemed
unsatisfactory by the customers. Internet merchants have been
widely criticized for their failures in this regard, particularly
as return rates have reached roughly 30 percent _ a rate slightly
higher than in the catalog industry.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Retailers with stores online and offline, like Gap and
Federated's Macy's, have had an edge at least in part because their
customers can return goods to a store whether they were bought
online or off. And though e-commerce companies are loath to open up
stores for this reason alone, they are clearly in the market for
help from companies that can help streamline returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I speak, there are four or five people from e-commerce
companies in this building talking to us about it,'' said James
Amos, chief executive of Mail Boxes Etc., speaking from his office
in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Amos estimated that 300 other companies had asked Mail Boxes
``for access to our 4,000 stores'' in the last several months.
``We're in discussions with just about everyone that'd come to the
top of your mind,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Amos said the deluge began late last year when the company
agreed to provide customers of eBay auctions with help in
inspecting and returning items bought online. Since then, Mail
Boxes has begun installing satellite dishes in franchise stores, in
hopes of connecting all of its business partners in a single
network.
</P>
<P>
   The satellites will not only provide high-speed Internet access,
the company said, but will link the stores' cash registers directly
to the corporate office and to the company's e-commerce partners.
</P>
<P>
   That setup, in turn, will allow the company to plug into the
back-office systems of Internet retailers _ so that if a customer
of an Internet-only merchant wanted to exchange an item at a Mail
Boxes store, the replacement item could be sent to a Mail Boxes
location. The customer could then simply drop off the old item,
pick up the new one and not have to deal with packaging, postage or
coordinating delivery times.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the first e-commerce partnerships will be announced
after the satellite system is completed next month, Amos said,
``We're basically going to be a bridge between the virtual and the
real world.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Mail Boxes will have plenty of company in that
regard. United Parcel Service, which recently announced plans to
expand its network of drop-off centers by testing storefront
locations in suburban areas, might use those stores to support
e-commerce companies. ``We're definitely going to contemplate it,''
said Mark Rhoney, president of UPS eVentures, the business UPS set
up to help e-commerce companies fill orders.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Kurtzman, chief executive of Ashford.com, an online
jewelry and luxury goods retailer, would welcome a partnership with
an offline company ``if that would help give customers an easier
way to return products,'' he said. ``We'd look to partner with
someone like FedEx or UPS to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   In exploring its own partnerships with e-commerce companies,
7-Eleven has not been approached by online jewelers, ``but we have
had some bizarre offers,'' said James Keyes, chief operating
officer. ``I don't think someone will pick up their living room
furniture at our store.''
</P>
<P>
   Keyes said that by this summer, 7-Eleven would test ATMs with
Internet access. Besides getting cash, customers would be able to
cash checks or obtain money orders or get directions from Web
sites, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the ATMs would not include Internet retailers, he
said, but that might change eventually.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you wanted a new videogame, you could preview it and order
it at the store, then have it delivered to the store on the day of
the release,'' Keyes said. Just such a service is already available
in Japan, he said, as the result of an agreement between 7-Eleven
and Sony.
</P>
<P>
   The company would also welcome the chance to take returned
merchandise for Web retailers, ``as long as the goods make sense in
our environment,'' Keyes said.

<P>
   Unsure if your financial plan will put your children through
college? Don't really know how a mutual fund works?
</P>
<P>
   General Electric feels your pain. On Tuesday, GE will introduce
the GE Center for Financial Learning, a Web site
(www.financiallearning.com) to battle what GE calls a ``financial
literacy crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   The site will offer advice from an advisory board of outside
experts on subjects like retirement planning and tax management. It
will feature questionnaires that measure consumers' financial
acumen, as well as self-paced courses on investments, mutual funds
and insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many Americans are in a real state of denial about their own
financial preparedness,'' said Kathleen S. Gurney, one of the 10
unpaid advisers and the president of Financial Psychology in
Sonoma, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The site will have links to GE Web sites, but GE will not sell
or advertise on the site, nor will it market directly to the site's
visitors.
</P>
<P>
   So why do it? ``GE is a household name in appliances, but not
when it comes to financial services,'' said J. David Mahder, chief
marketing officer of GE Financial Assurance, the GE insurance and
investment arm running the site. ``Launching this center will help
us leverage the GE brand.''
</P>
<P>
   The advisers, whose names will appear on the site, are doing
some personal brand tweaking, too. ``GE is a trusted name, and it's
going to help me reach a lot more people,'' Gurney said.

   As the Federal Communications Commission continues to debate
whether users of wireless telephones should have to pay to receive
as well as make calls, IDT Corp. has taken matters into its own
hands.
</P>
<P>
   Based in Hackensack, N.J., IDT is the communications carrier
that pioneered new services including phone calls over the Internet
and call-back _ a service that allows people overseas to slash the
rates they pay for international calls by routing them through the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Without building a wireless network, IDT is now set to introduce
a service that would offer nationwide wireless service while
eliminating the fees cellular customers typically pay for incoming
calls.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all cellular phone subscribers, unlike users of
traditional phones, have to pay when they receive calls. As the
wireless industry trys to become a pervasive competitor to
entrenched local telephone monopolies, it is pressing the FCC to
establish rules that would extend the traditional ``calling party
pays'' billing model into the wireless arena. That would enable
wireless users who sign up for a caller-pays plan to receive calls
free.
</P>
<P>
   But IDT is not waiting. Instead, it has put together a system
that includes a feature that even the major carriers may not have
thought of.
</P>
<P>
   IDT's approach is to buy large lots of cellular subscriptions
from big carriers like AT&AMP;T. But before selling them to consumers,
IDT links the phones to a system of its own making that allows each
phone to have two numbers.
</P>
<P>
   One number has a standard area code, and when a call comes in on
that number, the wireless subscriber is billed as usual for the
incoming call. But each IDT phone also has a toll-free number. When
someone using a normal phone calls the toll-free number, they hear
a message that informs them that they will be charged _ typically
10 cents a minute _ to reach the wireless subscriber, who would
then receive the call without fees.
</P>
<P>
   The two-number system could allow a wireless subscriber to give
the toll-free number to most people while giving the receiver-pays
wireless number to close family members, for instance.

   `Seinfeld' Actress in New Role Giving Advice Online
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there life after `Seinfeld?''' That is the question being
asked on Oracle's e-business network, a new online service
announced earlier this month. The answer can also be found there:
Estelle Harris, the actress who played the character George
Constanza's cranky mother on ``Seinfeld,'' is starting a weekly
computer-advice program on the Oracle network.
</P>
<P>
   The program, called ``Get With It'' and scheduled to begin next
month on Oracle.com, will be a live online talk show, featuring
streaming video of interviews with celebrities and ordinary types.
One program, for example, will include segments filmed on Wall
Street, featuring Harris interviewing technology stock traders.
</P>
<P>
   But the Oracle show is just one part of Harris' new career as a
``forward-looking Internet-savvy senior geek,'' as the Oracle site
describes her.
</P>
<P>
   Harris has also started Estelle Harris Productions, a company
focused on the technology needs of people over 50. And she plans in
April to begin operating an independent Web site, to be called Ask
Estelle (www.stelstar.com). In addition to carrying her own advice
column, the site will be a portal and shopping site with
information and products for older people.
</P>
<P>
   Howard E. Wall, chairman of Estelle Harris Productions in Palm
Springs, Calif., said Harris bought her first home computer just a
year ago and was immediately fascinated.
</P>
<P>
   According to Harris' producers at Oracle, her online program _
unlike ``Seinfeld'' _ will ``not be a show about nothing.''

<P>
   A developer's plan for Pier 45, presented to the San Francisco
Port Commission earlier this month, described the creation of ``San
Francisco at the Wharf.'' This $30.7 million tourist attraction
would include a 1906 ``earthquake theater'' and a ``mock Haight
Ashbury,'' an idea that was brought to the attention of veteran
Haight-Ashbury veteran  &UR; Wavy Gravy &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not go to the regular one?'' he asked. ``It's kind of a
coexistence between the punks and the hippies, a little
cutting-edge U.N. in action.''
</P>
<P>
   Likening the neighborhood to an amusement park is giving it
short shrift, said Gravy. ``They should declare the manhole cover
at the center of Haight and Ashbury as a national monument, &LR; 
because it's a power center, like Stonehenge or the pyramids.''
</P>
<P>
   P.S. A passing art lover notes that the terra cotta cherubs on
the Willis Polk-designed building destined to become the Jewish
Museum San Francisco are uncircumcised, a condition that can't be
brought into religious conformance because the building has
landmark status.

 &UR; Robert Mosbacher &LR; , is working hard for  &UR; John McCain &LR;  because if he

   &UR; A SCIENCE REPORT: WHY THE WIND BLOWS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   About a hundred researchers and theorists submitted explanations
for the sudden wind that blows through  &UR; Tom Geller &LR; 's open balcony
door, at the foot of Howard Street, at 5:06 every evening. Because
Personals is a democracy and not a laboratory, majority rules.
</P>
<P>
   The largest group of answers, hereby declared correct, said that
the sudden wind is caused by a change in air pressure that occurs
when the building's ventilation system switches from day to night
mode. ``Probably what is happening,'' opinions  &UR; Aloysius &LR; 
 &UR; Beerheart &LR; , ``is that the air conditioning system is shutting off
at 5:06 p.m. every day. When this happens there is no longer a
positive pressure in the room, which allows the outside air to blow
in through the open door.''
</P>
<P>
   Other readers blamed ``the wind rushing in to fill the void
caused by outrushing employees'' ( &UR; John Joss &LR; ); ``the sudden vacuum
created by the elevators as workers rush to leave'' ( &UR; Hayden
Hicks &LR; ); ``the dust devil caused by many people leaving work to get
into a hellish traffic jam'' ( &UR; Murray Rosenthal &LR; ); ``the first wave
of commuters racing to be first on the Bay Bridge reaching maximum
velocity'' ( &UR; Paula Jones &LR; ); ``all those clock watchers reach ground
floor and push open every lobby door in the city all at once''
( &UR; Dennis Green &LR; ); ``the simultaneous slamming of every car door in
every car in every parking garage'' ( &UR; Basha Hanner &LR; ).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Matt Regan  &LR; identifies the Tippler Effect, ``that sudden air
disturbance caused by 10,000 postwork martini shakers tossed at
once'';  &UR; Kent Mitchell &LR;  blames the ``San Francisco Sigh'' of relief
as commuters leave (and mentions the matching morning ``moan'');
 &UR; Les Albert &LR;  opines that because the ``moving bodies'' heading for
BART stations and bus stops are on a ``rotating planet, most of
them are turning right to catch their ride home. This sets air
currents in motion that are not random; the air is moved in a
regular pattern that builds up in about six minutes, creating the
Howard Street Mistral'';  &UR; Michael Slaughter &LR;  describes an
``orographic wind'' created by the shape of the landscape of tall
buildings and narrow streets, relating to the hottest time of the
day, 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, taking into account metaphysics: ``It's the ghost of
the '89 quake'' (which happened at 5:06 p.m.), says  &UR; R.P. Delman &LR; ;
the sighs of ``a mass of commuters praying to fit on the 5:06 at
the Embarcadero BART station,'' says  &UR; Brian Knittel &LR; ; ``Tom's

   REPUBS-CALIF (Pasadena, Calif.) _ As the presidential campaign
moves to the biggest states, George W. Bush and John McCain are
battling squarely for the biggest prize of all: California, whose
once-mighty Republican Party propelled Richard Nixon and Ronald
Reagan to the White House but has languished and feuded for much of
the 1990s as President Clinton and the Democrats came to dominate
the state. By Todd S. Purdum.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   BUSH-BOBJONES (Washington, D.C.) _ Gov. George W. Bush issued a
surprising apology Sunday for any offense he had caused Catholics
or others with his widely assailed visit to Bob Jones University,
expressing his regret both in a letter to Cardinal John O'Connor,
the Roman Catholic archbishop of New York, and at a news conference
in Austin, Texas. By Frank Bruni.
</P>
<P>
   NY-PUERTO-RICANS (New York) _ Being Latino in New York City used
to mean being Puerto Rican. But over the last decade, the number of
Puerto Rican New Yorkers decreased for the first time since they
began arriving in the city in great numbers 60 years ago. Experts
say the decline is destined to continue. By Mireya Navarro.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   DIALLO-REACT (New York) _ Rallies, sermons and speeches
addressed the death last year of African immigrant Amadou Diallo
and the acquittal Friday of the four police officers charged in his
shooting. By Eric Lipton.
</P>
<P>
   AIRPLANE-COMFORT (Undated) _ Passengers flying in coach may soon
find they have more room _ if they can get seats. American Airlines
is adding space between coach seats for those paying full fares,
and others, including British Airways and United, are segmenting
economy class into premium coach and true budget service. By David
J. Morrow.

   POTTER-BOOK-BOOM (New York) _ Last year the sales of children's
books soared on the windstream of Harry's Nimbus 2000 flying broom.
Classics like C.S. Lewis' ``Chronicles of Narnia'' experienced an
otherwise inexplicable burst in popularity, as did newer fantasy
titles like Brian Jacques' ``Redwall'' series, which had been
selling well and steadily over the years until Hogwarts magic gave
it a sudden lift. By Doreen Carvajal.

U.S. FOREIGN POLICY, THE DEMOCRATIC WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORMAN LEVINE  
 c.2000 Special for The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (LAST IN A SERIES OF THREE ARTICLES. ALSO MOVING IN THE ``A''
CATEGORY  &UR; -  &UR; The author examines the Democratic ``Liberal
Moralist'' and ``Liberal Realist''
 &UR; positions in the debate over the direction of American foreign
policy.)
</P>
<P>
   The American people are undergoing an out-of-body experience:
History is repeating itself, and they have been transferred back to
1920 and the battle waged by Woodrow Wilson and Henry Cabot Lodge
over America's entry into the League of Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson wanted both to make the world ``safe for democracy'' and
for the United States to obey the covenant of the League of
Nations, irrespective of national self-interest. His opponent was
Lodge, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and
although Lodge favored America's entry into the League, he wished
to modify certain articles as a means of preserving U.S. national
self-interest.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson refused to make any concessions and, in 1920, the League
went down to defeat. The conservatives of 2000 are the spiritual
descendants of Lodge, while present-day liberals inherit the legacy
of Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   As a liberal moralist, Clintonian foreign policy is an amalgam
of Wilson, Jimmy Carter's ``universal human rights'' and reaction
against the Vietnam War with its rejection of unilateral action by
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   After initial hesitation in 1993, Clintonian diplomacy shattered
the boundaries of the containment of Communism theory articulated
by George F. Kennan, a foreign-policy expert and diplomat, at the
beginning of the Cold War. Essentially a strategy to halt further
imperialism of the Stalinist empire, containment theory limited the
extension of American power to the Elbe, which, from 1947 to 1990,
was the eastern border of Germany. &QL; 
NATO EXPANSION &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clintonian foreign policy committed itself to the enlargement of
the horizon of democracy, and Clinton pursued this goal on two
fronts: expansion of NATO in Europe and support of Boris Yeltsin in
Russia. When Clinton embarked on the jihad of making the world safe
for democracy, he not only embraced this aspect of Wilsonism but
capitulated to the arguments of Anthony Lake, his first national
security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton Doctrine brought Poland, the Czech Republic and
Hungary into NATO. By including these three countries under the
NATO umbrella, the United States committed itself to the defense of
countries it never previously considered within its own sphere of
national self-interest. This enormous broadening of American
guarantees was justified under the principle of missionary
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   In expanding NATO, Clinton broke American implied agreements
with Mikhail Gorbachev. ``A World Transformed,'' written by George
Bush, who was president at the time of the disintegration of the
Soviet Empire in Eastern Europe, and Brent Scowcroft, Bush's
national security adviser, is unequivocal on this point: At no time
did Bush, Scowcroft, or Secretary of State James Baker indicate to
Gorbachev that NATO would be extended eastward to Poland, the Czech
Republic and Hungary after the Soviets voluntarily renounced their
title to these tracts of land.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. policy toward Yeltsin was another case of missionary
democracy. The Clinton administration adamantly supported Yeltsin
on the grounds that he was leading the democratic capitalist
transformation of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   However, Yeltsin's resignation from office and the crowning of
Vladimir Putin as his successor is a serious setback for the
Clinton doctrine. Putin's recent alliance with the Communists
belies the assertion that democracy is functioning in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lee Hamilton, Democratic loyalist, respected former
chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and current
director of the Woodrow Wilson Foundation, Putin's recent coalition
with the Communists ``amounts to a defeat for Clinton, for it
strengthens the power of the Communists in the Duma.'' &QL; 
PUSHING MULTILATERALISM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another Wilson ideal that the Clinton doctrine continues is that
American diplomacy should unfold within multilateral institutions.
Liberal moralists are suspicious of unilateral actions because they
fear it will give rise to worldwide anti-Americanism.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the fact that recent ventures in which America
acted under the aegis of the United Nations _ such as in Somalia,
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo _ all appear to be failures, the
White House still upholds the usefulness of multilateralism. The
Oval Office fears the bully backlash _ that other nations will
express their resentment against the paramountcy of the United
States by opposing American policies.
</P>
<P>
   Another principle of liberal moralism to which the Clinton
doctrine abides is free trade.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal moralism wishes to turn the movement toward economic
globalization to an advantage for the United States, and so Clinton
has devoted much effort to the reduction of tariffs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wishes to use trade as a form of social engineering,
because he hopes that free trade will encourage the growth of a
capitalist entrepreneurial class in countries making the transition
out of communism, like China. Borrowing a phrase from his former
economic adviser, Andrea Tyson, Clinton thinks in terms of
``strategic trade,'' or trade with a deeper purpose than just
making a profit.
</P>
<P>
   In its approach to China, the Clinton doctrine combines the
strategic trade and the ``strategic partner'' approaches.
</P>
<P>
   The theory of the strategic partner is to detach China from any
``anti-hegemonist'' bloc alliance. Primarily, this means preventing
the re-creation of the Cold War Sino-Soviet coalition. &QL; 
OVAL OFFICE'S PLAN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The hook of strategic trade is associated with the universal
human-rights theory of Carter. By its use of strategic trade, the
Oval Office hopes to ensnare President Jiang Zemin into granting
more ``human rights'' to Chinese citizens. The ultimate aim of
trans-Pacific social engineering is to both speed the development
of a commercial middle class in China and to provide these
entrepreneurs with the protective shield of civil liberties.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives of all camps attack the Clinton doctrine on China
as a contradiction between rewards and punishments.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting upon the differences that separate Republicans and
Democrats, Democratic loyalist Hamilton told ``The Arizona
Republic,'' ``Republicans are very skeptical of international
organizations, such as the U.N., the World Trade Organization and
the like. Democrats generally support these multilateral
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a monopolar world in the social and economic
sense. Even though the U.S. is the only superpower in the military
or `hard' sense, it cannot dictate to all nations of the globe in
matters of gender, children, values or culture. In terms of `soft'
power _ education, information and trade, this is a multipolar
world and the U.S. must learn to act in conjunction with
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important to recognize that the most important lever of
diplomatic power has changed from `hard' to `soft' power. To me,
trade is the crucial issue.'' &QL; 
PARTY SPLIT ON POLICIES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans tend to stress military power,'' Hamilton
added. ``I am an unrepentant free-trader because I believe that
unrestricted trade, from which all sides benefit, is the best way
to export the democratic order.''
</P>
<P>
   But policies are divisive ones within the Democratic Party. To
hold the presidency again in November, Democrats desperately need
the support of American labor, and the AFL-CIO has already endorsed
Vice President Al Gore. Nevertheless, a divorce has taken place
between the corporatist and labor wings of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   The corporatists favor strategic trade and China's entry into
the World Trade Organization, because they will be the ``winners''
from the globalization of trade, while Big Labor is opposed to
these policies, because they will be the ``losers'' when domestic
wages are repressed. The Seattle meeting of the World Trade
Organization ended in chaos when Big Labor and environmentalists
led street demonstrations demanding environmental protections, an
end to child labor in China and other Asian countries and
improvement of working conditions before any further reduction of
tariffs.
</P>
<P>
   The issues of China and world trade will be hotly debated along
partisan lines when Congress is called on to approve China's entry
into the World Trade Organization in the fall, and they will play a
major role in the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has already become a victim of the Democratic dependency on
Big Labor. Gore suffers from a split personality: one face as vice
president and the other as party candidate. As vice president, he
speaks in favor of the Clinton doctrine, but as candidate he must
massage the labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   This past week, Gore's divided personality made the front pages
when the AFL-CIO criticized him for placing the reduction of
tariffs before the increase of wages, the growth of labor unions
and the end of sweat shops in Third World countries.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of Gore's problems with the labor unions, he is also a
Liberal Moralist. In the war of words currently waged in opinion
journals, Stephen M. Walt, a professor of international relations
at Harvard University, has acted as the vice president's script
writer. In an article in the March/April issue of ``Foreign
Affairs,'' Walt has written a Democratic response to the Republican
broadsides that were published by ``Foreign Affairs'' in the
previous issue. The vice president's proxy only proved that on
foreign affairs, Gore is a clone of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley is also a Liberal Moralist and although there are
no significant differences between Gore and Clinton, there are
important divisions between Gore-Clinton and Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Gore-Clinton favor an increase in the defense budget, but
Bradley advocates a cut in appropriations for the Defense
Department. Bradley would use the money saved from the military
spending for his domestic agenda such as his health and
anti-poverty programs. Bradley is also far more attuned to the
growing gulf between the cyberspace Atlantic world and the
spinning-wheel Third World.  &QL; 
`BULLY BACKLASH' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Liberal realists, particularly professor Michael Mandelbaum of
the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, agrees
with Clinton-Gore that it is vital to work within multinational
organizations, but he dissents from the Clinton doctrine on the
issue that America should become a global proselytizer for
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Mandelbaum led the charge against the expansion of NATO because
he feared the ``bully backlash.'' Mandelbaum's essay, ``Foreign
Policy as Social Work,'' appeared in the January/February 1996
issue of ``Foreign Affairs.'' In the essay, he criticized Clinton
for seeking to turn the United States into the messiah of
constitutional government.
</P>
<P>
   Mandelbaum wrote of Clinton and Lake, his first national
security adviser: ``They tried and failed to turn American foreign
policy into a branch of social work.''
</P>
<P>
   Clintonian foreign policy, Mandelbaum and the entire liberal
realist camp argues, has overextended and overtaxed U.S. resources
around the world. The liberal realists oppose intervention in the
internal affairs of other sovereign states, and they reject the
notion that America can play the world's shrink, using the methods
of a social worker to aid the dysfunctional.
</P>
<P>
   No Republican or Democratic candidate in the current campaign
embraces isolationist or protectionist positions. As the new
century dawns, the United States is experiencing instant historical
replay. The First World War is over, the Treaty of Versailles is
written, and America in 2000 must decide whether it will sign the
League of Nations in 1920.
</P>
<P>
   All those who favor close collaboration with international
organizations, forgoing all instances of unilateral intervention,
will vote for Woodrow Wilson. All those who favor the retention of
full American self-interest, the need for unilateral intervention
to further national security, will vote for Lodge. But whatever
your vote, you must face the consequences: If Americans can put
aside their obsession with the marrying-a- multimillionaire
melodrama, they will bear in mind that history is a life-and-death
sentence, that it repeats itself, and the Second World War followed
the First.  &QL;

Department. Bradley would use the money saved from the military
spending for his domestic agenda such as his health and
anti-poverty programs. Bradley is also far more attuned to the
growing gulf between the cyberspace Atlantic world and the
spinning-wheel Third World.  &QL; 
`BULLY BACKLASH' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Liberal realists, particularly professor Michael Mandelbaum of
the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, agrees
with Clinton-Gore that it is vital to work within multinational
organizations, but he dissents from the Clinton doctrine on the
issue that America should become a global proselytizer for
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Mandelbaum led the charge against the expansion of NATO because
he feared the ``bully backlash.'' Mandelbaum's essay, ``Foreign
Policy as Social Work,'' appeared in the January/February 1996
issue of ``Foreign Affairs.'' In the essay, he criticized Clinton
for seeking to turn the United States into the messiah of
constitutional government.
</P>
<P>
   Mandelbaum wrote of Clinton and Lake, his first national
security adviser: ``They tried and failed to turn American foreign
policy into a branch of social work.''
</P>
<P>
   Clintonian foreign policy, Mandelbaum and the entire liberal
realist camp argues, has overextended and overtaxed U.S. resources
around the world. The liberal realists oppose intervention in the
internal affairs of other sovereign states, and they reject the
notion that America can play the world's shrink, using the methods
of a social worker to aid the dysfunctional.
</P>
<P>
   No Republican or Democratic candidate in the current campaign
embraces isolationist or protectionist positions. As the new
century dawns, the United States is experiencing instant historical
replay. The First World War is over, the Treaty of Versailles is
written, and America in 2000 must decide whether it will sign the
League of Nations in 1920.
</P>
<P>
   All those who favor close collaboration with international
organizations, forgoing all instances of unilateral intervention,
will vote for Woodrow Wilson. All those who favor the retention of
full American self-interest, the need for unilateral intervention
to further national security, will vote for Lodge. But whatever
your vote, you must face the consequences: If Americans can put
aside their obsession with the marrying-a- multimillionaire
melodrama, they will bear in mind that history is a life-and-death
sentence, that it repeats itself, and the Second World War followed
the First.  &QL;

FOR EM.TV, A MUPPET MISSION ACCOMPLISHED
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Replace double parentheses (()) with brackets) 
(nk) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MUNICH, Germany _ ``Here, you have to see this,'' insisted
Thomas Haffa, founder of EM.TV and Merchandising AG, as he ordered
the video to be cued.
</P>
<P>
   Three days earlier, Haffa had clinched the biggest deal of his
life: an agreement to buy the Jim Henson Co. and its legendary
Muppets for $680 million.
</P>
<P>
   Now, on the TV screen, up popped a Muppet in a pin-striped suit.
Produced by Jim Henson more than 20 years ago for a conference at
IBM, the Muppet begins a sonorous speech about corporate values but
soon becomes more fevered.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is one word that I want to leave you with today, one
word to guide you in the future, that word is SELL!'' Whipping off
his tie and banging the podium, he embarks on a crescendo that ends
in a frenzied climax of exhortations. ``Sell for motherhood! Sell
for America! Sell for apple pie! Sell your socks off! Whatever else
you do, just get out there and sell, sell, sell, sell!''
</P>
<P>
   That pretty much captures the approach that led to Haffa's
remarkable coup. Though almost unknown outside of Germany, his
11-year-old company has been built on selling just about anything
to do with children's television.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a blitz of deal-making, the 47-year-old Haffa has
become the Magilla Gorilla of children's television. EM.TV now owns
the rights to 28,500 half-hour episodes of shows ranging from ``Tom
&AMP; Jerry'' to ``Teen-age Mutant Ninja Turtles'' and ``The
Simpsons.''
</P>
<P>
   About two-thirds of those rights are limited to German-speaking
countries, while the remainder are global. EM.TV is also a prolific
merchandiser of toys, books and clothing tied to television shows.
And it is an increasingly prolific producer of shows and films in
its own right.
</P>
<P>
   Haffa is part of a new breed of entrepreneurs in Germany. Three
years ago, when small companies were shunned on the German stock
exchange, EM.TV was one of the first companies to go public on
Frankfurt's New Market.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, EM.TV shares have soared 14,000 percent. Adjusted
for splits, shares that began trading at 34 marks, or about $17,
three years ago are worth about 11,000 marks, or $5,482, now.
</P>
<P>
   Haffa and other family members still own about 52 percent of
EM.TV's stock, giving them a collective worth of several billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that rise reflects a new German mania for fast-growing
companies. Indeed, New Market is Europe's most booming market for
new issues.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholder euphoria aside, EM.TV's revenue quintupled in the
first nine months of 1999, to 257 million marks, or about $135
million. Net profit was 162 million marks, 63 percent of sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``The library is huge, and the assets have a very long life,
much longer than feature films,'' Annelie Hoppe, an analyst at
WestLB Panmure in Duesseldorf, said.
</P>
<P>
   In acquiring Henson, EM.TV will own full rights to the Muppets,
from characters like Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy to movies like
``Muppets From Space'' and TV shows like ``Fraggle Rock.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is one of the best brands in the world,'' Haffa said. ``I
believe there is a huge potential for the revival of the Muppet
characters.''
</P>
<P>
   Once a salesman for IBM _ where he first saw the Muppet selling
video _ Haffa worked for several years at the Kirch Group for the
German media tycoon Leo Kirch. As with Haffa, Kirch's core success
came from buying German rights to a hugh library of TV programming,
mostly American. But Haffa chose to leave in 1989 and seek his own
fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal announced last Monday, EM.TV will pay $680
million, half in cash and half in stock, so the deal could increase
in value as the stock price rises.
</P>
<P>
   ((Shares of EM.TV, which closed at 109.90 euros, or $107.13, the
day the deal was announced, rose to 112 euros on Thursday before
settling at 109.20 on Friday. They had traded from 101 to 104 euros
in the days just before the deal was announced.))
</P>
<P>
   The deal is a significant turning point for the children of Jim
Henson, who have led the company since he died of pneumonia 10
years ago and will continue to run it as a division of EM.TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started this process about six months ago, when we decided
to start looking around for a partner,'' said Brian Henson, Jim
Henson's 36-year-old son, who is chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially we were talking about a minority acquisition, but
being a 50-50 partner or a 60-40 partner doesn't work so well
because you end up not being a high priority for the partner,''
Henson said. ``So after a while we decided to go for a 100 percent
sale.''
</P>
<P>
   Henson already had links to EM.TV, which bought the German
rights to the Muppets years ago. But Henson said Haffa had a gift
for marketing, a Henson company weakness.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the worldwide popularity of the Muppets, not to mention
the annual millions of dollars from merchandising tie-ins, the
company remained small because family members were leery about
tapping capital markets. ``We were very conservative financially,
always keeping a positive cash flow and holding a lot in reserve,''
Henson said. ``It was very hard for a family like ours to take on a
lot of debt.''
</P>
<P>
   In the months before he died, Jim Henson had negotiated a sale
to Walt Disney; Michael D. Eisner, the Disney chairman, even
announced a deal in August 1989. But in the months after Henson's
death in May 1990, the companies could not come to final terms and
his children kept the company independent. While no figure was ever
stated, Disney's offer was thought to have been in the range of
$100 million to $150 million.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the EM.TV deal, Brian Henson will be in charge of
creative efforts but hand the job of chief executive to the
company's longtime chief operating officer, Charlie Rivkin. Lisa
Henson, 39, Brian's sister and a longtime movie producer who had
not been part of the Henson Co., will lead its feature-film
business. Cheryl Henson, 38, another sister, will be in charge of
the Children's Television Workshop and the Henson family
foundation.
</P>
<P>
   For Haffa, the deal provides a brand that he hopes will cover
all his products. It also gives him a long-sought platform for
producing material in the United States. Most importantly, it gives
him control of anything to do with Muppets.
</P>
<P>
   Christian Lamprecht, an analyst at Hypovereinsbank Research in
Munich, said he was skeptical about whether EM.TV could keep up
with investors' delirious expectations for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing is story-driven,'' he said. ``The story is
that the management has been constantly able to reel in fantastic
new deals.''

ENGINEERS REJECT OFFER IN STRIKE AGAINST BOEING
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After three fruitless days of discussions with a federal
mediator, talks between the Boeing Co. and its striking engineers
and technical workers broke down on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company's latest offer was a step backward,'' said Charles
Bofferding, the executive director of the Society of Professional
Engineering Employees in Aerospace, which represents 20,683
employees in the talks, at least 17,000 of whom have been on strike
since Feb. 9. Bofferding said that Boeing appeared to be inviting a
long strike by crafting its latest offer with terms it knew the
union would not accept, including a medical benefits provision
little changed from one that had been rejected by 98 percent of its
members.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, in an official statement, characterized its offer as
containing ``significant movement'' and said that the breakdown in
negotiations and likelihood that the strike would continue were
``disheartening.''
</P>
<P>
   The union is seeking bonuses and other benefits that match those
Boeing gave its machinists last year. Boeing's latest offer
included a stock option plan in lieu of the average of $4,400 for
each member the union wanted in bonus money, but the union said the
option package of 100 shares over three years was worth no more
than $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Another sticking point is the percentage of the proposed annual
increases that is guaranteed to each member. Boeing offered 8
percent, 4.5 percent and 4.5 percent wage increases for engineers
over the next three years and 5.5 percent, 4.5 percent and 4.5
percent for the technical workers, but managers would continue to
have control over how most of the money is allocated among the
groups. An individual technical worker might emerge with an
increase of just 3 percent over the three years while a co-worker
got more than the average.
</P>
<P>
   Both the company and the union have said that they could absorb
a long strike, but both are already feeling the effects. Boeing has
missed delivery dates on several planes, and its stock, which
closed at $37.8125 on Friday, is down nearly 8 percent since the
strike began. Union members might have to begin paying for their
own medical coverage on March 1.
</P>
<P>
   Bofferding said the union would now attempt to talk to industry
analysts, Boeing customers and engineering students at universities
in an effort to increase pressure on the company. ``We will start
what we call `strike plus more','' he said.

 By MERVYN ROTHSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For John Mauceri the path to Kurt Weill's ``Eternal
Road,'' which he is conducting for six performances beginning
Monday night at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, has been long and
winding.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I became music director of the Scottish Opera in Glasgow
about 15 years ago, I asked Kim Kowalke, the president of the Weill
Foundation, what work by Weill needed to be done,'' said Mauceri,
now principal conductor of the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra and the new
music director of the Pittsburgh Opera. ``And he said `The Eternal
Road.'''
</P>
<P>
   Weill (1900-1950) is known as the composer of ``Mack the Knife''
from ``The Threepenny Opera'' and ``September Song'' from
``Knickerbocker Holiday'' and is also remembered on Broadway for
``Street Scene,'' ``Lady in the Dark'' and ``One Touch of Venus.''
But as far as Mauceri knew, ``The Eternal Road'' was little more
than a footnote, an epic opera about the Old Testament and Jewish
history that had long been deemed impossible to produce, because of
its size.
</P>
<P>
   So Kowalke sent over the score, which had largely been written
near Paris after Weill, who was the son of a cantor but was a
nonpracticing Jew, fled Germany and Hitler in 1933. The work had
not been performed since 1937, when it had its only production, at
the Manhattan Opera House.
</P>
<P>
   Lotte Lenya, Weill's wife, was in the cast, as were Sam Jaffe,
an 11-year-old Sidney Lumet and an 8-year-old Dick Van Patten. But
despite critical acclaim, it ran for only 153 performances.
</P>
<P>
   The three-and-a-half-hour production, the largest ever at the
Brooklyn Academy, cost $1 million and is part of the academy's
celebration of the 100th anniversary of Weill's birth on March 2.
The opera has a cast of more than 200 singers and actors, and it
uses an 80-piece orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started to play the score,'' Mauceri recalled, sitting in
his office in his Manhattan apartment. ``I knew that Weill's early
style was atonal, what you might call brutalistic. And then he made
a big change in the 1920s, working with Bertolt Brecht on
`Threepenny Opera' and `The Rise and Fall of the City of
Mahagonny.' And later, when he came to America, he worked in a more
popular style with Ira Gershwin and Alan Jay Lerner, among others.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I didn't know what this score would sound like. I started
to play the first page, and the first melody was so overwhelming. I
was unprepared for the way it unfolded and grew, almost like a
time-lapse photograph of a flower, in such an astonishingly
beautiful way.''
</P>
<P>
   Mauceri knew that some day he would have to conduct this music,
he said. But despite his reaction, he was not able to persuade
anyone to let him do it. Tentative plans for a production at the
Scottish Opera did not pan out, he said, and talks with the RIAS
Symphony Orchestra (now the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin)
and the Lincoln Center Festival also did not bear fruit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mentioned it to almost everybody,'' he said, ``but I
discovered that there was a reticence in dealing with music by
composers who were directly affected by Hitler that was written
after they had to emigrate.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile in Germany, Rolf Stiska, who had become the director
of Theater Chemnitz, was also pursuing ``The Eternal Road.'' Stiska
had come upon the work in the 1980s, when he was assistant director
of the Berliner Ensemble, the theater company founded by Brecht.
But what put ``The Eternal Road'' back onstage was the interest
that the city of Chemnitz had in its Jewish past.
</P>
<P>
   An industrial city that was known as Karl-Marx-Stadt when it was
part of East Germany, Chemnitz had decided after reunification that
it owed a debt to the Jews who had been forced to flee or had died
in the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   So in 1991 the municipal council began holding annual
celebrations of Jewish culture, inviting surviving Jews who had
fled in the '30s to visit, welcoming Jewish settlers from Russia
and the east _ there are now about 300 _ and planning to build a $6
million synagogue. Construction is to begin in March.
</P>
<P>
   Stiska contacted the Weill Foundation, which wanted Mauceri to
conduct ``The Eternal Road.'' Mauceri happily agreed. ``I thought
that for Chemnitz to do `The Eternal Road' was such a beautiful
idea,'' he said. After long negotiations led by Karl-Hans Moeller,
Theater Chemnitz's chief dramaturge, a multinational production was
mounted.
</P>
<P>
   The opera opened in Chemnitz last June and returned in November,
receiving standing ovations at all 12 sold-out performances. It is
a co-production of the Chemnitz Opera (which is part of Theater
Chemnitz), the Brooklyn Academy, the New Israeli Opera of Tel Aviv
and the Opera Krakow of Poland. The director, Michael Heinicke, is
German; the set and costume designer, David Sharir, is Israeli.
</P>
<P>
   The opera, which will be performed in German with English
supertitles, begins in a synagogue in an unnamed city after the
Jews have been told they must leave by sunrise or be killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among those in the synagogue is a 12-year-old boy, the son of
a doctor who is not a practicing Jew,'' Mauceri said. ``The son
asks why this is happening: Why must we be thrown out of our homes?
And the synagogue's rabbi opens the Torah and begins to read the
story of the Jews from the moment of Abraham. And here is where the
music begins.''
</P>
<P>
   The rabbi tells the tales _ Moses, David, Solomon, the prophets,
the destruction of the temple _ which are enacted onstage. ``We
imagine the biblical scenes through the mind of the child,''
Mauceri said. In the end, soldiers force the Jews from the
synagogue, but they feel hope through the promise of a Messiah.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boy finally understands his Jewishness,'' Mauceri said,
``and that the covenant continues forever, that no matter what
happens to the Jews, they will always be the children of God.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The opera was conceived when the American producer Meyer Weisgal
asked the German-Jewish director Max Reinhardt to create a musical
drama based on the Old Testament. Reinhardt asked Weill to compose
the score, and Franz Werfel, an Austrian Jew, to write the German
libretto. The three worked on the project from 1934 to 1936.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because Weill had been forced to flee, he decided to use his
musical style for `The Eternal Road' as a means of saying goodbye
to Germany,'' Mauceri said. ``He did so by making reference to the
great German ecclesiastical works. So you're never too far from
Bach or Handel. There are also references to `Don Giovanni,'
Verdi's `Nabucco,' Wagner's `Parsifal,' Schubert lieder, Mahler.''
</P>
<P>
   There are double choruses and fugues, Mauceri said, the kind of
writing not usually associated with Weill. ``And yet it is always
Weill,'' he said. ``There's the African rhythm he loved so much,
the tom-toms, the use of a solo trombone, the quirky orchestration
that becomes his signature. The musical journey is both a
compendium of the past and a fundamentally radiant vision of the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   The fundamental question, then, is why, given all this, ``The
Eternal Road'' was not performed in its entirety for nearly 63
years. (A concert version of Acts 3 and 4 was presented in October
1998 at Avery Fisher Hall by Leon Botstein and the American
Symphony Orchestra.)
</P>
<P>
   The answer, Mauceri said, has to do with what he considers a
post-World War II reaction to tonal music composed in the years
before the war, as well as to the postwar work of many emigre
composers, not just Weill but also Erich Korngold, Arnold
Schoenberg, Miklos Rosza and others.
</P>
<P>
   Mauceri, 54, a protege of Leonard Bernstein and a native New
Yorker has been music director of the Washington Opera, the Teatro
Regio in Turin, Italy, and the American Symphony Orchestra, as well
as a conductor for the New York City Opera and a fellow at the
American Academy in Berlin. He has in the last decade studied,
conducted and recorded a great deal of that lushly romantic music.
</P>
<P>
   ``I firmly believe that for many people it was too painful for
beauty to exist in the rubble of World War II,'' he said. ``Beauty
is seductive and leads to emotion. And one can understand clearly
why emotion could be viewed as a dangerous thing in postwar Europe.
And this vacuum, this chaos, was used to promulgate atonal music,
which would not have in it the memory of that time.''
</P>
<P>
   But now, he said, ``The Eternal Road'' s beginning to get its
due. After Brooklyn it is to be presented at the New Israeli Opera
and the Opera Krakow.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a time of complete loss, Weill found a way, through
acknowledging his own history, to create such a positive work of
art,'' Mauceri said. ``And this beautiful work, which all our
children have been deprived of hearing, is finally being heard.''

DOMINGO'S NEW SEASON: THE ACCENT IS SPANISH
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In announcing next season's schedule at the
Washington Opera, where he is artistic director, Spanish tenor
Placido Domingo let it be known with a smile last week that he had
just realized that six of the eight works were set in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really a surprise for me, even `Parsifal,''' Domingo
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parsifal,'' Wagner's quest for the Holy Grail, although
written in German, is set in the monastery at what is now
Montserrat, 30 miles west of Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am amazed how great composers have been inspired by Spain,
particularly Seville,'' Domingo said.
</P>
<P>
   Seville is the location for two related operas on the schedule,
Rossini's ``Barbiere di Siviglia'' and Mozart's ``Nozze di
Figaro.'' Somehow Domingo missed the third Sevillian war horse,
Bizet's ``Carmen.''
</P>
<P>
   Cervantes' ``Don Quixote,'' the classic story of a knight-errant
who journeys around Spain tilting at windmills, is on the schedule
in the form of Massenet's ``Don Quichotte.'' The two other
Spanish-theme operas on the list are by Verdi: ``Il Trovatore'' and
``Don Carlo.''
</P>
<P>
   The non-Spanish works on the Washington Opera schedule next year
are ``The Consul'' by Gian-Carlo Menotti, which is set in an
unnamed but apparently middle-European city, and Puccini's
``Turandot,'' which takes place in China.
</P>
<P>
   Domingo had one other bit of Spanish opera news.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986 he appeared with the Washington Opera in the first
performance of Menotti's ``Goya,'' which Domingo commissioned as
homage to that Spanish artist.
</P>
<P>
   It has not become part of the standard repertory, as he had
hoped, but Domingo said that the Theater an der Wien in Vienna
planned to mount it in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I am singing still,'' said the 59-year-old Domingo, ``I
will do it.''

   Agreement on Digital TV Appears Unfinished
</P>
<P>
   Again under threat from the chairman of the Federal
Communications Commission, the cable television and
consumer-electronics industries have said, once again, that they
have solved a vexing problem slowing the transition to digital TV,
how to connect a digital television set to a digital cable box.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue is not fully resolved. Hollywood and the
industries have not decided on a copy-protection standard, making
the whole agreement hollow, some analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Ashes of the Year 2000 Problem
</P>
<P>
   There is still widespread debate on the extent of the threat of
year 2000 computer problems. One clear example of how disruptive
year 2000 could have been, had no one taken precautions, involved a
credit-card payment system made by Cybercash. Some owners of small
businesses that use Cybercash, including Tzu Ming Yang, who owns a
restaurant in Baltimore, did not update their system software and
unwittingly billed their customers day after day for the same
transaction. Because of special rules aimed at discouraging year
2000 litigation passed last year by Congress, lawyers say it will
be spring at the earliest before lawsuits emerge involving the
Cybercash breakdowns or any others.

   Boeing Contract Talks Break Down
</P>
<P>
   Contract negotiations between Boeing and the union representing
its engineers and technical workers collapsed after three days of
discussions. Both the company and the union have said that they
could absorb a long strike, but both are already feeling the
effects.

   New Chip-Making System by IBM

   Technologists for IBM will describe details this week of a

the company thinks will make it possible in the future to shrink
individual circuits to a size nearly as small as atoms.

   Offline Alliances for Online Concerns
</P>
<P>
   A recent deal between Starbucks and the urban delivery service
Kozmo.com _ in which Starbucks will essentially set aside space in
its coffee shops for Kozmo _ may be the first example of an
established retailer offering its floor space and personnel to an
e-commerce company. Industry executives and analysts predict that
such agreements will come rapidly as Internet retailers struggle to
address two glaring vulnerabilities _ customer acquisition costs
and returns _ while continuing to close the gap between virtual and
traditional stores.

   The Kermit Connection in Germany
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a blitz of deal-making, Thomas Haffa, founder of EM.TV
and Merchandising of Germany, has become the Magilla Gorilla of
children's television. EM.TV owns the rights to thousands of
episodes of children's shows and is a prolific merchandiser of
toys, books and clothing. But he recently clinched the biggest deal
of his life: the $680 million purchase of the Jim Henson Co. and
its Muppets.

PATENTS: NEW TESTS FOR CERVICAL CANCER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Md.)  (lb) 
 By TERESA RIORDAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Named for its inventor, George Nicholas Papanicolaou, the Pap
smear test has saved millions of women's lives since it was
introduced in the United States in the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the Pap test, cervical cancer is no longer the
leading cause of death among American women. But although the test
has been improved over the decades, it is not perfect. It can miss
cancerous conditions in 30 percent of women who are at risk for
cancer. And every year it gives false-positive results for 3
million otherwise healthy women who have to undergo the anxiety of
being tested further.
</P>
<P>
   Last week two companies received patents covering new approaches
to cervical-cancer testing. Each company contends that its test
promises to be much more reliable than the traditional Pap smear.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, the cytotechnologist who examines a Pap smear _ which
is a scraping of cells from the cervix and vagina _ has to peer
through a microscope, hunting through tens of thousands of plump,
regularly shaped healthy cells that have small nuclei, to find as
few as a dozen misshapen, cancerous or precancerous cells that have
large or irregular nuclei.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over time, the physical challenge is daunting,'' said Steve
Chubb, chief executive officer of Matritech, a privately held
company based in Newton, Mass. That is, in part, why there is such
a high error rate, according to Chubb.
</P>
<P>
   Matritech, building on research done by two cell biologists at
Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the mid-1980s, has
patented a way to make cancerous and precancerous cells obtained in
a Pap smear either glow in the dark or turn bright red, thus making
them easier for the cytotechnologist to find.
</P>
<P>
   ``You put the cells on the slide as you would in a normal Pap
smear, but then you incubate the slide with our antibody,'' said
Ying-Jye Wu, Matritech's vice president for product development.
The antibody, called NMP179, which is tagged with a color or
fluorescent probe, latches onto a specific protein within the
abnormal cells.
</P>
<P>
   Acta Cytologica, a journal in the field of cell research,
published in its November-December 1999 issue the results of a
study in which NMP179 was used to to test 261 Pap smears. The test
detected cancerous cells in 96.7 percent of the cases that were
later diagnosed as likely to progress to invasive cancer.
</P>
<P>
   In two other preclinical studies involving atypical Pap smears _
Pap smears that were inconclusive _ the Matritech test was able to
identify 100 percent of the cases in which cancerous as well as
precancerous cells were present.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until now it has been impossible to identify which of those
women with atypical specimens are at high risk,'' said Dr. Martha
Hutchinson, director of cytopathology at Women and Infants'
Hospital in Providence, R.I., and one of the authors of the
studies.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, she said, the test may be a cost-effective tool for
figuring out which women with atypical Pap smears actually have
precancerous conditions. Currently, some $3 billion is spent every
year on additional tests for women with atypical Pap smears, even
though few of those women are at risk for cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Digene Corp., a publicly traded company in Gaithersburg, Md.,
uses a different approach with its test.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of looking for cancerous or precancerous cells, it looks
for evidence of certain strains of the human papilloma virus, HPV,
a sexually transmitted virus that has been implicated in virtually
all cases of cervical cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Two studies published last month in The Journal of the American
Medical Association found that the Digene test detected about 84
percent of cancerous and precancerous conditions.
</P>
<P>
   One drawback to the test, however, is that it is not recommended
for use in younger women. That is because HPV is present in a large
number of young sexually active women whose immune systems will
fight off the infection naturally. Thus in young women the test
would yield many false-positive results. It is only when the
infection lingers for a number of years that the cervical cancer
begins to develop.
</P>
<P>
   An advantage of the viral approach, according to Evan Jones,
chairman and chief executive officer of Digene, is that the test
can be combined with tests for chlamydia and other sexually
transmitted diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the exciting aspects is that they can all be performed
in a single clinical test,'' Jones said. And the test can be
performed by women themselves, which means that it might be more
readily adopted by women in countries where Pap smears are not
common practice.
</P>
<P>
   So what does the company's latest patent do? ``It allows us to
perform our tests on a gene-chip array,'' Jones said. ``So we can
measure the presence of the genes expressed from multiple HPV
viruses or other cancer-related genes simultaneously, with the same
diagnostic test. It's not necessary for our current generation of
products but will be applied to future tests.''
</P>
<P>
   Wu, Susan K. Keesee, and Robert Obar received patent 6,027,905,
which was assigned to Matritech. Attila T. Lorincz and Abel De La
Rosa received patent 6,027,897, which was assigned to Digene.
</P>
<P>
   Patents may be viewed on the Web at www.uspto.gov or may be
ordered through the mail, by patent number, for $3 from the Patent
and Trademark Office, Washington, DC 20231.

 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIEL, Germany _ Germany's Christian Democratic Union, punished
for the financial scandal that has engulfed the party and its
former chancellor, Helmut Kohl, crashed to a heavy defeat Sunday by
the governing Social Democrats in an election in the northern state
of Schleswig-Holstein.
</P>
<P>
   The loss for the Christian Democrats amounted to a stunning
turnabout. Just three months ago, opinion polls showed Volker
Ruehe, Kohl's last defense minister and the party's candidate for
premier in Schleswig-Holstein, with a seemingly unassailable 10
percentage point lead over the Social Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But then Kohl admitted taking more than $1 million in secret _
and therefore illegal _ payments from unidentified donors and the
center-right party that had governed Germany for most of the
postwar years went into a tailspin.
</P>
<P>
   For all his insistence that the vote was about conditions in
this state of 2.8 million people, and not about the Christian
Democrats' national woes, Ruehe, 57, could not reverse a slide
accentuated by Kohl's continuing refusal to obey the law and name
his donors.
</P>
<P>
   Reliable projections from German television showed the Social
Democrats gaining 43.3 percent of the vote, an increase of 3.5
percent from the last election here in 1996, and the Christian
Democrats with 34.9 percent, a drop of 2.3 per cent.
</P>
<P>
   Fireworks lit the night sky over this port city as the results
returning the Social Democratic state premier, Heidi Simonis, to
office were announced. She will continue to govern in a coalition
with the Green Party, which took 6.1 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The result amounted to the first concrete confirmation of the
Christian Democrats' electoral plight since the financial scandal
broke late last year. But it also suggested that widespread fears
that the conservative party might disintegrate as Italy's Christian
Democrats did in the 1990s are premature. ``I averted a
catastrophe,'' Ruehe insisted. ``The Christian Democratic party has
at least been stabilized.''
</P>
<P>
   A ``catastrophe'' for the Christian Democrats would have
involved a drop below 30 percent in this state, which has changed
hands many times since World War II and been a useful bellwether of
party political fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   But the evidence that any real ``stabilization'' has been
achieved appeared slender. Ruehe had a clear interest in portraying
the result in the best possible light because he is a candidate to
succeed Wolfgang Schaeuble as leader of the Christian Democratic
party. Schaeuble, who has also admitted taking illegal funds, quit
this month.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even a figure of Ruehe's relative stature could not hurt the
Social Democrats in a state where unemployment has hovered around
10 percent. It is far from clear that the Christian Democrats have
reached the nadir of their travails.
</P>
<P>
   A strong showing by the Free Democrats, Germany's most
market-oriented party, suggested that some voters have migrated to
them from the Christian Democrats. The party's share of the vote
went up to 7.5 percent from 5.7 percent. There was no evidence here
of any migration from the Christian Democrats to far-right parties.
</P>
<P>
   Angela Merkel, the general secretary of the Christian Democrats
and one of Ruehe's chief rivals for the post of party leader, said
the party was disappointed at its loss. But in a show of
magnanimity, she praised her rival for doing better than expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Christian Democrats are coming out of the trough,'' Merkel
said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the clearest trend from the election was the
extraordinary revival of the Social Democratic chancellor, Gerhard
Schroeder, whose party lost five state elections last year as he
floundered in his first year in office, prompting widespread
suggestions that he might not survive his four-year term.
</P>
<P>
   But that was before the glorious reputation of Kohl, the unifier
of Germany, was tarnished. The former chancellor has said he cannot
break the promise he gave anonymous donors that their identities
would not be revealed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters have inflicted two black eyes, one on the Christian
Democrats, and one on Ruehe,'' said Franz Muentefering, the general
secretary of the Social Democratic Party, his smug expression
capturing its new-found confidence.
</P>
<P>
   After wavering as to whether his true constituency lay with the
business world, to whom he had promised a slimmed-down state and
lower taxation, or the workers and state employees that have
traditionally provided the backbone of Social Democracy, Schroeder
has acted decisively of late to cut taxes and reform what he has
called ``the German nanny state.''
</P>
<P>
   With the country's attention focused on the gathering problems
of the Christian Democrats, he has been able to do this with
relative impunity, winning votes in the center while reassuring
workers with the message that an invigorated economy will
eventually be good for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Ruehe, sometimes called the Rambo of German politics for his
bruising style, campaigned long and hard in this largely
agricultural state. His ambitions to become chancellor are well
known. Indeed, he once prompted the prickly Kohl to demand his
resignation as defense minister simply for having mentioned that he
might one day aspire to the top job. By the end of his 16-year
chancellorship, Kohl had no patience with any suggestion that his
own rule might one day have to come an end.

<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ Regional parties have humbled both of India's
national parties in state elections whose results became final
Sunday, emphatically reaffirming that the days when a pan-India
party could dominate the nation's politics are dead and gone.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party
was that two of its allies in its governing coalition _ one in the
agriculturally rich northern state of Haryana and another in the
poor eastern state of Orissa _ won thumping victories.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news for the Hindu party, one of India's two national
parties, is that its candidates performed miserably in Haryana and
came in a distant second to its ally in Orissa.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, its allies in Haryana and Orissa may well be
emboldened to demand a bigger role in the national government and a
larger share of patronage for their states.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest shock to the national party came in the most
important contest, in India's second-largest state, Bihar, in the
north. There, every pollster and Hindu party leader had predicted
the downfall of Laloo Prasad Yadav, the shrewd, resilient
politician whose state party has ruled Bihar for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   But Yadav's party has emerged with 123 seats in the state
legislative assembly, one more than Bharatiya Janata and its allies
combined. Neither side has an outright majority in the 324-member
assembly. Bihar, with a population of 100 million, now faces a
bruising contest to see whether Yadav or the alliance led by the
Hindu party can collect enough extra votes from other parties to
form a government.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an era of coalition,'' said Prime Minister Atal Behari
Vajpayee, who heads the Bharatiya Janata Party, when talking about
the disappointing results for his party in Bihar. ``We have to
learn the tricks of running a coalition government.''
</P>
<P>
   Yadav faces a raft of corruption charges, and Bihar itself has
one of the most pitiful performances among Indian state economies.
But Yadav was able to hold onto enough of his core constituencies _
Muslims and members of peasant castes and of the formerly
untouchable castes now known as Dalits _ to stay in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Hindu nationalists, who draw most of their support in Bihar
from the upper castes, had allied themselves with Ram Vilas Paswan,
a Dalit leader in a regional party. But Paswan's popularity was
undermined by his association with the upper caste party, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laloo has not delivered economically, but he has been able to
give social respectability to the most depressed sections of the
population,'' said Shaibal Gupta, who heads the Asian Development
Research Institute, based in Bihar's capital, Patna.
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee conceded that the results in Bihar were below
expectations. ``We will have to look into why we did not get
expected success,'' he told reporters in the city of Lucknow.
</P>
<P>
   The election results were even worse for the other national
party, the Congress Party, which suffered its worst loss ever in
the national elections five months ago and has clearly failed to
turn the tide since.
</P>
<P>
   The latest defeats are likely to continue to dim the reputation
of the Congress leader, Sonia Gandhi, widow of former Prime
Minister Rajiv Gandhi and the Italian-born inheritor of the Gandhi
political dynasty. Sonia Gandhi was seen as the party's savior when
she emerged to campaign for the party in the 1998 elections after
years of seclusion following her husband's assassination in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   But the results in this set of elections could hardly be more
different from the Congress Party's rousing sweep of state
elections a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the Congress Party, which was in power in Orissa,
suffered a crushing defeat to a state party, the Biju Janata Dal.
</P>
<P>
   Gandhi's hand-picked choice for chief minister in Orissa,
Giridhar Gamang, a tribal leader, proved highly unpopular. And the
party itself was widely blamed for mishandling relief efforts after
a horrific cyclone last year that devastated the region and killed
9,500 people.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Haryana and Bihar, Congress remained a marginal factor _ and
may have little choice but to join forces with Yadav in Bihar,
despite Congress' harsh criticism of him, to stop its Hindu
nationalist rival from coming to power there.
</P>
<P>
   As defeat loomed, Gandhi went on the offensive. During the first
days of the parliamentary session on Thursday and Friday, the
Congress Party rallied the opposition in rowdy demonstrations
against a new policy in the Hindu nationalist-governed state of
Gujarat that Gandhi decried as an attack on India's secular
traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Shouting slogans and sitting cross-legged on a lawn across from
Parliament House, with a hulking statue of the the independence
leader Mohandas K. Gandhi behind her, the usually shy, reserved
Sonia Gandhi on Thursday attacked the central government for
failing to stop the government in Gujarat from allowing civil
servants to join the Hindu party's parent organization.
</P>
<P>
   That organization, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, known as the
RSS, has portrayed itself as a cultural group, but opposition
leaders maintain that its political agenda is to make Hinduism the
supreme religion of India, threatening the rights of Muslims and
other religious minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Gandhi was back to being her quiet self on the floor of
Parliament on Friday and left the job of speaking to another party
leader, Madhavrao Scindia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ideology of the RSS has spread poison throughout the
length and breadth of this country,'' he said, as Hindu nationalist
members nearly drowned him out with angry shouts.
</P>
<P>
   Gandhi has made no public comment about the party's most recent
losses.

TOUGH, CHEERFUL MAYOR OF MEXICO CITY WINS HEARTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The first woman to become mayor of Mexico City,
Rosario Robles Berlanga, liked what she heard from her police chief
over her cellular phone. She snapped it shut and broke into one of
her broad, beaming smiles.
</P>
<P>
   A day earlier, 2,000 policemen, in a wildcat protest, blocked
several avenues and created a traffic catastrophe downtown. The
rampage started over a bonus the city said it had accidentally
failed to pay, but it continued even after cashiers rushed to the
mutinous precinct to make amends.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of risking violence by sending other policemen against
the rebel officers, Robles simply took to the airwaves to demand
order. The next morning her police chief called to report that she
had won the showdown. At dawn the protesting officers skulked back
to their station, apologizing sheepishly.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're hung over and repentant,'' she said triumphantly,
``like bad husbands.''
</P>
<P>
   In the five months since she took over as mayor, Robles has
surprised beleaguered residents of the capital city by convincingly
and cheerfully taking command of one of the largest and most
chaotic metropolises in the world.
</P>
<P>
   She had held the second-highest job in city government since
1997, when Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, Mexico's best-known opposition
politician, won the first election ever held for mayor. Last Sept.
29 Cardenas tapped Robles, his deputy, to complete his term, which
ends next fall, when he stepped down to run for president.
</P>
<P>
   But awkwardly for both Cardenas and his successor, Robles
quickly proved to be spunkier, more efficient and more appealing
than her dour mentor.
</P>
<P>
   As early as Dec. 6, in a survey by the newspaper Reforma, the
city residents who were polled gave her an approval score of 6.6 on
a scale of 10. Cardenas' highest grade in the quarterly polls was
5.5.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of Robles, 44, is part of a boom for women in Mexican
politics. Never before have so many women been in such high places.
In this crucial election year, Amalia Garcia, 48, is president of
Robles' left-of-center Party of the Democratic Revolution. Dulce
Maria Sauri Riancho, also 48, is president of the governing
Institutional Revolutionary Party. There are two women in the
cabinet, Foreign Minister Rosario Green, 58, and Environment
Minister Julia Carabias, 46. Maria de los Angeles Moreno, 55, is
president of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Women won suffrage in Mexico in 1955. But in the 1990s, as the
authoritarian country opened up to electoral competition, parties
on all sides began to see that they needed women's votes and
therefore needed women in high-profile positions.
</P>
<P>
   After striving for decades to ascend in the power structure,
many capable women were ready to jump on the opportunities that
finally opened up to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Firm government with a soft hand,'' is Robles' motto. She made
her mark with a move that would have been unthinkable just a few
years ago. When President Ernesto Zedillo decided to go on an
official tour of the city for the first time since the opposition
took over, he did not call to invite Robles to come along until the
day before.
</P>
<P>
   So she stood him up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half the people in the city, who are Mexican women, felt
avenged,'' she said in an interview in the jaunty black jeep in
which the mayor, who hates helicopters, whizzes between speeches
and ceremonies. ``Men are always leaving us in the lurch. This
time, for once, it was the other way around.''
</P>
<P>
   She has issued a 10-point code of conduct for the unruly
metropolis. She exercised a kind of maternal authority to ask
citizens to be nicer to one another. Point No. 1: do not
double-park. Previous Mexico City rulers were either too distant or
too corrupt to be able to call on citizens to change their habits.
</P>
<P>
   With Robles, residents were pleased by her confidence that they
could be more civil, although it is too early to tell whether they
will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bad government has damaged the city's social fabric,'' she
said. ``There is too much disorder. People are crying out for
rules. The key thing is to arrive at the rules by popular
consensus.''
</P>
<P>
   One challenge was the long student strike at the national
university, whose campus occupies a huge corner of the city. At one
point the strikers decided to march, at rush hour and without a
permit, down the main commuter highway around the capital. In an
afternoon of high drama, Robles sent unarmed mounted police
officers to block the protesters' path, then negotiated on the spot
to persuade them to detour onto a service road instead.
</P>
<P>
   Both major television networks covered the standoff live for
hours. When the students finally agreed to leave the highway
peaceably, the whole city sighed in relief. The strike was finally
ended early this month when the federal police raided the campus.
</P>
<P>
   Political opponents who tangle with the mayor often get bruised.
In January Robles published, with great fanfare, her personal
financial statement and challenged Oscar Espinosa Villareal, the
last appointed mayor from President Zedillo's party, to do the
same. When Espinosa put up a series of conditions to reveal his
holdings, she immediately agreed to all of them. In the end he
retreated into silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have my skirt on straight and I accept my
responsibilities,'' she told the press, recasting a classic Mexican
phrase defining macho men as having their pants on straight.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is bold but not foolhardy,'' said Alfonso Zarate, a
political analyst who lives in Mexico City. ``She is warm, a little
coquettish, but you never doubt for a minute that you are dealing
with a woman of power.''
</P>
<P>
   A self-declared ``woman of the left,'' Robles got her start in
politics as a student radical and her training as a leader of the
tough employees' union at the national university, where she was a
professor of economics. She is married to a college professor she
met two decades ago in the student movement and has one teen-age
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   While she remains devoted to her former boss, Cardenas, she
treads a fine line, trying to boost his presidential campaign with
her strong performance without eclipsing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really I am just harvesting what he planted,'' she said
diplomatically. While it is true that Cardenas devised programs
that have reduced crime and police corruption and improved air
quality, it is Robles' flair for connecting with constituents that
has made them appreciate the gains.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere she goes, when people see her open face topped by
girlish bangs, they drop formalities and call her instinctively by
her first name. At a recent public meeting held in a working-class
borough to discuss her anti-crime programs, women from the audience
flocked to hug and kiss her like a long-lost friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day, on every corner where I stop, I see the response of
the women,'' Robles said. ``When we grew up, the faces in the
political photos always belonged to men. Now I send a powerful
message.''
</P>
<P>
   In a megalopolis where politics is often grim and wearing,
Robles gives the impression that she is having the time of her
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it all,'' she said. ``I love being in contact with
people. I love to have an impact on their lives.''

AFTER HIS KNOCKOUT PUNCH, DE LA HOYA WORKS ON HIS NEXT MOVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Oscar De La Hoya had promised to be more aggressive
and seek the knockout, after a disappointing loss to Felix Trinidad
last Sept. 18. Against Derrell Coley on Saturday night at Madison
Square Garden, De La Hoya was not any more aggressive than he has
been in the past, but he did seek the knockout.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya leveled Coley, who was counted out at exactly three
minutes of the seventh round to put an end to a fight where Coley
was clearly overmatched. De La Hoya decked Coley with a wicked left
hook to the body and referee Wayne Kelly counted Coley out as he
kneeled down trying to catch his breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first round I felt he wouldn't knock me out,'' De La Hoya
said. ``You can feel the power from the get-go. I was going forward
to pressure him and try to get him tired. I was blocking most of
his punches. I didn't want to just start throwing punches and going
crazy. I wanted to be careful. My trainer was telling me to just be
patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Coley stunned De La Hoya in the fourth round with a solid right,
but he did not have enough skill or firepower to follow up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I had Oscar hurt,'' Coley said. ``I just didn't have
enough to take Oscar out. I just burned myself out.''
</P>
<P>
   Coley admitted he was not accustomed to fighting a high-caliber
fighter at a world-championship level.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very high level of boxing I was in and me not being
at the championship level hurt me,'' Coley said.
</P>
<P>
   But that did not hurt as much as the left hook that De La Hoya
knocked him out with.
</P>
<P>
   ``It knocked the wind out of me,'' Coley said. ``I thought if I
could take a knee, I could recover. I had blown my nose and I
couldn't see out of my right eye. While I was on my knee I thought
about getting up and I started thinking about my family. I didn't
think it was worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Coley earned $1 million for the fight. The largest payday of his
career. De La Hoya earned $5 million and can now contemplate his
next move.
</P>
<P>
   He said it does not matter to him whether he fights Trinidad
next or Shane Mosley. Trinidad will fight David Reid, the World
Boxing Association super welterweight champion, on March 3 in Las
Vegas. Trinidad will have to win in order to fight De La Hoya in a
rematch on June 10 in Las Vegas. If Trinidad loses, then De La Hoya
will fight Mosley on June 17 in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Arum, De La Hoya's promoter, and Don King, Trinidad's
promoter, are supposed to meet in Las Vegas on Thursday to try to
finish hammering out the details of a two-fight deal between De La
Hoya and Trinidad. The whole thing could fall apart over a pound or
two. A maximum of 151 pounds is on the table; De La Hoya does not
want to give Trinidad, who will fight Reid at 154 pounds, much of
an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be negotiated that we can step up a couple of pounds,''
De La Hoya said. ``But I'm not going to move up just so I can fight
a guy. This is my weight class. I started out at 130 pounds. I've
already moved up four weight classes.''
</P>
<P>
   If a deal with Trinidad cannot be reached, then De La Hoya will
move on to a fight with Mosley, who just recently moved up to 147
pounds. Mosley, who was the International Boxing Federation
lightweight champion a year ago, has knocked out both the opponents
he has faced at 147 pounds. He says he is ready for De La Hoya,
particularly the De La Hoya he saw fight Coley on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't look like he was at his best,'' Mosley said of De La
Hoya. ``If he was at his best, then that De La Hoya is going to be
in trouble against me.''
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya acknowledged that Mosley is a much more aggressive
fighter than Coley is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guarantee that he will change against me,'' De La Hoya said.
</P>
<P>
   The cofeature bout on Saturday night ended on a weighty note.
Arturo Gatti knocked out Joey Gamache in the second round of a
scheduled 10-round junior welterweight bout. Both Gatti and Gamache
weighed in at 141 pounds on Friday afternoon, although Gamache and
his manager disputed the accuracy of the scales. They thought they
were light to accommodate Gatti, whom they believe was
significantly overweight. Gatti jumped on the scales, which were
set at 141 pounds, and then quickly jumped off. He immediately
downed a large container of juice. New York State Athletic
Commission officials said there was nothing wrong with the scales
and that Gatti made weight.
</P>
<P>
   When Gatti entered the ring on Saturday night he weighed 160
pounds and Gamache weighed 147. Gamache was fighting a
middleweight.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to do something about the way that weigh-ins are
conducted,'' said Lou DiBella, the senior vice president of
programming for HBO/TVKO. ``You can't have one guy weighing 160
pounds and another guy weighing 147. That fight had nothing to do
with a skills mismatch. It was a physical mismatch.''

<P>
   The young and Harry-saturated arrived at Joseph-Beth Booksellers
in Cincinnati in numbers that startled adults like a Hogwarts magic
spell.
</P>
<P>
   Even the 9-year-olds were desperate; they had exhausted the
available supply of three Harry Potter books with frequent readings
and yearned for some palliatives until the fourth book appears
sometime this summer.
</P>
<P>
   And so the folks at Joseph-Beth, who organized the group and
christened it the Harry Potter Withdrawal Club, comforted its
members with the adventures of Dorothy in ``The Wonderful Wizard of
Oz,'' and with ``The Book of Three,'' the first volume in a
35-year-old series about a gallant pig keeper named Taran and his
nemesis, the grim Horn King.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been doing kids' books for 10 years, and I've never seen
anything like this, kids coming in and saying give me something
like this book,'' said Wendi Gratz, a children's buyer for the
Joseph-Beth's chain, who counted 20 children ages 9 to 13 at the
inaugural meeting of the club, one of hundreds organized by
bookstores around the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the literary halo effect of J.K. Rowling's best-selling
fantasy series. It has turned knobby-kneed Harry Potter into the
Medici patron of children's literature.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the sales of children's books soared on the windstream
of Harry's Nimbus 2000 flying broom. Classics like C.S. Lewis'
``Chronicles of Narnia'' experienced an otherwise inexplicable
burst in popularity, as did newer fantasy titles like Brian
Jacques' ``Redwall'' series, which had been selling well and
steadily over the years until Hogwarts magic gave it a sudden lift.
</P>
<P>
   The Potter series _ with more than 18.5 million copies in print
from its publisher, Scholastic _ accounted for much of the general
sales growth in children's literature. Last year paperback sales
alone increased almost 24 percent to $660 million and hardcover
sales grew more than 11 percent to $1.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Publishers said they suspected that the sales were buoyed, in
part, by a prosperous economy, but that theory does not extend to
adult books. Hardcover sales to adults increased a modest 2.6
percent to $2.8 billion last year, while trade paperback sales grew
a little over 3 percent to almost $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   That literary divide was sharply apparent this month when
youthful readers demonstrated their growing cultural clout. For the
first time, five children's novels elbowed aside the grown-up fare
on the fiction best-seller list of The New York Times on Feb. 20,
with a sixth juvenile title, ``Holes,'' by Louis Sachar, hovering
on the fringes of best-sellerdom. (The Times is now considering
creating a separate children's list.)
</P>
<P>
   All of the best-selling children's novels _ three of them the
Harry Potter titles _ are 230 to 400 pages and emphasize a linear
plot, vivid writing, a high degree of sophistication and few, if
any, illustrations.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Lucas, 11, a charter member of the Harry Potter
Withdrawal Club in Cincinnati, said Harry, the junior wizard, has
given him a taste for exactly this sort of literature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always liked reading, but after Harry Potter I got more into
the magic ones than the normals,'' he said on Friday while at home
with the flu and speeding to the end of his current book, ``Wayside
School Gets a Little Stranger,'' by Louis Sachar.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a completely different world,'' he said of his new
penchant for fantasy titles with a touch of magic. ``You know how
they make books and movies for TV? I've read the books, and my mom
would get the video. I've noticed that every single time the book
is better than the video.''
</P>
<P>
   Librarians and booksellers say that as mighty as Harry is, there
is no doubt that other factors are also driving the fantasy book
boom. They cite a prosperous economy, growing efforts by parents to
encourage children to read and perhaps an inflation in purchases by
adults who are buying children's books to read themselves. Some
experts also said the Potter boom was not an undiluted plus.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of halo effect from Harry Potter that's positive
and negative,'' said Diane Garrett, owner of Diane's Books in
Greenwich, Conn., which on Wednesday attracted nearly 150 children
and adults to a reading of the newest ``Redwall'' book by Jacques.
```Harry Potter' is getting many people to read who wouldn't pick
up a book. But what's happening is that it's eclipsing some of the
literature. Kids don't want to read about animals, or they don't
want to read fabulous things for their own age, or they're reading
Harry too young. So we're spending a lot of time reminding parents
that their kids are too young for `Harry.'''
</P>
<P>
   But tell that to the four children of the Jernick family of
Portola Valley, Calif. Ranging in age from 5 to 14, they have all
worked their way through the Potter books and are now exploring
other literary fare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've read all of the `Redwall' books,'' said Michael Jernick,
14. That is no small boast, since he has gone through 12 books in
the fantasy series about Redwall Abbey mice by Jacques, whose
latest book, ``The Legend of Luke,'' occupies grown-up best-seller
real estate. ``I've also read all three Harry Potter books,'' he
added. ``And I have to read the next one. I can't wait. But I have
to read different things.''
</P>
<P>
   With the ascendance of the high kiddie literary form, publishing
executives are already rushing to capitalize. Their promotions
offer various solutions to the question that librarians and
booksellers say they now frequently face: Children ask what else
they can read while they wait for the next ``Harry Potter'' book.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I would say this, but for the first time I'm
grateful to `Harry Potter,''' said a keen Potter competitor, Craig
Virden, the publisher of Random House Children's Books, where net
sales were up by 12 percent last year and are expected to rise by
double digits again this year. ``I think `Harry Potter' has made
reading cool. The best advertisement you can have is a kid talking
to another kid about a book.''

</P>
<P>
   The ``Harry'' halo effect has touched classics like ``The Lion,
the Witch and the Wardrobe,'' the first book in C.S. Lewis'
``Chronicles of Narnia'' series, which was first published in 1950.
All seven titles reliably sell about 1.7 million copies a year for
the publisher, HarperCollins, but in the first half of the
company's fiscal year sales have already reached that amount.
</P>
<P>
   Sales have also tripled for Lloyd Alexander's ``Chronicles of
Prydain'' series about Taran, the assistant pig keeper, which in
ordinary years sells about 10,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Harry Potter's creator, Rowling, expressed a fondness
for Dodie Smith's 1948 book, ``I Capture the Castle,'' about
17-year-old Cassandra who keeps a 6-penny journal of life in a
ramshackle English castle. In response, the book's publisher, St.
Martin's Press, immediately repackaged the book, included an
endorsement from Rowling on the cover, and then watched a steady
backlist title rise in sales to 54,000 from 11,000.
</P>
<P>
   Young Americans are making reading choices that show a distinct
preference for a backdrop with a British accent. The ``Potter''
series, the ``Narnia'' books and ``I Capture the Castle'' are all
set in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   This month the American Booksellers Association and its Book
Sense marketing staff polled independent booksellers on their
recommendations for what they are calling Harry Potter Deprivation
Clubs.
</P>
<P>
   The top response from 400 stores was ``The Golden Compass,'' a
416-page fantasy about an orphan named Lyra who grows up near
Oxford University and, naturally, is caught in a life-and-death
struggle against dark forces.
</P>
<P>
   The group's Top 10 list also includes classics like ``The
Hobbit,'' Edward Eager's 50-year-old ``Half Magic'' and Madeleine
L'Engle's ``Wrinkle in Time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard from hundreds of independent stores, and they're
all producing lists and fliers or Harry Potter recommendations to
meet the demand,'' said Carl Lennertz, a marketing consultant for
the national Book Sense marketing campaign. ``It's funny, I could
have begged my daughter to read `The Hobbit,' but she might not
have ever read it if this hadn't happened. There's a little bit of
peer pressure. You've got to keep up, but once they're in, they're
hooked.''
</P>
<P>
   The burst in sales of juvenile novels follows a gloomy period in
the late 1990s when the children's paperback market dipped by
almost 20 percent, as fans started abandoning the popular
``Goosebumps'' horror series. Over a two-year period through 1998,
customers were buying fewer copies of children's books, according
to the Consumer Research Study on Book Purchasing, which has not
yet released its 1999 study.
</P>
<P>
   Last year consultants for the Association of American Publishers
developed long-term projections that underestimated the percentage
growth in children's hardcover sales by over half, because they had
not factored in what Albert N. Greco, who helped develop the
projections, calls the ``titanic of book publishing: `Harry
Potter.'''
</P>
<P>
   The trends involving younger readers are clearly at odds with
those for younger adults, who according to surveys are devoting
less money and time to books. (People over 49 remain loyal
customers with increasing sales levels.)
</P>
<P>
   At Books of Wonder in New York, the clerks are approached about
four times a day by children and adults who are seeking post-Potter
reading material, said Jennifer Lavonier, manager and buyer for the
store. By now the response has a certain rhythm: Employees hand a
packet to customers that includes ``Harry Potter'' games and
questions and a list of some 20 other children's novels to
consider.
</P>
<P>
   Lavonier said she suspected that adults were seeking children's
novels for themselves because ``there's a lot of imagination in
children's books.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of scenery and detail that's not in some adult
books,'' she said. ``To be honest, I don't really even read adult
books anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   That view has resulted in some odd role reversals.
Eleven-year-old Logan Dill of Kentucky is currently rereading the
three books in the ``Harry Potter'' series to her father while
driving on errands with him in the family car.
</P>
<P>
   She is the most dedicated member of Joseph-Beth's Harry Potter
Withdrawal Club. Although attendance for club meetings has been up
and down, Logan is already planning to read the club's choice for
April, ``The Golden Compass,'' and has voluntarily finished ``The
Black Cauldron,'' the second title in the Lloyd Alexander
``Chronicles of Prydain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still waiting for the fourth `Harry Potter' book,'' she
said. ``But the books I've been reading have really helped. There's
nothing that can compare to Harry, but these books have really
helped fill the gap.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Logan has nearly finished reading the third ``Harry
Potter'' to her father, she has found relief just in time. In a few
days she said she will begin reading aloud ``The Black Cauldron''
series to her father.

<P>
   ROCKINGHAM, N.C. _ Bobby Labonte showed Sunday that the Joe
Gibbs Racing Pontiacs are capable of making it a long season for
their Winston Cup competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte solved the mystery of handling on a temperamental track
and drove away from a charging Dale Earnhardt Sr. to win Sunday's
Dura-Lube/Kmart 400 at North Carolina Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte and his teammate Tony Stewart, who finished fourth
Sunday, have combined to win four of the last five Winston Cup
points events, including the final three races of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is exciting to win this early,'' said Labonte, who didn't
visit Victory Lane last year until June 4 at Dover, Del. ''To know
that we've got (a win) under our belt, we can just go week in, week
out, like we did this weekend and last weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   With the victory, Labonte moved to second in the point
standings, five points behind Daytona 500 winner Dale Jarrett, who
finished fifth in the 400.
</P>
<P>
   But Labonte said he's not concerned with the standings. ''After
just two races, I'm not even thinking about the championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Labonte's Pontiac was out front two times Sunday for 134 laps,
including the final 113. He was two seconds ahead of Earnhardt, who
chopped four seconds off Labonte's margin over the final 40 laps.
</P>
<P>
   ''(Earnhardt) was catching us every time at the end of a long
run,'' Labonte said. ''We were just able to stay in front of him
the last time.''
</P>
<P>
   It was his first win at ''The Rock'' for Labonte, who has been
racing at the track since he ran a go-cart in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt, who has maintained all season that the new body on
his Chevrolet Monte Carlo is inferior, at times had the fastest car
on the track.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just sort of saved my tires and did the best I could with
it,'' Earnhardt said. ''It was tire management. I just ran out of
time. I needed a few more laps to catch (Labonte).''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt still maintained that his car's body - introduced this
season - does not have enough downforce on the front.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were handicapped with a lot of shove on the front end and
no downforce,'' Earnhardt said.
</P>
<P>
   Ward Burton, whose sole Winston Cup victory came at Rockingham
in 1995, led four times for 100 laps and finished third.
</P>
<P>
   ''It just wasn't our day to win,'' Burton said. ''We adjusted on
the car at the end and were faster than Earnhardt and as fast as
Labonte. We just ran out of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Stewart, Labonte's teammate at Joe Gibbs Racing, finished
fourth, giving Pontiacs three of the top five spots.
</P>
<P>
   ''Probably the driver was hurting us a little bit today,''
Stewart said. ''He probably drove a little too hard at the
beginning of runs and was hurting the tires a little too much.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Passengers who fly economy class may soon find the back of the
plane a little more comfortable _ if they can find seats.
</P>
<P>
   In the first widespread change in the passenger cabin since the
creation of business class two decades ago, several large airlines
are now overhauling their coach sections.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to increase profits, but different carriers are
trying far different routes to that end. British Airways and United
Airlines are dividing their coach cabins into two classes _ premium
and economy _ and charging passengers more if they want the extra
legroom of premium. American Airlines, meanwhile, is removing two
rows of seats in coach cabins to give all passengers three more
inches of sprawl space at no extra charge. Only one other carrier,
Virgin Atlantic, offers gradations within coach, having introduced
them several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Some passengers are decidedly enthusiastic. ``This extra room in
coach will make a big difference for me,'' said Harry Dodge, a
retired owner of an oil well services company, who is 6 foot 4
inches tall. ``I have taken some transcontinental flights and
developed some painful cramps in my legs. I swore that I would
never fly again.''
</P>
<P>
   But passengers paying rock-bottom fares _ whether keeping the
same legroom, on British Air and United, or getting slightly more,
on American _ will have fewer seats available to them. This will
often lead to more crowded planes _ and more competition for
coveted overhead luggage space.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines are betting that in a booming economy, enough
passengers will be willing to pay more for extra legroom _ 3 to 7
inches, depending on the airline. By creating premium economy
service _ separate from existing business class _ the carriers can
accommodate more business travelers, who buy only 20 percent of all
airline tickets yet account for half the industry's profits. At the
same time, the airlines can rely less on budget passengers, whose
fares are sometimes so low that the carriers lose money on them.
</P>
<P>
   How much more will travelers pay? That could vary widely. On a
United flight from New York to Chicago, for example, an Economy
Plus ticket sells for $1,094 (compared with $1,602 for first
class), while the cheapest economy seat is priced at $324. On
American from New York to Chicago, the lowest fare is $209. But
with fewer coach seats available, that fare is likely to sell out
faster, forcing economy passengers to pay at least 20 percent more
for the next available discount fare.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways said it has yet to finalize the fare structure
for its premium economy cabin, to be called World Traveler Plus.
Some seats will cost 20 percent more than the full-coach fare,
although discounts will be available.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, the changes will merely sort out some of the
disparities that are already widespread among coach passengers,
where a business traveler paying, say, $1,000 for a flight might be
seated next to a vacationer paying $200. Often, airlines will give
higher-paying ticket holders more elbow room, but there is no
guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   The new strategy is risky. If the economy turns sour and
travelers cut back, the carriers will have to slash fares to tempt
them back on board. The airlines making the changes will have fewer
coach seats to sell to generate volume.
</P>
<P>
   ``American's move is a big win for consumers,'' said Samuel
Buttrick, an airline analyst at PaineWebber. ``But it's not a way
to increase profitability. What's good for consumers is not always
good for the airline industry.''
</P>
<P>
   But the changes could work against some travelers. They could
prevent ``backpackers,'' as airlines derisively call bargain
hunters, from finding as many low-cost fares. And budget travelers
may soon find less room for their carry-on luggage, since some
airlines are increasing the baggage weight limit for higher-paying
passengers and that might lead to allowances for bulkier bags.
</P>
<P>
   The move to give coach passengers more legroom _ especially by
American _ has also ignited a nasty spat among the world's largest
carriers. Gordon M. Bethune, chairman and chief executive of
Continental Airlines, said he was looking at the changes at United
and American, but apparently not very seriously. In a recent
interview, he dismissed both carriers' moves as ``fads.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe at Continental in giving people what they will pay
for,'' Bethune said. ``And at the end of the day, many passengers
want to pay the cheapest airfare. There's more to a good product
than a few inches of extra legroom. That's a dumb approach by a
bunch of mediocre airlines.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, United takes exception. ``Every airline is
different,'' said Matthew Triaca, a United spokesman. ``During the
past few years, we have captured a large share of the business
traveler market. They have told us that they want a product that
rewards them when they pay a full fare.''
</P>
<P>
   Not every airline is tinkering with its coach cabin. Delta Air
Lines has said it is ``evaluating various options'' regarding its
economy seats. But many industry consultants said they were unsure
if the trend toward offering more legroom in coach would sweep the
business.
</P>
<P>
   Despite often hostile complaints about cramped seating, some
travelers are not overly concerned. A recent internal Delta survey
of its passengers suggested that most choose their carriers based
on flight schedule, price and frequent flier miles. Few Delta
passengers have asked for more legroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seat size and the quality of meals are way down the list,''
said David S. Stempler, president of the Air Travelers Association,
a Washington-based group for passengers. ``A lack of privacy is an
issue with some passengers. The extra space may help alleviate
that. But some passengers will always go for the cheap fares.''
</P>
<P>
   Airline executives expect the roomier cabin space _ notably from
United, British Air and Virgin Atlantic _ to attract many frequent
travelers. But the biggest market for the seats is among business
travelers, who often pay a lofty full-coach fare and wind up
sitting next to the restrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``This class of cabin has worked well for us,'' said Richard
Branson, Virgin's chairman. ``Why should someone pay full-coach
fare and get the same exact service as someone who paid $99 for a
ticket? There's no other industry where that happens.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Presser, a New York investment banker, recently sat in
United's Economy Plus cabin on a flight from New York to St. Louis
and immediately became a fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``A week earlier, I had paid full-coach fare on a trip to
Chicago, and I had to sit near the back of the plane,'' he said.
``I hated it. But the Economy Plus was surprisingly good. I had
enough room to pull down the tray table and work comfortably on my
computer.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Carriers create extra space in premium economy by removing one
row of seats and then redistributing the space.
</P>
<P>
   American will remove two rows, each taking up 37 inches seatback
to seatback. That is enough for at least three extra inches in each
of the 21 rows of, say, a typical Boeing 737. The $70 million plan
to increase the distance between seats gives economy passengers
more legroom than they have had on any domestic carrier in 20
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``By having a better product throughout coach, we think that we
will be the first call that discount travelers make,'' said Mike
Gunn, American's executive vice president for marketing and
planning. ``We also expect to attract more business travelers who
are willing to pay a higher-yielding fare.''
</P>
<P>
   Passengers may have to wait several months, though, before
landing a coach seat with more legroom. American plans to convert
half its planes _ including those serving the New York area _ by
June, and the rest by year-end. British Airways will begin premium
economy service between New York and London in August before
expanding it to all its planes within the next 18 months. United
said premium economy should be available on all domestic flights by
mid-March.
</P>
<P>
   When American's refurbishing is complete, it will have 6.4
percent fewer economy seats. United is removing coach seats on all
its domestic fleet, including 5 percent of the economy seats on its
737s. Low fares from, say, New York to London's Heathrow Airport
may also become more difficult to get.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting a cheap seat is kind of a pastime among people who
like to travel,'' said Martha Fay, a free-lance writer in New York
who frequently flies coach. ``Not getting a low fare will make a
difference. If I can't go to California for $250 but have to pay
$400 instead, then I may not take my daughter. Or I may just not
go.''
</P>
<P>
   Bethune, of Continental, concurred with the strategy of trying
to reduce the number of low-fare passengers. He noted that such
travelers tend to file more lost-luggage complaints than
first-class travelers, who can carry on more and whose checked
luggage is often treated more carefully. When an airline has
already lost money on the fare, the last thing it wants is to lose
money on the baggage, too.
</P>
<P>
   Since carriers are fiercely competitive _ moving almost
immediately to match fares and in-flight services _ some airline
executives are concerned they may be forced to realign their coach
seats if more carriers do so.
</P>
<P>
   That possibility riles several industry executives, who are
worried about frequent fliers and employees, who are allowed to fly
free when seats are available.
</P>
<P>
   One high-level executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
noted that about 80 percent of frequent fliers on major carriers
fail to get their first-choice flights when trying to redeem miles.
What are the chances of that percentage increasing, the executive
said, if the major carriers have fewer coach seats?
</P>
<P>
   A roomier coach cabin may also be troublesome to airline
employees, who have become accustomed to free air travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to think about your employees' morale,'' Bethune
said. ``Those are your employees' seats that you're taking away.
And if you don't have good employee morale in the airline business,
you don't have anything.''

BOGOTA AND REBELS MAKE PEACE ONLY FAR FROM HOME 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ Officially, peace talks between the Colombian
government and the largest rebel group are stalled, with no date
set for them to resume. Yet just the other day, the government's
chief negotiator boasted that ``we have advanced further this month
than in 40 years of conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   That apparent paradox is the result of an unusual new twist to
efforts to negotiate an end to a civil conflict that has killed
35,000 Colombians just in the last decade. Army troops continue
their confrontation on the battlefield with the leftist
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known by its Spanish
acronym as Farc. But at the same time, a delegation with
representatives from each side has spent most of February touring
Europe together.
</P>
<P>
   The unconventional arrangement has been described by Victor G.
Ricardo, the government's chief peace negotiator, as an effort to
build confidence and trust between the adversaries while ``coming
to know the models of friendly countries.'' At each stop along the
way, the joint government-guerrilla delegation has met with
officials, intellectuals, aid donors, religious leaders and
journalists, often issuing a joint statement afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, the chairman of the New York Stock Exchange visited
leaders of the rebel group at their jungle stronghold in San
Vicente del Caguan. The Colombian government explained the move as
part of an effort to ``educate'' the guerrillas, whose main leader
has been fighting in the bush for more than 50 years, about the
modern world and its ways.
</P>
<P>
   The European trip, which included stops in Norway, Sweden,
Italy, the Vatican, Switzerland, Spain and France, seemed motivated
in part by the same desire.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, the guerrillas have been exposed not only to
European social democracy but also to a barrage of criticism of
their involvement in drug trafficking, kidnapping for ransom and
human rights violations. The implication is that if Europe is ever
to view the group as an insurgency with legitimate political goals,
as it did Central American guerrillas in the 1980s, it must change
its behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps as a result, some experts here say they have detected a
slight shift of position by the group on the question of a
cease-fire. Though the guerrillas have always said fighting would
continue until at least 80 percent of the negotiating agenda had
been resolved, Raul Reyes, the leader of the rebel delegation, has
suggested the group might be willing to call a halt to hostilities
at an earlier stage.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have also softened the tone of their criticism of
links between government security forces and right-wing death
squads, which they previously had contended were one and the same.
``We know that the president has not created the paramilitary
groups and that he wants to combat them,'' Reyes said in Paris last
Thursday. A day later, he added, ``Fortunately, it is not the
entire army but only a part of the military that participates in
this.''
</P>
<P>
   A few optimists like Leon Valencia, a columnist for El Tiempo,
the main daily here, have even suggested that the ties being
developed between the two sets of negotiators have created an
opening to international mediation of the conflict. The rebel group
has a reputation here for xenophobia, and just last summer rejected
a government request that international monitors be sent to the
zone where the government ceded them control in the hope that it
would speed peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Such a mediator already appears to be in place. U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan recently appointed Jan Egeland, a
former deputy foreign minister of Norway, as his special adviser on
the conflict here. Colombians welcomed the move because of the
crucial role Norway played in peace agreements between Israel and
the Palestinians and, more recently, the government of Guatemala
and guerrillas there.
</P>
<P>
   But since taking office 18 months ago promising to bring peace,
President Andres Pastrana has often been criticized for conceding
too much to the rebel group, including control of a chunk of
territory the size of Switzerland, without receiving anything in
return. For those and other critics, the European tour, which ended
over the weekend, has provided plenty of new ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been like the formal presentation of an unruly
debutante to polite society,'' said Alfredo Rangel Suarez, a former
national security adviser to the Colombian government. ``It
reinforces the Farc's legitimacy as a counterweight to the
government, strengthens their image in the eye of Colombian public
opinion, and lifts the morale of their combatants in the field.''
</P>
<P>
   The government has repeatedly refused to grant the rebel group
formal recognition as a belligerent. But with the government and
rebel negotiating teams traveling and meeting European governments
together, Ricardo, the peace negotiator, is in practical terms both
conceding the rebels that status and saying he recognizes them as
his partners in peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the European tour was taking place, the U.S.
Congress has been considering a Clinton administration request for
$1.6 billion in emergency assistance to Colombia. The largest
single component of that proposed package, which the rebel group
has condemned, consists of 63 helicopters for the Colombian armed
forces and police, intended to allow them to operate in
coca-growing areas that the rebels dominate.
</P>
<P>
   Criticizing the Clinton administration package, the director of
the U.N. counterdrug program here, Klaus Nyholm, described it last
week as ``a lot of stick and very little carrot.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., has expressed similar concerns at
recent hearings in Washington, estimating that 79 percent of the
aid package is destined for the Colombian military.
</P>
<P>
   But from the Colombian government's point of view, that would be
precisely the utility of the U.S. aid. It would be only one part of
a much more ambitious $7.5 billion program that the Pastrana
administration calls Plan Colombia, which contains proposals both
to curb the narcotics trade and to bring about economic and social
development.
</P>
<P>
   So while Ricardo escorted the rebels around Europe, another
Colombian government delegation met with European governments
seeking nearly $1 billion in aid for the ``carrot'' part of Plan
Colombia. One benefit of the rebel tour, then, was that it
permitted the Colombian government to remind potential European
donors that it is up against dogmatic guerrillas with a blinkered
view of the world and little sense of politics other than from the
barrel of a gun.
</P>
<P>
   In dealing with Washington, a senior government official said
here on Friday, the Pastrana administration constantly needs to
remind the United States that while ``we are going to fight
drugs,'' the peace efforts are also vital.
</P>
<P>
   But because ``Europe thought it strange we have a peace process
and a counterdrug strategy in the same package,'' he added, there
is also a need to ``tell Europe the opposite'': that while
negotiations are essential, ``you cannot address the causes of
violence without addressing drug trafficking.''

FRANCE'S PREMIER UNDER FIRE FOR MIDDLE EAST TRIP 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Prime Minister Lionel Jospin of France came close to
celebrating a highly successful first 1,000 days in office Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he awoke to an avalanche of criticism, as journalists
and political analysts here replayed the weekend's events before
examining what most considered to be his biggest political blunder
to date: his trip to the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Splattered across the front pages of France's newspapers were
less than flattering images: Jospin running from a mob or huddling
in his car as Palestinian demonstrators kicked it.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Jospin angered the Arab world, departing from
France's usual cautious diplomacy to call acts committed by
Hezbollah guerrillas in Lebanon ``terrorist.'' But back home the
blunder was as much about French politics as about Arab-Israeli
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   France's Middle East policy has traditionally tilted more toward
the Arabs, a stand personified by the shouting match between French
President Jacques Chirac and Israeli security guards when he
visited East Jerusalem in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   For more than two years, the Socialist Jospin and the Gaullist
Chirac have been reluctant partners in what the French call
``cohabitation.'' Though they will surely be adversaries in the
next elections in 2002, they have rarely criticized each other
bluntly: Polls show the voters don't like it. Instead, they try to
outmaneuver each other, quietly, to little effect. So far, no doubt
to their mutual frustration, they have nearly the same popularity
ratings, which have risen and fallen together.
</P>
<P>
   In reaching into what has traditionally been Chirac's realm _
foreign policy _ Jospin was no doubt looking to upstage the
president in his own back yard. But last week's incident simply
left Jospin looking rash and clumsy.
</P>
<P>
   Editorialists took him to task for not even informing Chirac of
the line he intended to take, making France look scattered and
inconsistent in foreign policy issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Sunday was supposed to be the day Lionel Jospin
celebrated his 1,000 days in office,'' one article in Le Journal du
Dimanche said Sunday. ``But catastrophe struck on the 999th day.''
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper said Jospin wanted to ``kill three birds with one
stone'' by pleasing Jewish voters, displaying foreign policy skills
and speaking as frankly abroad as he does at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``On all three points, this was a total failure,'' the newspaper
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   To some degree, Jospin's blunder was made worse by the fact that
the prime minister began his career as a diplomat and said last
month he could do better than Chirac in foreign policy if he were
not held back by cohabitation, a statement the news media were only
too glad to recall Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, Jospin quickly pulled back from his use of the word
terrorist, substituting acts of war. But it was too late. The rocks
were flying and Chirac was able to look sage, demanding that Jospin
report to him directly as soon as he got home Saturday night.
Jospin retorted that he would not be available until Wednesday. So
Chirac called him.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrations against Jospin did not end when he left Israel.
Sunday, thousands of angry Palestinian students burned French flags
and pictures of the prime minister in Hebron. There were also
demonstrations in the West Bank town of Nablus, where hundreds of
students shouted, ``Down with France, America and Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the debacle, few analysts expect Jospin to stop looking
for ways to undermine Chirac's authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the elections approach, the prime minister will want to be
more present on the international scene,'' wrote Pascal Boniface,
head of the Institute for International and Strategic Relations, in
the Journal du Dimanche. ``The tone will get tougher.''

TURNING A MURDER CASE INTO A THEATRICAL EVENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Matt Galloway talks in sporadic, sometimes emotional
bursts. His hands fly around. His body tries to keep up. At least
that is how Stephen Belber portrayed him onstage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I questioned that at first,'' the real Galloway said after
watching ``The Laramie Project,'' a new play by Moises Kaufman of
the New York-based Tectonic Theater Project, which had its premiere
here on Saturday night. ``But I guess I really do talk like that.
It was pretty accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   As a bartender at the Fireside Lounge in Laramie, Wyo., Galloway
was one of the last people to see Matthew Shepard alive 17 months
ago before two local roofers lured him into a truck, beat him,
robbed him and left him for dead on a wooden fence on the outskirts
of town _ all because Shepard, a 21-year-old student at the
University of Wyoming, was gay.
</P>
<P>
   After five days in a Colorado hospital, Shepard died. The
roofers received life sentences with no chance of parole.
</P>
<P>
   The serendipity of Galloway's role in Shepard's life, as well as
the relationships that scores of others had with Shepard, have been
woven into an emotional performance, drawn from court records,
personal journals and 200 interviews in Laramie conducted by
Kaufman, his writers and his actors. ``The Laramie Project''
examines homophobia, class distinctions and cowboy culture by
blending the chronology of the case with the anger, confusion,
sadness and embarrassment it left behind. The play ultimately
questions whether Laramie, or the nation, has changed as a result.
</P>
<P>
   The words of more than 60 people are conveyed by eight actors
simulating the appearance, mannerisms and speech patterns of the
people they interviewed. Kaufman, 36, who wrote the critically
acclaimed play ``Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar
Wilde,'' said his new play represented an effort to use the stage
as a journalistic medium.
</P>
<P>
   And it succeeds to the extent that a three-act play lasting
nearly three hours can mine deeper feelings than newspaper and
television reporters who face daily deadlines. Kaufman even breaks
a little news in the play, revealing that Reggie Fluty, the deputy
sheriff who first reached Shepard at the fence, learned later that
the victim was HIV positive and feared that her efforts to
resuscitate him had exposed her to the virus that causes AIDS. She
began drug therapy, and tests showed she was not infected.
</P>
<P>
   But in addressing larger issues attached to the murder of a gay
man for no other reason than his sexual orientation, the play
reflects a community still in conflict: Romaine Patterson, a
university student, says she was inspired to pursue courses in
political science in order to fight for human rights, yet a Baptist
minister, who goes unnamed in the play, says he hopes that during
the 18 hours Shepard was tied to the fence, he had a moment to
reflect on his lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Galloway, 25, a senior at the university who still works at the
Fireside, was one of several Laramie residents portrayed onstage
who attended the opening performance. In an interview, he said the
Shepard murder had changed some attitudes in Laramie, including
those of friends of his who no longer use the word ``fag'' to
describe a gay man.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he recalled two customers coming into the
Fireside last week, asking to buy T-shirts bearing the name of the
bar as a souvenir of where Shepard spent his last moments. Galloway
said he was repulsed by the request.
</P>
<P>
   Zackie Salmon, 52, who manages a scholarship program at the
university, was briefly portrayed onstage, expressing repugnance at
one of the killers, Aaron J. McKinney. As a lesbian, she said, she
has noticed that the death of Shepard has had some salutary effects
on Laramie's gay and lesbian population, which is larger than most
gays and lesbians there had ever realized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before this incident, I would have never felt as comfortable
being who I am,'' Salmon said. ``After the Matthew Shepard
incident, there was a push for understanding, like we're going to
face what happened in our community and we're going to change.''
</P>
<P>
   But even so, Salmon added, she has a lesbian friend who works in
a different department at the university who has told her that she
fears she could lose her job if her sexual orientation were made
public.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still won't walk across the street holding my partner's
hand,'' she said. ``I would do that in New York and I've done it in
San Francisco. But I still won't do it in Laramie.''

WITH OLYMPIC CONSTRUCTION DONE EARLY, SYDNEY TRIES TO REBUILD
SUPPORT 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two hundred days before much of the world turns its attention to
Homebush Bay, the unlikely hub of the next Summer Olympics, there
is only one building crane still in operation on the vast site that
was once a slaughterhouse and then a dumping ground for household
and industrial waste in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The crane looms over the 5-year-old Aquatic Center, where a
construction crew is increasing the seating capacity to 17,500 for
the swimming events that are expected to bring the hosts more
medals and delight than any of the other events when the Games
begin Sept. 15 and run through Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of a water polo complex in Ryde and a
volleyball stadium that has generated resistance from the residents
of Bondi Beach, the rest of the sites are completed. And what is
finished is generally impressive if nowhere near as architecturally
daring as the Opera House with which Sydney is associated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, I think they are far ahead of most Games I have
experienced,'' said Dr. Jacques Rogge, the Belgian who is chairman
of the International Olympic Committee's coordination commission
and who has been involved in 14 previous Summer and Winter Games.
``I think never was there such an advancement in the preparation.
Construction is essentially finished six months before the Games;
this has never happened before.''
</P>
<P>
   But the twist in Sydney, a city whose serpentine harbor has
plenty of twists, is that there is already reconstruction work to
be done: reconstruction of public trust, reconstruction of public
enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The really sad thing is that, for a lot of the public, the joy
has gone out of the Games,'' Michael Knight, Olympics minister for
the state government of New South Wales and president of the Sydney
Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games, said in an interview
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is more negative now than it was a year ago, and I think it
is going to be very hard to turn that around,'' said John Boultbee,
the director of the Australian Institute of Sport in Canberra,
where many of the country's elite athletes are based.
</P>
<P>
   What makes it particularly difficult is what happened last
October, when it was revealed that most of the tickets for events
with the greatest cachet in Australia were no longer available to
the public. Of the 3.5 million tickets expected to be available to
the public, it turned out that 420,000 had already been set aside
by the budget-conscious organizing committee for clubs and
individuals of means, some of them paying more than face value. And
that was beyond the tens of thousands of tickets traditionally set
aside for sponsors in Summer Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Such a revelation would not have generated big waves in a
country that is as evangelically capitalistic and conditioned to
high ticket prices as the United States. But Australia, despite
significant wealth disparities, still has a strong egalitarian
streak, and the idea that the common people did not have equal
access to the Games in a sports-minded country was a most unpopular
idea _ particularly for the some 250,000 Australians (out of a
population of 19 million) who applied for tickets and received none
and who had not been told of how slim their chances were when the
process began.
</P>
<P>
   Rogge said the organizing committee ``did wrong in not
announcing the premium ticket sales.'' Premium sales were also
organized in Atlanta, he noted, ``but in Atlanta they announced it
and it was not an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Boultbee said: ``The really sad thing, is that it was ready to
turn. The good results in sports and excitement of Australia doing
well last year was about to take over the public attitude when the
ticketing thing, which has been just so much more harmful than any
other thing, came along.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight, the politician who is paid to oversee the organization,
decided in February to transfer a considerable number of the
organizing committee's responsibilities, including the operation of
all sites, to the Olympic Coordination Authority, which has
successfully overseen the construction of $2.03 billion worth of
stadiums and facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The arc of public opinion in Summer Olympic host cities has
become predictable. There is euphoria at the announcement seven
years before the Games, then growing disenchantment as the
construction begins and inconveniences and taxpayer costs increase,
then renewed excitement as the event gets close. Sydney will be no
exception, but the IOC scandal and its fallout, which received
considerable attention here throughout 1999, put a damper on the
usual renewal of enthusiasm and the ticketing problems deadened it
again _ at least until late May when the teen-age sensation Ian
Thorpe and the enormously popular Olympic veterans Kieren Perkins
and Susie O'Neill compete in the Australian Olympic swimming trials
at Homebush Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks later, 100 days before the Games, the Olympic flame
will arrive in Uluru, the site of Ayers Rock, which is the huge,
red symbol of traditional Aborigine life. The first torch bearer
will be Nova Peris-Kneebone, who in 1996 became the first Aborigine
to win an Olympic gold medal as part of the women's field hockey
team.
</P>
<P>
   Barring protests by Aborigine groups _ who are still debating
how they want to use the global platform of the Games to increase
awareness of their unfortunate past and uneasy present _ the
torch's arrival should lift morale, as well. But what Boultbee and
others worry about is what the public reaction will be if, as is
customary, hundreds of seats are left empty by sponsors and their
guests once the Games begin.

<P>
   Yet for all the grumbling and the loss of Olympic innocence,
there is ample optimism here. Melanie Boyd, a 23-year-old water
polo player who works at the Sutherland Leisure Center where Thorpe
trains in Sydney's southern suburbs, said: ``I think the media here
have taken the negativity further than the public perception. I was
there in Sydney the night we won the Olympics in my school uniform.
I was a private school girl out in the city with all my mates and
we were wearing, `Thank you Sydney' stickers. That memory has stuck
with me. I think when the Olympics get here, a lot of these issues
will seem very small.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogge, who has visited Sydney 12 times in his oversight role,
has a similar, if wider, view.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six months before the Games in Los Angeles, we faced a boycott
by the communist countries,'' he said. ``Six months before the
Games in Moscow, we had the Jimmy Carter boycott and ultimately the
United States and a dozen other countries did not participate. Six
months before the Games in Seoul, the situation was very tense with
students protesting in the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six months before the Games in Montreal, we still did not know
if we would have an Olympic stadium because there were strikes and
the stadium was not finished. So when you compare that, I'm saying,
frankly speaking, they did a good job in Sydney and the preparation
was almost trouble free.''
</P>
<P>
   Staying in Rogge's good graces over the next 200 days will
require the Sydney organizers to recruit, train and manage 60,000
contracted workers and 40,000 volunteers. It will require
Sydneysiders to abandon the use of their cars en masse temporarily
during the Games to make sure the roads are not clogged. It will
also require technology and security to be essentially bug free.
But Sydney's hardware is there, much of it in Homebush Bay, where
the opening and closing ceremonies and 15 of the 28 sports _
including the main attractions swimming, track and field,
gymnastics and basketball _ will be staged about nine miles west of
Sydney's center.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Homebush is already in use. Earlier this month gymnasts
competed in the test event at the new 20,000-seat Superdome
(Luciano Pavarotti was the opening act last year). For the past
four days, the 110,000-seat Olympic Stadium has been the site of
the Australian track and field championships. One of the champions
was a 15-year-old named Georgie Clarke, who won the women's 1,500
meters. A distant relative of the former Australian star Ron
Clarke, Georgie has run the race in 4 minutes 6.77 seconds and
might not be running quite so fast so young if the 2000 Games were
not there as a carrot.
</P>
<P>
   There are other Australian teen-agers running against the clock
in other sports, and those that make it in time will end up a short
drive from the stadium in the Olympic Village in Newington, which,
with its 513 new houses and 355 new apartments and freshly laid
roads, looks more like Olympic Suburbia. Construction only began
here in May 1998, and there is still a lot of land to scape and
rooms to furnish before the athletes and coaches arrive. The field
where national flags will be raised as delegations arrive is still
a bare mound of earth with a steam shovel resting on it.
</P>
<P>
   But even when the suburbanites move into this ecologically
innovative planned community after it stops playing host to
Olympians, the roads will still bear the names of athletes like
Perkins, O'Neill and the Ethiopian marathoner Abebe Bikila. The
fate of Merlene Ottey Avenue depends on whether the Jamaican
sprinter is exonerated after testing positive for the banned
steroid nandrolone.

LEITER LOOKING TO EXPAND HIS OPTIONS ON THE MOUND 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. _ Al Leiter held the ball in his left hand,
lifted it above his shoulder to signal to Mike Piazza and
minor-league catcher Alan Probst that he was tossing a fastball and
then he unleashed the pitch. But Leiter was not tossing a four-seam
fastball and he was not being the same Leiter that the Mets know so
well.
</P>
<P>
   Under a penetrating sun and on an empty field, Leiter worked on
spotting his sinking fastball on the outside part of the plate.
Leiter grunted as he pumped the two-seam pitch off the corner to
Piazza. The fastballs were on the corner, just off the corner and
then on the corner again, stifling Piazza and making batting
practice seem like pitching practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perfect,'' Dave Wallace, the pitching coach, said to Leiter.
``Right?''
</P>
<P>
   His forehead glistening with sweat and a cup of water in his
hand, Leiter nodded and said, ``Yeah, perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   This was Leiter's laboratory for the day. Two simulated innings,
60 pitches and most of them were two-seam fastballs or change-ups
designed to nick the outside corner against right-handed hitters.
Leiter already has a nasty cut fastball and a slider that lets him
control the inside part of the plate in powerful fashion, which is
how he has succeeded as a pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   But, as Leiter reflected on his subpar 1999 season in which he
went 13-12 with a 4.23 earned run average, he decided to refine his
repertory to possibly return to the form he used to go 17-6 with a
2.47 ERA in 1998. While Leiter's cut fastball can be devastating
enough to carry him if his other pitches are average, hitters
adjusted to it last year, and Leiter struggled. Leiter, who is no
longer the Mets' ace because Mike Hampton is two lockers away,
wants to be able to confuse the hitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably controlled the inside and outside one out of every
five starts last year,'' Leiter said. ``If you do that three or
four times out of five, you're looking at a 20-game winner.''
</P>
<P>
   So Leiter developed a plan to attack his weaknesses and he
worked on those changes Sunday. He threw a sinking fastball to
Piazza, who fouled it feebly along the right-field line. He tossed
another fastball and Piazza popped it to right field. Then Leiter
surprised Piazza with a cutter on the inner half and Piazza tapped
it weakly to third. Of the five dozen pitches Leiter threw, Probst
said his location was perfect on 56 or 57.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those pitches Mike fouled off looked like strikes, and then
broke out of the zone,'' Probst said. ``The hitter thinks he's
going to get the barrel of the bat on it, and then he hits it off
the end of the bat. That's what Al wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, it is early, very early, in spring training. But
manager Bobby Valentine stood behind the backstop like a Little
League father and hollered encouragement to Leiter. At one point,
Valentine turned to reporters and gushed, ``Doesn't he look good?''
The manager praised Leiter for easily ``controlling both sides of
the plate'' and said that Leiter was returning ``to the pitching
mode that made him really successful two years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. Leiter said that the adjustments to pitching to the
outside corner more often involve repetition and trust. If Leiter
throws 100 pitches, 20 or 25 will be targeted for the outside
corner, but Leiter must believe that he has the two-seam fastball
and change-up in his arsenal. If Leiter has a 1-2 count on a tough
right-handed batter, like Atlanta's Brian Jordan, he does not want
Jordan to be able to expect an inside pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got to believe in it,'' Wallace said. ``You can talk all
you want, but he has to really want to do it and execute it.''
</P>
<P>
   After Leiter's work was finished, he asked Probst how much his
two-seamer had darted. Then the last pitcher to start a game for
the Mets in 1999, a game where he gave up five runs to the Braves
and never recorded an out, walked away thinking about how 2000
could have a better ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have something to prove,'' Leiter said. ``I want to show
that the pitcher from two years ago is the type of pitcher I know I
am and can be.''

 _ SF CHRON  
 Internet Lands America's Cup  &HT;     By Jim Doyle 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
One of the highlights of the America's Cup races on New Zealand's
Hauraki Gulf is the emergence of a dramatic new Internet technology
that gives viewers a ringside seat on world-class sailboat races.
<P>
   Aided by a sophisticated mix of 3-D animation techniques and
dazzling computer graphics, Virtual Spectator _ a live Internet
sports channel _ represents a step toward the convergence of
broadcast television and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   While previous efforts to track yacht races have relied on
primitive graphics and lengthy transmission delays, Virtual
Spectator places the personal computer user in the catbird's seat
in a fully animated, almost instant re-creation of the event.
</P>
<P>
   Fans are able to select different perspectives of a live an &LR; 
ongoing  &LR; race including a wide-angle aerial view that shows the
boats' positions on the water as well as closer, telescopic views
from alongside the boats and near the turning marks, or buoys.
</P>
<P>
   During the America's Cup cq  &LR; trials, more than 70,000 people in
73 countries used Virtual Spectator to watch the challenger races
between 11 countries from seven nations _ live via the Internet.
Many of these viewers were based in U.S. and European cities where
there was little or no television coverage of the two-hour races.
The live Internet coverage hooked the interest of sailors and
nonsailors alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've created something that's a real-time interactive
experience and people are excited about it. It's actually reaching
a very wide audience of young and old,'' said Craig cq &LR;   &LR; Meek, one
of Virtual Spectator's founders. ``The whole idea is to open up the
sport to not only the farthest corners of the world, but also make
it more understandable.''
</P>
<P>
   The America's Cup match between cup defender Team New Zealand
and Italy's Prada continues this (feb 28 onward)  &LR; week. The Kiwis
now lead 3 to 0 in the best-of-9 series. Software for the America's
Cup match is downloadable for cq  &LR; $9.95 from Virtual Spectator's
Web site ( &LR; www.virtualspectator.com &LR; ) or through Quokkasports'
official America's Cup Web site ( &LR; www.americascup.org) &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Virtual Spectator is the name of the Auckland, New Zealand,
-based  &LR; company as well as its Web site, technology and product.
</P>
<P>
   The firm has yet to turn a profit. But its yacht racing program
has caught the attention of financiers, Web sites and advertisers
searching for ways to capture the sustained interest of Web
surfers, who typically jump from one site to the next after only a
few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Virtual Spectator users watch a three-dimensional, animated
presentation of a sailboat race. The animations are driven by live
performance data that is transmitted from the racecourse by each
competing yacht. The position and relative speeds of each racer is
tracked around the course by small transponders using global
positional technologies. Wind speed and other weather data are is
 &LR; also relayed via the Internet and displayed on the user's computer
screen.
</P>
<P>
   To create the animated, on-screen presentation, the race data
are digitally linked via the Internet to highly - &LR; detailed boat
profiles that have been previously downloaded into the viewer's
personal computer. In addition, fans can replay earlier races on
their computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is revolutionary. It is the first technology to produce a
live animated sporting event,'' said Jay cq  &LR; Snider, who runs a
Philadelphia venture capital firm that recently invested more than
$1 million in Virtual Spectator. ``We've been looking around the
world for new sports technology and, of all places, we found it
here in New Zealand.''
</P>
<P>
   Virtual Spectator is developing a similar product for major golf
tournaments and also  &LR; experimenting with Internet coverage of motor
sports and soccer. Tests have been conducted on Formula One race
cars and gliders. ``Our biggest challenge now is to find new ways
to track things. Once we have the data, we can do all sorts of
amazing things with it,'' said Meek, adding that technicians are
designing unobtrusive and cost-effective tracking devices.
</P>
<P>
   For horse racing, a tiny transponder may be attached to a
horse's saddle. For track and field, the most effective tracking
device may be a reflector that's sewn into a runner's jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Virtual Spectator was created in response to a request by Bruno
Trouble, an organizer of the Louis Vuitton Cup, who asked Meek and
his partners how technology could be used to bring the America's
Cup cq  &LR; challenger series in New Zealand to a global audience.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, Meek founded Terabyte Interactive Ltd., an
Auckland multimedia firm that developed CD-ROMs for clients and,
when that market collapsed, established online banking and bill
paying sites. His main partner in Virtual Spectator is Ian Taylor,
who years ago founded Animation Research Ltd., an award-winning
broadcast animation company in Dunedin, New Zealand. Taylor's firm
created most of Virtual Spectator's animated images using Silicon
Graphics computers.
</P>
<P>
   Early subscribers who purchased Virtual Spectator software on
CD-ROM for the America's Cup trials paid $69.95 for the untested
product. In the past four months, the program was used to cover
more than 200 challenger races. Technicians ironed out the
product's glitches and took steps to improve it.
</P>
<P>
   The early version included less-than-live commentary that was
poorly written and crawled across the screen at a snail's pace. It
also failed to clearly display umpires' penalty calls, which
further confused race fans.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the program has been streamlined to be more user friendly.
Umpires' calls are clear and live commentary by experts is
available in English, French, Spanish and Italian. Instead of
translations, the words are written in the commentator's native
tongue.
</P>
<P>
   Virtual Spectator's creators say they are well positioned for
the next technological revolution: the convergence of digital
television and broadband computer cables that will easily transmit
video as well as high-end graphics.
</P>
<P>
   In the not-too-distant future, viewers will be able to choose
between a spectrum of video and animated images from the same
sporting event and to create their own custom displays. For
example, a fan may decide to follow a race for a while via a
large-scale animated presentation, while displaying live video
images from different camera angles in smaller corners of the
screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly, you're putting people in control of content,'' said
Meek, adding that viewers around the world will be able to select
visuals and expert commentary. In the brave new world, interactive
sports fans will become the homegrown equivalents of ESPN
producers.

 Why Thin Computing Is In  &HT;     By Henry Norr 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Because thin clients rely on network servers to run programs and
store data, they don't require as much horsepower as a stand-alone
computer.
<P>
   Typically, they have less memory and no drives (hard, floppy, or
CD-ROM) of their own, and since all they do is draw what the user
sees on the screen, a relatively modest and inexpensive
microprocessor is enough to deliver good performance.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, thin clients don't require a standard Windows license.
</P>
<P>
   Stripping out those costs translates into lower prices: Thin
clients typically cost between $350 and $700, depending on the
vendor and the software and hardware configuration. That makes them
a few hundred dollars less than a typical low-end business PC.
</P>
<P>
   Such savings, however, are only a drop in the bucket compared to
what the information technology industry calls the ``total cost of
ownership,'' which includes not only the upfront price of the
hardware, but also the much larger cost of installing, supporting
and updating the machine over time.
</P>
<P>
   It's in this domain, proponents say, that the real value of
thin-client computing lies:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_ &UR; Easy updates &LR; . When every desktop PC has its own software
installed, an upgrade _ whether of the operating system,
applications, drivers or utilities like security and antivirus
programs _ typically requires sending a technician to every desk, a
time-consuming, expensive and intrusive process. (Some large
companies now use special software that automatically upgrades
client machines over the network, but these programs introduce
costs and complexities of their own.)
</P>
<P>
   Since it's often impossible to upgrade everyone at once, large
organizations may face an awkward transition period during which
different versions of key programs are running on various machines.
In the thin-client model, because all key software runs on servers,
only one or a handful of machines needs to be updated. The new
software is immediately available to everyone, and outmoded
versions can't keep rearing their heads.
</P>
<P>
   It's the speed with which software can be upgraded across a
large organization that's turned out to be the most important
benefit of thin-client computing for National Semiconductor,
according to Bob Neuberger, manager of thin-client technology for
the Santa Clara chipmaker's information services group.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least in our industry,'' he said, ``time to market is
critical to profitability, because the first to market gets the
biggest margins,'' he said. ``If engineering or sales has a new
application ready to go, we just can't take months to roll it
out.''
</P>
<P>
   As an example, Neuberger cited Lotus Notes, the communications
and collaboration software the company runs on. ``We have 7,000
users, and it used to take us three months for every upgrade,'' he
said. ``Now we can do it in four hours.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_ &UR; No more instant obsolescence &LR; . As every PC owner knows, the
insatiable appetites of software developers render conventional
computers obsolete within a very few years.
</P>
<P>
   That puts users _ from information-technology professionals at
giant corporations to users with a single home PC _ in a bind:
either stick with aging software, foregoing the presumed benefits
of the latest releases, or face the hassle and expense of frequent
hardware upgrades.
</P>
<P>
   The thin-client model breaks this cycle. Since the desktop
machine has to manage only the user interface, a relatively modest
task, a thin client should last for many years, even across
multiple generations of software.
</P>
<P>
   This was the key element in recent decisions to move to thin
clients at two Bay Area organizations. Contra Costa County's IT
managers were asked to install new PeopleSoft applications on 360
desktops, but got no budget for the beefed-up PCs many of them
would have required, according to Steve Kaplan, president of Ryno
Technology, an integration company based in Benicia, that was hired
to help with the project. In the case of ABM Industries, according
to Anthony Lackey, chief technical officer of the San Francisco
company, there were two main ``drivers for change.'' One was the
Y2K problem, which required replacing roughly half of the company's
2,500 PCs. The other was a new corporate accounting package the
company had selected.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a PC it requires 128 megabytes of RAM and a 500-megahertz
Pentium,'' Lackey said. ``Only about a dozen of our PCs met that
requirement.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, running the software on PCs would have
increased the burden on the communications network connecting the
company's 210 offices. ``We would have needed much bigger pipes _
by a factor of six, compared to what we ended up with for the thin
clients,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a company's servers often need to be upgraded or
replaced as more demanding software is introduced, but that's a
more manageable problem: Servers generally are more expandable than
desktop PCs, with room for extra memory, storage and processors.
And even when all-new hardware is required, only one or a few
servers need to be replaced, compared to scores or hundreds of
client PCs.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_ &UR; High reliability &LR; . Thin-client users can't fiddle with
configuration settings and have no way to introduce unauthorized
programs such as games and screensavers, not to mention viruses.
Since the servers are managed and monitored by professionals,
they're presumably far less susceptible to such problems. That
means lower support costs and less downtime.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, notes analyst Dan Kusnetsky of International Data
Corp., thin-client computing works like the telephone system: ``You
turn it on, it works. Enhancements and new services happen out on
the network, so you don't usually need new hardware on your end to
take advantage of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, thin-client computing isn't without downsides. The
biggest is that it makes an organization totally dependent on the
reliability of its servers and its network _ without them, thin
clients are useless.
</P>
<P>
   Thin clients also lack the flexibility of PCs: You can't just
plug in a scanner, for example, when an employee gets a new
assignment that requires one. And in a general sense server-based
computing eliminates much of the ``personal'' in personal
computing.
</P>
<P>
   For managers like National Semi's Neuberger, that's a plus, not
a minus. But some users may resent losing the freedom to install
digital pictures of their kids or the latest MP3 player.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely some re-education needed,'' Neuberger said,
``but most users get over it pretty quickly. After all, they can
see how big the benefits are, both for the organization and for
them.''

JETS SEEK A PASS-RUSHER IN THE DRAFT AND INEXPENSIVE FREE AGENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Searching for a pass-rusher _ the New York Jets have not had a
defensive lineman with more than 10 sacks since 1990 _ the club's
scouting brain trust and assistant coaches finished poking the
country's best collegians Sunday as the annual combine in
Indianapolis ended.
</P>
<P>
   Now the energies of the rest of the Jets' personnel staff will
be turned to free agency, as well as the college draft on April 15.
</P>
<P>
   Because the combine gave the Jets their first opportunity to
measure the collegians up close, the team made no significant
free-agent moves last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jets have not been proactive in free agency,'' said one
agent who has had long-time dealings with Bill Parcells. ``They
have been reactive.''
</P>
<P>
   Another agent said that his client, a tight end, got some early
interest from the Jets but has not heard from the team for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they have a money problem _ and they want to see who
they can get cheap,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets are about $1 million under the salary cap. The money
for the draft comes under a separate pool, however, and thus the
Jets will be able to afford to sign collegians, but not high-priced
free agents.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets in recent years disguised their lack of a pass rush by
coming up with creative defensive schemes from Bill Belichick.
Belichick will now try to be as innovative as the Patriots new head
coach. And because the Jets are shifting to a 3-4 defense under
their new coach Al Groh, they would love to have a pass-rusher.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' veteran defensive linemen _ built around the
run-stopping nose tackle Jason Ferguson _ are the workmanlike
Anthony Pleasant, Rick Lyle, Ernie Logan and Bobby Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   As a unit, the Jets' defensive line had only nine sacks.
</P>
<P>
   One pass-rusher who might be available when the Jets pick at No.
16 in the draft is Shaun Ellis of Tennessee. He is 6 feet 4 inches,
weighs 260 pounds and is expected to run the 40-yard dash in 5
seconds flat.
</P>
<P>
   But they also need a tight end, someone who can snare more than
the 7 passes caught by Eric Green last season.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Jets have two first-round picks in the draft.
They have not had a first-round choice since 1997. But now, with
the 16th pick they received from New England for signing Belichick,
and their own No. 18, the Jets could get an impact player by
packaging the choices. In addition to Ellis, the other big ``need''
player available could be tight end Bubba Franks, the 6-5,
245-pounder from Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Jets are not talking about what they looked for
at the combine. Groh has maintained Parcells' policy of forbidding
his assistants to talk to the news media. Parcells, who remains as
chief of the club's football operations, has declined to discuss
free agency or the draft.
</P>
<P>
   But Dick Haley _ who was also in Indianapolis _ remains the
draft director, although Groh has been given final say on
personnel. As collegians were tested by position, the Jets'
assistants watched their specialty. Ray Hamilton, the new defensive
line coach, watched the pass-rushers; Ken Whisenhunt, the new tight
ends coach, assessed players at that position.
</P>
<P>
   These are not the only two positions the Jets are interested in
filling. They still are on the lookout for a speedy receiver, and
there will be interest in an offensive lineman as well as a
defensive back.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the Jets have closely guarded the injury update of almost
a dozen players who had surgery in the past year, including four
starters whose 1999 seasons ended because of injury.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets do say, through a spokesman, that each player's
rehabilitation is on schedule. But it is difficult to discern how
big a part injuries will play in what the Jets do at the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Their investigations over the past few days focused on possible
replacements for the cadre of sidelined Jets. And that search will
continue during free agency.

 Seeing X-Rays in a Whole New Light  
 By Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
With a couple of mouse clicks, Dr. Charles Anderson called up a
digital X-ray image on a large computer screen. Not only was he
able to zoom in on a section of a patient's knee, he was able to
look into the future of radiology.
<P>
   Anderson was demonstrating a new type of X-ray machine at the
Veteran's Administration Medical Center in San Francisco. The
machine uses new digital technology to capture X-ray images instead
of the century-old technique using standard analog technology.
</P>
<P>
   Although the device made by Swissray International Inc. is the
only one of its kind so far in the Bay Area, Anderson and medical
experts believe similar digital X-rays &LR;  machines will be
commonplace in hospitals and clinics around the country in a decade
or so. So far Swissray has installed 25 nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   For the average patient, the benefits of digital X-ray machines
should be less time waiting for results because since &LR;   &LR; doctors can
see the images in a matter of seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Or, if the patient's own doctor or a top  &LR; specialist is hundreds
of miles away, the doctors could still view a digital X-ray over
the Internet. And like a digital photo, the digital X-ray image can
be enhanced by computer to pick out finer details like a hairline
bone fracture.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can squeeze a lot more information from these images,''
said Anderson, a doctor of radiology at the VA hospital. ``You can
bring out details more than you can with film.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike X-ray film sheets that are cumbersome to store and easily
lost, digital X-rays are always accessible through the hospital's
computer network or the Internet, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can download a client's X-ray in my home, and it takes about
10 seconds,'' Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Startling advances in medical science have made procedures like
talk-show host David Letterman's quintuple bypass heart surgery
last month somewhat routine. And other radiological exams, like
magnetic resonance imaging, already give doctors a digital readout.
</P>
<P>
   But X-ray processing has remained basically unchanged since the
1920s, said Robert A. Bell, president of R.A. Bell and Associates,
a radiology industry consulting firm in Encinitas (San Diego
County).
</P>
<P>
   Doctors have long used X-rays, invisible bursts of
electromagnetic radiation, as a diagnostic tool because they can
pass through the human body. Conventional X-ray machines use
photographic film to capture images of bones and internal organs.
</P>
<P>
   X-ray film takes 10 to 20 minutes to develop using chemicals
that require special handling, said Ueli Laupper, CEO of Swissray
America Inc., the U.S. unit of the Swiss company founded by his
father Ruedi Laupper.
</P>
<P>
   The digital machines do not change the way X-rays are
administered to the patient. But instead of film, the machine
captures the X-ray images using digital cameras, and the image
shows up on a computer monitor in 10 to 15 seconds, Laupper said.
</P>
<P>
   Digitized versions of X-ray results are not totally new in
hospitals. For several years, radiologists have been able to take
an ``interim step'' by producing standard film X-rays, then
converting them to digital using devices similar to computer
scanners or copy machines, Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   But the future of the $10 billion worldwide market for X-ray
equipment is in machines that directly digitize the X-ray results,
Bell said. He noted that several manufacturers _ including General
Electric Co.'s Medical Systems unit, Siemens Medical Engineering
Group and Phillips Medical Systems _ have introduced digital X-ray
machines that focus on specific examinations, such as chest X-rays.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, GE Medical Inc. received U.S. Food and Drug
Administration approval for the country's first digital mammogram
machine.
</P>
<P>
   Swissray's Ueli Laupper said his company has an advantage
because its device is the first one to hit the medical market for
use for all types of X-rays. The X-ray generator and optical reader
can be rotated 90 degrees to scan different parts of the body.
</P>
<P>
   The company recently announced a $13 million order for 32 units
by the Romanian Ministry of Health.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the expense of digital machines remains a major barrier.
Conventional machines cost around $170,000, said Laupper. The new
digital devices cost as much as $450,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   At those high prices, the digital machines by themselves will
remain money losers for hospitals and clinics without a ``major
restructuring'' of a radiology department's staffing and operating
procedures, Bell said. The digital X-ray machines save labor
because they don't require people to file and process film.
</P>
<P>
   Those kinds of changes often take years to implement, so
patients may not notice a conversion to digital for another eight
to 10 years, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is clearly the future, presuming they can get the price
down,'' Bell said.

 _ SF CHRON  
 Ain't It Cool Ain't News But It's Fun  &HT;     By David Lazarus 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Let's start with what Harry Knowles is not.
<P>
   He says he isn't a journalist, although his Web site, Ain't It
Cool News, is a leading online source for Hollywood dirt and
behind-the-scenes movie doings.
</P>
<P>
   He says he isn't a film critic, although he reviews just about
every new movie released and runs separate reviews by a stable of
other film buffs.
</P>
<P>
   So what is he?
</P>
<P>
   ``I call myself a `film advocate,''' he said the other day
before presenting a sneak preview of the new Ridley Scott movie
``Gladiator'' at the Metreon theaters in downtown San Francisco.
``I'm looking for good films and trying to help films get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Others might call Knowles, who runs Ain't It Cool News
(www.aint-it-cool-news.com) out of his house in Austin, Texas, the
ultimate Internet movie geek _ a guy who has managed to combine a
lifelong passion for film with technology that allows him to share
his interest with a global audience.
</P>
<P>
   And share he does. Knowles estimates that he spends as much as
16 hours every day cranking out his thoughts on just about anything
from the movie world that strikes his fancy. Much to the
consternation of studio executives, he also posts advance peeks at
test screenings throughout the country and glimpses of screenplays
in progress.
</P>
<P>
   His site, with about 500,000 daily hits, has more readers than
Variety and the Hollywood Reporter combined.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harry Knowles was one of the first to embrace the tools of the
Internet,'' said Jonathan Taylor, executive editor of Variety. ``He
has gone from being perceived as a pirate or a scalawag to almost
being part of the establishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, Taylor noted, Knowles is courted by the major studios
and invited to screenings. ``The strategy seems to be that if you
can't beat him, seduce him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Knowles' muscle was made clear in July 1997 when 20th Century
Fox held a test screening at the Mall of America in Minneapolis for
``Titanic,'' which at the time was foundering amid icebergs of bad
prerelease pre-release  &LR; buzz.
</P>
<P>
   Ain't It Cool News had spies at the screening, and their
subsequent raves online have been credited &UR;  &LR; with turning around the
film's prospects and helping it become the highest-grossing movie
of all time.
</P>
<P>
   However, the danger of Knowles' shoot-from-the-hip,
no-experience-required style was illustrated a couple of weeks ago
when he and an accomplice hacked into a computer they thought
contained a preannouncement list of Oscar nominees. The list, which
he posted on his site, turned out to be bogus.
</P>
<P>
   Knowles, 28, insists he's just another fan with just another Web
site. Ain't It Cool News, he said, ``is a nontraditional
non-traditional  &LR; look at the film business through the eyes of
someone who wants it to be better than it is.''
</P>
<P>
   But Knowles isn't just another fan. He's a guy who has appeared
with Roger Ebert on the latter's syndicated movie-review program,
has a book in the works and is developing a TV talk show he
describes as ```Wayne's World' meets `Entertainment Tonight.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Knowles keeps infiltrating test screenings and
passing along tidbits from a network of pseudonymous contributors
within and without the film business.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really infuriated a lot of people in the industry,'' said
Paula Parisi, who covers technology for the Hollywood Reporter.
``There are some studios that forbid their people to have anything
to do with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, she thinks Knowles is a positive influence as well as a
thorn in the side of moviemaking. ``He brings a fresh perspective
to covering the entertainment industry,'' she said. ``It's
something the industry has been needing.''
</P>
<P>
   In person, Knowles can charitably be said to make a striking
impression. With a mane of shaggy red hair and a bushy red beard,
he was dressed for the Metreon screening all in brown, accented by
a bright green tie and fluorescent green shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Consistent with his self-styled image as the consummate Net
nerd, Knowles is hopelessly out of shape, and he carries his
300-plus pounds with the slow, rolling gait of a guy who seldom
gets out of the house _ which is, of course, precisely the case.
</P>
<P>
   Knowles by now has become so practiced at telling his story that
the anecdotes spill out in media-friendly sound bites. He tells of
the childhood in Texas hawking movie memorabilia with his father,
the failed stab at a college education, the accident that left him
bedridden for several months.
</P>
<P>
   He tells how Ain't It Cool News, named after a line from the
John Travolta movie ``Broken Arrow,'' was launched in early 1996 as
a way to continue selling movie trinkets online.
</P>
<P>
   Knowles got his first real taste of Internet publishing when he
spent a couple of months contributing movie snippets to Matt
Drudge, the online political columnist. ``He told me I could never
make a name for myself covering entertainment news,'' Knowles
recalled with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long for movie buffs to stumble across Knowles'
Ain't It Cool News and to respond to his quirky, highly opinionated
reviews, which often read more like a diary entry than an
exploration of cinematic trends.
</P>
<P>
   Soon came the test-screening spy reports and insider views, and
Knowles' following really took off. Hollywood studios started
paying more attention when blistering early reviews of ``Batman and
Robin'' at Ain't It Cool News all but murdered the film prior to
its release.
</P>
<P>
   ``The press was saying that this was the death of Hollywood,''
Knowles said of his initial infamy. ``But I wasn't out to destroy
anything. I was like the character in `Network' who was mad as hell
and not going to take it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   His stature has since risen to the point where he can now call a
major studio and request a special screening of an unreleased film,
as was the case with his arranging a showing of Dreamworks'
``Gladiator.'' The movie is not slated to hit theaters until May.
</P>
<P>
   Knowles gave away tickets through his site and had no trouble
packing the theater with adoring fans. He told them before the
lights dimmed that ``this movie is going to kick your ass pretty
hard,'' and they loudly clapped their appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   (``Gladiator'' turned out be violent, unpleasant and largely
pointless, but Knowles subsequently pronounced it a great film, and
there can be little doubt that Ain't It Cool News will deliver the
crowds when it finally opens.)
</P>
<P>
   Knowles recognizes that, more than anything else, it's an
accident of good timing that he is where he is today _ and he
freely admits that he's grateful to have been among the first geeks
to get a movie site up and running on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where would I be without the Internet?'' he mused. ``I'd
probably still be selling movie posters at garage sales.''
</P>
<P>
   And the funny thing is, he'd probably be just as happy.

 _ SF CHRON   Boom in Biotech Stocks Brings Back Memories of Bubbles Past 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
All of a sudden the world seemed bio-crazy. Biotech stocks doubled
and tripled in a matter of months, fueled by media hype of medical
discoveries on the horizon. Biotech ruled Wall Street, temporarily
outshining high tech.
<P>
   That was in 1991, the last time biotechnology experienced
anything like the market frenzy it is enjoying today.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, by spring 1992, the bubble had  &LR; burst, plunging biotech
into a swoon from which it only fully recovered last July, when the
American Stock Exchange's ``BTK'' biotech index finally surpassed
the level it achieved in January 1992.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, as biotech shares tripled, the question arose:
Could biotech crash again?
</P>
<P>
   No, never, not a chance, biotech industry observers say. The
industry is far more mature today than in 1991, and though some
correction seems inevitable, it won't be as severe as the '92 crash
_ which wiped out more than half the value of many biotech shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prices may come down 10 percent, but not 50 percent,''
predicted Steve Burrill, who runs his own biotech investment bank
in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Burrill said the combined market capitalization of all 400 or so
biotech firms is only twice as large as one pharmaceutical giant,
Merck.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could buy this whole industry for what you could buy two
Mercks for,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kurt von Emster, manager of the Franklin Biotechnology Discovery
Fund in San Mateo, said biotech has dozens of products poised to
come on the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still in the first leg of a biotech rally which we
expect will last another decade,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, given the sudden euphoria over biotech, it seems wise to
compare this boom to the bubbles of past.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Dietz, biotech investment banker with Pacific Growth
Equities in San Francisco, said this rally began last fall, as the
success of the Genentech public offering, coupled with media
fascination with the Human Genome Project, began to focus attention
on a sector Wall Street had long ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Genomics _ the study of how genes control disease and
development _ was seen as a new era in drug discovery. Investors
bid up shares in companies like Celera, Incyte and others that were
discovering and patenting genes. The genomics fad emboldened Bay
Area firms _ Tularik, Caliper Technologies and Maxygen _ to test
Wall Street's appetite for biotech IPOs. Tired of dot-coms, Wall
Street bit. By January 2000 it was official _ biotech was hot.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics are stunning. The BTK index started at 200 in
October 1991 and peaked at 223.92 in January 1992. After sinking as
low as 77.56 in March 1995, the index took seven years to get back
to its starting point.
</P>
<P>
   But since May 1999, the BTK has gained an astonishing 460
points. It closed at 664 on Friday. In percentage terms, the BTK
has gained 487 percent over the last 52 weeks. In January and
February alone it has gained 273 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Rising share prices have meant jaw-dropping gains for biotech
mutual funds. Von Emster's Franklin fund is up almost 70 percent
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Performances like that attract money. Robert Adler, president of
AMG Services, which tracks the flow of money in and out of mutual
funds, said $800 million a week has poured into biotech mutuals
since mid-January. That's four times higher than anything he's ever
measured in biotech. Every week, the sheer inflow of money adds
about 2.5 percent to the amount of mutual fund money chasing
biotech stocks.
</P>
<P>
   What happens when more money chases a product in limited supply?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes investor demand overtakes performance and starts to
create the upward pressure on prices,'' Adler said. ``There's no
question some of that is happening now.''
</P>
<P>
   Biotech is doing its bit to add more stock to the market. In
January and February, 20 firms filed IPOs. That matches the number
of biotech firms that went public in 1998 and 1999 combined,
according to the IPO Monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Biotech has had booms before, but nothing like this.
</P>
<P>
   Hollings Renton, chief executive of Onyx Pharmaceuticals and a
20-year industry veteran, experienced the periods in 1980, 1984 and
1987, when biotech first seized the imagination of Wall Street and
the general public. The early booms, notably the one precipitated
by Genentech's 1980 IPO, were fueled almost exclusively on
promises.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 1980s, biotech had almost no products,'' Renton said.
</P>
<P>
   That had changed by 1991, when biotech experienced its next _
and until now _ biggest surge of popularity in the press and on
Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Richard van den Broek, biotech analyst with Chase H&AMP;Q in New
York, said Amgen triggered the '91 boom with a one-two punch that
got Wall Street's attention. First Amgen won a patent battle that
secured its control over the anemia drug EPO. Then it won approval
to sell Neupogen, to prevent infection in people undergoing
chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market went nuts,'' van den Broek recalled. ``Everybody
was going to be the next Amgen.''
</P>
<P>
   In this atmosphere of euphoria, in October 1991, the BTK index
began with a base value of 200. It was comprised of 15 companies
that mirrored the performance of the entire industry. Some, like
Amgen, Chiron, Biogen and Immunex, are still there. Others have
gone away and been replaced.
</P>
<P>
   But the index faithfully recorded the crash that occurred in
1992, after several biotech firms failed to win approval for drugs
to control sepsis, an infectious disease. Investors lost faith in
the biotech miracle.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was at least a three-year, grinding bear market for
biotechs in the midst of a bull market elsewhere,'' van den Broek
said.
</P>
<P>
   After hitting rock bottom in March 1995, biotech experienced
another brief revival. Scott Morrison, biotech consultant with
Ernst &AMP; Young in Palo Alto, said the '95 rally came after
Republicans in Congress killed the Clinton health plan, easing
industry fears of drug price controls.
</P>
<P>
   Bay Area biotech firms like Gilead Sciences seized the chance to
go public. But the '95 rally was weak, and the BTK never got above
160 _ still shy of its 1991 starting point.
</P>
<P>
   The index was still bumping along at 200 in July 1999, when
fickle Wall Street started a new infatuation with biotech.
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear what happened between July and today to triple
the value of biotech. Yes, firms have dozens of products in
late-stage clinical trials, and many will be blockbusters. But the
potential products aren't three times more valuable than they were
a few months ago. Biotech promoters will tell you that three months
ago the stocks were severely depressed and now they are properly
valued.
</P>
<P>
   And yes, our growing knowledge of human genes will ultimately
lead to new medicines. But even if scientists today discovered the
genes for stupidity and greed _ two factors in the current boom _
it would be a decade before they got a pill approved by the Food
and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Long before then Wall Street will prick this bubble. It's not a
question of whether, but rather when and how severe the ensuing
fall will be.
</P>
<P>
   Past biotech windows have lasted six to nine months. This one
started in October and accelerated in January.
</P>
<P>
   As for the severity of the fall, it is hard to envision a crash
as severe as in '92. Biotech's fundamentals are stronger than ever.
Biotech companies had $20 billion in sales in 1998 and currently
have more than 300 prospective drugs undergoing Phase II or III
clinical trials. Some will eventually win approval by the Food and
Drug Administration and lead to future sales.
</P>
<P>
   But the forces that have killed past booms continue to lurk in
the background. Drug price controls are being whispered about
again. A product flop or two, and who can predict what will happen.
</P>
<P>
   One thing we can probably count on is market overreaction. The
market overreacted by shunning biotech for seven years. It is
probably overreacting to biotech's promise now.
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope the market discovers moderation when investors
realize that the payoff from genomics and today's other hot biotech
buzz words could be a decade away.

 _ SF CHRON  
 The NC _ With a Twist  &HT;     By Henry Norr 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
As even a casual technology watcher can tell you, the NC, or
``network computer,'' was a big-time bust. What's not so widely
known is that an increasing number of major companies, including
many in the Bay Area, have enthusiastically adopted a variation on
the idea.
<P>
   The ungainly name for this new technology _ ``thin-client
computing'' _ is hardly a household word, even in Silicon Valley.
But for information-technology managers at many large
organizations, it's shaping up as the Next Big Thing.
</P>
<P>
   The NC, you may recall, was a concept introduced in 1996 by
Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, then taken up by Sun Microsystems' chief
Scott McNealy and other Silicon Valley bigwigs and pundits. The
idea was to replace the conventional PC, with all its cost and
complexity, with a cheap and simple terminal running a Web browser
and small applications downloaded as needed from high-powered
network servers.
</P>
<P>
   The idea resonated with tech managers tired of the high price
and constant hassle of upgrading and supporting PCs, and it
generated an enormous amount of discussion in high-tech circles.
Sun, IBM and other hardware makers began to produce NCs.
</P>
<P>
   There was just one problem: Hardly anyone bought them.
</P>
<P>
   In large part, that was because Ellison et al. made the NC part
of a crusade against Microsoft. Gripes about the software
behemoth's products and policies aren't uncommon among its
corporate customers, but few were prepared to abandon
well-established standards like Microsoft Office.
</P>
<P>
   That was especially true because the alternative _ miniprograms
written in Sun's Java language _ didn't even exist yet, and
developers who tried to create them found the going tougher than
expected.
</P>
<P>
   Thin-client computing, however, promises most of the benefits of
the NC, without forcing customers to abandon Windows. And the new
idea even has Microsoft's support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thin'' refers to the fact that these machines lack many of the
hardware features of conventional PCs. They get by with less RAM
and slower processors because they rely on high-powered network
servers to do most of the work _ that's why they're called
``clients'' of the server. They don't have their own drives,
because applications and user data are stored on the server. And
they don't have expansion slots or most of the ports PCs do,
because the whole point is simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   For now, thin clients represent barely a ripple compared to the
PC tide. According to preliminary estimates by International Data
Corp., worldwide thin-client sales for 1999 amounted to about
700,000 units; for PCs the total was about 113 million. But 700,000
represents an increase of nearly 90 percent from thin-client
volumes in 1998, and Eileen O'Brien, director of the enterprise
thin-client program at IDC, projects that sales will nearly double
again this year and hit 6 million by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Amazon.com reportedly runs on thin clients, although
company officials won't confirm that fact. Parts of Coca-Cola and
Kodak do too, and FedEx is estimated to have 10,000 such machines.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bay Area, the latest thin-client convert is San
Francisco's ABM Industries. Founded in 1909 as a one-man
window-washing business, it now consists of nine operating
companies and 55,000 employees who provide engineering, janitorial,
parking and security services. ABM's 2,400 white-collar employees,
working at 210 offices nationwide, used to have conventional PCs,
but in recent months they've instead received new thin-client
systems.
</P>
<P>
   The transition has presented some challenges, according to
Anthony Lackey, the 36-year-old exec who's supervised the project,
but on the whole it looks like a big success. Because of it, he
estimates, ABM will see ``hard savings'' of $19 million over five
years, and the benefit will be much greater when you factor in
``soft savings'' _ like increased productivity because employees
will waste less time fiddling with computer settings, recovering
from crashes and resolving version conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the project's success, Lackey was just promoted from
assistant vice president to vice president of MIS and from director
to chief technical officer.
</P>
<P>
   National Semiconductor, the Santa Clara chipmaker, has been
moving in the thin-client direction since 1997, according to Bob
Neuberger, manager for thin-client technology. Today the company's
7,400 desktop computers, he said, include almost 700 thin clients,
plus a much larger number of PCs configured to run in client mode.
</P>
<P>
   Other Bay Area stalwarts such as Robert Half Associates and
CellularOne are also deploying thin clients, according to industry
sources. And Contra Costa County has recently installed hundreds of
the stripped-down machines in its county administration building
and court house in Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways the thin client is a throwback to the mainframe
era, when employees had to go through ``dumb terminals'' with no
processing power _ just keyboards and green screens for displaying
text and numbers carried over the wire from the corporate data
center.
</P>
<P>
   Today's thin clients, however, look and feel much more like PCs.
Almost all have a graphical user interface and a mouse. They run
familiar applications, like Microsoft Word and Excel, that few
would describe as thin. Increasingly they include a Web browser,
e-mail and even multimedia capabilities. And they're not dumb _
each has its own microprocessor, though it's used only to manage
communications with the server, where the real computing is done,
and to draw what the user sees on screen.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the biggest beneficiary of the thin-client movement
could turn out to be Microsoft. When Ellison, McNealy and friends
first proposed the NC, Microsoft pooh-poohed it as something no one
wanted. But when Gates et al. saw how much interest the concept
generated among corporate customers, they responded in
characteristic fashion, moving quickly to ``embrace and extend''
the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Relying at first on technology licensed from Citrix, an
innovative software developer based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.,
Microsoft released a special version of its Windows NT 4.0 server
software that allows thin clients to run standard Windows
applications from the server. It also came up with two operating
systems for thin clients: first a version of Windows CE, originally
developed for handheld devices, then a higher-powered alternative
called Embedded NT.
</P>
<P>
   And with the new Windows 2000, Microsoft built support for thin
clients directly into the standard server versions of the software.
In another characteristic move, the company is finding new ways to
make money off the trend: Windows 2000's license will force many
businesses with thin clients to pay increased ``client-access
fees.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Windows 2000 release, and the commitment to
thin-client computing it implies, have given a big boost to the
movement, according to Steve Kaplan, president of Ryno Technology.
His Benicia company once made and sold its own PC clones, but in
recent years it has focused on network integration services,
especially for thin clients.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Microsoft seems to be following its usual policy of
co-opting technological challenges into the Windows framework. And
its strategy seems to be working. Among the several types of client
systems IDC includes in the thin category, ``Windows-based
terminals'' _ running either Windows CE or Embedded NT _ now
represent a majority of unit sales. Of course, that's well short of
Microsoft's 90 percent share of the conventional operating systems
market. But sales of ``Windows-based terminals'' are growing faster
than any other thin-client category, according to O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, Java-centric thin clients _ the original network
computers _ are going the way of the dodo. According to Dataquest,
144,433 were sold in 1997, but the figure has declined steadily to
17,323 last year. The research company expects sales to dwindle to
just 7,638 this year, then disappear.
</P>
<P>
   What happened? The problem was the inefficiency of the Java
language and the software ``virtual machines'' needed to run Java
applications, according to Jeff McNaught, vice president of
marketing at San Jose's Wyse Technology, the leader in thin clients
unit sales. (IBM is second, followed by an array of smaller
companies including Network Computing Devices of Mountain View and
Maxspeed of Palo Alto.)
</P>
<P>
   Wyse tried to build a Java-oriented NC, McNaught said, ``but it
just wasn't viable. The Java apps just got way too big and needed
way too much CPU and memory _ up to 96 megabytes. It would have
ended up costing more than a PC.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, McNaught noted, ``the applications people want are
Windows applications _ there's just no denying that point.''
</P>
<P>
   McNaught is also skeptical about the latest thin-client twist:
terminals based on the free Linux OS. Wyse developed one of those,
too, he said, but decided not to market it under its own name
because demand has been limited.
</P>
<P>
   Even the cost savings that might be expected from using a free
OS turn out to be mostly illusory, according to McNaught, because
Linux requires more memory in the client machine, including
relatively expensive flash RAM for storing the OS. Compared to
those costs, he said, the license fees Microsoft charges for its
thin-client systems are ``insignificant.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be too early to count Linux out of the thin-client
market, though. Numerous developers are working on leaner versions
of it. Citrix, SCO and other companies already offer ways to access
server-based Windows applications from Linux clients, and last
month Ottawa-based Corel announced plans to add such capabilities
to its desktop-oriented Linux version. (Corel is licensing the
software, called Bridges, from a Campbell company named GraphOn.)
</P>
<P>
   Besides, it's at least conceivable that businesses will be less
insistent on compatibility with Windows applications in the future,
as native Linux alternatives increase and mature and as more
applications become available through a browser interface.

<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ Darryl Strawberry is expected to learn this week
how long he will be suspended from baseball, and whether
Commissioner Bud Selig would grant him some loophole that will
allow him to return to the game in the last months of the 2000
season.
</P>
<P>
   After failing a drug test, his third violation under baseball's
aftercare program, Strawberry asked Selig for another chance last
week. Strawberry needs the structure of baseball, his friends
argue. He needs to have the hope of playing the game once again,
they say.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry turns 38 in a couple of weeks, and if taking batting
practice every day is what is preventing Strawberry from doing
cocaine, he is in big trouble. If anybody thinks that serving as
the designated hitter against most right-handed pitchers will keep
him from doing drugs, they are deluding themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry has four children and his wife is pregnant with a
fifth, and he still takes drugs. The fact that he faces a mountain
of debt has not caused him to confront his addiction, and for more
than 10 years, knowing that he could make a lot of money playing
baseball _ and support his family and pay off his debt _ has not
prevented him from doing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   For all of his trouble, Strawberry has never lost his sense of
entitlement. He apparently has never thought of himself as anything
other than a baseball player, capable of incalculable wealth.
According to the report filed with the Florida Department of
Corrections on Feb. 8, Strawberry has ``plans to build a home later
this year in Cheval,'' a gated community which is one of the most
expensive in the area. He is driving a top-of-the-line sport
utility vehicle. When he was out of baseball last year, the Yankees
stopped paying him his salary, and Strawberry did not seek
alternative employment to address his many outstanding obligations.
But he did have a personal trainer who worked on site with him at
Legends Field at the start of spring training.
</P>
<P>
   When police arrested him last year for possession of cocaine and
solicitation of prostitution, Strawberry told them that the drugs
belonged to a relative. He told teammates that there was something
unseemly about the arrest, that the police had it in for him.
Friends whispered to newspapers that the case against Strawberry
was legally flawed, that the charges would be dropped _ right up
until Strawberry meekly plead no contest.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry privately griped that reporters were treating him
unfairly, that they were trying to get him in trouble _ as if they
had anything to do with him circling the block repeatedly and
engaging the undercover officer in Tampa last April.
</P>
<P>
   The morning after his meeting with Selig last week, Strawberry
surprised everyone by appearing at Legends Field. He wanted to make
sure no one thought he was running and hiding, he said. Two hours
later he slipped through a side exit, and he has not been heard
from since.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, Strawberry has been running and hiding for years,
using his baseball career as a cover. He has made at least three
separate appeals to Yankees owner George Steinbrenner to keep him
on his team, made his plea of no contest in order to facilitate his
return to baseball last summer, and last week, he tearfully asked
Selig for another chance to get back in the game.
</P>
<P>
   It's time for Strawberry to focus on everything that really
matters, all of which has nothing to do with baseball: his
addictions, his life, his kids, his obligations. Baseball officials
have given Strawberry many chances to right his career, believing _
hoping _ that he would take advantage of that opportunity. But it's
quite apparent by now that his baseball career cannot solve his
addiction or any of his other trouble. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry is well-liked by his teammates, who are drawn to his
good nature, his sense of humor. He possesses a presence, Yankees
Manager Joe Torre said the other day, because he has been a big
name in the big city. When he looks you directly in the eye, there
is still something vulnerable about Strawberry; you can see shadows
of an innocent and underprivileged 18-year-old kid and it's easy to
feel sorry for him. David Cone has seen the way Strawberry touches
others _ particularly young people _ when Strawberry speaks of his
own travails, and Cone knows there is good in his old friend.
</P>
<P>
   But Strawberry needs to address his own problems. He needs
stability, and it's not going to come from baseball, a sport played
eight months, day and night, in 29 cities located in two countries.
If Steinbrenner wants to help Strawberry, then he should get him
treatment, get him a job away from baseball, and force him to face
the challenges he must inevitably conquer once he leaves the game _
whether that departure takes place in two days or two years.
</P>
<P>
   Selig might be moved by Strawberry, but he should not be fooled
into thinking that giving him a chance to resume his baseball
career will have anything to do with addressing his addiction.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gov. George W. Bush expressed regret on Sunday for
not speaking out against racial and religious intolerance during a
visit to Bob Jones University in South Carolina, an appearance that
has come to haunt his campaign and challenge his claim to being a
new kind of conservative eager to expand the Republican Party's
appeal to all voters.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Cardinal John O'Connor, the Roman Catholic
archbishop of New York, and in a press conference on Sunday
afternoon in Austin, Texas, Bush said that he had erred by not
clearly separating himself from some of the anti-Catholic and
racially discriminatory sentiments that have been associated with
the university, a conservative Christian institution.
</P>
<P>
   Although he did not apologize for making the visit to Bob Jones,
his letter was a striking about-face for the Texas governor, who in
recent weeks had brushed off suggestions that his appearance there
was a mistake, and it reflected the depth of concern in the Bush
campaign that the tenacious after-life of the episode was doing
Bush political damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``On reflection, I should have been more clear in disassociating
myself from anti-Catholic sentiments and racial prejudice,'' Bush
said in the letter to O'Connor, which the Bush campaign said was
mailed on Friday. ``It was a missed opportunity causing needless
offense, which I deeply regret.''
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, Bush reiterated those sentiments, and
said that while he was unaware of some of the policies and
statements associated with Bob Jones University before he went
there, he was not offering that as a defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I make no excuses,'' Bush said. ``I had an opportunity and I
missed it and I regret it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I had gotten up then and seized the moment to set a
tone, a tone that I had set in Texas, a positive and inclusive
tone,'' he added. Bush and officials with his campaign said that
the letter to O'Connor, the spiritual leader of about 2.4 million
Catholics in the New York metropolitan area, was triggered in part
by the Bush family's longstanding friendship with the archbishop.
</P>
<P>
   But the letter also seemed to anticipate the potential
importance of Catholics in the Republican primary in New York on
March 7. Catholics represent an estimated 46 percent of the voters
likely to participate in that primary, the outcome of which could
be pivotal in determining whether Bush can put an end to the potent
challenge from Sen. John McCain of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Bush did not use the word ``apology'' in either his written or
spoken remarks, and his contrition was measured, possibly
underscoring his need for the continued support of the kinds of
religious conservatives who support Bob Jones University. Bush
neither condemned the school nor its officers, and he did not say
that his decision to go there was in and of itself a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Bush used his expressions of regret as an
opportunity to lash out at McCain for raising the specter of
anti-Catholic bigotry as a wedge to attack a political opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Early last week, before the Michigan primary, many Catholic
voters in the state received phone calls that informed them of
Bush's visit to Bob Jones University and of anti-Catholic
statements made by school leaders in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Bush noted in the news conference on Sunday that McCain and his
aides initially said that they were not sure who was making the
calls, but later acknowledged that they were behind the effort. On
Saturday, McCain admitted that he had approved the calls in
advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very disappointed in the senator,'' Bush told reporters.
``It was clear that he looked you in the press corps in the eye and
did not tell the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, campaigning in Virginia on Sunday night, said that he
had not yet been informed of Bush's expression of regret. But
Warren Rudman, a former senator from New Hampshire and the national
chairman of McCain's campaign, caustically noted that Bush's
statement came more than three weeks after his visit to the
university.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took a long time in getting there,'' Rudman said.
</P>
<P>
   The political baggage that Bush picked up with his visit to the
school, which was part of an appeal to Christian conservatives in
South Carolina that helped ensure his victory in the primary,
seemed to grow heavier, not lighter, each day.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters grilled the governor about it on an almost daily
basis. Some prominent Republicans took public issue with the way
Bush was handling it. Political opponents latched onto it as a way
to discredit Bush's self-appointed mantle as ``a compassionate
conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   And Rep. Peter T. King, R-N.Y., threw his support for Bush to
McCain and repeatedly took issue with Bush's appearance at the
university and his ties to Christian conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   But as recently as the middle of last week, Bush was still
publicly saying that he would not make any apologies for his visit
to the school, because his appearance there was not an indication
of what was in his heart. And he made clear that he opposed all
bigotry, religious or racial.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, however, he and his advisers came to realize that he
had to make a public gesture more emphatic than that, both to
assure Catholic voters that he had not intended any insult and to
recapture his image as a centrist Republican, according to
officials with the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign's telephone calls to Catholic voters
provided another incentive, these officials said. Bush did not want
those calls' implicit charge of anti-Catholicism to go unanswered,
and aides said the governor was also genuinely pained at the
thought that anyone might regard him as a bigot.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign officials said that over several days last week, Bush
and his advisers weighed a number of ways for Bush to express his
regret, including writing an op-ed column for newspapers. They said
they did not initially intend to publicize the letter to O'Connor,
written as much out of friendship as anything else, but that
Catholic leaders in New York urged them to.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, Bush says that racial and religious intolerance
``are personally offensive to me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to erase any doubts about my views and values,'' Bush
added. ``As a public official, I take seriously my duty to
encourage tolerance and respect for the religious views of others.
As a Christian, I see Catholics as my brothers and sisters in
Christ, sharing the same ancient creed and core beliefs. And, as
you know, my own brother and sister-in-law are both Catholics.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also chastised people who used his appearance at the
university to draw conclusions about his values or cast aspersions
on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``What no American should expect _ and what I will not tolerate
_ is guilt by association,'' Bush wrote. ``This is why I am
offended by any suggestion that I tolerate anti-Catholic bigotry _
and resent any attempt to create that impression.''
</P>
<P>
   The friction between Bush, McCain and their associates spilled
onto the Sunday morning television news programs. Appearing on
NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' Rudman and Karl Rove, the chief
strategist for the Bush campaign, got into a shouting match as they
quarreled over which of their candidates had the most to be sorry
for.
</P>
<P>
   Rove noted that Rep. Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina
Republican who was co-chairman of McCain's campaign in that state,
had accepted an honorary degree from Bob Jones University.
</P>
<P>
   It was a reminder of how many politicians over time have had
ties to the school or spoken there without stirring the kind of
criticism that Bush's visit did.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one of Bush's most prominent political allies, Gov.
George Pataki of New York, suggested in an interview on Sunday that
McCain was unfairly exploiting the episode.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one should use religion in a campaign,'' Pataki said.
``It's just abhorrent.''

COMMENTARY: AT THE HEART OF THE DIALLO CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BOB HERBERT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The cops had their day in court and were acquitted.
The system was twisted this way and that to insure that they were
treated fairly. More than fairly. The judge, Joseph Teresi,
trumpeted his sympathies as soon as the trial was over by
hobnobbing at a bed and breakfast with the defense lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The hope here is that the cops who killed Amadou Diallo for the
crime of breathing while black will turn in their badges and their
blue uniforms and move on. It would be best all around if they were
to seek vocational satisfaction in some other venue.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever they do, the problems that they have come to epitomize
will remain _the humiliation and brutalization of thousands of
innocent New Yorkers, most of them black and brown, by police
officers who are arrogant, tyrannical, poorly trained, often
frightened and not infrequently racist. (Remember, from the
officers' perspective, the killing of Diallo was his fault.)
</P>
<P>
   Much of the city remains in deep denial about the extent of
these abuses. Only the most sensational cases draw the spotlight.
Everybody recognizes the name Amadou Diallo. But you will get only
a blank stare if you mention Brother Tyrone Davis, a teacher at a
parochial school in Harlem who was stopped so often by the police
he became reluctant to leave the school without his religious
collar.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo's mother, Kadiatou, zeroed in on a fundamental problem
when she complained about the cops viewing her son as suspicious in
the first place. Diallo was standing outside his home, breathing.
That was about it.
</P>
<P>
   According to the police, he also looked up and down the street.
``Peering'' was the pejorative verb they used. Now, that's really
suspicious. The next thing you know, he's dead.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the mayor nor the police commissioner seemed
particularly troubled by any of this. There is little in the way of
official acknowledgment that there is something terribly wrong in
the way that many of the city's police officers conduct themselves.
Rudolph Giuliani and Howard Safir seem not to understand that their
silence in the face of pervasive misconduct by the police is a way
of encouraging misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Or, perhaps they do.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani would have been the perfect person to order a halt to
the harassment of law-abiding New Yorkers, and to begin forging
closer relationships between the police and the communities they
are supposed to serve. But he did not, and it seems safe to say
that he will not. Perhaps when Giuliani leaves office the city will
get a mayor of all the people, and some progress will be made.
</P>
<P>
   But there were missed opportunities on the other side as well.
The impressive protests that followed the killing of Diallo drew
nationwide attention, but that spotlight was not used effectively.
The main thrust of the protests became a demand that the cops who
killed Diallo be indicted and, following that, convicted.
</P>
<P>
   I think that was a mistake. The spotlight drawn by the killing
of Diallo should have been thrown on the wide range of police
abuses that plague New York, from the unwarranted harassment of
innocent men, women and children who are stopped and frisked by the
scores of thousands for no good reason; to the use of numerical
quotas for summonses, gun seizures, arrests and other matters that
drive cops to ignore good sense and the Constitution in a mindless
attempt to satisfy mindless superiors; to the bullying and often
brutal physical abuse that accompanies many encounters between the
police and civilians and that results in tens of millions of
dollars in legal settlements and judgments every year; to the false
arrests that occur with horrifying frequency on matters large and
small (the humiliating experience of Alton White, a star of the
musical ``Ragtime'' comes immediately to mind); to the extreme
tragedies, deliberate or otherwise, like the Abner Louima case and
the slaughter of Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   I agree with Fernando Ferrer, the borough president of the
Bronx, who said, in the aftermath of the Diallo verdict: ``The
bigger issue is reform of the Police Department. That still has to
happen. And that is all about building a relationship of trust
between the community and its Police Department. That, at the end
of the day, is what will keep people in the community and police
officers safer.''

<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ As the presidential campaign moves to the
biggest states, George W. Bush and John McCain are battling
squarely for the biggest prize of all: California, whose
once-mighty Republican Party propelled Richard Nixon and Ronald
Reagan to the White House but has languished and feuded for much of
the 1990s as President Clinton and the Democrats came to dominate
the state.
</P>
<P>
   No Republican presidential nominee has won the Golden State
since the elder George Bush in 1988; the current Democratic
governor, Gray Davis, swept into office with a 20-point margin two
years ago. The Bush-McCain fight has opened new fault lines here
that California Republicans can ill-afford, and a major subtext of
the candidates' struggle is who would be best equipped to regain
the White House by blocking the Democrats from carrying what has
become a must-win state for them in November.
</P>
<P>
   For the reality is that both men are seeking the votes of a
California Republican Party that is older and whiter, and more
dominated at the grass-roots level by social conservatives than it
was in the 1980s, when a pragmatic fiscal conservatism reigned. At
the same time, the state as a whole is younger, browner and more
politically independent than it was a decade ago, and its striking
economic recovery from the severe recession of the early '90s has
helped make Clinton more popular here than in almost any other
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general electorate has gone exactly the other way from the
party leadership in terms of positions on immigration, ethnicity,
abortion, guns,'' said Stuart Spencer, the dean of Republican
strategists here who was one of Reagan's closest advisers from
Sacramento to the White House. ``Till they get their ship righted,
and move back to a more centrist, moderate position, they're going
to have trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   No place exemplifies that trend better than Pasadena, the
once-rock-solid old-line Republican enclave just east of Los
Angeles. In the mid-1990s, State Assembly seats in the area that
had been safely Republican since the 1940s went to Democrats
instead, and this year, the incumbent congressman, Rep. James E.
Rogan, is facing a stiff re-election challenge from a Democratic
state senator, Adam Schiff, in one of the most expensive and widely
watched races in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very much for George Bush, but I think he's just
waffled,'' said Dorie Hilton, a lifelong Republican and the wife of
a retired Navy captain who was shopping along Colorado Boulevard
this weekend. But now Hilton is for ``John McCain without a doubt;
he's such a contrast to Bill Clinton.'' She added: ``If the far
right takes over the Republican Party, we're all in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Hilton is precisely the kind of voter McCain must target to win
a state where only Republican votes will count in choosing
delegates March 7.
</P>
<P>
   She is Republican, female, moderate and likely to vote. And, on
paper, McCain would seem an almost ideal California candidate: a
Westerner, a proponent of campaign finance overhaul and government
reform in a state that regularly passes ballot measures to rein in
its elected officials, an opponent of tobacco in one of the
nation's most strongly anti-smoking states, a Navy veteran in a
state with legions of them.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, Bush has consistently outpolled McCain by about
2-to-1 among Republican voters, nearly a third of whom identified
themselves as strongly conservative in a recent statewide Field
Poll, and nearly 40 percent of whom aligned themselves with the
religious right. A Time-CNN poll released Saturday had Bush leading
among Republicans 49 percent to 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has begun running television advertisements here
portraying himself as a ``proud Reagan Republican,'' in an effort
to rally the party's base. But even that strategy carries potential
risks in a state where the abortion issue has routinely led
moderate Republicans to support Democratic general election
candidates in statewide contests in recent years. Both Bush and
McCain oppose abortion, and no anti-abortion Republican has won at
the top of the statewide ticket since the elder Bush in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order for either one of them to grab the majority of the
Republican vote here, they're both going to have to go to the
right, and that poses problems for both'' in a general election,
said Garry South, a Democratic political consultant who is Davis'
chief adviser. ``The Republicans that you see showing up to vote in
the fall don't look a lot like the ones you see voting in the
primary.''
</P>
<P>
   The state has its unusual ``blanket'' primary system, in which
the names of all candidates appear on the same ballot regardless of
party, because a moderate Republican, Rep. Tom Campbell, believed
he could have won the 1992 primary for U.S. Senate that he lost to
a more conservative candidate if crossover voters had been eligible
to participate.
</P>
<P>
   With financial backing from the computer magnate David Packard,
Campbell sponsored the 1996 ballot initiative that created the new
system.
</P>
<P>
   That means the primary will provide the first real test of how
Californians might vote in the general election. But because the
rules of both national parties expressly forbid selecting delegates
in a blanket primary, the parties cooperated here to pass a state
law requiring that only the votes of party members be used to
select that party's delegates. On the Republican side, all 162
delegates will be allocated to whoever gets the most Republican
votes statewide.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the 1990s, former Gov. Pete Wilson, a fiscal
conservative whose support for abortion rights gave him a moderate
tinge, managed to paper over internal differences with a
grass-roots party organization that was moving to the right on
social issues. But with the resounding defeat of State Attorney
General Dan Lungren, who ran to succeed Wilson in 1998, and of all
but two of the GOP's other candidates for statewide posts, the
differences became all too apparent and the party was left hundreds
of thousands of dollars in debt.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's aggressive stands against illegal immigration and
affirmative action had alienated the state's growing Latino
population, who had once given both him and Reagan more than 40
percent of their votes. More than a year ago, virtually the entire
statewide Republican elected establishment here lined up behind
Bush because he was seen as a nonpolarizing figure whose successful
outreach to Hispanic voters in Texas might translate well here,
though some of the more conservative grass-roots groups held back,
flirting with candidates like Steve Forbes or Dan Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In polls last year, Bush often ran about neck-and-neck with Vice
President Al Gore here. Now, Gore is outpolling the Texas governor
by double-digit margins, but running about even with McCain in
hypothetical general election matchups. That is not great news for
either Republican; Democrats hold about a 9-point edge in voter
registration here, though both major parties have lost strength to
independents.
</P>
<P>
   ``By definition, any nonincumbent Republican running statewide
in California is the underdog,'' said state Sen. Jim Brulte of
Rancho Cucamonga, who took over as the party's finance chairman
last year and got it out of debt with Bush's help. ``That's just
the way things work. The explosive growth of the Latino population
and the ever-increasing percentage of Asian voters in California is
changing the dynamic, and it's important for Republicans to reach
out to those communities. It's also important not to misread the
results of the 1990s: Pete Wilson did get elected twice.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as Republicans make the primary choices next week, in
several counties around the state there are also hot contests for
the little-noticed posts of party central committees, with a
statewide group that calls itself ``mainstream'' trying to regain
control from more socially conservative groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on fire, but in the mainstream, nothing moderate about
us,'' said former state Assemblyman Brooks Firestone of Los Olivos,
north of Santa Barbara in the Central Coast wine-making country.
Firestone, a fiscal conservative who supports abortion rights and
gun controls, lost a bitter 1998 primary for Congress to a more
conservative candidate who had the support of Christian
conservative groups. Since then, Firestone has fought to reassert
the party's more socially moderate wing.
</P>
<P>
   Firestone is a strong Bush supporter, and he thinks ``there's no
question that Bush will win the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``While a lot of Republicans like McCain for who he is and what
he's meant for America,'' he adds, ``they're becoming upset with
his Democratic support as this become more and more obvious that
Democrats are playing around in these open primaries.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Scott Jessup, 44, a banker who was strolling in Pasadena with
his wife, Holly, is one Republican who finds no attraction to
either of his party's candidates this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no leadership at all in the California Republican
Party,'' Jessup said. ``There's no issue. Taxes just won't cut it
anymore. When the economy's very strong, people don't feel like
they need a tax cut.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Bush and McCain he said: ``They don't grab me. At least
McCain appears to have a little more fun.''

FROM PULPIT TO STREET, DIALLO VERDICT PROTEST CONTINUES

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Words of anger, frustration and concern Sunday rose
from pulpits across the city, and more than 1,000 demonstrators
took to the streets for a third day of prayer and protest,
displaying the roiling emotions after the acquittal last Friday of
four police officers in the shooting death of Amadou Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   At St. Patrick's Cathedral, Auxiliary Bishop James McCarthy told
the congregation that Diallo's death should cause people to
``re-examine our own tendencies toward violence, toward fear, and
perhaps toward prejudice _ racial prejudice at that.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Mayor David N. Dinkins, speaking at First Sharon Baptist
Church on East 116th Street in Harlem, called on the parishioners
to make widely known their opposition to the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   At Abyssinian Baptist Church on West 138th Street in Harlem, the
Rev. Calvin O. Butts III compared the verdict to events in South
Africa that led once peaceful black leaders to turn to pick up
weapons in their struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a little like my Lord, I want to kick over some
tables.'' said Rev. Butts, who has at times been a strident critic
of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. Rev. Butts' comments were repeatedly
greeted with cheers and applause in the church, a bastion of the
Harlem establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the sometimes volatile language, the day passed without
violence. But there were tense moments Sunday afternoon when some
of the more than 1,000 people who had assembled at the United
Nations for a prayer vigil began to head down Second Avenue,
disrupting traffic until police officials appealed to protest
organizers to contain the march.
</P>
<P>
   ``They walked onto this man's block, up to his doorstop and shot
him cold,'' said Frankie Lipsett, 39, a building superintendent
from the Soundview section of the Bronx, who joined the rally.
``This is just another example of what is wrong with this country.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict also reverberated in the Senate race, with Hillary
Rodham Clinton telling a national conference of Dominicans at City
College of New York that the Diallo case reflected a ``trust
divide'' in New York.
</P>
<P>
   She said police officers must work harder to understand the
communities they serve, and city residents need to better
appreciate the risk the police face each day. And she called on the
city to do a better job recruiting blacks, Hispanics and other
minorities to the police force, comments that brought almost
immediate criticism from her opponent, Giuliani, whose aides noted
that the police department had embarked upon aggressive minority
recruitment efforts in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   During the rally at the United Nations, both the Giuliani and
the police department were frequently ridiculed. Some demonstrators
wore pictures of Diallo, and others wore pins with a Giuliani
picture that had a red slash through his face.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Al Sharpton, who organized the vigil to try to drawn
international attention to the Diallo case, called on people to
``hold their wallets,'' as Diallo was apparently doing when he was
shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to boycott in this city,'' he said. ``We are
afraid to spend money with certain people because we are considered
suspects. Let's hold our wallets, let's hold our wallets.''
</P>
<P>
   The remarks by Butts, made in two morning sermons to
standing-room-only crowds backed into the popular church, stood in
contrast to his actions last year when he hugged Giuliani at a
service organized by Cardinal John O'Connor at St. Patrick's
intended to ease tension over the Diallo shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Butts, who is considered a possible mayoral contender in 2001,
said that following the shooting of Diallo last February, he
received calls from leaders in the white community urging
restraint.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of those same leaders called me now to say let's get
together, let's sit down and talk,'' Butts said. ``I told them to
go to hell.''

   NEW YORK _ A stretch of 116th Street in East Harlem _
increasingly marked by Mexican restaurants and Dominican bodegas _
nonetheless still bears the name ``Luis Munoz Marin Boulevard''
after the first native son governor of Puerto Rico. On the blocks
around ``El Barrio,'' Puerto Rican music still wafts out of certain
storefronts.
</P>
<P>
   And Maria Martinez, 62, hangs no less than three Puerto Rican
flags from her apartment window and fence. ``The truth is,'' she
likes to say with a bit of Puerto Rican defiance, ``we got here
first.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, though, it is hard to resist the sense that Martinez
is hanging her flags with as much a feeling of nostalgia as pride.
</P>
<P>
   Being Hispanic in New York City used to mean being Puerto Rican.
But over the last decade, the number of Puerto Rican New Yorkers
decreased for the first time since they began arriving in the city
in great numbers 60 years ago _ down by nearly 100,000, or 11
percent, according to data from the Department of City Planning.
With the growing presence of Dominicans and Mexicans, Puerto Ricans
now account for 37 percent of the city's Hispanic population.
Experts say the decline is destined to continue.
</P>
<P>
   In certain ways, city planners say, the trend reflects a
traditional immigration pattern: the dispersion of groups from the
city to the suburbs and other parts of the country as they make
economic headway. But unlike most traditional immigrant groups who
came to New York during the early part of the 1900s, more than a
third of Puerto Ricans leaving the city have moved to Puerto Rico,
including significant numbers of people born in the States.
</P>
<P>
   For many Puerto Ricans, their diminishing presence has provided
them with a moment to look back on, and assess, the Puerto Rican
experience in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Although there has been no shortage of success stories _ from
considerable political gains and lasting contributions to the arts
to the less visible but more pervasive expansion of the middle and
professional classes _ there is much about the fate of Puerto
Ricans that remains puzzling. Why, for instance, are so many among
the poorest of the city's poor?
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, the percentage of Puerto Rican households in the
city living at or below the poverty line increased despite a strong
local economy, to a rate greater than that of any other group.
According to the most recent data, about 40 percent of New York's
Puerto Ricans qualified as poor, a figure considerably higher than
that of African-Americans and worse than the average rate for all
Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Taking stock of the widely differing fortunes of Puerto Ricans
in the city, Luis Garden Acosta, founder of the youth agency El
Puente and a former member of the Young Lords Party, the militant
Puerto Rican group of the 1960s, said, ``It's been a period of
exploration, of very strong community building, of coming to grips
with American reality, with the wonderful promise of great
opportunity starkly contrasted sometimes by the horrible aspects of
our existence.''
</P>
<P>
   Many researchers say there is not enough scholarship to lay out
a definitive explanation of why so many Puerto Ricans in the city
continue to struggle. It is also difficult to track the poor: are
they mostly a static group, or a constantly changing group driven
by the frequent back-and-forth migration between the States and
Puerto Rico?
</P>
<P>
   But there have emerged in recent years some dominant theories on
the progress of Puerto Ricans as a group, some involving a question
of bad timing, others centering on the question of whether their
American citizenship has been a mixed blessing in this country.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, researchers note that because citizenship has
meant no barriers to entry into the United States, the proportion
of poor people among the Puerto Ricans coming to New York over the
decades has been larger than for immigrant groups. This has made
broad economic progress a more daunting challenge.
</P>
<P>
   And many of the Puerto Ricans who arrived from 1940 to 1970 were
especially vulnerable because they wound up concentrated in
manufacturing jobs just as industry began its long and nearly
complete decline in the city.
</P>
<P>
   The depressed state of nearly half the city's Puerto Rican
population is made even more striking when set against the more
general success of Puerto Ricans in other parts of the country,
like Tampa, Fla., and Los Angeles, where the income of Puerto Rican
households has resembled that of the overall population.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's this almost structural poverty,'' said Gladys Carrion,
a Bronx-born Puerto Rican who is executive director of Inwood
House, an agency that serves pregnant teen-agers. ``They're still
living in the poorest communities, segregated communities, with the
worst schools, in the lowest-paying jobs. The question is, why do
we continue to be on the hit parade for the pathology?''
</P>
<P>
   The poverty levels may have something to do with the exodus from
New York, some researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Puerto Ricans in the United States has grown over
the last decade or more, up from 2.7 million in 1990 to 3.1
million, according to the Census Bureau's latest count in 1997. But
in New York City, the Puerto Rican population fell by more than
96,000 residents in roughly the same period, to 800,000 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   While Puerto Ricans have moved out, however, the city's broader
Latinization has increased, its boroughs filling with Central
Americans, South Americans, Dominicans and Mexicans. City planners
estimate that in about 10 years, Puerto Ricans will be replaced by
Dominicans as the city's largest ethnic group by place of origin.
</P>
<P>
   This shift is mainly because of fewer births and because Puerto
Ricans have spread out around the Northeast and beyond, with large
numbers going elsewhere in New York state and to New Jersey and
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Joseph J. Salvo, New York City's chief demographer, said, ``It's
typical of how these things work,'' referring to the growth and
decline of population groups.
</P>
<P>
   But an analysis by Salvo and other city planners after the 1990
census also found something distinctly atypical: of those leaving
between 1985 and 1990, the single largest group, 38 percent, was
going to Puerto Rico. And close to 40 percent of them were born in
the States.
</P>
<P>
   For Puerto Ricans, of course, there has always been a great deal
of migration back and forth between the island and New York in
response to shifts in the economic climate. City researchers found,
for instance, that many of those leaving for Puerto Rico tended to
be less educated and poorer than the Puerto Ricans who stayed in
the city or moved to other states.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers have blamed such circular migration for
interruptions in the family life and schooling of many migrants and
for slowing the development of local leadership and institutions.
By now, however, many Puerto Ricans also migrate back and forth
responding to family ties and better job and educational
opportunities throughout the United States, said Jorge Duany, an
anthropologist at the University of Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Retirees and successful younger people have also been drawn back
to Puerto Rico, where the unemployment rate of 12 percent today is
half what it was in the 1980s. Hildamar Ortiz, a lawyer who left
New York with her 14-year-old daughter in 1996, said she moved
partly to honor her late father's dreams of retiring in Puerto
Rico. But she said she had always wondered what it would be like to
be Puerto Rican in Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Born in the Bronx after her parents migrated north in the late
1930s, Ortiz, 52, who works for the Federal Housing and Urban
Development Department in San Juan, said she grew up in a Puerto
Rican neighborhood where the only non-Hispanic whites around were
the teachers at school. ``The only time we went to Fifth Avenue was
for the Puerto Rican Day parade,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, she said, she feels so at home that she has no plans to
return to New York, except to catch the occasional Broadway play.
</P>
<P>
   ``You belong here,'' she said, sitting in the living room of her
10th-floor beach-front condominium. ``You feel it; nobody questions
it. There's no hostility. I think you don't realize how much that
takes a toll.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in the neighborhoods of Ortiz's childhood, more people have
become poor.
</P>
<P>
   Central to that stubborn poverty is the question of educational
attainment, experts say.Barely 10 percent of Puerto Rican New
Yorkers 25 and older have a college degree, said Francisco L.
Rivera-Batiz, an associate professor of economics and education at
the Teachers College of Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of the educational problems among Puerto Ricans in
the city has only been deepened because the city's current economic
expansion has increased the demand for more highly skilled workers,
Rivera-Batiz said.
</P>
<P>
   Census Bureau officials say the Puerto Rican experience mirrors
somewhat that of Hispanics nationwide, who in the 1990s for the
first time surpassed blacks in poverty and who have the lowest
education rates among the major demographic groups.
</P>
<P>
   But at Aspira, a youth services organization founded 38 years
ago to combat high dropout rates among Puerto Rican students,
officials say the lack of significant progress in educating Puerto
Rican children can no longer be attributed to factors true for
other Hispanic groups, like language problems. By now, most Puerto
Ricans in the city have been born in the States and speak English.
</P>
<P>
   For second- and third-generation Puerto Ricans, said Alex
Betancourt, a director at Aspira, ``the issue is schools that have
been neglected for many, many years and poor family involvement in
education.'' The problem is abetted by a pattern of residential
segregation in New York City that researchers say has been almost
as severe for Puerto Ricans as for blacks, historically the most
segregated demographic group in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks and Puerto Ricans in the city have faced similar
discrimination, researchers said, but the black population has
generally done somewhat better for reasons that go beyond the
language barrier and cultural adjustments that Puerto Ricans
additionally faced.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that the black population counted on its
autonomous churches as ``an enormous laboratory of leadership
development,'' said Andres Torres, director of a Latino public
policy analysis institute at the University of Massachusetts and
author of a book comparing the two groups. Another, he said, is
that the attachment to the homeland among Puerto Ricans has divided
their attention, making them less focused than blacks on dealing
with problems in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps more critically, experts say, blacks have had a more
diversified labor base, and thus more economic mobility, and found
a better labor niche in civil service jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The poverty among Puerto Ricans is largely rooted in the
low-wage manufacturing jobs that first lured migrants to New York
City in large numbers during the post-World War II years _ many of
them agricultural workers displaced by industrialization on the
island, economists and researchers who have studied the Puerto
Rican migration say.
</P>
<P>
   But for many, that kind of employment was short-lived because
manufacturing had begun its steep decline in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Puerto Ricans had terrible timing,'' said Sonia M. Perez, a
researcher with the National Council of La Raza, a national Latino
civil rights organization. ``There was this massive decline of
jobs, and they weren't able to bounce back'' because of low
education levels.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s and '80s, she said, ``you started to see the
breakdown of families, an increase of single-mother families, high
unemployment. That's when you started to see indicators of high
poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Many believe that the poverty was compounded by the Puerto Rican
experience with welfare. Arriving as American citizens, Puerto
Ricans were entitled to the social services denied to many new
immigrants. Among single mothers with young children, who often
found welfare a more attractive option than a low-paying job with
no benefits, public assistance kept many from job experience or
started them on a cycle of poverty, sociologists say.
</P>
<P>
   At 33, Mercedes Gerena, who was born in the Bronx to Puerto
Rican migrants, remains a single parent on welfare, just as her
mother was while raising her and nine siblings in Mott Haven. She
said her fate was sealed when she became pregnant at 16 with the
first of her two children.
</P>
<P>
   Gerena is facing federal deadlines for ending her benefits. She
recently found a job cleaning restaurants, and hopes to one day
become a nurse's aide or a day care attendant. Although her
16-year-old son dropped out of school, Gerena has big hopes for her
daughter, Jennifer, 13, a seventh grader at St. Jerome Church's
parish school who wants to go to college to become a teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Puerto Ricans in the Bronx, they sometimes feel like quitting,
but they hold on, Gerena said. ``We've had our ups and downs. They
all can tell you it's rough, but they've managed.`
</P>
<P>
   For those trying to understand the idiosyncratic history of
Puerto Ricans in New York, there has long been the belief that the
experience has been complicated by their passionate nationalism.
Both Americans and natives of a U.S. commonwealth with its own
culture and sense of nationhood, great numbers of Puerto Ricans
have resisted acculturation. Many blame American policies in Puerto
Rico for the economic conditions that forced them to migrate in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
   New York City Councilwoman Margarita Lopez, who was born in
Puerto Rico, said she has lived in the city for more than 20 years,
but had to decide ``to embrace this country.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to make a conscious decision that you're part of this
or not,'' Lopez, 49, said. ``We're always taking the position of
outsiders, outsiders that are not willing to give up the dream of
going back to the island. You ask yourself, am I betraying who I
am? When I answered no, then I was able to move forward. But it
wasn't easy.''
</P>
<P>
   But other Puerto Ricans are proud New Yorkers. ``Why would I
want to leave the vital electronic center of the world, the most
interesting cultural capital of the world?'' said Miguel Algarin, a
poet who founded the Nuyorican Poets Cafe on the Lower East Side.
</P>
<P>
   Algarin, who moved to New York when he was 9, said the Puerto
Rican flight is a mistake. ``They should have stayed on 116th
Street, fixed up the apartments like whites are doing now and
maintained their political base in the United States,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After a half century, Puerto Ricans in New York have succeeded
in carving out electoral districts and Latino studies programs in
universities. They have won bilingual education and civil rights
battles and congressional, state and municipal posts. They have
created a wide array of organizations, from cultural institutions
to nonprofit agencies that now increasingly serve other Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Puerto Ricans have to be acknowledged as the front line that
opened doors for every Latino that came after them,'' said Susana
Torruella Leval, director of El Museo del Barrio, the Puerto Rican
and Latin American art museum.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 20 Puerto Rican elected officials in New
York. But political representation has not necessarily translated
into advancement for many constituents.
</P>
<P>
   One major limitation, said Juan Figueroa, president and general
counsel of the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, is
that the party system in the state is so machine-driven that it
leaves little room for those who want ``to march to a different
beat in order to deal with the many endemic problems of our
communities.''
</P>
<P>
   But Antonia Pantoja, 77, a pioneering Puerto Rican community
organizer who founded Aspira, said the underlying problem is
indifference by both government and the public, including
economically comfortable Puerto Ricans, to ``a society where
children are not taught by the schools they attend, where families
do not have decent housing to live in, where the color of your skin
will keep you out of the services and resources all citizens are
entitled to.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``Not only are these facts distressing, they are the
shameful reality of a country that professes commitment to a
democratic society.''
</P>
<P>
   At the southern tip of the Bronx, Edwin Lorenzo is among those
staying and refusing to remain indifferent.
</P>
<P>
   Lorenzo grew up in the Mill Brook Houses in Mott Haven and went
to West Virginia University in pursuit of an engineering career.
Then, during one spring break in the Bronx, a friend was murdered
over a drug deal. After that, he said, ``every time I came here, a
lot of things bothered me that didn't use to bother me. The streets
were dirty. There was graffiti on the walls.''
</P>
<P>
   Lorenzo, the youngest of five children born to a Puerto Rican
father and Salvadoran mother, switched majors to become a social
worker. At 28, he is director of the East Side House Settlement
Mott Haven Community Center, a multiservice agency whose
after-school programs he attended as a child. Lorenzo has a brother
in California and another one in Florida, but he is raising his
three children in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many years we judged success by whether or not we left the
inner city,'' he said. ``All the successful people leave, and they
have no connection to the community. All the people who stay are
viewed as failures. That's a greater harm than the other one.
</P>
<P>
   ``You decide it has to stop someplace,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A stretch of 116th Street in East Harlem _
increasingly marked by Mexican restaurants and Dominican bodegas _
nonetheless still bears the name ``Luis Munoz Marin Boulevard''
after the first native son governor of Puerto Rico. On the blocks
around ``El Barrio,'' Puerto Rican music still wafts out of certain
storefronts.
</P>
<P>
   And Maria Martinez, 62, hangs no less than three Puerto Rican
flags from her apartment window and fence. ``The truth is,'' she
likes to say with a bit of Puerto Rican defiance, ``we got here
first.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, though, it is hard to resist the sense that Martinez
is hanging her flags with as much a feeling of nostalgia as pride.
</P>
<P>
   Being Hispanic in New York City used to mean being Puerto Rican.
But over the last decade, the number of Puerto Rican New Yorkers
decreased for the first time since they began arriving in the city
in great numbers 60 years ago _ down by nearly 100,000, or 11
percent, according to data from the Department of City Planning.
With the growing presence of Dominicans and Mexicans, Puerto Ricans
now account for 37 percent of the city's Hispanic population.
Experts say the decline is destined to continue.
</P>
<P>
   In certain ways, city planners say, the trend reflects a
traditional immigration pattern: the dispersion of groups from the
city to the suburbs and other parts of the country as they make
economic headway. But unlike most traditional immigrant groups who
came to New York during the early part of the 1900s, more than a
third of Puerto Ricans leaving the city have moved to Puerto Rico,
including significant numbers of people born in the States.
</P>
<P>
   For many Puerto Ricans, their diminishing presence has provided
them with a moment to look back on, and assess, the Puerto Rican
experience in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Although there has been no shortage of success stories _ from
considerable political gains and lasting contributions to the arts
to the less visible but more pervasive expansion of the middle and
professional classes _ there is much about the fate of Puerto
Ricans that remains puzzling. Why, for instance, are so many among
the poorest of the city's poor?
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, the percentage of Puerto Rican households in the
city living at or below the poverty line increased despite a strong
local economy, to a rate greater than that of any other group.
According to the most recent data, about 40 percent of New York's
Puerto Ricans qualified as poor, a figure considerably higher than
that of African-Americans and worse than the average rate for all
Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Taking stock of the widely differing fortunes of Puerto Ricans
in the city, Luis Garden Acosta, founder of the youth agency El
Puente and a former member of the Young Lords Party, the militant
Puerto Rican group of the 1960s, said, ``It's been a period of
exploration, of very strong community building, of coming to grips
with American reality, with the wonderful promise of great
opportunity starkly contrasted sometimes by the horrible aspects of
our existence.''
</P>
<P>
   Many researchers say there is not enough scholarship to lay out
a definitive explanation of why so many Puerto Ricans in the city
continue to struggle. It is also difficult to track the poor: are
they mostly a static group, or a constantly changing group driven
by the frequent back-and-forth migration between the States and
Puerto Rico?
</P>
<P>
   But there have emerged in recent years some dominant theories on
the progress of Puerto Ricans as a group, some involving a question
of bad timing, others centering on the question of whether their
American citizenship has been a mixed blessing in this country.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, researchers note that because citizenship has
meant no barriers to entry into the United States, the proportion
of poor people among the Puerto Ricans coming to New York over the
decades has been larger than for immigrant groups. This has made
broad economic progress a more daunting challenge.
</P>
<P>
   And many of the Puerto Ricans who arrived from 1940 to 1970 were
especially vulnerable because they wound up concentrated in
manufacturing jobs just as industry began its long and nearly
complete decline in the city.
</P>
<P>
   The depressed state of nearly half the city's Puerto Rican
population is made even more striking when set against the more
general success of Puerto Ricans in other parts of the country,
like Tampa, Fla., and Los Angeles, where the income of Puerto Rican
households has resembled that of the overall population.
</P>
<P>
   Central to the stubborn poverty is the question of educational
attainment, experts say.Barely 10 percent of Puerto Rican New
Yorkers 25 and older have a college degree, said Francisco L.
Rivera-Batiz, an associate professor of economics and education at
the Teachers College of Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of the educational problems among Puerto Ricans in
the city has only been deepened because the city's current economic
expansion has increased the demand for more highly skilled workers,
Rivera-Batiz said.
</P>
<P>
   Census Bureau officials say the Puerto Rican experience mirrors
somewhat that of Hispanics nationwide, who in the 1990s for the
first time surpassed blacks in poverty and who have the lowest
education rates among the major demographic groups.
</P>
<P>
   But at Aspira, a youth services organization founded 38 years
ago to combat high dropout rates among Puerto Rican students,
officials say the lack of significant progress in educating Puerto
Rican children can no longer be attributed to factors true for
other Hispanic groups, like language problems. By now, most Puerto
Ricans in the city have been born in the States and speak English.
</P>
<P>
   For second- and third-generation Puerto Ricans, said Alex
Betancourt, a director at Aspira, ``the issue is schools that have
been neglected for many, many years and poor family involvement in
education.'' The problem is abetted by a pattern of residential
segregation in New York City that researchers say has been almost
as severe for Puerto Ricans as for blacks, historically the most
segregated demographic group in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks and Puerto Ricans in the city have faced similar
discrimination, researchers said, but the black population has
generally done somewhat better for reasons that go beyond the
language barrier and cultural adjustments that Puerto Ricans
additionally faced.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that the black population counted on its
autonomous churches as ``an enormous laboratory of leadership
development,'' said Andres Torres, director of a Latino public
policy analysis institute at the University of Massachusetts and
author of a book comparing the two groups. Another, he said, is
that the attachment to the homeland among Puerto Ricans has divided
their attention, making them less focused than blacks on dealing
with problems in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps more critically, experts say, blacks have had a more
diversified labor base, and thus more economic mobility, and found
a better labor niche in civil service jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The poverty among Puerto Ricans is largely rooted in the
low-wage manufacturing jobs that first lured migrants to New York
City in large numbers during the post-World War II years _ many of
them agricultural workers displaced by industrialization on the
island, economists and researchers who have studied the Puerto
Rican migration say.
</P>
<P>
   But for many, that kind of employment was short-lived because
manufacturing had begun its steep decline in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Puerto Ricans had terrible timing,'' said Sonia M. Perez, a
researcher with the National Council of La Raza, a national Latino
civil rights organization. ``There was this massive decline of
jobs, and they weren't able to bounce back'' because of low
education levels.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s and '80s, she said, ``you started to see the
breakdown of families, an increase of single-mother families, high
unemployment. That's when you started to see indicators of high
poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   Many believe that the poverty was compounded by the Puerto Rican
experience with welfare. Arriving as American citizens, Puerto
Ricans were entitled to the social services denied to many new
immigrants. Among single mothers with young children, who often
found welfare a more attractive option than a low-paying job with
no benefits, public assistance kept many from job experience or
started them on a cycle of poverty, sociologists say.
</P>
<P>
   After a half century, Puerto Ricans in New York have succeeded
in carving out electoral districts and Latino studies programs in
universities. They have won bilingual education and civil rights
battles and congressional, state and municipal posts. They have
created a wide array of organizations, from cultural institutions
to nonprofit agencies that now increasingly serve other Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Puerto Ricans have to be acknowledged as the front line that

and Latin American art museum.

   There are more than 20 Puerto Rican elected officials in New
York. But political representation has not necessarily translated
into advancement for many constituents.
</P>
<P>
   One major limitation, said Juan Figueroa, president and general
counsel of the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, is
that the party system in the state is so machine-driven that it
leaves little room for those who want ``to march to a different
beat in order to deal with the many endemic problems of our
communities.''

CANADA SURPRISES COLOMBIA IN FINAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- This was surely the greatest week in the history
of Canadian soccer, complete with a fairytale ending as soccer's
newest overachievers upset Colombia, 2-0, Sunday in front of 6,197
at the Coliseum to capture the 2000 Gold Cup -- a tournament that
began with CONCACAF giants Mexico and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first tournament championship ever on an
international stage for Canada, who came into the tournament ranked
85th in the world by FIFA -- with the worst reputation among the 12
participating team's.
</P>
<P>
   Canada, who had never been beyond the first-round in recent Gold
Cup competition, needed to win a coin flip over South Korea to gain
a birth in the quarterfinals. From there, the Canadians rewrote
history in Canada, defeating Mexico, Trinidad &AMP; Tobago and Colombia
all in the same week to finish the tournament, 3-0-2.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Devos and Carlo Corazzini each had goals for Canada, and
goalkeeper Craig Forrest, the MVP of the tournament, recorded his
second straight shutout. Forrest, who had a penalty kick save
Thursday against Trinidad &AMP; Tobago, saved another Sunday, guessing
correctly in the 85th minute, stopping Colombian striker Faustino
Asprilla's shot to the left side.
</P>
<P>
   Devos said he expects this to be headline news, at least for a
day, all over Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully this will be front page news at every newspaper and
station across the country,'' said Devos. ``This has never happened
before, we've never won a major trophy. It's a monumental
achievement, just unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Most experts expected Canada to fold after upsetting three- time
Gold Cup champion Mexico last week -- but Devos said the Canadians
never stopped believing something more special could happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever we go out on the pitch, we go out with the intention
of winning,'' said Devos. ``Historically, we haven't had much
success, but today we turned the corner.''
</P>
<P>
   Canadian coach Holger Osieck said he hopes this victory improves
financial backing of Canada's national team program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that we won it, I hope everybody in Canada will support us
and we can go further as a soccer nation,'' said Osieck.
``Hopefully this will pave the way to develop Canadian football the
way it should be developed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Canadians, controlling most of the possession and showing
rare confidence, scored with time winding down in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Nash sent a corner kick to the far post, where Devos
outleaped Colombian defender Andres Mosquera, sending a header to
the near post. Colombian keeper Diego Gomez nearly grabbed the shot
off the line, but the ball rolled inches past in the 45th minute to
give Canada a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadians extended their lead in the second half after
Jeffrey Clarke was tripped by Gomez on a breakaway, setting up a
penalty kick which Corazzini converted in the 67th minute for a 2-0
lead and his tournament leading fourth goal.
</P>
<P>
   In the 85th minute, Forrest preserved the shutout with another
brilliant penalty kick save -- further increasing his reputation on
the international stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's definitely the best goalkeeper in CONCACAF and one of the
best in Europe,'' said Devos. ``Not just because of the two penalty
kick saves, but throughout the tournament he came up big for us and
that's what you need to win championships.''

<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon _ No man has made himself more Israel's enemy in
recent years than Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, the portly, bespectacled
Shiite Muslim cleric who leads Hezbollah, the Lebanon-based,
Iran-backed Party of God that has evolved into a formidable
guerrilla movement and political party from the umbrella
organization that once directed the Middle East's most brutal
Islamic terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Two of Nasrallah's predecessors were assassinated by Israel, the
last one by helicopter gunships that blasted his motorcade with
rockets. So when the militant Islamic leader showed up this month
to mark the eighth anniversary of that attack in Nabi Chit, a
shabby hamlet in the Bekaa region, he was taking a mortal risk.
</P>
<P>
   The rally _ venue and time previously announced _ was barely 10
minutes' flying time from bases in the nine-mile deep ``security
zone'' that Israel has maintained since 1985 in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah, which has dispensed and suffered sudden death on a
numbing scale for 18 years, has more to celebrate these days than
what it hails as the martyrdom of its leaders. Unless events cause
a change of plan, Prime Minister Ehud Barak's commitment to
withdraw Israel's 1,000-man contingent from southern Lebanon by
July 7 has opened the way for Hezbollah to declare itself the lone
Arab force ever to ``defeat'' Israeli forces.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing has been simple in Lebanese politics since the
country began to deconstruct in the mid-1970s, and Hezbollah's
moment of triumph could also be a prelude to a painful transition
for the Islamic group. Many Lebanese predict that the Israeli
withdrawal could remake the political landscape here in ways that
will undermine Hezbollah, since it would strip the group of what,
until now, has been its political trump card.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, it is less the hint of change than the scent of
victory that has lured Nasrallah out of his secretive routines to
events like the one at Nabi Chit, which he reached in a battered
BMW with darkened windows while steely-eyed gunmen rode decoy
behind him in three Range Rovers.
</P>
<P>
   Nasrallah, 40, a vegetable vendor's son who was Hezbollah's
field commander in the south before becoming the group's leader in
1992, is making the most of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   With two bodyguards pressed tightly to his side on the podium at
Nabi Chit, and other armed men patrolling the hall, the
bushy-bearded cleric punched the air, pushed out his chest, and
repeatedly tipped back his black turban as he proclaimed Israel's
``total humiliation and disgrace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I send this message to both the Zionists and the Americans:
You are fighting God in southern Lebanon, and those who fight God
are doomed to defeat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Israel, many concede that Hezbollah has won a classic
guerrilla victory _ by not losing, by outlasting the enemy, by
inflicting losses that erode support at home _ rather than by a
triumph of arms.
</P>
<P>
   In one of many similar articles in Israeli newspapers, Yoel
Marcus, a columnist for Haaretz, a newspaper long opposed to the
occupation of southern Lebanon, compared the promised pullout to
the United States' defeat in Vietnam. He concluded, ``This is one
war that we have lost.''
</P>
<P>
   The kind of Hezbollah action that has worn down Israeli
resistance is on display at an exhibition the group opened last
week in Beirut. Day after day, young Lebanese have clustered around
a television set playing a videotape that shows Hezbollah fighters
in camouflage fatigues and helmets storming Israeli posts on rocky
hillsides in southern Lebanon, or detonating roadside bombs as
Israeli military convoys wind their way along mountain roads.
</P>
<P>
   Attacks like those have killed hundreds of Israeli soldiers
since Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1978, including seven in the
last month alone.
</P>
<P>
   What happens now will involve a complex political matrix, in
which Hezbollah's activities will be profoundly influenced by more
powerful players, including Iran and Syria, its two principal
backers, and the Lebanese government, as well as the terms of any
peace deals Israel can work out with Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The peace talks between Israel and Syria, suspended now but
likely to resume, will revive Israeli demands that Syria use the
power it wields in Lebanon, where it has 35,000 troops, to
guarantee that the power vacuum Israel leaves behind is filled not
by Hezbollah, but by Lebanon's 65,000-man army. The Lebanese
government, which wants its own peace with Israel, would then,
presumably, inhibit Hezbollah attacks into Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, senior Lebanese political and military officials
concede that Hezbollah's stepped-up military offensive against
Israeli forces in recent weeks _ attacks that prompted the Israeli
bombing raids that destroyed three Lebanese power plants on Feb. 8
_ were almost certainly encouraged by Syria.
</P>
<P>
   By this reckoning, Syria may have calculated that putting
pressure on Israeli forces in Lebanon would help wrest concessions
that Israel has so far refused in talks. By the same token, these
Lebanese officials say, Syria, once it achieves its own peace with
Israel, will not want to see it disturbed by continued fighting
across the Israel-Lebanon border.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah could thus could end up isolated, its 1,500 guerrilla
fighters too weak to maintain dominance in areas of southern
Lebanon and the western Bekaa region it now controls, and in effect
consigned to the diminished role of a political party competing in
Lebanon's sectarian politics.
</P>
<P>
   Considering that Shiite Muslims are the largest group in
Lebanon's population of 3.5 million Muslims and Christians, and
that Hezbollah is now indisputably the strongest Shiite political
force, the situation poses pressing questions. Will Hezbollah
continue the more moderate politics it adopted in the 1990s? And
will its professed conversion to democracy only cover the old
passions for a militant Islamic state in Lebanon?
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, there are major questions for the entire region,
since lasting Middle East peace may ultimately depend on whether
militant groups like Hezbollah and its Palestinian counterpart,
Hamas, abandon their historic goals of extinguishing Israel and
accept that it has a permanent place on the Middle East map.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the answers to these questions lie in Iran, the source
of Hezbollah's brand of Shiite fundamentalism, and of an estimated
$2 billion in support since the early 1980s, and in Syria, the
conduit through which the arms supplied by Iran have flowed.

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s Hezbollah rejected the very idea of an independent
Lebanon, as of an independent Israel, calling for the submersion of
both in a greater Islamic state. With the emergence of more
moderate policies in Iran, Hezbollah underwent what scholars here
call a ``Lebanonization'' and shifted toward the mainstream. It now
controls the largest single bloc in the 128-seat Parliament, with
seven seats of its own and influence over perhaps 50 others.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Hezbollah has established a substantial
presence in Lebanese life. Apart from two radio stations, a popular
television station and several newspapers, it has a far-reaching
network of hospitals, clinics, pharmacies, schools and martial arts
centers, as well as welfare and rehabilitation centers for those
injured by war and for their families, and pensions for relatives
of dead fighters.
</P>
<P>
   A Lebanese scholar who has written extensively on Hezbollah,
Nizar Hamzeh, says that under Nasrallah, ``the party has
concentrated more on the ballot box than on bullets,'' although
U.N. records continue to show a pattern of about 1,500 attacks a
year on Israeli troops. Still, Hamzeh says, the jury is out on what
Hezbollah's ultimate aims may be.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ultimate goal is still to capture the Lebanese state,'' he
said in an interview in his office at the American University of
Beirut, whose American president, Malcolm Kerr, was assassinated in
1984 by gunmen who were widely assumed to be linked to Hezbollah.
``But the question is, what kind of Lebanese state? There may be
those within Hezbollah whose attitude is `If we can't succeed in
creating an Islamic state from without, let's do it from within.'''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, no clear answers are available to those who
visit Hezbollah's center of strength in the crowded southern
suburbs of Beirut, in the Bekaa region along Syria's border and
amid the olive, orange and lemon groves of southern Lebanon where
fighters mount their attacks on the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Every question about Hezbollah's longer-range goals, including
whether it will seek to carry the war against Israel across the
border after Israeli troops leave, is met with polite evasions.
</P>
<P>
   Nasrallah lost his oldest son, Hadi, an 18-year-old Hezbollah
commando, in a skirmish with the Israelis in 1997, and stroked his
son's face in his coffin at the funeral 10 months later, when
Israeli forces returned the body. But the Hezbollah leader shows
little passion or bitterness when asked about the movement's future
attitude to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the Pakistani Islamic scholar Eqbal Ahmad,
in June 1998, he said Hezbollah could not be more Palestinian than
Yasser Arafat. ``If their leaders compromise, there is little we
can do,'' he said in the interview, which was published in Dawn, a
newspaper in Karachi, Pakistan. ``We cannot substitute for their
leadership. If they decide to resist, we shall be on their side.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Hezbollah seems to have achieved a genuine popularity,
beyond working-class Shiites, who are its traditional constituency.
Its 20,000 active members now include many middle-class
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the reconstructed high-rises of west Beirut, risen from the
rubble of the 16-year civil war, drivers of expensive sedans wait
at ``friendly checkpoints'' set up by young Hezbollah activists in
yellow smocks, breezily tossing banknotes into plastic buckets in
return for candies.
</P>
<P>
   The donations help cover a sharp cutback in financing for
Hezbollah by Iran, which began urging the group to moderate its
policies when Iran began easing its Islamic policies in the early
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Once Israel withdraws from Lebanon, however, Hezbollah's support
may shrink back more to its core: working-class Shiites. Sunni
Muslims, Christians and other religious groups and the middle class
seem grateful to Hezbollah for its part in driving Israeli troops
out, but convinced that peace would be better managed by other
hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, we support Hezbollah for driving out the Israelis _
they have been brave and we owe them much,'' said Antranik
Helvadjian, a bookstore manager of Armenian descent. ``But
Hezbollah to govern Lebanon? Absolutely not.''
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah has made a big push to remold its message, and some
Lebanese take comfort from Hezbollah officials' effort to expunge
elements of the group's past, including terrorism. In its offices,
officials' faces tighten, and Western reporters find visits and
interviews being canceled at short notice, when they merely mention
the word.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hezbollah had nothing to do with any terrorist acts,'' Hussein
al-Khalil, Hezbollah's security chief in the 1980s and now chairman
of its politburo, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   That stretches credulity. According to Western intelligence
reports and other evidence, the 1983 bombings of the U.S. and
French embassies and marine compounds, the 1985 TWA hijacking and
about 50 kidnappings were carried out by Islamic splinter groups
that operated under pseudonyms, but always under Hezbollah's
control.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983 alone, at least 400 people were killed in Hezbollah
terror attacks in Beirut, including more than 250 Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Hezbollah officials seem uneasy when discussing the
group's links to Iran. Its offices are a gallery of portraits of
Iranian religious leaders, and Hezbollah's leaders, clerics and
nonclerics alike, adopt Iran's Islamic dress codes.
</P>
<P>
   But Khalil, Hezbollah's politburo chief, insisted that this did
not translate into Iranian control. ``We are Lebanese 100
percent,'' he said. ``We have good relations with Iran, and we take
spiritual guidance from Iran's religious leaders, but our decisions
are taken by Hezbollah, not by Iran.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Lebanese scholars agree, noting more political and
financial independence and support that may even enable it to
resist orders from Syria.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a real evolution within the movement, because
they have come to the conclusion that the Islamic revolution _ and
the revolutionary mentality _ cannot survive for long,'' said
Farouk Nassar, a Lebanese journalist who is now an editor with The
Middle East Reporter, a widely read political bulletin. ``They know
that they have to adjust, or they're doomed.''

BELCHER HOPES TO RETURN IN APRIL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. -- The biggest issue the Angels face in camp is
putting together a starting rotation, but one pitcher they can't
count on for the first month is Tim Belcher.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher, in the second year of a two-year, $10.2 million
contract, had surgery to repair a torn flexor muscle in his right
elbow Dec. 2. These days he's playing catch every other day, slowly
increasing his arm strength. The club would like to have him
throwing off a mound for the first time March 10 or 11.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their plan for me is if I miss four or five starts in April
and I'm back by May 1, they'll be happy,'' Belcher said of the
rehab schedule. ''My thinking is if I'm throwing off the mound by
March 10, I should be able to throw an inning or two (in a spring
game) by the end of camp. If I can do that, there's no reason I
can't be ready by mid-April or the end of April.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll try to be as cautious as I can, but at the same time,
they're saying take baby steps but I feel like a premie.''
</P>
<P>
   The good news for Belcher is that the injury did not involve the
ligament. Had the ligament been torn instead of the muscle,
Belcher, 38, would have retired. And even the muscle tear wasn't
significant. In fact, Belcher said most of the pain resulted from
the build-up of scar tissue, which was removed during surgery.
</P>
<P>
   A healthy Belcher can certainly help a starting staff that will
have to rely heavily on young arms, but he says the outlook isn't
as bleak as it's made out to be.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been on staffs with more question marks than this one and
won,'' he said. ''A prime example is the (Dodgers) staff in '88 and
we won it all. Going in we had one guy who was established and
healthy -- Orel (Hershiser). Fernando's (Valenzuela) health was a
question mark, Tim Leary had never won and I was a rookie. And we
had just traded Bob Welch to Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   ''But Leary has a breakout year and wins 17; I win 12 and we win
the World Series. We've got some good young arms here. The staff on
paper is the weakest part of the club, but that doesn't mean we
aren't any good.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels are also being cautious with Ken Hill, even though
Hill professes to ''feeling fine.'' Hill has an athritic right
elbow which usually becomes inflammed with excess work.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's at the stage where he is ready to face live hitting, but
we're also working on mechanics,'' manager Mike Scioscia said.
''He's coming along nicely.''
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Troy Glaus has switched his uniform number to 28
so that Scioscia could wear 14, the number Scioscia wore throughout
his major league career. Glaus said Scioscia called him at home
during the off-season to ask if the switch was OK. Glaus obliged.

COMMENTARY: GREAT LEAP BACKWARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The tectonic plates are shifting under China's
political system. The resulting stress seems to be leading toward a
political earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   How else to explain Beijing's apparently irrational threat last
week of growing readiness to take Taiwan by force?
</P>
<P>
   Here is China, working closely with the Clinton administration
to join the World Trade Organization, and thereby to further
penetrate the American market while removing the annual
human-rights pressure from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   And here is China, working in Washington to block the Taiwan
Security Enhancement Act, helping President Clinton prevent that
nation of 22 million free Chinese from buying defenses against
Beijing's new missile batteries across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
   At this critical moment, with both China's WTO admission and
Taiwan's anti-missile defense in the balance in Congress, Beijing's
communist leaders undermine Clinton's efforts to help them.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, they double-crossed Clinton in the most insulting way.
The U.S. president sent a mission to Beijing headed by his closest
diplomatic and military advisers. Their goal was to prevent any
rash moves by China against dissidents or harsh rhetoric about
Taiwan that would embarrass Clinton's pro-China backers in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But unbeknownst to our mission, the Beijing regime was preparing
an 11,000-word white paper escalating the tension. Just after our
delegation left, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott was
delivered the diplomatic equivalent of a slap in the face with a
wet fish.
</P>
<P>
   China's leaders are not crazy. The only rational explanation for
their seemingly aberrant behavior is that a split in their
leadership is widening rapidly. That severe internal stress could
cause a lashing-out into war in the Strait.
</P>
<P>
   One side _ the ``half-good'' side behind Prime Minister Zhu
Rongji _ while stifling political freedom at home, wants to take
the capitalist road, loosen economic constraints, do business with
the United States and join the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   The far worse side _ behind President Jiang Zemin and the
corrupt military-industrial cartels _ fears free trade, and
counters worker and student unrest by arresting dissidents and
cracking down on (and driving underground) the growing Falun Gong
movement.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been assuming that the half-good side behind Zhu is
winning. That (and not just the suasion of his lucrative Riady
connection) accounts for his flip-flop from ``butchers of Beijing''
to ``strategic partners.''
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy is that the Jiang hard-liners are winning. To be
charitable about the motive for Clinton's appeasement, see it as
intended to help the better side _ but the practical result has
been to enrich, embolden and empower those hard-core communist
despots whose families are tightly tied to the militarists.
</P>
<P>
   That's why China sells arms to rogue states, why it sides
stridently with Russia against the West on Kosovo and Iraq, and why
it sent a mob to trash our embassy in deliberately violent response
to our accidental bombing. Most important, the failure of Clinton's
appeasement is revealed in China's sharp escalation of military
threats to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang's communist militarists have recently seen what a dose of
nationalist fervor can do to keep a repressive regime in power.
They watched how Vladimir Putin used ``breakaway Chechnya'' as his
scapegoat to take workers' minds off economic distress, and how
Washington reacted by admiring his intellect and thereby supporting
his election. They have been making the same noises about
``breakaway Taiwan'' as Putin did before his popular rape of the
Chechens.
</P>
<P>
   America's policy must not reward the Jiang adventurists by
extending them WTO membership and by failing to be the arsenal of
Taiwan's democracy. That would further enervate Jiang's internal
opposition in the Forbidden City.
</P>
<P>
   Our candidates for president, Al Gore included, should call on
Clinton and Congress to respond with resolution to the new
intimidation of Taiwan. The way to prevent war _ and the terrible
decision that would face the next president _ is to make clear now
that belligerent threats by Beijing's dominant faction trigger
consequences that will weaken China.

   REDMOND, Wash. _ Washington state, which will account for only
2.2 percent of delegates at the Democratic National Convention this
year, has unexpectedly emerged as a battleground for the two men
seeking the party's presidential nomination, and Al Gore spent much
of the weekend here trying to make sure that Bill Bradley would
have nothing to show for his effort to win the state's primary on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley suspended his national campaign last week to spend time
in the Evergreen State. He needs a victory here to resuscitate his
candidacy. His decision to spend precious campaign time here,
rather than in big states like California and New York, which vote
on March 7, puzzled many political professionals.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore, refusing to concede any ground to his opponent, is
fighting back. He made room in his schedule for a series of events
where he highlighted his environmental record, his support for
civil rights and his endorsement by Gov. Gary Locke and the state's
Democratic establishment.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle Sunday, Gore highlighted the case of a sickly
6-month-old to support his argument that Congress ought to pass
legislation defining the rights of patients frustrated with the
health care system.
</P>
<P>
   The infant, Ian Malone, suffered brain damage when he was
deprived of oxygen at birth and cannot eat or swallow. He has
received nursing care at home for 16 hours a day, but the insurance
company has decided to end coverage because it says private nursing
care is not needed.
</P>
<P>
   The baby is fed by a tube and must have his lungs cleaned out
several times a day. The parents, Dylan and Christine Malone of
Everett, Wash., said they could not afford to hire nurses, who
could cost more than $200 a day. They have filed several
unsuccessful appeals with Aetna, the insurance company
administering their health plan.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he would try to persuade the company to reverse its
decision. Aetna spokesmen were not immediately available for
comment Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was in fine fighting form as he hammered his opponent at a
meeting of state Democrats in the union hall of the aerospace
machinists here on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The presidency is not an academic exercise,'' he said,
suggesting that Bradley's approach to social problems was too
cerebral. ``It's not a seminar on some grand theory. It's not a
place from which to ponder problems. The presidency is a day-by-day
fight for real people who face real challenges and need a real
champion who is willing to fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he took comfort in the fact that he had been attacked
simultaneously by Bradley as too conservative, and by conservatives
as too liberal. ``I must be doing something right,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic voters who heard Gore and Bradley over the weekend
say they liked both, but tended to favor the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick J. Hammond, 31, a deputy county prosecutor from Tacoma,
Wash., said: ``I support Gore. I really think he's the better
qualified of the two. Bradley is a good man. I like him. But he's
trying to portray himself as something that he isn't _ as more
progressive and more liberal than his voting record indicates.''
</P>
<P>
   Justin O. Delacour, a 26-year-old courier for Federal Express,
said he would vote for Bradley. Of the vice president, he said: ``I
don't believe he's a very progressive candidate. The way he speaks
indicates that he's more progressive than I think he actually is.''
</P>
<P>
   After hearing the two candidates speak to the Seattle branch of
the NAACP, also on Saturday night, Harold Johnson, a retired
tool-maker for Boeing, said, ``I like them both.'' But he said that
politically active people in his neighborhood were ``leaning toward
Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington has more than 3 million registered voters. Any of
them may vote in the primary on Tuesday. But the results do not
affect the selection of the state's delegates to the Democratic
National Convention, who are chosen through a caucus process that
begins on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   By moving up the date for their primary, Washington state
Democrats hoped to heighten their influence in the selection of a
presidential nominee, while getting candidates to pay more
attention to the state. And they succeeded beyond their
expectations.

RABIN VOWED TO PULL BACK FROM GOLAN, BARAK SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel told his cabinet
Sunday that Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister who was assassinated
in 1995, had given guarantees that Israel would fully withdraw from
the Golan Heights in exchange for security commitments by Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said he would not ``erase the past,'' hinting that he,
too, would be prepared to meet Syria's demand and withdraw down to,
or close to, the shores of the Sea of Galilee if Israel's security
needs were met.
</P>
<P>
   This has been the working assumption of diplomatic analysts
tracking the Israeli-Syrian peace effort _ that a complete
withdrawal to the June 4, 1967, line is the condition for a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Barak himself has repeatedly said he would honor the historical
record in the negotiations with Syria, which have been suspended
since January. But he never before made it clear publicly how the
Israeli government perceived that record, and had been vague about
what he was prepared to do.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli television and radio reporters treated his words as a
revelation. Channel 2 News here said Sunday night, ``It was the
first time that an Israeli prime minister has ever admitted'' that
Israel had agreed _ conditionally _ to a complete withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   The revelation was not exactly public. It leaked from a
closed-door cabinet meeting in classic Israeli style. But it leaked
so efficiently, to every Israeli radio and television broadcast,
that it was clearly meant as a roundabout way to start preparing
public opinion for possible concessions.
</P>
<P>
   It was also seen as a signal to Syria that Israel is willing to
talk specifically about borders.
</P>
<P>
   Angry that Israel refused to engage in in-depth discussions
about the possible extent of an Israeli withdrawal, Syria broke off
talks with Israel shortly after their negotiations resumed last
December.
</P>
<P>
   Syrian officials were embarrassed by the leak of a draft treaty
to an Israeli newspaper. The treaty, a working document prepared by
the Americans that summarized both sides' positions, made no
explicit mention of Israel's position on the border line but
revealed concessions on security that Syria was supposedly willing
to make.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, American diplomats have tried to restart the talks.
It is unclear what is going on secretly, but publicly the
relationship between Syria and Israel is characterized by vehement
hostility that in no way resembles a dialogue of peace.
</P>
<P>
   Syria's state-run newspapers have run frequent references to
Israel as ``Nazi-like.'' And Israel has accused Syria of allowing
or even abetting increased guerrilla attacks on Israeli soldiers in
southern Lebanon. These attacks pushed Israel to bomb civilian
targets in Lebanon earlier this month and brought condemnation on
Israel, led by Syria, from the entire Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   What Barak told his cabinet ministers Sunday was that
Israeli-Syrian negotiations conducted by his immediate predecessors
all presumed a withdrawal from the Golan Heights and dealt with the
June 4, 1967, line, said Gadi Baltiansky, his spokesman, confirming
the leaks from the cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Barak appeared to confirm what Syria has long maintained _ that
Rabin had left a ``deposit'' with the Americans, a promise that a
full withdrawal would be undertaken if Syria conceded Israel's
demands on security.
</P>
<P>
   He also said Sunday that Benjamin Netanyahu, his immediate
predecessor, had agreed to withdraw from the Golan down to two
miles from the June 4, 1967, line at one point and ``significantly
less'' than two miles elsewhere, Baltiansky said.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu issued a statement denying this information, which
Barak said came from Ronald Lauder, the American businessman.
Lauder was Netanyahu's emissary to Syria for secret negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that everybody is talking now about a
complete withdrawal from the Golan Heights,'' Housing Minister
Yitzhak Levy said after the cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has pledged to pull out of Lebanon by July, but he
intended to do so as part of an agreement or near agreement with
Syria. Sunday his ministers began facing the possibility that an
agreement might not be reached and examining the risks and timing
of a withdrawal that would take place without Syria's assistance.

ON THE FIRST DAY, SOSA IS SWINGING, RUNNING AND SLIDING 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MESA, Ariz. _ Demonstrating veteran wiliness, Sammy Sosa stopped
running. The Chicago Cubs were running their post-workout sprints
in the outfield, and Sosa badly trailed the pack. But this was the
last sprint, so Sosa stopped well short of center field, his
destination, spun around and raced back to the right-field line,
easily beating the rest of the players. Then he collapsed to the
ground, exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   For Sosa, the first day of spring training was over Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was running, I was little bit tired,'' Sosa said,
meeting with reporters after he refreshed himself with a shower.
The slugger, however, fared better than his teammate Willie Greene,
who was also on the field for the first time. Sosa made it to the
end of the workout; Greene did not get through stretching
exercises.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently dehydrated, Greene, a third baseman, became
lightheaded and nauseated and had to leave the field. He wound up
in a hospital, receiving two liters of fluid intravenously.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, meanwhile, pumped life into the Cubs' workout, unleashing
a barrage of batting practice home runs reminiscent of his
performances the past two seasons, in which he hit a total of 129
home runs. Only Mark McGwire, with 135, has hit more in two
successive seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't expect him to hit live, but he did,'' Don Baylor, the
Cubs' new manager, said.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, who came to spring training late because he was recovering
from the flu, started slowly, hardly hitting the ball fair out of
the batting cage with his first 16 swings in four rounds of
hitting. Then he sent 13 balls soaring over the outfield fence in
his next 28 swings, many of the balls landing on Center Street and
menacing traffic. Fans stood behind the fences and scrambled after
the balls, jeopardizing their own well-being as they scooted
between moving vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   No, Sosa said, he was not surprised at the results of his first
batting practice, which lasted 10 rounds and 45 swings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is me; this is my swing,'' he said. ``When you've been
swinging the bat for the last two months, it doesn't surprise me. I
was hitting back home in the Dominican. I don't take long to get
ready.''
</P>
<P>
   In his early swings, he broke three bats. ``That's OK,'' he
said. ``Spring training's like that. The first couple days,
pitchers are trying to make the team. I don't mind breaking a
couple more bats.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Neal did not mind Sosa breaking bats. As he walked from
the hitting field to the running field at Fitch Park, Sosa reached
over a fence and handed the bat to Neal, a 5-year-old fan, who was
seated on her father's shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in his workout, Sosa joined his teammates in sliding
practice. Now a player who hits the ball out of the park 66 times
or 63 times does not have to slide into any of the bases as he runs
around them. But Baylor has plans for Sosa, and they require
sliding. The manager wants his home run hitter to steal more bases
than the seven he had last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want him to take a few more chances,'' Baylor said. ``A lot
of guys will be given the green light to steal a bag if they want
to. He'll be one of the guys. But I'm not stupid. I'm not going to
make him do things he's not comfortable doing. But during the
course of the season, I think he will become a little more
comfortable with what we're trying to accomplish. We're trying to
take the extra base, move up runners. When he sees these other guys
doing it, he'll understand what we're trying to do. He's a very
smart player.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Sosa became the first player in Cubs history to go
30-30, hitting 33 home runs and stealing 36 bases. He reached that
level two years later with 36 homers and 34 steals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still believe that I can steal 30 bases again,'' the
31-year-old Sosa said. ``When I was 30-30, I weighed 198. Now I'm
225, 230. When you gain some weight, you're supposed to become
slow. But I don't believe that. I believe if you know how to steal
bases, you're going to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   And furthermore, he said, he's prepared to do what the manager
wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a problem with that,'' he said. ``Anything I can
do for my team to win the game, I'm willing to sacrifice myself and
go out there and do anything I can. If he wants me to steal, I love
to steal. I don't see why not. I'm ready. I came in to do whatever
he wants me to do.''
</P>
<P>
   In spite of Sosa's 63 home runs, the Cubs lost 95 games last
season, second most in the National League. That is why Baylor
intends to change the way the Cubs play. But can Sosa hit 60 for a
third successive season?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no limit for myself,'' he said. ``I'm still hungry. I
come back here and forget about what has happened the past two
years. This is a new year. I can't sit down and relax because I've
had two great years. I feel like a rookie. I'm still hungry. When
you're hungry, you're never satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa the past two years has waged scintillating home run battles
with McGwire, who plays for division rival St. Louis. Now Ken
Griffey Jr. has joined the National League Central. Sosa welcomed
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great,'' he said of the trade that put Griffey with
Cincinnati. ``The National League is going to be more exciting
because we got Griffey, Mark and myself. Everybody is waiting for
us to go out there and put on a show.'' &QL;

<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Because of the risk to the soldiers, the
Pentagon has refused to allow U.S. troops to return to northern
Mitrovica, the section dominated by Serbs in the divided town that
has become a flash point of ethnic tension in Kosovo, senior United
Nations and Western officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Klaus Reinhardt of Germany, the commander of the NATO-led
peacekeeping forces in Kosovo known as KFOR, said negotiations were
continuing.
</P>
<P>
   Asked directly in an interview here Sunday whether the United
States had refused to send troops back to northern Mitrovica,
Reinhardt paused for a time and then said: ``Your question comes a
couple of days too early. We're working on this question.''
</P>
<P>
   Reinhardt has pushed hard to internationalize the KFOR troops in
Mitrovica, which is in the French zone of Kosovo. When American
troops first entered the north to search for weapons a week ago,
angry Serbs hurled snowballs, stones and bricks at them, and they
finally withdrew. The soldiers were criticized for aggressive
tactics such as breaking down doors.
</P>
<P>
   The general said that because he did not want the Serbs to
dictate who would patrol northern Mitrovica, he sent U.S. and
German troops back into the north a few days later, but at 5 a.m.,
to do a weapons search.
</P>
<P>
   But officials here say the Americans, who are in charge of the
tense eastern sector of Kosovo, do not want to send troops back to
Mitrovica. Reinhardt said many countries in the peacekeeping force
that had refused his requests to help patrol Mitrovica in November
and December were now willing to take part after violence this
month killed at least 11 people, most of them Albanian.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today a lot of the restrictions on me that were in place in
December are gone,'' the general said, praising the Swedes, Finns
and Danes in particular for their willingness to take on the risks
of Mitrovica. ``We'll see when the Americans go back there.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Pentagon's reluctance, officials say that Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright has been on the telephone almost daily
with Bernard Kouchner, the head of the U.N. mission here, urging a
solution to the Mitrovica issue.
</P>
<P>
   Reinhardt also said he had pressed the Americans hard in the
last month to do a better job of securing Kosovo's eastern border
with the rest of Serbia. The goal there is to prevent armed
Albanians, some of them in uniform, from attacking targets inside
Serbia proper, especially in the 3-mile-wide demilitarized zone
where Serbian troops are not allowed to enter, although the police
are.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why such armed groups _ offshoots of the supposedly
dismantled Kosovo Liberation Army _ were allowed to enter Serbia
from Kosovo, the general bristled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not allowing it,'' he said firmly, noting that KFOR had
arrested six armed people on Saturday trying to go across the
border. ``I told people to arrest anyone who tries to go out of our
sector into eastern Kosovo. We close down the border as much as
possible. We recognized that something was brewing, and my
instructions were to seal that border more hermetically before
there is a real crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   American troops have now built watchtowers along the border with
Serbia, near the towns of Bujanovac, Presevo and Medvedja, which
have majority Albanian populations and which more radical Albanians
refer to as ``eastern Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Armed Albanians wearing uniforms with shoulder patches like
those of the KLA, but representing an organization dubbed the
Liberation Army of Presevo, Bujanovac and Medvedja, have been seen
in the demilitarized zone. In response, the government of
Yugoslavia put four more militarized police units into the area,
alarming NATO officials.
</P>
<P>
   The area is also known as an entry point for drug smuggling, and
Reinhardt said he was still asking capitals for specialized
officers in drug interdiction. The U.N. police, badly under
strength, has also requested officers with such expertise, but in
vain.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The official Yugoslav press agency, Tanjug, reported Sunday that
a Serbian policeman and an ethnic Albanian guerrilla were killed on
Saturday night and three Serb policemen were wounded in a shootout
near the village of Konculj, when Albanians ambushed a police
patrol with automatic weapons and hand grenades.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third recent attack against the police in the area.
The Serbian police said a bomb damaged the courthouse in Bujanovac
on Friday night, in an attack they blamed on ``Albanian
terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   Western officials have accused Belgrade of trying to destabilize
Kosovo, while the Yugoslavs accuse KFOR of not stopping the
infiltration of armed Albanians from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Reinhardt said the Kosovo peacekeeping force was now operating
more intensely to check the province's northern border with Serbia
proper, above Mitrovica, to prevent the flow of arms and undercover
police or intelligence officers into Kosovo from Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Danish and Belgian battalions are checking vehicles more
vigorously, he said, and last week the peacekeepers began to use a
computer at a checkpoint to register who goes in and out. Although
Kosovo is formally part of Yugoslavia, KFOR says it has the right
to deny entrance to suspicious people or to deport them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally the military does not do such work,'' Reinhardt said.
``But there is no point in complaining. This is an area of big
concern for me, and I have sent officers with specialized training
to assist in this job, and I have sent my deputy to supervise, and
I'm feeling very comfortable'' about the security of northern
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The general said he had been getting most of the money and
personnel he needed for his military operation, but that the NATO
governments ``that decided to get us here'' were less supportive of
the U.N. civilian administration here.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, he said, the failure to send promised funding for
the civilian budget and to send promised international police
officers has meant that his troops must do a great deal more
policing than they want to do, or are trained or equipped to do.
With only 2,000 international police officers here, he said,
considerably fewer than 800 are on the streets on any given day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're missing 3,000 police officers,'' said the general, who
has initiated joint patrols by his troops with the police. ``But
there's no use complaining. It won't change the situation, so I
have to make the best out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The lack of international prosecutors and judges also annoys
him, and he acknowledged the reluctance of Albanian prosecutors and
judges to convict other Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, he said, two Serbs were killed and KFOR soldiers
immediately arrested suspects, having tracked them with dogs, and
found the weapons used. ``They turned these guys over to the police
and the prosecutor, and the prosecutor released them the same
day,'' he said. ``How can we enforce law and order if this takes
place?''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Reinhardt admitted with a degree of embarrassment that someone
in Mitrovica had stolen his personal revolver while Albanians were
cheering him last Monday, as he sought to defuse a large Albanian
demonstration. Normally the weapon is secured to his holster on a
cable, but the day before, the ring attaching the pistol and the
cable broke, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were touching me and pulling me and shaking my hands,
and it just went,'' he said. ``It happened. So what? For me the key
thing was to prevent the crowd from becoming violent, and when we
told them to go home, they went.''

NEWS ANALYSIS: REGRETS WELL PLACED, IF QUESTIONABLY TIMED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Calif., Ill., Dela.)  (With BUSH-BOBJONES) 
(js) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gov. George W. Bush touched all the right bases
Sunday in expressing regret to Cardinal John O'Connor of New York
over his journey to Bob Jones University: the cardinal is the de
facto leader of the Roman Catholic Church in the United States and
he is widely respected across religious lines.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was determined to muffle the outcry before crucial
primaries in New York, California, Illinois and other states with
large Catholic constituencies. And the Texas governor sent a signal
to voters _ and his contributors _ that he is not too high and
mighty to admit a blunder.
</P>
<P>
   But there was one big problem: Bush's turnabout may have come
about 24 days too late.
</P>
<P>
   For days, Bush has been castigated by Sen. John McCain, his
rival for the Republican presidential nomination, and many of his
own supporters for opening his South Carolina campaign at Bob Jones
on Feb. 2 without condemning the ultraconservative school's
well-known history of forbidding interracial dating and promoting
anti-Catholic teaching. Many party strategists said the controversy
only escalated _ and became even more knotty to overcome _ because
Bush spent days trying to justify his pilgrimage to the university
and did not move quickly to admit his mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's handling of the Bob Jones firestorm underscores one of
his campaign's biggest weaknesses: while Bush and his operatives
are adroit at moving offensively to promote their agenda, they
often seem to linger as controversies swell around them. Last
summer, for example, Bush dragged out a controversy over whether he
used drugs years ago by dancing around the question for days,
modifying his explanations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to prepare themselves to have much quicker rapid
response, which is, in effect, damage control,'' said William Dal
Col, the campaign manager for Steve Forbes, who quit the Republican
race this month. ``If he's the nominee, the Gore people will come
in with brass knuckles and billy clubs.'' Dal Col added that the
apology was ``the right thing to do, but it would have been better
had they done it immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   The episode also demonstrates the great degree to which the
McCain operation will go in stoking incidents that reflect poorly
on its opponent. McCain has emphasized that his will not be a
negative campaign. But he himself approved telephone calls to
Catholic voters in Michigan before that state's primary, alerting
them of Bush's visit to Bob Jones University.
</P>
<P>
   The caller said: ``Bob Jones has made strong anti-Catholic
statements, including calling the pope the Antichrist and the
Catholic church a satanic cult. John McCain, a pro-life senator,
has strongly criticized this anti-Catholic bigotry, while Governor
Bush has stayed silent, while gaining the support of Bob Jones
University.''
</P>
<P>
   When the telephone calls first surfaced, McCain insisted that
his campaign had nothing to do with them.
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, many of Bush's supporters said he should have
repudiated Bob Jones' policies in his speech, or moved forcefully
within a day or two to put out a letter like the one he sent to
O'Connor. Instead, as recently as Friday he still appeared
defensive _ and seemed to be trying out new explanations _ as he
struggled to move on to other subjects long after the victory in
the South Carolina primary on Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Once Bush's advisers decided they had to move on the Bob Jones
matter, they mulled over several alternatives, like having Bush
submit an explanation to a newspaper's editorial page. But they
settled on the letter to O'Connor, the leader of the archdiocese's
2.4 million Catholics in a state where roughly half the electorate
is Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   By specifically appealing to O'Connor, Bush was clearly trying
to mend relations with New York's Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't win the New York Republican primary without the
Catholic vote _ it can't be done,'' said Kieran Mahoney, a
strategist for Gov. George Pataki, who backs Bush. ``Time will tell
whether the statement will help. On balance, I think it will
because Bush has a fair amount of personal credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The question becomes how quickly Bush can extinguish the
firestorm. That depends in part on how Bush conducts himself. If he
sticks to his words of regret and does not backtrack _ and does not
appear frazzled by more questions about the appearance _ the matter
will blow over faster.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's reversal Sunday was particularly distasteful for him and
his advisers because, they note, many other Republicans (and
Democrats) have spoken at Bob Jones with barely a peep from their
opponents. The list includes Ronald Reagan, Bob Dole and Dan
Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   But to many Republicans, Bush's seeming embrace of the school's
policies was a disturbing contrast to his calls for ``compassionate
conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   The school's president, Bob Jones III, accused the press of
playing up the visit to damage Bush. ``The media hates George Bush
and has said the most unkind and untrue things about BJU in its
attempt to reflect on the governor,'' he said in a statement made
public before Sunday's development.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's advisers were stunned that the visit became such
a huge issue. ``The same people who are hollering about it now were
delighted that we did it at the time, and we won South Carolina by
11 points,'' said Warren Tompkins, Bush's top strategist in South
Carolina. ``We were all a bunch of geniuses on Feb. 19, and now
they're saying we'll all a bunch of idiots.''
</P>
<P>
   More than three weeks after he set foot on the red-carpeted dais
at Bob Jones, Bush is no doubt hoping that, finally, he can move
on. But the Democrats have other ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm offended as a Catholic, I'm offended as a supporter of
civil rights; I'm just flat out offended,'' said Sen. Joseph R.
Biden Jr., D-Del. ``It should haunt them. And it will haunt them.''

SUPER TUESDAY FORCES ADJUSTMENTS IN MEDIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ With limited resources and a staggering media
challenge _ getting their message out in the 17 states that are
holding primaries in the next nine days _ the four leading
Republicans and Democrats in the race for president are engaged in
a feverish hopscotch of the nation, targeting television markets in
certain states, bypassing others and relying on the ``free media''
supplied by the press to make their cases to a larger extent than
before.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer volume of races _ in states representing 110 million
Americans and 13 of the country's top 25 media markets, including
New York, Los Angeles, Boston, Atlanta, Baltimore and San Francisco
_ has meant a fundamental shift in the way the campaigns are
communicating with the voters.
</P>
<P>
   No longer able to mount a sustained media blitz in a small state
like New Hampshire or South Carolina with the national press corps
as an audience in residence, candidates are being forced to spread
their advertising money so thin that the campaign may not yet be
registering with voters in some of the big states that are holding
primaries on Super Tuesday, March 7.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, neither Gov. George W. Bush of Texas nor Sen. John
McCain of Arizona has begun advertising on television in such
significant and complex Super Tuesday states as Georgia and
Missouri, choosing instead to concentrate on the biggest
battlegrounds: New York, Ohio and California. And even there,
political strategists say, the amounts they have allocated so far
are not close to the fortunes that have to be spent to have much
impact.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Bush and McCain have laid out nearly $5 million apiece
for television in five crucial states from Jan. 11 to March 6:
Ohio, California, New York, Washington and Virginia. That McCain is
now matching Bush in television expenditures is an indication of
how far the senator has come; but neither campaign will disclose
how much more it might spend, or whether commercials will be
broadcast in appreciable volume in other Super Tuesday states.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia and Washington hold their primaries on Tuesday. So does
North Dakota, where Bush is unchallenged on the air with almost
$200,000 in commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that we've really ever campaigned in Maryland,''
said Howard Opinsky, a McCain campaign spokesman. The omission is
simply a function of too many Super Tuesday states and too little
time and resources, he said. Missouri was also unlikely to be a
focus this week, he said, adding: ``And that's my home state. My
parents are really distraught about that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about big states,'' Opinsky continued, ``but
look, we're now at the stage where it's more of a national
campaign, where voters are going to make up their minds not so much
on local issues but on a gut feeling on the candidates and where
they stand on national issues.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, the emphasis is a little different.
Former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, who has yet to win a
primary, is training much of his campaign's energies in Washington
state, where he is spending several days in hopes of securing his
first victory and some momentum, that elusive cachet that gets the
attention of voters and the press.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Berendt, the state's Democratic chairman and a supporter of
Vice President Al Gore, said that Bradley had spent $400,000 early
on television and radio here, and that Gore, playing catch-up, had
now spent about the same amount. (Both campaigns are running
commercials in New York and California but declined, for strategic
purposes, to provide other details.)
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, the mother lode of contests on Super Tuesday has
blunted the impact of a big war chest. ``In gross terms, the
amounts of cash on hand sound big, but you need to spread it across
so many media markets,'' said Nelson Warfield, a Republican
consultant who served as Bob Dole's press secretary in 1996.
Indeed, even in delegate-rich states like California, where much of
the advertising money is being spent, the widespread expectation is
that the influence of commercials is going to be more marginal than
in prior years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are going to be a lot of quick judgments made, based on
relatively little information that's generated within California,''
said Mark Baldassare, survey director for the Public Policy
Institute of California, based in San Francisco. ``We're going to
see these four candidates streaking across the state. A couple of
days of the Republicans, a couple of evenings with the Democrats
and that's it: Make up your mind.''
</P>
<P>
   At some level it is alchemy that determines what mix of
advertising and press coverage makes for a winning formula; this
year, too, under-the-radar appeals by direct mail, telephone and
special-interest radio commercials are playing major roles in some
states.
</P>
<P>
   Still, officials in both parties acknowledge that over the next
nine days the war for voters' hearts, particularly on the more
competitive Republican side, will be decided in arenas over which
they have little control: the free or ``earned'' media of local
newscasts, radio talk shows, newspaper columns, political Web sites
and Internet chat rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an earned media battle,'' said Joe Andrew, national
chairman of the Democratic National Committee. ``To buy a week on
television in Los Angeles alone would cost $800,000 to $900,000,
and they have to fight this on both coasts.'' Mark Miller,
executive director of the moderate Republican Leadership Council,
put it another way: ``For all those voters who said they were sick
of the 30-second commercials, they're about to get their wish.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In such a compressed race, with virtually no time to shape a
message or fashion a comeback if damage is done, the importance of
any event in which voters are able to compare the candidates _ like
the Republican and Democratic debates this week in Los Angeles _
could be greatly magnified. ``Given that voters aren't going to see
a string of debates,'' Baldassare said, ``the debates that do take
place may have just enormous consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Who benefits in this scenario is unclear. As Baldassare pointed
out, ``Mr. McCain's performance in debates has been, shall we say,
uneven.'' And in having to rely more extensively on free media,
Bush, meanwhile, is fully experiencing the downside of unscripted
encounters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I caught some of a live interview the other day with Bush on a
local talk-radio station in northern Virginia,'' said Warfield, the
Republican consultant. ``It was clear he wanted to talk about
drawing the liberal-conservative contrast with McCain. Instead, he
found himself answering questions about Bob Jones University. I can
guarantee you, if he were paying for that air time, he wouldn't be
talking about Bob Jones University.''
</P>
<P>
   Even earning the attention is difficult. Martin Kaplan,
associate dean of the Annenberg School of Communication at the
University of Southern California, said that Los Angeles television
stations, for instance, have little appetite for politics. ``Local
stations are superb at weather, sports and crime, but most don't
have political reporters anymore,'' he said. ``They do have
helicopters, so they can follow a motorcade as well as they do a
low-speed car chase.''
</P>
<P>
   To get as much free air time as they can, the campaigns are
using technology wherever possible to expand access. One strategy
is satellite interviews, remote conversations with news anchors in
prized markets. ``We've probably done 50 or 60 satellite interviews
in the March 7 primary states,'' said an aide in one of the
campaigns. ``We set up the satellite and do nine or 10 back to back
to back.''
</P>
<P>
   And of course, in some cases commercials still lead to coverage.
In Seattle, Gore got a lot of mileage out of a spot he began
running this past weekend, a sort of travelogue narrated by an
expert climber, Jim Frush, about scaling Mount Rainier in
Washington last summer with Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every single Washington state TV station played the entire ad
on their news at 6,'' Chris Lehane, a Gore campaign spokesman, said
triumphantly. ``And then the next morning they interviewed Frush.''

CLARKE DOMINATES WOODS TO WIN $1 MILLION MATCH-PLAY PRIZE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLSBAD, Calif. _ It was the kind of beating that Tiger Woods
has given to many others, but this time, he was on the receiving
end.
</P>
<P>
   As a decided underdog, playing a 36-hole match against the
world's No. 1 player, Darren Clarke believed the odds were against
him, but he also believed in his ability. From the first hole,
Clarke was in charge of his emotions, and he eventually took charge
of the match. With each drive that pierced the fairway, with each
iron shot that flirted with the flagstick, with every birdie putt
that fell, Clarke made another statement that he would not back
away.
</P>
<P>
   During the past year, some opponents have been intimidated by
Woods, and it has hampered their ability to beat him. But Clarke
was inspired, never allowing the situation to suffocate him and
earning a victory that may propel his career to another level.
</P>
<P>
   Winning the Andersen Consulting Match Play Championship, and the
$1 million first-place check, Clarke soundly defeated Woods, 4 and
3, in an eye-opening performance at La Costa Resort &AMP; Spa. Entering
the 64-player tournament as the No. 19 seed, Clarke won six matches
enroute to the title, knocking off Paul Azinger, Mark O'Meara,
Thomas Bjorn, Hal Sutton, David Duval and finally Woods.
</P>
<P>
   That is an impressive list of victims, but Sunday's victory was
Clarke's finest moment. With the match all square after 18 holes in
the morning, Clarke dominated the afternoon with a front-nine
assault from which Woods never recovered. Clarke birdied five of
the first eight afternoon holes to go 4 up, and his lead was never
less than 3 up thereafter. To Clarke, a two-time Ryder Cup player
and a consistent top-10 performer on the European Tour, this
victory confirmed that he can become one of the world's best.
</P>
<P>
   ``To play as solid as I did against Tiger, the best player in
the world, it's a great feeling,'' said Clarke, who rose to No. 14
in the world ranking with the victory. ``The 64 best players in the
world were here this week, and to come out No. 1 is great. I'm not
that old yet, I'm only 31. Hopefully, this will be a stepping stone
and I can improve.''
</P>
<P>
   It would have been difficult for Clarke to improve on this
victory. To beat Woods is difficult; to dominate him is rare. But
Woods only led for one hole of the match, and Clarke played
brilliantly, missing only one fairway all day, and missing just
three greens in regulation. There was no miraculous comeback for
Woods, because Clarke never allowed it and because Woods did not
play up to his standards. He missed fairways and greens, he missed
crucial putts, and for one of the few times during the past eight
months, he failed to rise in a spotlight moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Darren, to be honest, just flat outplayed me,'' said Woods,
who settled for the runner-up check of $500,000. ``He hit the ball
beautifully, he made a lot of putts. He played beautifully today.
And I just wasn't able to put a lot of pressure on him. I was just
trying to find my golf swing. I did a lot of it with smoke and
mirrors today, just trying to keep myself in the ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Clarke was relentless, making birdies on 12 of the 32
holes and never giving Woods an opening. Clarke took the lead for
good in the afternoon on No. 4, the 22nd hole of the match,
sticking an approach shot to five feet, while Woods missed the
green with his second shot, leaving himself a tough chip from thick
rough. Woods' chip shot ran 20 feet past the hole, then he missed
the putt coming back and conceded the hole to Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Though he did not know it, Woods would never get any closer.
Clarke took a 2 up lead on the next hole, hitting another
near-perfect approach shot to 8 feet, then making the putt for
birdie. On the par-3 No. 7, Clarke hit his tee shot to 10 feet,
then made a difficult downhill putt for another birdie. Woods could
have answered with an 8-foot birdie putt, but he missed it, and
that gave Clarke a 3-up lead. And on the next hole, Clarke made it
4 up by making another 8-footer for birdie, after Woods missed a
16-foot birdie attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Woods won the par-5 No. 9 with a birdie and closed to 3 down,
but he gave another hole away on No. 10 with a bogey when he missed
a four and a half foot putt. Then after Woods birdied the par-3 No.
11, hitting a beautiful tee shot to two feet, he dropped another
hole with a bogey at No. 12, hitting his second shot into a
green-side bunker, then hitting a poor bunker shot that stayed in
the bunker. Woods blasted his next shot four and a half feet past
the hole. Then he missed the putt for par, and Clarke played Woods
even the next three holes to close the match.
</P>
<P>
   In victory, Clarke managed to negate two of Woods' advantages _
his length and his stamina. Though Woods outdrove Clarke by at
least 30 yards on many holes, Clarke's terrific approach shots kept
Woods on the defensive. By Clarke hitting first from the fairway,
and getting close to the pin, Woods was forced to aim at the flag,
and because he was not accurate with his irons Sunday, Woods kept
making mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Tiger's length was to my benefit,'' Clarke said. ``It
gave me an opportunity to be hitting first into the greens, and as
soon as I got it close, that resulted in pressure on Tiger.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Clarke is battling a weight problem at around 245
pounds, at least 20 pounds overweight. But while Woods went to the
range between the morning and afternoon sessions, Clarke rested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to walk down the hill again,'' Clarke said,
smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke walked down some fairways smoking a cigar, but when he
stood over the ball, he was all business. According to his manager,
Chubby Chandler, Clarke's rotund build is deceiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not fit, but he's strong,'' Chandler said. ``He needs to
get more fit, but I think the adrenaline playing against Tiger
carried him through.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he would do with the money,'' Clarke smiled and said,
``Spend it.''
</P>
<P>
   He had a right to be happy. Clarke wasn't even aware that the
championship match was 36 holes until Saturday afternoon, but he
proved fit enough and good enough to beat the world's best. For
Clarke and Chandler, that was a victory worth celebrating.
</P>
<P>
   ``British Airways better watch out,'' Chandler said. ``They may
not have enough champagne.''

EARLY RESULTS IN SENEGAL INDICATE TIGHT RACE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   DAKAR, Senegal _ The results of this West African nation's
presidential election began trickling in Sunday night a few hours
after polling stations closed, showing a close race between the two
men most favored to lead Senegal for the next seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's election was considered a turning point in the history
of Senegal. For the first time, it was not clear what the outcome
would be, and voters were given a choice among four credible
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The race was too close to determine whether either of the top
two runners had garnered the 50 percent of the votes necessary to
win in the first round. Officials for President Abdou Diouf, who is
seeking his fourth consecutive term, said they believed that the
candidate could still muster the votes required to prevent a
run-off against Abdoulaye Wade, of the Democratic Party of Senegal.
</P>
<P>
   Early Sunday, after casting his vote in central Dakar, Diouf was
asked about his chances of winning in the first round. He
responded: ``Only God knows that.'' But Wade sounded a combative
note at his home late Sunday night, insisting that Diouf could win
in the first round only by rigging votes. ``I believe I should win
in the first round,'' Wade said.
</P>
<P>
   An independent National Observatory for Elections, which
supervised Sunday's election, said the voting had been generally
free and fair. About 2.7 million people in this country of 9
million had been registered to vote.
</P>
<P>
   International observers from Europe and Africa also monitored
Sunday's vote, and there were no reports so far of widespread
irregularities. In general, international observers have said that
elections in Senegal have improved over the years in transparency,
and the 1998 legislative election was considered free and fair by
all participants.
</P>
<P>
   There were only a few reports of the violence that had marred
the last days of the campaign. The one exception was the southern
region of Casamance, where a separatist movement has operated for
20 years and where shots and rockets were reportedly fired in one
town. On Friday, a Socialist Party official was killed by a mob in
Casamance.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Here in the capital _ where the opposition has traditionally had
greatest support and which Wade handily won _ calls for change were
heard often Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so tired of having the same government for 40 years,''
said Boubacar Diallo, 35, an artist voting in the neighborhood of
Diacksao. ``This government has been practicing ballot-box coups,''
he added, voicing a popular opinion that the ruling party had
rigged past elections.
</P>
<P>
   But the Socialist Party remained particularly strong outside
Dakar and the other cities, and it enjoyed the organizational
advantages of uninterrupted rule since independence from France in
1960.
</P>
<P>
   Seizing on the electorate's possible weariness after four
decades of the Socialist Party, the presidential candidates
emphasized the need for change, though none offered any detailed
vision how to accomplish that during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Even Diouf talked of change, as his French campaign and media
managers subtly tried to tap into the mood without sacrificing the
man. ``Together, let's change Senegal,'' read billboards showing
Diouf with two children.
</P>
<P>
   Senegal, which has never suffered the military coups or rule
that afflicted most of its neighbors, was one of the first African
nations to introduce multi-party politics in the 1970s under its
first president, Leopold Senghor, also a famous poet.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the presidency never shifted away from the
Socialist Party. Diouf, who had served for a decade under Senghor
as his prime minister, became president in 1981. Diouf found his
foil in Wade _ the archetypal opposition figure seen in many other
African nations, although enjoying genuine and wide support
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The two men fought in three previous elections for the
presidency, the last time in 1993. In recent years, the Socialist
Party was weakened by the defection of heavyweight members, who had
hoped to succeed Diouf one day but whose ambitions had apparently
been derailed. Two of them, Djibo Ka and Moustapha Niasse, were
candidates Sunday, although given little chance of victory.

IN WASHINGTON, BRADLEY STUMPS LIKE A WINNER
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Former Sen. Bill Bradley never seems to hit his
oratorical stride until about midafternoon, so it was shocking to
see him stroll into an ornate hotel lobby packed with supporters at
9:30 a.m. recently and bellow with unusual verve, ``Good morning,
Spokane!''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley then gave one of the punchiest, most compelling stump
speeches of his campaign. Afterward, the crowd enveloped him as he
pecked cheeks, signed autographs and grasped every hand until none
were left. Eileen Davis was so moved by the event that tears welled
in her eyes as she shook his hand. ``Thank you for your charisma,''
she said, using a word not often applied to the staid and stoic
insurgent.
</P>
<P>
   Though he trails badly in most polls, is surrounded by advisers
resigned to his defeat and is opposed at every turn by his own
party's establishment, Bradley is still managing to run a spirited
campaign in this state, where he has staked his underdog hopes on a
victory in Tuesday's nonbinding primary.
</P>
<P>
   With a lightness that had been notably missing in recent weeks,
Bradley has been working harder than ever at the small gestures of
winning votes: tossing jelly doughnuts to workers on a picket line
in Spokane, dishing chili to supporters in downtown Seattle,
patiently enduring hours of questions from undecided voters at
late-night town meetings. He has even called the reporters who
cover his Democratic rival, Vice President Al Gore, playfully
cajoling them to write about him.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, he has shown few signs that he feels defeated,
despite Gore's double-digit lead in most polls. At a moment when
other politicians might become frantic or sullen, Bradley has
remained quintessentially himself: calm, self-possessed, almost
aggressively unruffled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every candidate creates his own problems,'' said Sen. Bob
Kerrey, D-Neb., who stumped with Bradley here on Saturday. ``But
when it comes to all the problems beyond his control, he's
suffering them very well.''
</P>
<P>
   There certainly have been more than enough problems to get him
down, not the least of which has been the continuing ability of the
Republican maverick, Sen. John McCain, to grab attention from his
campaign. Yet Bradley has more often than not displayed the loose,
jokey informality that marked his style months ago, when things
seemed less dire.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, for instance, his staff instructed him to pose alone
for photographers on a pier overlooking Puget Sound and the
snow-capped Olympic Mountains. Pointing with mock solemnity at the
scene, he wryly declared, ``That's water.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, he joked with reporters: ``That would be considered a
manufactured moment.'' And when he was introduced to an
environmental activist dressed in a salmon suit, he told her,
``Keep on swimming.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Bradley has even donned clothes to express his
more unbuttoned mood, replacing his rumpled blue and gray suits
with green or brown V-neck sweaters, open-collar shirts and khaki
pants.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's energy level can fluctuate with the size and
enthusiasm of a crowd, and he has had some unexpectedly large ones
here. On Friday, more than 1,200 people packed into a ferry
terminal in Bellingham to hear him make the kind of upbeat speech
that typified his events last fall. He was animated and engaging
and the crowd responded, laughing at his well-worn jokes and
applauding raucously at just the right moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seems the most presidential, the most dignified of the
candidates,'' Kris Berger, 35, said after the speech.
</P>
<P>
   The following morning in Spokane, Bradley gave a stump speech
abundantly salted with the kinds of punchy applause lines that his
speeches have often lacked.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can we do, what must we do, to leave no one behind?'' he
asked a hushed room. ``The people of Spokane who are earning under
$14,000 a year work too hard, care too much, deserve more, and
we're going to get them more.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there have been lost moments. On Saturday, he was to give
a speech laying out the differences between his health care plan
and Gore's outside a Seattle health clinic. The address was as
sharp and clear as any Bradley has given on the subject. But in the
cold drizzle, only about 60 people came out, despite his staff's
last-minute efforts to round up people on the street. And a visibly
disappointed Bradley delivered his prepared text in a stiff
monotone.
</P>
<P>
   Later that night, Bradley gave a rendition of his standard
speech on race relations to the Seattle chapter of the NAACP that
failed to even mention his hosts. Even some of his supporters in
the half-filled banquet hall found his performance listless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I detected that maybe he was a bit tired,'' said Hubert Sims,
a 50-year-old banker who says he will vote for Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   But more often than not, Bradley seems energized by his hunt for
votes. At a town meeting at Everett Community College on Friday, he
was as patient as a town councilman answering dozens of questions
and more than a few complaints, including one from a student who
said federal budget cuts had worsened his urinary tract infections.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, he faced a more contentious crowd at Evergreen
College, known as a bastion of student radicalism, where he was
peppered with questions about trade policy, global warming,
American Indian rights and the price of a gallon of milk. (``About
$1.68,'' he answered.)
</P>
<P>
   The students booed when he said he opposed legalizing drugs and
hissed when he said he supported sanctions against Iraq. But he
took more questions than his staff wanted him to, and won the
respect of more than a few in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was really good,'' said Richard Myers, 20, a
junior. ``This is a difficult crowd to handle and he did a good
job.'' Still, Bradley did not quite close the deal with Myers, who
said he might vote for Ralph Nader on the Green Party line.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Though his days are packed with events, Bradley still tries to
maintain the sort of loping pace that he seems to find more
comfortable. Sunday morning, after giving a speech on race
relations before more than 500 parishioners at an African Methodist
Episcopal church in Seattle, Bradley remained in his pew to watch a
play about slavery, even though he was scheduled to be at another
event.
</P>
<P>
   When an usher came by to ask if he was ready to go, Bradley
simply signaled to her with his hand: wait.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who can lose his temper in private, has managed to keep
his cool in public despite the pressure-cooker atmosphere of the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In New York early last week, for instance, Bradley was cut off
during live interviews with television stations in Oregon and
California. Both times, the lost satellite feeds ruined the
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we lose by 1,000 votes in San Francisco,'' Bradley began to
say after the second lost feed. And an aide finished his sentence,
``I'll take the blame.''
</P>
<P>
   Calmly, without apparent anger or dismay, Bradley simply
replied, ``That won't help me.''

UMPIRES AND BASEBALL START THEIR NEGOTIATIONS TODAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Richie Phillips, the major league umpires' newly
deposed labor leader, formulated a mass resignation strategy last
July in an effort to induce baseball officials to begin early
negotiations for a new labor agreement. Seven months later, those
talks will begin, without Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   John Hirschbeck, a 17-year American League umpire, who was
elected Sunday to a three-year term as president of the World
Umpires Association, and Joe Brinkman, who was elected vice
president, will join the new union's lawyer, Joel Smith of
Baltimore, in meeting Monday with three officials of Major League
Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think baseball would like to get something done before
opening day and we'd like to get something done before opening
day,'' Hirschbeck said after the umpires' meeting. ``It would be
nice to start the season with a contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Representing Major League Baseball will be two executive vice
presidents, Rob Manfred, the top labor executive, and Sandy
Alderson, the baseball operations chief, and Ralph Nelson, an
Alderson assistant, who will oversee the umpiring staff. Baseball
wants to merge the separate league staffs into the commissioner's
office, and that will be a topic of negotiation. It is not expected
to be a difficult one.
</P>
<P>
   These will be the first talks for an umpires union that Phillips
will not lead. He had served as the head of the Major League
Umpires Association since 1978. But Phillips' union lost in an
election last November, and the National Labor Relations Board
certified the new union as the umpires' collective bargaining
representative on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The umpires, mostly from the American League, who joined
Hirschbeck and Brinkman in the move to oust Phillips and the old
union, wanted a less confrontational approach to negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The old contract expired on Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Hirschbeck said 48 of the 71 umpires have joined the new union.
The holdouts are National League umpires who continued to support
Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to be open to all umpires and we welcome them,''
Hirschbeck said. ``We'd like them to join us. We will all continue
to encourage them to join us.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not they join the new union, the umpires will be
represented by it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll go in and try to get the best contract we can for all of
the umpires,'' Hirschbeck said.
</P>
<P>
   The one-sided nature of the membership of the new union was
reflected in the election of officers Sunday. The 39 umpires who
attended elected Hirschbeck and Brinkman plus Tim Welke as
secretary-treasurer and six members of the board of directors _
Larry Young, Tim McClelland, Rocky Roe, Jeff Nelson, Bill Welke and
Fielding Culbreth. All but Nelson are A.L. umpires. &QL;

NETS' VAN HORN PUTS AGGRESSIVENESS INTO HIS GAME 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Midway through the fourth quarter
Saturday night, Charlotte Hornets forward Derrick Coleman found his
spot just outside the lane, set himself and turned for a routine
jump shot. But as he released the shot, the long arm of Keith Van
Horn suddenly rose in front of him, snapping the ball back over
Coleman's head.
</P>
<P>
   Before Coleman could wipe the surprised look off of his face,
Van Horn was making long strides down the other end of the floor,
catching a pass from Kerry Kittles and authoritatively slamming the
ball through the rim as players ducked underneath.
</P>
<P>
   The aggressive play might have surprised Coleman, as well as the
18,481 fans at the Continental Arena, who watched Van Horn help the
Nets to a 104-93 victory. But for Van Horn, it may have had its
roots in a darkened video room, with Nets assistant coach Jim Lynam
showing the third-year forward the subtle flaws in his game.
</P>
<P>
   The two watched the tape from the previous game against Miami
earlier this week, a game in which he shot just 7 of 20 from the
floor, and Lynam held his thumb and forefinger just a sliver apart,
telling Van Horn that the slight gap is all that was separating
makes and misses. The lesson was to attack, to finish plays with
aggressiveness.
</P>
<P>
   While it worked once, the Nets and Van Horn can only hope that
the lessons stick, particularly with the next test coming Monday
night in Utah. For the Nets, it represents the beginning of an
arduous five-game trip. For Van Horn, it is his first time back as
a professional to the state where he became a local hero as a
collegiate star.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes proved helpful Saturday. But the next test for Van
Horn will come against Karl Malone, as rugged a task as his
new-found aggressiveness can find.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just saw that I was getting to the basket easily,'' Van Horn
said. ``I need to, instead of trying to finesse so much, be more
aggressive in taking it to the basket, get fouled, take it at the
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Nets Coach Don Casey said: ``They made up a tape and I think
that helped, and also the fact that he caught the ball and made his
decision quickly. The defense didn't have time to hone in.''
</P>
<P>
   The soft-spoken Van Horn has absorbed some criticism this season
for his play, particularly at the end of games. But in the fourth
quarter against the Hornets, he scored 12 of his 29 points. He even
found himself being judged for his decision to remain home with his
wife in New Jersey two weeks ago following the birth of their
daughter rather than fly to Atlanta for that night's game.
</P>
<P>
   But, unlike Stephon Marbury, whose homecoming in Minnesota last
week was marked by ill will from the bitter crowd, this trip to
Utah will likely be a happy event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been looking forward to it,'' said Van Horn, who runs a
business in Utah that organizes basketball camps for children.
``It's a big basketball town. I still go there every summer, I have
a camp there, I'm still involved in the community to a certain
extent. My wife's family is from there and they all live there. A
lot of my folks' friends are there. I have my business there.''
</P>
<P>
   It helps that he and the Nets are hardly believed to pose a
threat to Malone and the Jazz. But if he plays with the
aggressiveness that he exhibited on Saturday, even family might be
booing him by the time he leaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a quality win, especially with some of the teams we
have coming up,'' Van Horn said of Saturday's victory. ``We have
San Antonio, Utah, a good, young Denver team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our last road trip was disastrous. We lost those
buzzer-beaters. We lost to the Clippers. So I think we need to
prove to ourselves we can go on the road for a lengthy period of
time and win. It's a big challenge for us and we need to step up to
the challenge.'' &QL;

KNOBLAUCH OPENS THE BASE PATHS FOR ALL THE YANKEES

<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ Chuck Knoblauch exuded a baserunning arrogance
when he played for the Minnesota Twins, striding purposefully off
first base, far away from the bag. His body language screamed to
pitchers and catchers that he was going to run, and that there was
not much anybody could do about it.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch muted that part of his game in his first two years
with the Yankees, but he worked the entire off-season to recover
his intimidating presence on the bases, and he intends to run often
this year. Manager Joe Torre wants all of the Yankees to be more
aggressive on the bases, something he has stressed in the first
workouts of spring training, and all of his players will have the
option of stealing bases any time they choose in the exhibition
games.
</P>
<P>
   Green lights for everybody: For Derek Jeter, who is still
developing the confidence to run; for Paul O'Neill, who can steal
10-15 bases a year by using his experience; for Bernie Williams,
whose exceptional speed has not translated into many stolen bases;
and for Ricky Ledee and Scott Brosius and Roberto Kelly, and anyone
else who sees an opportunity to place stress on the defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to let them run at will and do what they want,''
said Torre. ``I told them, `Go out there, let me see your
decisions.' I'd rather have to explain to them why that was a bad
decision than not finding out what their capabilities are. Once
they prove it to themselves that they can run, then they develop
their confidence, and it's contagious.''
</P>
<P>
   Evidently so. Torre stressed aggressiveness in spring training
in 1998 and the Yankees opened that season seemingly in full
sprint, a lineup of larcenists, swiping 40 bases in the first month
of the year; they constantly pushed for the extra base, charging
from first to third, from first to home. Late that year, as
defenses began to concentrate more on limiting their leads, the
Yankees stopped running, and tended to hold their ground and wait
for a big hit.
</P>
<P>
   And they never really regained the brazenness last year, when
they did not register their 40th stolen base until June 12, six
weeks later than in 1998. Jeter was banging hits all over the place
and Knoblauch tended to wait at first for those hits, and with
O'Neill struggling, Jeter often stayed at first base, his feeling
being that the first baseman would have to hold him and O'Neill
would have a bigger hole to hit through on the right side of the
infield.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly, Torre and third base coach Willie Randolph feel, the
Yankees just lost that aggressive attitude. They want that mindset
restored this year, ``and that starts at the top,'' Torre said _
with Knoblauch and Jeter.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch averaged 51 stolen bases in his last three years with
the Minnesota Twins, and in his first two years with the Yankees,
he averaged 40 stolen-base attempts. Knoblauch has not really
looked to run, and many times, he appeared more concerned with
making a mistake, taking tentative leads off first base.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to change this year. On those many warm days in New
York last November and December, Knoblauch went to Yankee Stadium
to work on his running, to strengthen his legs, and when the
weather turned cold, he did his form running in a spacious gym on
the West Side of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   In his first two years with the Yankees, Knoblauch arrived in
spring training with his chest and shoulders thick from weight
training, in excellent physical condition. Randolph noticed he
looks much different this year, toned from the running _ in better
condition to play baseball, to steal bases, to be aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to get back to running,'' Knoblauch said. ``Each
year that goes by, I'm a little more comfortable. My first two
years, I've felt like I've always gone from first to third well and
taken chances, and hopefully, I can get back to putting pressure
and stealing bases.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter stole 30 bases in 1998 and went into last year with an eye
on swiping 40, but he had just 27 attempts, and often, it was easy
to tell from his actions at first base whether he was serious about
running. Jeter picked his spots in '99, wanting to keep the
first-base hole open for O'Neill and Bernie Williams, the hitters
who followed him _ and the Yankees staff wants their runners to try
to be intelligent, rather than reckless, about when they run.
</P>
<P>
   But they do not want baserunners intent on holding their ground
for the benefit of the hitter behind them. If you want to help the
hitter behind you, Randolph said rhetorically, ``then get to second
base and let him drive you in from there.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill is 37 and does not possess great speed, but Randolph
says O'Neill breaks from a base and reaches his optimal speed as
quickly as any large-framed person he has seen. Williams might be
the fastest Yankee running first to third or first to home, but he
seems to lose milliseconds when leading off first base, at that
moment when the pitcher begins his motion homeward and Williams
needs to break for second. With speed like that of Jeter and
Williams, Randolph said, ``You don't have to have the perfect jump.
You just need to get a decent lead and break, and still beat it.''
</P>
<P>
   Like O'Neill, Ledee could steal 10 to 15 bases, but Randolph
thinks Ledee needs to make adjustments in the way he takes leads,
in the way his body is balanced at the time he needs to make his
break. Ledee, too, tends to raise the upper half of his body first
and then move forward _ imagine a sprinter doing this _ and this is
something that can rob him of quick first steps. Brosius is a smart
baserunner with decent speed, but Randolph is looking for him to
stay lower.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have lost some of their bench speed over the last
two years, with the trades of Homer Bush and Chad Curtis. Kelly, a
non-roster invitee expected to make the club, probably will help:
He has 235 steals in his career, with a high success rate of 74
percent on his attempts. The Yankees will look to steal third more
often, something that many teams have begun to try with more
regularity in the last few seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just going to try to get back that element to our game
and try to take advantage of it,'' Randolph said.

 By EDDIE SEFKO  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
CARLSBAD, Calif. _ What a change of pace this must have been for
Tiger Woods, what with the spike marks on the other backside for a
change.
<TEXT>
<P>
   So many times as an amateur and pro, the world's best player and
match-play devotee had kicked his opponent into submission with
cold-blooded disregard in this format.
</P>
<P>
   But in the final of the Andersen Consulting Match Play
Championship on Sunday, it was Woods' turn to get trampled.
Northern Ireland's Darren Clarke unleashed a torrid stretch of
birdies to draw away from Woods on the second 18 holes for a
4-and-3 victory and a $1 million paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   Just call it a rare victory for those who like to pump pints
instead of iron.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke's physique is such that you half-expected ABC to go to a
station break while his swing made the wide path around his gut.
But the portly fellow with the carefree attitude and wry sense of
humor stayed even with Woods during a hotly contested first 18
holes, then turned up the heat by shooting 5-under-par 31 on the
front nine of the afternoon round in the 36-hole finale at La Costa
Resort.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke might never enter the gym now that he has proved a person
of girth can get the best of somebody as chiseled as Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``To play against Tiger, the No. 1 player in the world, and come
out on top is a great feeling,'' said Clarke, who added the week's
worth of golf was the best he has ever performed on a daily basis
over an extended period.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke's win Sunday meant he had taken down Woods and David
Duval _ the world's No. 1 and No. 2 players _ on consecutive days.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if a win like this in a World Golf Championships event
would motivate him off the golf course as well as on it, Clarke
said: ``What are you trying to get at? That I have a fat gut? Is
that what you are trying to say?''
</P>
<P>
   Cracking a smile as he said it, Clarke didn't mind being the
butt of the joke, so to speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to start working on my weight,'' he said. ``I have to
get in better shape. I was very lax about it over the winter.''
</P>
<P>
   But the regimen didn't start immediately, said Chubby Chandler,
Clarke's manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``British Airways might not have enough champagne for him
tonight,'' Chandler said.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke was listed in British bookmaking as a 66-1 long shot
before the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Darren flat-out outplayed me,'' Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing else mattered. After the morning half of the finale
ended with the match even, Clarke birdied five of the first eight
holes in the afternoon and never looked back.
</P>
<P>
   Woods has a 12-4 individual match-play record as a professional,
in addition to his amateur success in this format.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wasn't able to put a lot of pressure on him,'' Woods
said. ``I only hit one good shot in the afternoon. I did it
(played) with a lot of smoke and mirrors just to keep myself in the
ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods said he thought he gave himself a chance to win the match
even though he didn't think he played well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really haven't played that bad for that long since Sunday at
Disney when I had a chance to win,'' Woods said. ``I shot 73 in the
last round and still won.''
</P>
<P>
   But in reality, he spent most of the afternoon on the ropes
before finally suffering the knockout blow. Even Woods' best might
not have been enough Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   If Woods was looking for a turning point, he could have picked
out two holes in the afternoon. First, on the 10th, Woods
three-putted from 35 feet, giving Clarke the hole with a par to go
4-up.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after winning the 11th hole, Woods was in the greenside
bunker on the par-5 12th with his second shot. But he took four
shots to get down and lost the hole, again to Clarke's par. Woods
left his first sand shot in the bunker, then couldn't get up and
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``On No. 10, I had the opportunity to put the approach close,
and to not put that shot inside of his and put some pressure on him
was frustrating,'' Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of winning the hole, Woods lost it, essentially putting
him in a must-win situation on every ensuing hole.
</P>
<P>
   Woods had shown a little gamesmanship during the first 18 holes.
On the 13th hole, Woods made Clarke putt an 18-incher for par and
to halve of the hole. Clarke tapped in, then smiled at Woods as if
to say, ``Did you really think I was going to miss that?''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was messing with me there,'' Clarke said. ``I asked him if
we were playing medal play. But he was all right.''
</P>
<P>
   On the next hole, Woods had a one-footer for par. Clarke
conceded the putt.
</P>
<P>
   On the first nine holes of the day, which started in light fog
in the cool morning air, Woods and Clarke combined for 10 birdies,
five pars and three bogeys. Still, nobody led by more than a hole,
and Woods led for only one hole in the entire match.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Clarke took charge when he rolled in a 15-foot birdie
putt on the par-3 seventh to go 3-up. His lead never was less than
that the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   He closed it out in grand fashion, making a beautiful
up-and-down from the bunker on the par-3 14th and a routine par on
the 15th to clinch it.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke missed only one fairway and two greens during the 33
holes Sunday and was 11 under par. He made only one bogey, on the
fifth hole in the morning 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've come over here (to the United States) quite a few times
and haven't fared that well,'' said Clarke, who won for the first
time on U.S. soil. ``I've had the potential these past few years.
But I've never actually finished the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think I was 11 under par for the whole play. To play as
well as that under the circumstances, and against the best player
in the world, certainly is very gratifying.'' &QL;

 GUARD'S DEVELOPMENT GIVES UT HOPES FOR A LONG
MARCH (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) By MIKE JONES
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Ironically for a shooting guard, Darren Kelly's
favorite memory of a game-winning shot is by someone else.
</P>
<P>
   Flash back to last season's NJCAA Division II national
championship game. Kelly's team _ Brown Mackie (Kan.) College _ is
down by a point in the waning seconds. Kelly takes a pass and
penetrates the Danville (Ill.) Area CC zone defense, which
immediately converges. Seeing no opening for a clear shot, Kelly
quickly whips a pass back out to teammate Jay Rhodes, who knocks
down a 3-point shot that decides the championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``They called it the assist of my life,'' said Kelly, who was
named the tournament's most valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of play-making ability is what Texas coach Rick Barnes
has been looking for most of the season from one of what has become
primarily a four-guard backcourt rotation _ someone other than
point guard Ivan Wagner.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes believes he found that individual on a recent afternoon
in Missouri, when he, in essence, put the ball in Kelly's hands
late in the second half. Kelly responded with 13 points in a
crucial 66-63 road victory. He has scored in double figures three
times in four games since and averaged 13 points a game, leading
Barnes to believe that he has found another reliable weapon as the
Longhorns begin to focus on tournament play.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order for us to be the team we need to be in March, Darren
is a major player,'' Barnes said. ``I knew we had to get some guy
on the perimeter to give us some good numbers and he was the guy we
felt could do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Darren can score in a lot of different ways. He's quick, he
has a good mid-range game, he can shoot from the perimeter and he's
learned to take the ball to the basket.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes in particular likes Kelly's acumen in crunch-time
situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not afraid to take big shots,'' Barnes said with
appreciation. ``The hotter the situation, the better he likes it.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Barnes has put so much faith in him in February
has given Kelly, who averaged almost 22 points a game last season,
added assurance to relax and play his game after what was a
difficult assimilation into Barnes' style of play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me feel good that coach Barnes has that type
confidence in me,'' Kelly said. ``He's been telling me all this
time that I had this potential, but I wasn't stepping up and doing
the things I needed to do. But now I'm getting more comfortable and
I've grown to have a lot more confidence in him. At first, I wasn't
buying into what he was saying.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider that Kelly, a product of inner-city Washington
basketball, has always been the offensive focus of his teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always played on a guard-oriented team,'' Kelly
explained. ``In junior college, I was The Guard. I created and
scored. But this team plays off Chris Mihm and Gabe Muoneke and
\Rearly\S I was trying to do things that weren't characteristic of
this team and I was hurting us, basically. Now, I cater to the
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shots I've been making are good shots for me and coach
Barnes has been telling me to get more open looks. What I've been
doing helps the big guys, and that's the main thing. I complement
what they do. Other teams have to respect \Rdefensively\S what I've
been doing.''
</P>
<P>
   So does Mihm, who has to depend on the Longhorns' guard play to
alleviate double and sometimes triple-team pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Darren has been stepping up big-time,'' Mihm said. ``He's
playing with so much more confidence and that has been fun to see.
Coach has put it on Darren because of the fact that he's so quick,
a driver and a slasher and that's what we need. Both he and Will
\RClay\S have done a great job penetrating, whether it's shooting
the mid-range jump shot or getting to the basket. If we get those
kinds of good shots _ soft shots on the rim _ we'll clean up \Rwith
put-backs\S on those.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes continues to call Wagner the team's most valuable player.
Clay has proved to be the backcourt's defensive stopper as Kelly
has added needed offensive punch. Lawrence Williams hasn't been
able to establish any consistency after missing early playing time
because of a groin pull, but is capable of knocking down long-range
shots when he's on.
</P>
<P>
   The sum total is that as March approaches, Barnes feels much
better about his backcourt than he did a season ago, when Wagner
was playing too many minutes on a bad knee and the team simply ran
out of gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a totally different team,'' Barnes said. ``I have
confidence in our guards and it's no secret that when they're
playing well, we play our best basketball. Now, we're not so
one-dimensional. A year ago, we were.''

 RANGERS REJECT TRADE OFFERS FOR
CATALANOTTO (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) BY T.R.
SULLIVAN c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ Exhibition games haven't begun yet, but
trade talks are starting up. The Rangers have had three National
League teams call with interest in infielder Frank Catalanotto.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just said no,'' Rangers general manager Doug Melvin said.
``I told them we like his bat, he gives us a little bit of depth.''
</P>
<P>
   Catalanotto, a left-handed hitter, is a career .276 hitter with
34 doubles, 17 homers and 63 runs batted in in 525 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers need Catalanotto because they're not sure how many
games Luis Alicea will be able to play at second base. Alicea
played in a career-high 132 games in 1995, and that has steadily
decreased since. Last year he was bothered by a pulled hamstring
muscle and injured wrist that required surgery after the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers are also going to take a long look at Edwin Diaz at
second base. Diaz was once a former top Rangers prospect who was
lost to the Arizona Diamondbacks in the 1997 expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin and manager Johnny Oates said Diaz is the best defensive
second baseman in camp, and he increased his value as a utility
player last year by playing 44 games at shortstop for the
Diamondbacks' Triple-A team in Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   He also hit .311 for Tucson but walked only 17 times and struck
out 77 in 415 at-bats. Melvin said that is holding Diaz back.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll drive the ball and get some hits, but his plate
discipline is not too good,'' Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   But Melvin said Diaz has a chance to make the team, ``If he can
show us he can play shortstop on a part-time basis.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be an advantage. Catalanotto's best defensive
position is first base. He's considered adequate defensively at
second and third, but he's not considered a shortstop. Greer's
agent due Outfielder Rusty Greer's agent, Bo McKinnis, is due in
Port Charlotte today and is expected to meet with Doug Melvin.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have expressed an interest in signing Greer to a
long-term extension beyond 2001, but any talks right now are
preliminary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're going to chat, but that's about it,'' Greer
said.
Cannon arm Johnny Oates said center fielder Ruben Mateo may have
the best throwing arm in baseball. But there is a problem when
throwing to home plate.
</P>
<P>
   The pitcher's mound.
</P>
<P>
   Outfielders try to make their throws to the plate on one bounce.
Oates said if Mateo's throw to home plate bounces too close to the
catcher, it's going rocket right past him.
</P>
<P>
   But if he hits the pitcher's mound's the ball's going to bounce
high in the air and over the catcher's head.
</P>
<P>
   ``He throws it that hard,'' Oates said. ``I'm afraid if Pudge
\RRodriguez\S has to jump for the ball, that runner is going to
look at Pudge's ribcage and say, `I've got a chance to take Pudge
Rodriguez out of the game.' I want Pudge down low.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ruben's got to know how to harness that arm.''
Briefly
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Rafael Palmeiro was given permission to miss
yesterday's workout to attend to a personal matter in Miami. He's
expected back today.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Mike Venafro, sidelined with a strained ligament in his
left middle finger, is expected to throw off a mound today for the
first time in camp.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have two more days of pitchers throwing batting
practice before the first intrasquad game Wednesday. / nn

 SMU SEARCHING FOR TOURNAMENT BID (For use by NYTimes
News Service clients) By JOHNNY PAUL c.2000 Fort Worth
Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Opinions vary regarding a potential NCAA Tournament
berth for SMU's men's basketball program.
</P>
<P>
   This one comes from TCU coach Billy Tubbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any question about it,'' said Tubbs,
whose Horned Frogs dealt the Mustangs one of their five losses this
season. ``I would almost think they're a lock regardless of what
they do from here on out. I really believe SMU should be in.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, SMU's fate likely depends on what it accomplishes this week
at Moody Coliseum and during the Western Athletic Conference
Tournament, scheduled for March 9-11 in Fresno, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, deserving and reality, as he knows, too, are two
different things,'' Mustangs coach Mike Dement said. ``I think
we've got to find 2-4 more wins. I think we're going to have to do
that. I'd like to think were deserving, but we've got more work to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   It will not be an easy chore for the Mustangs (21-5), who will
put their five-game winning streak on the line against the Horned
Frogs (15-13, 6-6) tonight at Moody Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   SMU can share the WAC regular-season title if it beats TCU and
Tulsa (26-3, 11-2) in its regular-season finale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing our two toughest opponents,'' Dement said. ``I
think these two teams have given us the most problems
matchup-wise.''
</P>
<P>
   TCU beat SMU, 92-75, on Jan. 29 in Fort Worth, and the Mustangs
lost at Tulsa five days later, 70-59.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to play so much differently than we did
before,'' Dement said. ``I'm hoping and wondering if we can do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   SMU also will be forced to overcome a nine-day layoff since its
83-81 victory at UT-El Paso, and Dement admits being ``worried
about being rusty.''
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA selection committee will not concern itself with SMU's
layoff, not with so many programs on the bubble to reach the
tournament's 64-team field.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only about 6-8 spots, and there are about 25
schools,'' Dement said. ``Many of them are in the power
conferences. I think the committee will be looking for reasons to
start knocking people out to get it down to one or two because
there are so many.''
</P>
<P>
   The WAC lost its automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament after
eight of its members departed and formed the Mountain West
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   So, SMU and a slew of others _ Arizona State, Brigham Young,
Notre Dame, Louisville, DePaul, Wake Forest, Pepperdine, Gonzaga,
Utah State and Fresno State among others _ remain in search of the
NCAA Tournament's 35 at-large berths.
</P>
<P>
   SMU is ranked 38th in one version of the power ratings, and
Fresno State (19-9, 9-3) could be the Mustangs' chief obstacle
should the WAC receive only two NCAA berths. The Bulldogs were
ranked 39th in the same power ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've had a really good year because we've taken some
steps like beating Fresno State,'' Dement said. ``We've gotten to
20 wins, and we've never done that since I've been here. I think
we've had a good year, but what we need is a special year.''
</P>
<P>
   What happens this week likely will determine that.

 RANGERS SEEKING IMPROVED GLOVE WORK (For use by
NYTimes News Service clients) By T.R. SULLIVAN c.2000 Fort Worth
Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ The Rangers made a strong push to improve
their pitching in the off-season. The moves could prove to be in
vain if they don't play better defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' defense, a point of pride with manager Johnny
Oates, has fallen off the past three years after leading the
American League in fielding in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   They've finished ninth in fielding the past three years, a
disappointing statistic for a team that is trying to emphasize
pitching and defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something I've talked to Johnny about where we have to
be better at,'' general manager Doug Melvin said. ``We have to play
better defense to make the pitching better.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates' goal every year is to have his team commit less than 100
errors, and the Rangers set a club record with 87 errors in 1996.
But they've averaged 120 errors per season since, including 119
last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``In '96, I don't think we had any careless errors,'' Oates
said. ``We focused on catching the ball and throwing the ball.
There's no doubt in my mind we had at least 25 careless errors last
season. We need to get back to focusing on catching the ball and
throwing it and taking pride in defense.''
</P>
<P>
   With all the personnel changes in the off-season, Oates and
Melvin believe there are some reasons why the Rangers could be
better defensively this season. It's starts on the left side of the
infield, where Royce Clayton and Todd Zeile combined to commit 50
errors, the most by a shortstop-third base combination in the
league.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton, normally a strong defensive shortstop, was bothered by
an injured right shoulder for most of the first half of the season.
He needed three weeks on the disabled list in May and didn't reach
full strength until after the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it affected him a little bit,'' infield coach Bucky
Dent said. ``He was a lot better and played great in the second
half.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers also insist they'll be better at third base despite
the risk of bringing in Mike Lamb from Double A to replace an
11-year veteran.
</P>
<P>
   Zeile, a converted catcher, made a number of spectacular plays
last year but also committed many of his errors on routine
grounders. The Rangers are counting on Lamb to change that, even
though he committed 28 errors in 137 games with the Tulsa Drillers
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never saw him before last year, but he was outstanding the
first half,'' Drillers manager Bobby Jones said. ``He made just
eight errors. Second half, he started making a couple of errors and
started to dwell on it. A lot of them were throwing errors where he
got lazy, bounced his throw over first base, and the first baseman
couldn't come up with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sat him down, told him, `You're going to make errors, but
don't worry about it. Just go out and make the plays, and if it
happens, it happens.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The defense on the other side of the infield could depend on how
many games Luis Alicea plays. Alicea has good hands, average range
and can turn the double play. But he's 34, and his durability is
questionable; his number of games has decreased each year since
playing a career-high 132 games in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Catalanotto is Alicea's backup, a player with decent hands
but limited range. The Rangers are taking a hard look at Edwin
Diaz, the best defensive second baseman in camp, as a utility
player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alicea is pretty good,'' Oates said. `I don't think we give up
anything there losing \RMark\S McLemore, except going back for
pop-ups into right field. I'm just not sure how many games Alicea
can play and stay strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Outfield throwing is another area where the Rangers think they
can be better. Rangers outfielders combined for 21 assists last
year, the lowest of any team in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Gabe Kapler, who has an above-average arm, could make a
difference in right field by getting to more balls quicker than
Juan Gonzalez. But there's little doubt about Ruben Mateo.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Goodwin, last year's starter, was the latest in a long line
of Rangers center fielders who had weak throwing arms. Oates said
Mateo might have the best arm in the American League.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ruben could do the same thing in center field that Pudge
\RRodriguez\S did behind the plate,'' Oates said. ``He should be
able to shut down the other team going from first to third and make
runners think twice about scoring from second base.''
</P>
<P>
   Mateo probably doesn't have Goodwin's speed and range yet, but
the Rangers could compensate for that by having Kapler in right
field instead of Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fielding is the one thing you can work hard at and improve,''
Melvin said. ``A guy either has bat speed or he doesn't. He either
has a strong throwing arm or he doesn't. But, with hands, you can
work hard at becoming a better fielder.''
</P>
<P>
   The general manager expects that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defensively,'' Melvin said. ``We're going to have to catch the
ball better than we have in the past.''

DODGERS HAVE EYE ON COOK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. -- The Dodgers' search for a left-handed
reliever may be 25 desolate miles down Interstate 95.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are paying close attention to what develops at a
lefty-rich &UR;  &LR; Mets camp and have a special eye on one-time Dodger
Dennis Cook. The two teams have spoken about a possible trade,
baseball sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Cook told reporters at the Mets camp in Port St. Lucie he
expects to be &UR;  &LR; traded before spring training ends. He has $4.55
million remaining on the three-year contract he signed last season
with the Mets, and became expendable when general manager Steve
Phillips signed free agents Rich Rodriguez and veteran Jesse Orosco
to cheaper contracts during the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   John Franco, who has veto rights in trades, is expected to be
the Mets' &UR;  &LR; set-up man.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips is said to be still trying to identify Cook's value on
the trade market, but the Mets are looking for young starting
pitching. The Dodgers have that in Mike Judd and Jamie Arnold.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, last week's injury to Dodgers lefty Onan Masaoka has
club officials a bit concerned. It's the one area the club lacks
depth in. Masaoka's expected to miss another week with a sprained
left ankle and there are only three other unproven lefty relievers
in camp. The Dodgers seek that veteran lefty, and are prepared to
deal for it.
</P>
<P>
   Cook fits that role and is thought of highly by Dodgers
officials. He was 10-5 with a 3.86 ERA last, but had a 6.23 ERA
after the all-star break. Left-handers hit .211 (15 for 71) against
him.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers made overtures to acquire Orosco last season when he
was pitching with Baltimore, but sources said a deal was never
close. Again, the club is interested in Orosco, but since he just
signed as a free agent he can't be traded until June 15, unless he
agrees to it.
</P>
<P>
   Charting Checo: One of the running gags of spring is the
``Robinson Checo Watch,'' the only camp invitee yet to arrive.
Checo's visa problems are supposed to be straightened out today and
he could be in camp later this week. Of course, figuring out what
to do with him is another issue. Manager Davey Johnson isn't
fretting over the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``He might be in town, for all I know,'' Johnson joked. ``I'm
not in charge of the travel. I don't know where he is. I thought he
would be here....Last year he was right in the mix. This year I
don't know where he is; if he's in the mix, or where he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was mostly joking about Checo's status, but it brings to
light a more serious issue on the matter. Checo was the principle
player the Dodgers received in a salary-dumping trade that sent
Dave Mlicki and Mel Rojas to Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Once in Motown, Mlicki parlayed a 14-12 mark with a 4.60 ERA
into a multi-year contract. Rojas was released, but the Dodgers
still paid $4 million of his salary.
</P>
<P>
   Checo went 2-2 with a 10.34 ERA with the Dodgers and was last
seen crawling off the Astrodome mound after he walked five batters
and allowed four runs in one-third of an inning in last year's
season finale. Meanwhile, right-hander Apostle Garcia went 7-5 with
a 3.36 ERA at Double-A San Antonio and left- hander Rick Roberts
was 2-7 with a 6.58 ERA at Class A Vero Beach and Yakima.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a game: The Dodgers will hold their first intrasquad
game today. The notables sched uled to pitch are Chan Ho Park,
Darren Dreifort, Carlos Perez and Jamie Arnold.

FARRAKHAN ENDS LONGTIME RIVALRY WITH ORTHODOX MUSLIMS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DIRK JOHNSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Declaring an end to more than two decades of bitter
rivalry, Minister Louis Farrakhan of the Nation of Islam embraced
W. Deen Mohammad, the son of the late Elijah Mohammad, on Sunday
and said the two men ``will be together until death takes us
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Farrakhan, speaking to a group of about 20,000 people at the
group's annual Savior's Day rally, said that his Nation of Islam
and the nation's orthodox Muslims were uniting ``to work together
for the causes of Islam.''
</P>
<P>
   Farrakhan, 66, had been locked in a leadership struggle with the
family of Elijah Mohammad, the onetime leader of black Muslims who
died in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   W. Deen Mohammad, who leads more than 2 million black orthodox
members of the Muslim American Society, said he wished to convey a
``message of peace and love and undying friendship to Louis
Farrakhan,'' adding that ``Muslims are one community.''
</P>
<P>
   As Mohammad rose, the crowd chanted, ``Long live Mohammad, long
live Mohammad.''
</P>
<P>
   Farrakhan, who has been battling prostate cancer, struck a tone
that was much more moderate than some of his earlier speeches, in
which he has harshly attacked Jews and others he has seen as
enemies of his teachings.
</P>
<P>
   Alluding to ``rumors that Farrakhan got sick _ he's changed,''
the leader of the Nation of Islam said, ``has Farrakhan changed?
Yeah, I have.''
</P>
<P>
   Saying he was quoting the Bible, Farrakhan said, ``A fool
changes not, but a wise man will change often.''
</P>
<P>
   But he told his followers, ``I haven't abandoned you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You as a people should never doubt me after my years of
service,'' he said, adding that ``some of you are so anxious to put
down your brother on the basis of what you read in the newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Farrakhan said that the U.S. government has sent
spies among the Nation of Islam to sow discord. The government, he
said, ``has been recruiting young college students and filling them
with vicious lies about me and the Nation and sending them in to
infiltrate us.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of what he called a ``near-death experience'' last year
from cancer, Farrakhan said that ``no man undergoes a trial and
comes out the same.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that his life had been saved by Allah, who wanted him to
pursue the unity with orthodox Muslims, setting off roars of
approval from the crowd, where men were largely dressed in the
trademark bow-ties of the movement, and women wore white habits and
veils.
</P>
<P>
   While Farrakhan did not single out Israel for criticism, a
Hasidic rabbi addressed the crowd and denounced Zionism.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Dovid Weiss told Farrakhan's followers, ``Please know the
difference between Judaism and Zionism _ they are diametrically
opposed.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``We Jews feel for you, we relate to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Mohammad, who received a standing ovation from the crowd at the
United Center, said that the unification was ``truly a sign that
God has always been with the sincere ones _ those who kept the
faith.''
</P>
<P>
   In a Friday gathering that was also part of the Savior's Day
commemoration, Farrakhan called the reunification of orthodox
Muslims and his renegade group ``the last frontier.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that Elijah Mohammad would have been joyous about the
end of the rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty-five years later, I know that your father wanted
this,'' Farrakhan said on Friday. ``I know it in my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nation of Islam has recently begun to embrace orthodox
traditions, including observance of Friday prayers and the Muslim
holiday Ramadan, a period of fasting.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony Sunday was started with a traditional Muslim prayer
from the Koran, which was a departure from Farrakhan's earlier
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Farrakhan also spoke of the need for stronger families, and
urged people to take part later this year in a ``Million Family
March'' on Washington.
</P>
<P>
   He said blacks must break the bonds of self-hatred imposed by
``the robber of our father,'' referring to slavery and
discrimination by whites in America.
</P>
<P>
   He credited Elijah Mohammad for ``starting us on the road we are
now walking on,'' and said that ``words would never ever say how
much I personally thank his family and the early pioneers of Islam
in this country.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Conceived as a way of giving the 5,000 black soldiers and
sailors who fought in the Revolutionary War their rightful place in
American history after centuries of neglect, a memorial to honor
them remains unbuilt.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years, four presidents and four missed deadlines later,
the charity created to erect the memorial is $7 million short of
the $8 million it needs by October to avoid losing its choice site
in Washington between the Lincoln Memorial and the Washington
Monument.
</P>
<P>
   After years of missed opportunities and failed strategies, the
Black Revolutionary War Patriots Foundation has been unable to
capture the public's attention. Despite the early backing of
General Motors, which remains a supporter, the foundation seems to
have lost the interest of other major supporters like Philip
Morris.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation's last major gift, $50,000 from Ghana, was
announced a year ago. Its leaders have proved overly optimistic
about their ability to raise money, all of which must come from
private sources. The minting of a commemorative coin two years ago,
for example, raised only a fifth of the projected $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation's board and its president, Wayne F. Smith, say
they remain committed to building the 90-foot-long curving bronze
bas-relief that would honor the black patriots, many of whom were
slaves. ``I'm absolutely convinced that this memorial will
happen,'' Smith said. ``It's when, not if.''
</P>
<P>
   Building a monument in the nation's capital can take 10 years
from start to finish. Congress must authorize the memorial, whose
location and design must also pass muster with various planning
agencies. Some memorials with strong political support receive
money from the federal government, but many, like the memorial for
black patriots, must be financed with money from other sources to
cover the costs, including maintenance fees. All the money for the
memorial must be raised before work can start.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve other memorials are awaiting completion in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Smith says he is disappointed by the foundation's lack of
progress and frustrated by his inability to persuade more people to
give. ``This is a kind of lonely business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the foundation's experience also underscores how a charity
can seriously underestimate what it takes to generate support. ``We
haven't done well with well-intentioned and well-meaning people
struggling away,'' conceded James Granum, a foundation director.
</P>
<P>
   While no memorial project has ever been denied more time,
Congress is expected to hold hearings next month on whether it
should further amend the 1986 Commemorative Works Act to require
projects to meet several conditions before being given extensions,
said John G. Parsons, a National Park Service official who serves
on the National Capital Planning Commission. ``If there isn't
public support,'' Parsons said, speaking generally, ``let's move
on.''
</P>
<P>
   The foundation's board plans to meet on Tuesday to discuss
strategy. Yet the foundation has been slow to grasp some
opportunities. It planned no major events to coincide this year
with Black History Month in February, Smith said, and there are no
major fund-raising events expected in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The results speak for themselves,'' said Maurice Barboza, one
of the charity's founders, who was ousted in 1992 as president
because the foundation said it was unhappy with his performance.
</P>
<P>
   While defending his record since becoming president in 1996,
Smith acknowledged that he and the board must ``fish or cut bait.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A compelling case can be made for a memorial to honor black
patriots, who were long ignored in history books. While some blacks
sought their freedom by joining the British, others fought
alongside white soldiers. Crispus Attucks, for example, who was
depicted on the special coin issued two years ago, was an escaped
slave who was the first patriot to die in the Boston Massacre, in
1770, before the war.
</P>
<P>
   Austin Dabney, a slave from Georgia, was given his freedom for
fighting in his master's place. The Georgia Legislature awarded him
112 acres for his bravery.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an extraordinary history that completes American
history,'' said Barboza, himself a Son of the American Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Although the foundation was distracted for some time by its
differences with Barboza, the cause finally appeared to gain some
momentum in 1996 when General Motors gave $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   But the foundation's announcement in late 1996 that it had
raised $3.7 million since its inception proved overly optimistic
because the foundation had included such unfulfilled promises as
the one from Mayor Willie Brown of San Francisco to raise $1
million. A spokesman for the mayor said Brown would be happy to
continue working with the foundation to raise money.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation raised $1.5 million over the next three years,
bringing its total to $3.6 million, not including about $500,000 in
pledges. It has spent all but roughly $1 million of the money,
including about $800,000 on the actual development of the memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, many of the foundation's early supporters have
drifted away, and the foundation has had little luck replacing
them. Philip Morris, which gave $50,000 in 1992, has moved on to
other causes. DuPont pledged $50,000 the same year but said it has
not followed the progress of the project.
</P>
<P>
   Some supporters of the memorial say the foundation has failed to
get its message across. ``It's really been a problem of not
communicating terribly effectively about the memorial,'' said Karen
Hastie Williams, a Washington lawyer who was involved in the
project early on but is not now.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to reinvigorate its efforts, the foundation has shaken up
its board, adding new directors, including some black clergy, who
the foundation hopes can help raise another $1 million from their
congregations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have faith if we work hard enough and redouble our efforts
to get the right kind of people involved, we can raise this money
overnight,'' said Robert J. Brown, a co-chairman of the board.
``We're not talking a lot of money.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Chris Childs dutifully followed Allen Iverson around
screens for most of the day, trying everything to disarm pro
basketball's most potent offensive weapon. Lock and trail, coaches
call this _ a strategy aimed more at containment than prevention,
aimed at letting the All-Star gets his points with minimal damage.
</P>
<P>
   But, with less than 17 seconds left Sunday afternoon, defending
Iverson that way suddenly made no sense to Childs. The Knicks and
their point guard had worked so hard to reclaim the lead, erasing a
10-point deficit in the final 15 minutes to take a 1-point lead.
Madison Square Garden was percolating with noise. Lock and trail?
The Philadelphia 76ers had locked them up for most of four
quarters, and the Knicks had trailed nearly the entire game.
</P>
<P>
   Too safe, too conservative.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had just called that same type of play and I got picked
off by my own guy,'' Childs said of the 76ers setting a screen for
Iverson. ``Instead of following the guy around the screen the last
time, I just stayed with him and decided to shoot the gap. I didn't
want to foul him, but I also didn't want him to beat us.''
</P>
<P>
   Clogging the passing lane, denying Iverson with outstretched
arms and nimble feet, Childs refused to let the National Basketball
Association's leading scorer touch the ball on the final possession
_ a stingy and disruptive defensive play that illustrated how the
Knicks came back and won, thrillingly, 89-88.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of Iverson, the point guard Eric Snow dribbled into the
forest. Triple-teamed, his bank shot was too hard. Tyrone Hill
tried to tip the miss in, but the Sixers forward mistimed his jump
and barely got his left hand on the ball.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Latrell Sprewell had cradled a long rebound and
dribbled the clock away, the Knicks (34-20) emerged with their
second straight double-digit comeback and were headed to Miami for
Monday night's game only a half-game behind the Heat in the
Atlantic Division standings.
</P>
<P>
   Life at the Garden was very good, though you would not have
known it through the first three quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had us down most of the game,'' said an effusive Patrick
Ewing, whose 18 points and 10 rebounds led his team and countered
Iverson's 26 points.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing was economical, taking only 14 shots, tying the game with
1 minute 15 seconds remaining on a strong inside layup and
unselfishly giving the ball up to Childs on the Knicks' final
possession. At 88-88, Childs passed to Ewing on the left side about
18 feet away from the basket. Childs cut along the baseline, a
routine play that usually begins with Ewing faking a pass to a
guard before keeping it himself and trying to break his defender
down.
</P>
<P>
   Childs suddenly found himself free from Iverson and with the
ball in his hands. He was fouled by Iverson with 16.9 seconds left,
he made the first of two free throws to give the Knicks the
eventual winning margin _ and their first lead since 8-7 in the
first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was open,'' Ewing said. ``He was wide open.'' He smiled
before adding, ``Should I have shot it?''
</P>
<P>
   On a day when Latrell Sprewell and Allan Houston had trouble
finding their rhythms offensively _ they shot a combined 9 of 24
from the field _ the Knicks received great complimentary
performances from Larry Johnson, Kurt Thomas and John Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   It was Johnson (13 points) who tied the game with 46.8 seconds
left, tipping in a missed putback by Ewing. He knocked down
consecutive 3-pointers in the third quarter as the Knicks fought
back from a 12-point deficit. Wallace kept the Knicks in the game
in the first half, scoring 13 of his 15 points on a brilliant array
of dunks and jumpers. And Thomas (10 points, 7 rebounds) was his
usual ornery self on defense, using his left forearm as effectively
as Houston uses his right wrist.
</P>
<P>
   Trying desperately to match Philadelphia's intensity, the Knicks
finally found a way in the final minutes. They limited the 76ers to
one field goal in the final 4:22.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson needed 26 shots to get his 26 points. As awesome as he
was at times, he had nowhere to go in the final seconds and was
frustrated enough afterward to abstain from interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Since they traded for Toni Kukoc, the 76ers appeared to shed
that middle-of-the-pack label. They look potent and diverse enough
to give the Knicks, Miami and Indiana trouble in late spring. But
their lack of a true offensive threat to support Iverson was
revealed. If that was not apparent, Kukoc's lax defense stood out.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Larry Brown kept pulling Kukoc out of the game. Kukoc was
burned repeatedly, but no worse than when Wallace shook him along
the left baseline in the first half. In what will surely go down as
a Knick highlight, Wallace dribbled the ball between his legs with
his back to the basket; he then spun around Kukoc along the
baseline and leaped high in the air, dunking and drawing a foul for
an eventual 3-point play _ a sequence shown several times on the
overhead scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was wild,'' Ewing said admiringly of the young forward's
move. ``That was a great move.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing also called Sunday's victory ``a great game,'' a kind of
post-All-Star gauge for a team with much hope and perhaps as much
possibility, the difference between a team who wants to contend for
the Eastern Conference title and another who has been there, done
that and now wants more. &QL;

   BEIRUT, Lebanon _ No man has made himself more Israel's enemy in
recent years than Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, the portly, bespectacled
Shiite Muslim cleric who leads Hezbollah, the Lebanon-based,
Iran-backed Party of God that has evolved into a formidable
guerrilla movement and political party from the umbrella
organization that once directed the Middle East's most brutal
Islamic terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Two of Nasrallah's predecessors were assassinated by Israel, the
last one by helicopter gunships that blasted his motorcade with
rockets. So when the militant Islamic leader showed up this month
to mark the eighth anniversary of that attack in Nabi Chit, a
shabby hamlet in the Bekaa region, he was taking a mortal risk.
</P>
<P>
   The rally _ venue and time previously announced _ was barely 10
minutes' flying time from bases in the nine-mile deep ``security
zone'' that Israel has maintained since 1985 in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah, which has dispensed and suffered sudden death on a
numbing scale for 18 years, has more to celebrate these days than
what it hails as the martyrdom of its leaders. Unless events cause
a change of plan, Prime Minister Ehud Barak's commitment to
withdraw Israel's 1,000-man contingent from southern Lebanon by
July 7 has opened the way for Hezbollah to declare itself the lone
Arab force ever to ``defeat'' Israeli forces.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing has been simple in Lebanese politics since the
country began to deconstruct in the mid-1970s, and Hezbollah's
moment of triumph could also be a prelude to a painful transition
for the Islamic group. Many Lebanese predict that the Israeli
withdrawal could remake the political landscape here in ways that
will undermine Hezbollah, since it would strip the group of what,
until now, has been its political trump card.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, it is less the hint of change than the scent of
victory that has lured Nasrallah out of his secretive routines to
events like the one at Nabi Chit, which he reached in a battered
BMW with darkened windows while steely-eyed gunmen rode decoy
behind him in three Range Rovers.
</P>
<P>
   Nasrallah, 40, a vegetable vendor's son who was Hezbollah's
field commander in the south before becoming the group's leader in
1992, is making the most of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   With two bodyguards pressed tightly to his side on the podium at
Nabi Chit, and other armed men patrolling the hall, the
bushy-bearded cleric punched the air, pushed out his chest, and
repeatedly tipped back his black turban as he proclaimed Israel's
``total humiliation and disgrace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I send this message to both the Zionists and the Americans:
You are fighting God in southern Lebanon, and those who fight God
are doomed to defeat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Israel, many concede that Hezbollah has won a classic
guerrilla victory _ by not losing, by outlasting the enemy, by
inflicting losses that erode support at home _ rather than by a
triumph of arms.
</P>
<P>
   In one of many similar articles in Israeli newspapers, Yoel
Marcus, a columnist for Haaretz, a newspaper long opposed to the
occupation of southern Lebanon, compared the promised pullout to
the United States' defeat in Vietnam. He concluded, ``This is one
war that we have lost.''
</P>
<P>
   The kind of Hezbollah action that has worn down Israeli
resistance is on display at an exhibition the group opened last
week in Beirut. Day after day, young Lebanese have clustered around
a television set playing a videotape that shows Hezbollah fighters
in camouflage fatigues and helmets storming Israeli posts on rocky
hillsides in southern Lebanon, or detonating roadside bombs as
Israeli military convoys wind their way along mountain roads.
</P>
<P>
   Attacks like those have killed hundreds of Israeli soldiers
since Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1978, including seven in the
last month alone.
</P>
<P>
   What happens now will involve a complex political matrix, in
which Hezbollah's activities will be profoundly influenced by more
powerful players, including Iran and Syria, its two principal
backers, and the Lebanese government, as well as the terms of any
peace deals Israel can work out with Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The peace talks between Israel and Syria, suspended now but
likely to resume, will revive Israeli demands that Syria use the
power it wields in Lebanon, where it has 35,000 troops, to
guarantee that the power vacuum Israel leaves behind is filled not
by Hezbollah, but by Lebanon's 65,000-man army. The Lebanese
government, which wants its own peace with Israel, would then,
presumably, inhibit Hezbollah attacks into Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, senior Lebanese political and military officials
concede that Hezbollah's stepped-up military offensive against
Israeli forces in recent weeks _ attacks that prompted the Israeli
bombing raids that destroyed three Lebanese power plants on Feb. 8
_ were almost certainly encouraged by Syria.
</P>
<P>
   By this reckoning, Syria may have calculated that putting
pressure on Israeli forces in Lebanon would help wrest concessions
that Israel has so far refused in talks. By the same token, these
Lebanese officials say, Syria, once it achieves its own peace with
Israel, will not want to see it disturbed by continued fighting
across the Israel-Lebanon border.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah could thus could end up isolated, its 1,500 guerrilla
fighters too weak to maintain dominance in areas of southern
Lebanon and the western Bekaa region it now controls, and in effect
consigned to the diminished role of a political party competing in
Lebanon's sectarian politics.
</P>
<P>
   Considering that Shiite Muslims are the largest group in
Lebanon's population of 3.5 million Muslims and Christians, and
that Hezbollah is now indisputably the strongest Shiite political
force, the situation poses pressing questions. Will Hezbollah
continue the more moderate politics it adopted in the 1990s? And
will its professed conversion to democracy only cover the old
passions for a militant Islamic state in Lebanon?
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, there are major questions for the entire region,
since lasting Middle East peace may ultimately depend on whether
militant groups like Hezbollah and its Palestinian counterpart,
Hamas, abandon their historic goals of extinguishing Israel and
accept that it has a permanent place on the Middle East map.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the answers to these questions lie in Iran, the source
of Hezbollah's brand of Shiite fundamentalism, and of an estimated
$2 billion in support since the early 1980s, and in Syria, the
conduit through which the arms supplied by Iran have flowed.
</P>
<P>
   The recent parliamentary elections in Iran, which strengthened
reformers there, seem likely to diminish Iranian support for
Hebzbollah in the long run.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s Hezbollah rejected the very idea of an independent
Lebanon, as of an independent Israel, calling for the submersion of
both in a greater Islamic state. With the emergence of more
moderate policies in Iran, Hezbollah underwent what scholars here
call a ``Lebanonization'' and shifted toward the mainstream. It now
controls the largest single bloc in the 128-seat Parliament, with
seven seats of its own and influence over perhaps 50 others.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Hezbollah has established a substantial
presence in Lebanese life. Apart from two radio stations, a popular
television station and several newspapers, it has a far-reaching
network of hospitals, clinics, pharmacies, schools and martial arts
centers, as well as welfare and rehabilitation centers for those
injured by war and for their families, and pensions for relatives
of dead fighters.
</P>
<P>
   A Lebanese scholar who has written extensively on Hezbollah,
Nizar Hamzeh, says that under Nasrallah, ``the party has
concentrated more on the ballot box than on bullets,'' although
U.N. records continue to show a pattern of about 1,500 attacks a
year on Israeli troops. Still, Hamzeh says, the jury is out on what
Hezbollah's ultimate aims may be.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ultimate goal is still to capture the Lebanese state,'' he
said in an interview in his office at the American University of
Beirut, whose American president, Malcolm Kerr, was assassinated in
1984 by gunmen who were widely assumed to be linked to Hezbollah.
``But the question is, what kind of Lebanese state? There may be
those within Hezbollah whose attitude is `If we can't succeed in
creating an Islamic state from without, let's do it from within.'''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, no clear answers are available to those who
visit Hezbollah's center of strength in the crowded southern
suburbs of Beirut, in the Bekaa region along Syria's border and
amid the olive, orange and lemon groves of southern Lebanon where
fighters mount their attacks on the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Every question about Hezbollah's longer-range goals, including
whether it will seek to carry the war against Israel across the
border after Israeli troops leave, is met with polite evasions.
</P>
<P>
   Nasrallah lost his oldest son, Hadi, an 18-year-old Hezbollah
commando, in a skirmish with the Israelis in 1997, and stroked his
son's face in his coffin at the funeral 10 months later, when
Israeli forces returned the body. But the Hezbollah leader shows
little passion or bitterness when asked about the movement's future
attitude to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the Pakistani Islamic scholar Eqbal Ahmad,
in June 1998, he said Hezbollah could not be more Palestinian than
Yasser Arafat. ``If their leaders compromise, there is little we
can do,'' he said in the interview, which was published in Dawn, a
newspaper in Karachi, Pakistan. ``We cannot substitute for their
leadership. If they decide to resist, we shall be on their side.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Hezbollah seems to have achieved a genuine popularity,
beyond working-class Shiites, who are its traditional constituency.
Its 20,000 active members now include many middle-class
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the reconstructed high-rises of west Beirut, risen from the
rubble of the 16-year civil war, drivers of expensive sedans wait
at ``friendly checkpoints'' set up by young Hezbollah activists in
yellow smocks, breezily tossing banknotes into plastic buckets in
return for candies.
</P>
<P>
   The donations help cover a sharp cutback in financing for
Hezbollah by Iran, which began urging the group to moderate its
policies when Iran began easing its Islamic policies in the early
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Once Israel withdraws from Lebanon, however, Hezbollah's support
may shrink back more to its core: working-class Shiites. Sunni
Muslims, Christians and other religious groups and the middle class
seem grateful to Hezbollah for its part in driving Israeli troops
out, but convinced that peace would be better managed by other
hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, we support Hezbollah for driving out the Israelis _
they have been brave and we owe them much,'' said Antranik
Helvadjian, a bookstore manager of Armenian descent. ``But
Hezbollah to govern Lebanon? Absolutely not.''
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah has made a big push to remold its message, and some
Lebanese take comfort from Hezbollah officials' effort to expunge
elements of the group's past, including terrorism. In its offices,
officials' faces tighten, and Western reporters find visits and
interviews being canceled at short notice, when they merely mention
the word.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hezbollah had nothing to do with any terrorist acts,'' Hussein
al-Khalil, Hezbollah's security chief in the 1980s and now chairman
of its politburo, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   That stretches credulity. According to Western intelligence
reports and other evidence, the 1983 bombings of the U.S. and
French embassies and marine compounds, the 1985 TWA hijacking and
about 50 kidnappings were carried out by Islamic splinter groups
that operated under pseudonyms, but always under Hezbollah's
control.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983 alone, at least 400 people were killed in Hezbollah
terror attacks in Beirut, including more than 250 Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Hezbollah officials seem uneasy when discussing the
group's links to Iran. Its offices are a gallery of portraits of
Iranian religious leaders, and Hezbollah's leaders, clerics and
nonclerics alike, adopt Iran's Islamic dress codes.
</P>
<P>
   But Khalil, Hezbollah's politburo chief, insisted that this did
not translate into Iranian control. ``We are Lebanese 100
percent,'' he said. ``We have good relations with Iran, and we take
spiritual guidance from Iran's religious leaders, but our decisions
are taken by Hezbollah, not by Iran.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Lebanese scholars agree, noting more political and
financial independence and support that may even enable it to
resist orders from Syria.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a real evolution within the movement, because
they have come to the conclusion that the Islamic revolution _ and
the revolutionary mentality _ cannot survive for long,'' said
Farouk Nassar, a Lebanese journalist who is now an editor with The
Middle East Reporter, a widely read political bulletin. ``They know
that they have to adjust, or they're doomed.''

MARATHON FIELD BIG BUT NOT FAST
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Marathon, which has long sought to
strike a balance between its block-party atmosphere and a desire
for intense competition, returns to the streets Sunday, seemingly
more popular than ever.
</P>
<P>
   The marathon, now in its 15th year, is expected to topple last
year's record of 20,630 participants, even though a minuscule
percentage of runners have a realistic chance of breaking the tape
and taking home the first-place prize money.
</P>
<P>
   The overall quality of the men's field seems to be down from
last year, based solely on the top times of the elite runners who
have registered thus far. Only three runners have ever broken two
hours, 10 minutes in a competitive marathon, a time that is
considered good but far from great among elite runners.
</P>
<P>
   One of the three sub-2:10 runners is Simon Bor, no doubt the
sentimental favorite of race president Dr. William Burke. Last
year, when Burke was desperate for somebody to break the
11-year-old course record of 2:10:19, Bor ran 2:09.:25, and the
31-year-old Kenyan returns to defend his title.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Simon tells me that he is ready to run a faster time this
year,'' Burke said.
</P>
<P>
   If Bor stumbles, nearly a dozen of his countrymen will be ready
to take up the challenge. As usual, Kenya dominates the list of
male elite runners. This year's race is being used as the Olympic
trial for Guatemala, but a victory by anyone besides a Kenyan would
be considered a major upset.
</P>
<P>
   Four American men are seeded in the top 25 but none higher than
No.18 Daniel Gonzalez, a 31-year-old resident of Mountain View
whose main goal is to beat 2:19 and qualify for the U.S. Olympic
Trials. Gonzalez's top marathon time is 2:13:19, but that was 14
years ago in the California International Marathon.
</P>
<P>
   Bor's top challengers appear to be Peter Ndirangu and Elijah
Korir.
</P>
<P>
   Ndirangu and Bor share a personal-best time of 2:08.46, which
Ndirangu accomplished with a third-place finish in the 1997 Chicago
Marathon. Ndirangu, a member of the Kenyan Armed Forces, has never
run in Los Angeles but won his most recent race, the Kenyan Armed
Forces 30K last month.
</P>
<P>
   Korir, who will turn 34 on March 13, is the oldest among elite
runners but seems to be in his prime. He set his personal best of
2:09:43 with a victory in France's Lyon Marathon last October.
</P>
<P>
   The women's race might feature an almost entirely new set of
faces. Among elites already registered, only Aurica Buia of Romania
(fourth place) returns from last year's top 10 finishers.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Salumae of Estonia, whose personal best of 2:27:04 would
place her second on the marathon's all-time list and beat last
year's winning women's time by more than three minutes, has been
installed as the top seed. Salumae, 32, trains in San Diego and
earned her personal best with a victory in the 1997 Turin Marathon
in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The first-place awards of $35,000 and a 2000 Honda Accord will
await the winners of the elite races, but the vast majority of
runners will simply hope for mild weather and the strength to
accomplish their goal of finishing the race.
</P>
<P>
   The ``common man'' will have plenty of help along the way. The
26.2-mile course, unchanged from last year, will be lined by
hundreds of thousands of spectators and there will be various
community and ethnic celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   The Marathon will also feature events for the noncompetitive
athlete. The Acura Bike Tour, which drew more than 15,000
participants last year, starts and finishes near the Coliseum, and
the Motrin 5K starts and finishes near the Convention Center and
Staples Center.

SPORTS COLUMN: 76ERS TAKING THEIR TIME TO MEND 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Before Sunday's game with the Knicks, Pat Croce, the
76ers' energetic 45-year-old president, conceded that this game at
Madison Square Garden was a litmus test for his team.
</P>
<P>
   True, it was only February and the season will not end until
mid-April. But this was a test.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the Knicks,'' Croce with typical gushing enthusiasm.
``They're the measuring stick; for us they've been the big barrier
_ especially here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks had beaten the 76ers in their last six meetings at
the Garden; the last two by 85-70 and 91-72.
</P>
<P>
   But Croce was sure this game would be different. While the
Knicks had decided to stand pat on the trade front, the 76ers had
made a blockbuster three-player trade, landing Tony Kukoc, the
final pillar from the Bulls' championship dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very excited, we finally have someone who can complement
Allen,'' Croce said referring to the star point guard Allen
Iverson. ``He brings so much to this team, to this city. People are
starting to talk about the 76ers again.''
</P>
<P>
   Were the 76ers now equipped to beat the Knicks?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Croce said, smiling at his own audacity. ``I'm a
positive person. I felt we could have won without Tony, but now I'm
very excited.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks have to be wary of a guy like Croce, an optimist who
really believes. Here's a man who is still recovering from a
serious motorcycle crash last June that shattered his leg in 10
places. In November Croce learned that the bones were finally
beginning to heal.
</P>
<P>
   He believes in healing.
</P>
<P>
   He mended fences with Andrew Toney, a former star guard who
became alienated from the previous owners; another former star,
Maurice Cheeks, is on the bench as an assistant coach; a third,
World B. Free, is in the front office. Iverson, Croce said, ``Will
be here as long as I'm here.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For three quarters Sunday the test went well for Philadelphia.
The 76ers opened up a 10-point lead. Iverson was going well,
Forward George Lynch was going well. Even centers Tyrone Hill and
Theo Ratliff were going well. The 76ers' jumping switching trapping
defense had the Knicks off balance.
</P>
<P>
   Kukoc was not a factor. He threw one or two nice passes but was
an immediate defensive liability. He replaced Lynch with 2 minutes
45 seconds left in the first quarter, the 76ers up by 10. He
immediately fouled Ewing while coming over to help. He gave up to
jumper to John Wallace, then a riveting spin dunk by Wallace. On
offense he missed a couple crucial shots as the Knicks started to
close in.
</P>
<P>
   The 76ers had the lead for three quarters. Then the Knicks, like
the cagey distance runner who saves the monster kick for the end,
made their move. Ewing hit a hook; Larry Johnson tipped in a missed
shot and Chris Childs _ the invisible factor _ got the game-winning
points on two foul shots.
</P>
<P>
   On Philadelphia's final possession, the veteran Knicks clamped
down on Iverson with Childs. The defense forced guard Eric Snow to
take the final shot _a shot he did not want to take. Kukoc, the
would-be difference, was on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   A week after being shut down by the Lakers Kobe Bryant, Iverson
had another ``bolt game'' _ a day when he didn't feel like talking.
A day drenched in disappointment. So he bolted.
</P>
<P>
   Croce spoke instead. He shook his head and tried to put a
positive spin on the loss, but this one hurt. He cursed under his
breath. Pounded his fist in his hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had this game, we should have won this game,'' he said. ``I
can't believe we lost this game. We were right there. We had the
lead all game.''
</P>
<P>
   He shrugged his shoulders and smiled. He's an optimist. if
Philadelphia had won he would have said the game was a harbinger of
things to come. In defeat, he said this was only one game, with
lots more to play _ including a rematch with the Knicks in
Philadelphia on March 10.
</P>
<P>
   A subdued Kukoc only talked about becoming more aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to get myself involved more,'' he said. ``I've been
trying to stay out of the way. I have to start looking more for my
shots.''
</P>
<P>
   As a team, Kukoc said, ``We have to find a way to get better
down the stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks are a good team, a championship team until proven
otherwise. They pull games out of the fire. They run a smart race. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lynch, the 76ers' veteran forward, attempted to put the day in
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a playoff-like test for us,'' he said. ``We wanted to
be a lot more competitive than we had been here when we'd lose by
10 or 20 points and be out of the game in the third quarter. We
played well, we didn't get blown out and if we played at home we
may have won by 10 points. But the Knicks have been together a long
time. They hit their free throws, they make clutch plays. We didn't
make the great shot when we needed it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a litmus test for Philadelphia; another game for the
Knicks. In a basketball sense the Knicks are at a near perfect
time: they have a perfect balance of age, of experience of depth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to get there,'' Croce said.
</P>
<P>
   He could not hide his disappointment Sunday, but Philadelphia's
time is on the horizon and the Knicks know it; they know it about
Toronto and they know it about Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The 76ers, much like the bones in Croce's shattered left leg,
are beginning to mend. Time. These things take time. &QL;

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Passengers who fly economy class may soon find the back of the
plane a little more comfortable _ if they can find seats.
</P>
<P>
   In the first widespread change in the passenger cabin since the
creation of business class two decades ago, several large airlines
are now overhauling their coach sections.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to increase profits, but different carriers are
trying far different routes to that end. British Airways and United
Airlines are dividing their coach cabins into two classes _ premium
and economy _ and charging passengers more if they want the extra
legroom of premium. American Airlines, meanwhile, is removing two
rows of seats in coach cabins to give all passengers three more
inches of sprawl space at no extra charge. Only one other carrier,
Virgin Atlantic, offers gradations within coach, having introduced
them several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Some passengers are decidedly enthusiastic. ``This extra room in
coach will make a big difference for me,'' said Harry Dodge, a
retired owner of an oil well services company, who is 6 foot 4
inches tall. ``I have taken some transcontinental flights and
developed some painful cramps in my legs. I swore that I would
never fly again.''
</P>
<P>
   But passengers paying rock-bottom fares _ whether keeping the
same legroom, on British Air and United, or getting slightly more,
on American _ will have fewer seats available to them. This will
often lead to more crowded coach sections _ and more competition
for coveted overhead luggage space.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines are betting that in a booming economy, enough
passengers will be willing to pay more for extra legroom _ 3 to 7
inches, depending on the airline. By creating premium economy
service _ separate from existing business class _ the carriers can
accommodate more business travelers, who buy only 20 percent of all
airline tickets yet account for half the industry's profits. At the
same time, the airlines can rely less on budget passengers, whose
fares are sometimes so low that the carriers lose money on them.
</P>
<P>
   How much more will travelers pay? That could vary widely. On a
United flight from New York to Chicago, for example, an Economy
Plus ticket sells for $1,094 (compared with $1,602 for first
class), while the cheapest economy seat is priced at $324. On
American from New York to Chicago, the lowest fare is $209. But
with fewer coach seats available, that fare is likely to sell out
faster, forcing economy passengers to pay at least 20 percent more
for the next available discount fare.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways said it has yet to finalize the fare structure
for its premium economy cabin, to be called World Traveler Plus.
Some seats will cost 20 percent more than the full-coach fare,
although discounts will be available.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, the changes will merely sort out some of the
disparities that are already widespread among coach passengers,
where a business traveler paying, say, $1,000 for a flight might be
seated next to a vacationer paying $200. Often, airlines will give
higher-paying ticket holders more elbow room, but there is no
guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   The new strategy is risky. If the economy turns sour and
travelers cut back, the carriers will have to slash fares to tempt
them back on board. The airlines making the changes will have fewer
coach seats to sell to generate volume.
</P>
<P>
   ``American's move is a big win for consumers,'' said Samuel
Buttrick, an airline analyst at PaineWebber. ``But it's not a way
to increase profitability. What's good for consumers is not always
good for the airline industry.''
</P>
<P>
   But the changes could work against some travelers. They could
prevent ``backpackers,'' as airlines derisively call bargain
hunters, from finding as many low-cost fares. And budget travelers
may soon find less room for their carry-on luggage, since some
airlines are increasing the baggage weight limit for higher-paying
passengers and that might lead to allowances for bulkier bags.
</P>
<P>
   The move to give coach passengers more legroom _ especially by
American _ has also ignited a nasty spat among the world's largest
carriers. Gordon M. Bethune, chairman and chief executive of
Continental Airlines, said he was looking at the changes at United
and American, but apparently not very seriously. In a recent
interview, he dismissed both carriers' moves as ``fads.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe at Continental in giving people what they will pay
for,'' Bethune said. ``And at the end of the day, many passengers
want to pay the cheapest airfare. There's more to a good product
than a few inches of extra legroom. That's a dumb approach by a
bunch of mediocre airlines.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, United takes exception. ``Every airline is
different,'' said Matthew Triaca, a United spokesman. ``During the
past few years, we have captured a large share of the business
traveler market. They have told us that they want a product that
rewards them when they pay a full fare.''
</P>
<P>
   Not every airline is tinkering with its coach cabin. Delta Air
Lines has said it is ``evaluating various options'' regarding its
economy seats. But many industry consultants said they were unsure
if the trend toward offering more legroom in coach would sweep the
business.
</P>
<P>
   Despite often hostile complaints about cramped seating, some
travelers are not overly concerned. A recent internal Delta survey
of its passengers suggested that most choose their carriers based
on flight schedule, price and frequent flier miles. Few Delta
passengers have asked for more legroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seat size and the quality of meals are way down the list,''
said David S. Stempler, president of the Air Travelers Association,
a Washington-based group for passengers. ``A lack of privacy is an
issue with some passengers. The extra space may help alleviate
that. But some passengers will always go for the cheap fares.''
</P>
<P>
   Airline executives expect the roomier cabin space _ notably from
United, British Air and Virgin Atlantic _ to attract many frequent
travelers. But the biggest market for the seats is among business
travelers, who often pay a lofty full-coach fare and wind up
sitting next to the restrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``This class of cabin has worked well for us,'' said Richard
Branson, Virgin's chairman. ``Why should someone pay full-coach
fare and get the same exact service as someone who paid $99 for a
ticket? There's no other industry where that happens.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Presser, a New York investment banker, recently sat in
United's Economy Plus cabin on a flight from New York to St. Louis
and immediately became a fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``A week earlier, I had paid full-coach fare on a trip to
Chicago, and I had to sit near the back of the plane,'' he said.
``I hated it. But the Economy Plus was surprisingly good. I had
enough room to pull down the tray table and work comfortably on my
computer.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Carriers create extra space in premium economy by removing one
row of seats and then redistributing the space.
</P>
<P>
   American will remove two rows, each taking up 37 inches seatback
to seatback. That is enough for at least three extra inches in each
of the 21 rows of, say, a typical Boeing 737. The $70 million plan
to increase the distance between seats gives economy passengers
more legroom than they have had on any domestic carrier in 20
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``By having a better product throughout coach, we think that we
will be the first call that discount travelers make,'' said Mike
Gunn, American's executive vice president for marketing and
planning. ``We also expect to attract more business travelers who
are willing to pay a higher-yielding fare.''
</P>
<P>
   Passengers may have to wait several months, though, before
landing a coach seat with more legroom. American plans to convert
half its planes _ including those serving the New York area _ by
June, and the rest by year-end. British Airways will begin premium
economy service between New York and London in August before
expanding it to all its planes within the next 18 months. United
said premium economy should be available on all domestic flights by
mid-March.
</P>
<P>
   When American's refurbishing is complete, it will have 6.4
percent fewer economy seats. United is removing coach seats on all
its domestic fleet, including 5 percent of the economy seats on its
737s. Low fares from, say, New York to London's Heathrow Airport
may also become more difficult to get.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting a cheap seat is kind of a pastime among people who
like to travel,'' said Martha Fay, a free-lance writer in New York
who frequently flies coach. ``Not getting a low fare will make a
difference. If I can't go to California for $250 but have to pay
$400 instead, then I may not take my daughter. Or I may just not
go.''
</P>
<P>
   Bethune, of Continental, concurred with the strategy of trying
to reduce the number of low-fare passengers. He noted that such
travelers tend to file more lost-luggage complaints than
first-class travelers, who can carry on more and whose checked
luggage is often treated more carefully. When an airline has
already lost money on the fare, the last thing it wants is to lose
money on the baggage, too.
</P>
<P>
   Since carriers are fiercely competitive _ moving almost
immediately to match fares and in-flight services _ some airline
executives are concerned they may be forced to realign their coach
seats if more carriers do so.
</P>
<P>
   That possibility riles several industry executives, who are
worried about frequent fliers and employees, who are allowed to fly
free when seats are available.
</P>
<P>
   One high-level executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
noted that about 80 percent of frequent fliers on major carriers
fail to get their first-choice flights when trying to redeem miles.
What are the chances of that percentage increasing, the executive
said, if the major carriers have fewer coach seats?
</P>
<P>
   A roomier coach cabin may also be troublesome to airline
employees, who have become accustomed to free air travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to think about your employees' morale,'' Bethune
said. ``Those are your employees' seats that you're taking away.
And if you don't have good employee morale in the airline business,
you don't have anything.''

PROSECUTION IN DIALLO CASE NOW FINDS ITSELF ACCUSED
</HEADLINE>
  (With NY-DIALLO-REACT)

 By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lawrence Teele, a school custodian, said while
walking home in Harlem on Saturday that the prosecution lawyers had
lacked passion and conviction. Barbara Ford, a Bronx woman
attending a rally up the street at the National Action Network, the
Rev. Al Sharpton's headquarters, said they had not prosecuted the
case ``as fully as it could have been.'' Francis Kallon, protesting
near the United Nations on Sunday, said he was angry that they had
not cross-examined the defendants more aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   Struggling to explain the seemingly inexplicable _ how four
armed police officers could shoot and kill an innocent unarmed man
and walk away scot-free _ many of those outraged by the verdict in
the Amadou Diallo trial have arrived at one answer: that the Bronx
district attorney, Robert T. Johnson, botched the case.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's office, and some others who followed the trial
closely, vigorously dispute that, and even many critics praised the
summation by Eric Warner, the lead prosecutor. But after 12 Albany
jurors found that the prosecution had not proved any of six counts
against each officer, and after a juror pointed obliquely to the
prosecution's presentation of the case by way of explanation,
Johnson suddenly found himself excoriated this weekend in the
streets, at churches, and on talk radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should Bronx DA Be Brought to Task in Diallo Trial?'' the
front page of the newspaper Afro Times shouted this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did not represent his community or his people,'' Frankie
Lipsett, 39, a building superintendent who lives in the Bronx
neighborhood where Diallo was shot, said of Johnson, who is black.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism, including calls for Johnson's resignation, has
been so vigorous that the Rev. Calvin O. Butts 3rd felt obliged to
comment on it during a fiery sermon Sunday at Abyssinian Baptist
Church in Harlem. ``This is not a time for black people to fight
amongst themselves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a year ago, of course, Johnson was a hero to many of
those now attacking him. Withstanding criticism from the four
officers' defenders, he indicted them on second-degree murder
charges, and even opposed their application for bail.
</P>
<P>
   But over the course of the trial, as momentum seemed to shift to
the defense, the second-guessing began. The prosecution team, which
together has more than 75 years of experience, was criticized for
its cross-examination of the officers, for failing to cross-examine
the last defense witness, an expert on police practices, and for
not putting on a rebuttal case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying they were incompetent, but they were not
aggressive,'' said Michael A. Hardy, a lawyer who represents
Sharpton. ``They didn't have an appeal to the jury; they didn't
tell a story.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of those who followed the trial closely, however, said the
criticism was unfair _ that the prosecution put on as strong a case
as it could, given the consistent testimony and sympathetic
demeanor of the officers and the lack of witnesses to contradict
their version of events.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what else he could have done,'' said Eddie Hayes,
a lawyer who followed the trial as an anchor for Court TV, said of
Johnson. ``I think he has severe limitations, given that there are
no real eyewitnesses and the defense has four trained, experienced
witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Both he and Stephen Gillers, a law professor and vice dean at
New York University, said they felt Johnson effectively put police
policies on trial, which was as important as trying the officers
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt we put on the strongest case we could,'' said
Johnson's spokesman, Steven Reed, who declined to respond to
specific criticism.
</P>
<P>
   But Robert Aiello, a former prosecutor who is one of the lawyers
representing Saikou Diallo, Diallo's father, in a pending civil
action, said he was reluctant to second-guess the prosecution but
thought prosecutors should have tried harder to impeach the
officers' credibility. Even the defense lawyers said they had
prepared their clients for far more grueling cross-examination.
</P>
<P>
   An objection raised by many _ that prosecutors chose not to
cross-examine James J. Fyfe, an expert on police procedures and the
last defense witness _ was echoed by a juror Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't cross-examine _ I was so surprised,'' said the
juror, Helen Harder.
</P>
<P>
   Aiello also said he thought the prosecutors should have asked
that the judge say in his instructions to the jury that, even if
the use of deadly force is necessary at first, it can become
unjustified later. Such a charge would have allowed the jury to
consider the validity of Officers Sean Carroll and Edward McMellon
firing 16 shots each.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil
Liberties Union, said the prosecution also erred by not insisting
that the judge more fully explain the law of street encounters.
Defense lawyers succeeded in persuading Justice Joseph C. Teresi to
read jurors the law of street encounters in New York, under which a
police officer has the right to make a basic inquiry of a citizen.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel said that, under New York law, a citizen is legally
entitled, if not necessarily wise, to ignore a police officer's
inquiry if he is not committing any crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where was the objection from the prosecution to the
instruction?'' Siegel asked.

DEVILS COME OUT FIRING AND END 0-4-1 SLUMP WITH A SHUTOUT
</HEADLINE>
   (ms)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Unaccustomed to losing four in a row,
the New Jersey Devils came out firing Sunday evening. Their shots
in the first 25 minutes were either wide by inches or pushed aside,
but three of their 48 shots eventually found the net for a 3-0
triumph over the Montreal Canadiens at Continental Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils, who had gone five games without a victory for the
first time in five years, ended the streak in grand fashion. Petr
Sykora, Claude Lemieux and Bobby Holik scored the goals, but their
best player was goaltender Martin Brodeur.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur turned aside all 30 shots he faced for his fourth
shutout of the season and the 40th of his career. He earned the
shutout with a number of brilliant saves, especially one on Turner
Stevenson's rebound after a shot by Martin Rucinsky with 4 minutes
20 seconds left in the scoreless first period.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to get out of it,'' Brodeur said of the 0-4-1
stretch, ``and I think we responded well. We needed this because
we're also going on the road for the next seven games.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devils' trip starts in Nashville on Tuesday and concludes in
Pittsburgh on March 17, with stops in Colorado, Vancouver, Calgary,
Atlanta and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The road trip should be fun,'' said Brodeur, who absorbed the
overtime loss to the Canadiens in Montreal last Thursday. ``It'll
give us an opportunity to spend time as a team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devils, who broke a league record for road victories last
season with 28, are 12-13-4 on the road this season and have lost
their last two games away from Continental Arena. Their overall
record of 37-19-7 after Sunday's victory is the best in the Eastern
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   With help from Chicago's victory over St. Louis Sunday, the
Devils also have the same number of points as the Blues in the race
for the Presidents' Trophy, which goes to the team with the most
points in the National Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils capitalized on their second manpower advantage, with
Sykora opening the scoring 50 seconds after a penalty to Patrick
Poulin for tripping Jason Arnott at 4:38 of the second period.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 19th goal of the season and fourth on the power play
for Sykora, who scored after exchanging passes with Scott Gomez on
the right side. Sykora's is shot from a sharp angle deflected off
the skate on Eric Weinrich past Jeff Hackett, who stopped the first
20 shots he faced.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stayed patient after we didn't score in the first,'' Sykora
said. ``We didn't get down on ourselves got that lucky bounce on
the first goal.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devils doubled their lead just over two minutes later, when
Lemieux took a pass from Gomez on the right, as Montreal defenseman
Vladimir Malakhov lost his stick, and beat Hackett over the left
shoulder for his 19th goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   It was during the next two minutes that Brodeur shone just as
bright as he did on the save against Stevenson in the first period.
First, he denied Oleg Petrov when the diminutive right wing raced
toward him with tremendous speed on the right, and then he denied
Rucinsky's sharp backhander from the slot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marty played excellent,'' Coach Robbie Ftorek said of Brodeur,
who improved his record to 35-12-7. ``He had a lot of big saves,
especially in the second period.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Brodeur getting his 40th shutout, Ftorek said, ``I hope
50 comes quicker than 40 because it took him so long to get the
40th.''
</P>
<P>
   Any fear of a third-period letdown vanished 4:39 into the period
when Holik took a pass from Ken Daneyko down the right flank and
beat Hackett between the legs for his 20th of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a good effort from everybody and we got a good
result,'' Scott Stevens, the Devils' captain, said.

PHONE DEAL IN HONG KONG SAID TO GET A NEW PLAYER
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: Embargoed for 10:30 p.m. ET)

 By MARK LANDLER with ANDREW ROSS SORKIN 
  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. is on the verge of
investing $1 billion in Singapore Telecommunications, which could
enable it to sweeten its offer for Hong Kong's dominant telephone
company, Cable and Wireless HKT Ltd., executives close to the
negotiations said Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The emergence of a new player came after a board meeting of the
Hong Kong company's British parent, Cable and Wireless PLC, in
London on Sunday, at which the directors were presented with
competing bids from Singapore Telecommunications and Pacific
Century Cyberworks, a Hong Kong start-up.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Century proposed to acquire Cable and Wireless HKT in a
stock-and-cash offer that values the company at $35 billion,
executives close to the talks said. Singapore Telecom's offer was
slightly lower than that, although the cash portion of its bid was
potentially larger, people briefed on the offer said.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Century also made an all-stock offer worth $38.5
billion, but executives involved in the discussions said it was not
likely to be accepted. Cable and Wireless has pressed Pacific
Century to offer more cash.
</P>
<P>
   The Cable and Wireless board meeting ended without a decision on
Sunday night, and with the News Corp. added to the mix, the battle
for Hong Kong's phone company seems to be turning into a global,
multifront corporate war.
</P>
<P>
   Executives close to Singapore Telecommunications said that as
part of its $1 billion investment, the News Corp. would set up an
Internet and TV venture in Singapore similar to the one it
announced late last year with Cable and Wireless HKT. If the
Singapore company merged with its Hong Kong counterpart, the joint
venture with News would become a region-wide service.
</P>
<P>
   In the short run, however, Murdoch's involvement would enable
Singapore Telecommunications to increase its cash offer to Cable
and Wireless, which is currently about $6.4 billion for the
company's 54.4 percent stake in HKT.
</P>
<P>
   The bidding war for Cable and Wireless HKT has riveted Asia,
because it is the first takeover battle of the Internet age here
and because it pits the archrivals Hong Kong and Singapore against
each other. Singapore Telecommunications is controlled by the
Singapore government, while Pacific Century was started by Richard
Li, the 33-year-old son of Li Ka-shing, Hong Kong's mightiest
tycoon.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Li barged into merger negotiations between Singapore
Telecom and Cable and Wireless two weeks ago when he announced that
he wanted to acquire Cable and Wireless HKT. Since then, Li has
raised $1 billion through a share placement and roughly $10 billion
in loans from a consortium of banks, including the Bank of China
and HSBC Holdings.
</P>
<P>
   HSBC's role could prove contentious. Executives close to
Singapore Telecommunications said the company was considering suing
HSBC for conflict of interest because its investment banking arm
had advised Cable and Wireless HKT. According to Singapore Telecom,
that gave HSBC access to HKT's internal financial documents, which
it could use to help Pacific Century.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for HSBC, David Hall, declined to comment on a
potential lawsuit, saying the bank had not been contacted by
Singapore Telecommunications or its lawyers. But he said, ``We wish
to make it absolutely clear that at all times, we have acted
properly in our dealings with Cable and Wireless HKT.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives close to HSBC said the London-based bank had resigned
as an adviser to Cable and Wireless HKT last week. The threat of a
lawsuit by Singapore Telecom seemed calculated to sow doubt among
board members of Cable and Wireless about the soundness of Pacific
Century's financing.
</P>
<P>
   Although Singapore Telecom would seem to have more financial
leverage than Pacific Century, it is handicapped by political
considerations. Neither the Hong Kong government nor the mainland
Chinese have welcomed the prospect of a Singapore company taking
over Hong Kong's phone company.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers in Hong Kong reported over the weekend that China
Telecom, which owns 10.7 percent of Cable and Wireless HKT, would
vote to accept Pacific Century's offer. China Telecom is the Hong
Kong-based arm of China's state telephone company and is controlled
by Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear how Murdoch would change the political dynamic.
The News Corp. has had an up-and-down history in China, though
Murdoch has gone to great pains in recent years to cultivate
Chinese leaders.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, the most important constituency is the board of
Cable and Wireless. The board meeting on Sunday was spent outlining
the two bids, the executives said, with no real winner emerging.

 &HT;    Bush admits his mistake
 &HT;    By Ken Herman and Jena Heath
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ After weeks of defending his speech at controversial
Bob Jones University, Gov. George W. Bush said Sunday he made a big
mistake by not condemning the fundamentalist school's anti-Catholic
beliefs when he was there.
</P>
<P>
   ``On reflection,'' Bush said in a letter to Cardinal John
O'Connor, archbishop of New York, ``I should have been more clear
in disassociating myself from anti-Catholic sentiments and racial
prejudice. It was a missed opportunity, causing needless offense,
which I deeply regret.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's confession came as he began a crucial nine-day period
leading up to the Super Tuesday contests on March 7 that could
determine whether he or Arizona Sen. John McCain will be the GOP
presidential nominee. Virginia and Washington state hold primaries
Tuesday, and North Dakota Republicans will meet in caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Bush narrowed McCain's lead in the race for
Republican national convention delegates by winning Puerto Rico's
winner-take-all primary. The 14 delegates Bush picked up Sunday,
along with the 12 he won Saturday in three other U.S. territories _
Guam, American Samoa and the Virgin Islands _ gives the Texas
governor 93 delegates, three behind McCain. A candidate needs 1,034
delegates to win the Republican nomination for president.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush picked up additional delegates, he cannot count on
getting votes from the islands' residents if he wins the
nomination. Residents of U.S. territories cannot vote in the
general election, but are allowed to participate in presidential
primaries and caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, McCain announced Sunday that he won't take part in
Thursday's GOP presidential campaign debate in Los Angeles, and
aides say they pulled out because Bush was slow to agree to the
California event and that sparked scheduling conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he plans to attend the debate, if held, because it
would be an important discussion in a key state.
</P>
<P>
   McCain scored big wins in his home state and in Michigan last
Tuesday. The Michigan win, a shocker to the Bush camp, included
efforts by McCain to portray Bush as anti-Catholic because of his
speech at Bob Jones University.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said Sunday he did not know about the school's
anti-Catholic sentiments and ban on inter-racial dating until after
his speech that kicked off his South Carolina campaign in the
aftermath of McCain's big win in New Hampshire. The speech signaled
Bush's move to the right, a strategy that played well as he won
South Carolina but turned into a negative in last week's contest in
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   McCain fueled the fire with campaign phone calls alleging Bush,
by speaking at Bob Jones University, showed an anti-Catholic bias.
The university believes Catholicism and Mormonism are ``cults.''
</P>
<P>
   In his letter to O'Connor, Bush rejected that belief.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a Christian, I see Catholics as my brothers and sisters in
Christ _ sharing the same ancient creeds and core beliefs,'' Bush
told O'Connor. ``And, as you know, my own brother and sister-in-law
are both Catholics.'' Florida Gov. Jeb Bush converted to
Catholicism after marrying his wife, Columba.
</P>
<P>
   As he headed to Seattle on Sunday, George W. Bush said he wrote
the letter to O'Connor and other Catholic leaders because he was
``deeply troubled by impressions that run contrary to my nature and
my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In retrospect, I wish I had clearly condemned the sentiments
that pit one religion against another,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to trying to make the Bob Jones University
controversy go away, Bush on Sunday blasted McCain for his
involvement in Michigan phone calls claiming that Bush is
anti-Catholic. McCain initially denied any involvement in the
calls, but The New York Times reported Sunday that McCain approved
the scripts in advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I regret campaigning against a man that says one thing and
does another, a person who says he will run a positive campaign
then approves the scripts of anti-Catholic bigotry in a state like
Michigan,'' said Bush, adding that the calls ``clearly implied that
I'm an anti-Catholic bigot.''
</P>
<P>
   The calls, identified as part of ``Catholic voter alert,'' said
Bush sought ``the support of Southern fundamentalists who have
expressed anti-Catholic views.'' The call mentioned Bush's speech
at Bob Jones University, and said Jones ``has made strong
anti-Catholic statements including calling the pope the anti-Christ
and the Catholic church a satanic cult.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who previously denied approving calls alleging Bush is
anti-Catholic, said Sunday the calls he OK'd were accurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The call was that he attended an institution'' in South
Carolina, McCain said on ABC's ``This Week.'' ``My campaign came to
me and said we want to make some calls. I said as long as they are
factual and correct and the same thing I would say on the `Today'
show or any other program, fine. Then they were portrayed as some
calls that were somehow accusing Governor Bush of being
anti-Catholic or a bigot. That's not true, and that's not what I
take responsibility for.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., and a former Bush backer now supporting
McCain, said Sunday that Bush invited criticism by speaking at Bob
Jones University. King, a Catholic, switched to McCain after the
speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Governor Bush is at all bigoted, but he was
willing to shake hands with the devil to make the deal to get
himself elected in South Carolina,'' King said on NBC's ``Meet the
Press.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bob Jones controversy is not the first time Bush has found
himself at the precarious intersection of church and politics. In
1993, prior to his first gubernatorial campaign, Bush, a Methodist,
said he believes that heaven is open only to those who accept Jesus
Christ as their personal savior.
</P>
<P>
   Bush later clarified the comments to say he had not intended to
judge other people's religious beliefs. Abraham Foxman, president
of the Anti-Defamation League, which monitors anti-Semitism, has
said he is convinced Bush harbors no ill-will toward
non-Christians.

AMTRAK TO EXPAND SERVICE, COPYING STRATEGY OF AIRLINES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After years of trying to balance its books by
cutting service, Amtrak has concluded that to succeed it should
instead create new routes, offer more frequent service on existing
lines and organize itself more like the airlines, so people can
change trains and get to places more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   Railroad officials say the railroad plans to announce on Tuesday
that it will run a train from New York to California, which it
believes is unprecedented. It also plans to expand service to
Monterrey, Mexico, and Toronto, and stretch its Florida-to-New York
service to Boston. It will add a third daily train between New York
and Chicago, in hopes that if it gives travelers more schedule
choices, more people will choose trains over cars or planes. And it
hopes to attract business travelers on routes like Washington to
Atlanta on overnight trains.
</P>
<P>
   It is a major change of strategy for the company, which has
managed to sidestep growth since its creation by Congress in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been trimming, cutting and shrinking up, to save some
out-of-pocket cash,'' said George Warrington, the Amtrak president.
``But we found out that if you reduce the scope of your network,
you take out a significant percentage of revenue.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin, who is chairman of Amtrak's
board, said in a telephone interview, ``We're going to grow it into
profitability.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson and Warrington emphasized, in separate interviews, that
part of the strategy was to carry more high-value freight. The
transcontinental train, for example, will have refrigerated cars
for carrying produce, which the railroad says will make it
profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how many people would prefer a 58-hour rail trip to a
6-hour flight, Thompson said, ``Some people will, sure, people that
love rail passenger service, people who are retired and want to see
the country instead of just flying over it.'' Cutting trains that
did not earn back their direct costs and their share of overhead
costs, Warrington said, reduced the number of passengers fed into
the system, some of whom would have continued their trips on more
profitable routes.
</P>
<P>
   Now the railroad wants to add trains that can earn back direct
costs, and make some contribution, even a small one, to the
overhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The airlines figured this out a long time ago,'' said
Warrington, who plans to imitate the airlines in other ways,
including offering discounts for tickets sold to leisure travelers
weeks in advance, and raising the price for last-minute travelers.
</P>
<P>
   The new schedules, which will be in place by 2003, include
overhauling 50 passenger cars and locomotives, some of them in
storage for years, and buying or leasing 2,000 box cars,
refrigerator cars and ``roadrailers,'' which have tires and train
wheels.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak is negotiating with the freight railroads over whose
tracks it operates, offering them a share of the added profits, and
hopes to carry goods on its passenger trains that now move by
truck, including meat and poultry and manufactured goods like car
parts.
</P>
<P>
   The changes will increase the number of miles Amtrak trains
travel every year to 38 million from 34 million and, Amtrak hopes,
raise the number of passenger-miles to 6.7 billion from 5.3 billion
last year. A passenger mile is one paying passenger traveling one
mile.
</P>
<P>
   And the changes will improve the bottom line by $65 million a
year, company officials say, which is essential because Congress
has said it will end operating subsidies in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion plans require agreements with the freight
railroads but do not need approval by Congress. The changes are big
for Amtrak but small in the scope of the overall transportation
picture. The railroad is seeking a shift in its share of the
intercity passenger market, which is now less than 1 percent. If it
gets all the mail and express freight business it wants, the total
would amount to 0.13 percent of that market. For the freight
railroads and the trucking companies, ``that's a rounding error,''
Warrington said.
</P>
<P>
   The Amtrak Reform Council, a panel created by Congress in 1997
to report on the railroad's progress, said recently that from 1989
to 1998, while the airlines' passenger miles increased by 35.3
percent and intercity buses' passenger miles increased by 7.8
percent, Amtrak's shrank by 1.4 percent.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The halls of the Brooklyn Tabernacle shook with the
exhortations of the Rev. Jim Cymbala on Sunday, and Carol Cymbala,
leading the choir, worked the piano as she has done for 27 years,
as if nothing at all were different about this day. But something
was.
</P>
<P>
   The 270-voice Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir was singing for the
first time in public since winning its third Grammy award last
week: best gospel choir or chorus album for ``High and Lifted Up.''
The title was appropriate not only for the album but also for the
mood among the throng in the Flatbush Avenue church.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lift up your hands to the Lord,'' Jim Cymbala shouted, and the
congregation reached for the ornate pink and white ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you have a lot of praise for the Lord, like the choir
does today?'' he yelled$ and a wave of amens and shouts of joy
answered.
</P>
<P>
   The choir has recorded 18 albums and performed around the world,
including at Carnegie Hall and Radio City Music Hall. It won
Grammys in the gospel category in 1994 and 1996. The feat was
unusual considering that the pastor's wife does not read sheet
music and has no formal music training.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are choirs so much better than we are,'' said Carol
Cymbala, 52, during a break between services. ``We are not that
good. But any recognition there is, is an honor.''
</P>
<P>
   The nondenominational congregation is made up of 10,000
born-again Christians, a multiracial gathering that talks about God
with ease and passion and never fails to credit him for any good
fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Fans, in turn, have given glory to the choir. It has sold 1.5
million albums, and its music is no small part of a service so
popular that people wait in line to get into the church long after
the service has begun.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of the first service on Sunday, the choir sang
seven songs, most of them accompanied by the worshippers' fervent
foot-stomping and hand-clapping.
</P>
<P>
   Was the crowd drawn by the music or the message?
</P>
<P>
   The Cymbalas have pondered this.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so easy for church to be a happening rather than a
worship service,'' Jim Cymbala, 57, said during his sermon on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The choir's recording career began ordinarily enough.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Cymbala's father, the Rev. Clair Hutchins, asked the
Cymbalas to take over his struggling congregation, which then
worshipped in a storefront church on Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   They agreed, but at first scrambled to draw new people to the
church and pay the bills.
</P>
<P>
   Their fortunes changed as interest grew. The choir that began
with eight singers and Carol Cymbala in 1973 had grown to 60 or so
singers by 1981.
</P>
<P>
   In that year, she thought it would be nice to make a tape so the
congregants could take the service home with them. She gave the
tape to a friend who had contacts in the recording industry and
passed it on to executives at Word, a Christian label in Nashville,
Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   The choir, to its members' amazement, was signed, and since then
has recorded an album every year or two.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the early days, anyone could join the choir. But today,
aspirants go through one or two auditions and a series of
interviews with the Cymbalas to reveal the depth of their faith.
``Now you need an FBI background check,'' Jim Cymbala said with a
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   The recognition and publicity are surely welcome, if humbling.
The gospel awards are not presented during the national telecast;
they are among a group of awards given out in earlier ceremonies
and noted by a list that crawls across the television screen.
</P>
<P>
   One choir member, Esther Cedeno, said she fixed her eyes on the
screen when the list came up. ``It was like, `Who are we to win a
Grammy?''' she said. ``But then you think about it. It teaches us
we don't have to compromise. We don't have to cross over, like some
artists are doing.''

A DIALLO JUROR SAYS PROSECUTORS FAILED TO PROVE THEIR CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By WINNIE HU   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ A juror who helped acquit four police officers
charged with murdering Amadou Diallo said Sunday that the
prosecution had failed to prove its case, but she believed the
officers should be held responsible for civil damages.
</P>
<P>
   In a 20-minute interview at her home, the juror, Helen Harder,
72, described the atmosphere in the jury room as generally
amicable, untainted by the racial overtones that have hovered over
the case. She said she empathized with Diallo's family, but
stressed that the prosecution had not proved that the officers
acted criminally. She also blamed police procedures for creating a
volatile confrontation. ``I still feel that they had some
responsibility _ that doesn't mean that I want them to be convicted
of manslaughter,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Officers Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon, Kenneth Boss and Richard
Murphy, were acquitted of all charges Friday in the death of
Diallo. The police officers, who are white, fired on Diallo, an
unarmed African immigrant, 41 times and struck him 19 times as he
stood in the vestibule of his apartment building in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Harder, whose cozy home is filled with framed photos of her nine
children and 17 grandchildren, said she and the other jurors put
aside their personal feelings about the shooting during the more
than 30 hours of deliberations. She said they followed Justice
Joseph C. Teresi's instructions to consider only whether the
prosecution had proved its burden. It had not, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two or three days earlier, I would never have expected that
verdict,'' she said. ``It surprised me. We were charged by the
judge and told that the prosecution has to prove its case or there
is no case. Well, that made it different.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Harder said she was surprised, and disappointed,
that the prosecution had not asked any questions of the final
defense witness, James J. Fyfe, an expert on police procedures who
testified that the four officers had acted properly. She said the
prosecution did not present enough evidence against the officers
and left her with unanswered questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they probably didn't have enough to work with,'' she
said of the prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Although the racial overtones of the Diallo shooting have
polarized communities throughout New York, Harder, who is white,
insisted that race had not been an issue during the deliberations.
Four of the jurors were black women and the rest were white men.
``There was not a racial aspect in the jury room,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Harder said that none of the jurors believed the officers were
guilty of murder, and that only one or two initially considered a
conviction for manslaughter or one of the lesser charges.
Eventually, she said, the jurors amicably reached an agreement as
they went through all the charges _ listed on a chalkboard _ one by
one for each officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody had reservations about whether the police acted
properly, but given the parameters, we decided they did,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Harder said the four officers and the police department
should be held responsible for the shooting in a civil lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the city is responsible, because they're responsible
for police procedures,'' she said. ``I think the whole unit they
belonged to wouldn't have had such a sharp look to the people who
lived there if there were some black police officers, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Harder spoke publicly about the Diallo trial for the first time
Sunday afternoon after meeting with six other jurors. Since the
verdict was read in court Friday, the jurors have dodged calls from
reporters, posted signs outside their homes asking to be left alone
and generally maintained their silence, in part, out of fear of the
repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so intense and we were so mind-boggled by it,'' Harder
said of the jury deliberations. ``We decided we didn't want to talk
to anyone.''

EARLY SKIRMISHES DEFINING NEW JERSEY SENATE PRIMARY
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ In a season dominated by presidential politics,
the Democratic rivals for the Senate from New Jersey have yet to
take center stage. But former Gov. Jim Florio has been attacking
Jon S. Corzine, his virtually unknown opponent, every day and from
every angle, as if the June 6 primary were right around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   One minute his campaign tries to portray Corzine, a former
co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., as a cutthroat Wall Street
tycoon with a history of exploiting workers. The next, it paints
Corzine as a bleeding-heart left-wing extremist who opposes the
death penalty, mandatory criminal sentences and welfare reform.
</P>
<P>
   Florio accuses Corzine, whose holdings in his old firm alone are
worth more than $300 million, of cynically trying to buy the
election by making or steering huge political donations to many
powerful Democrats. And he belittles Corzine, who is so new to
politics that even his supporters often mispronounce his last name
(CORE-zyne), as hopelessly naive for thinking he could ever sell
his expansive ideas in a general election, let alone in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine, meanwhile, has not exactly been stoic in response. His
staff dutifully answers every public attack with a volley of
aggressive countercharges about Florio's record. But until last
week, Corzine himself had barely entered the fray.
</P>
<P>
   Although these skirmishes have drawn little attention so far,
they have revealed the essential dynamic of what is shaping up to
be a grueling Democratic contest: Florio is desperately trying to
define his opponent, while Corzine is merely hoping to define
himself, betting that New Jersey voters already know enough about
Florio to be seeking an alternative to him.
</P>
<P>
   Both men have their work cut out for them. According to a
Quinnipiac College Poll released on Wednesday, only about one in
five registered Democrats has heard enough about Corzine to have
any opinion of him, positive or negative.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Florio, a statewide fixture for a
quarter-century, holds a commanding lead over his opponent, 57
percent to 22 percent in the latest survey.
</P>
<P>
   But polls this early in a race typically reflect name
recognition more than anything else. Indeed, the former governor,
who pushed through a $2.8 billion tax increase in 1990 after
campaigning on a promise not to raise taxes, remains unpopular with
the public a decade later, the same survey found. More ominously
for Florio, as many as 39 percent of Democrats still view him
unfavorably.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Florio trails far behind the wealthy Corzine in
amassing campaign money. And Corzine has locked up the endorsements
of county organizations representing about two-thirds of the
state's Democrats; on Saturday, for example, he thrashed Florio at
the Mercer County party convention, receiving support from three
out of four delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine will thus enjoy a preferred spot on primary ballots in
those areas and a huge manpower advantage in the crucial area of
get-out-the-vote efforts.
</P>
<P>
   With Florio so far ahead in the polls, and Corzine clearly
winning the political inside game, both candidates expect that
their race will end up too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   To Corzine and his advisers, the campaign will not begin in
earnest until after the March 7 and 14 presidential primaries, when
television advertisements introducing his face, voice and
personality to voters will begin appearing in the New York and
Philadelphia media markets. Almost every appearance Corzine makes
is being videotaped, including his endorsement on Thursday night by
Sen. Frank Lautenberg.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Raymond J. Lesniak, a Democratic power broker from
Elizabeth and one of Corzine's chief strategists, said it would
take four to six weeks of television for rank-and-file Democratic
voters to get to know Corzine. ``It's virtually impossible to
define anybody in New Jersey without going on TV,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Corzine's advisers think Florio will be able to
afford no more than two weeks of television commercials, giving
their candidate a potential head start of more than two months.
``That's the kind of advantage that a politician would salivate
over,'' said one of Corzine's most active supporters.
</P>
<P>
   But W. Michael Murphy Jr., a co-chairman of Florio's campaign,
said an aggressive, sustained and unanswered television campaign by
Corzine would only turn off voters. ``They're going to have to
spend enormous amounts of money, and at some point people are going
to look at him and say, `Oh yeah, that's the rich guy trying to buy
the election,''' said Murphy, a former prosecutor who was a
candidate for governor in 1997.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The golden coin's message is as revolutionary as
this city gets these days: Put aside revered dead presidents and
contemplate Sacagawea, the Shoshone woman who courageously guided
Lewis and Clark in the 19th-century expedition that redefined
America.
</P>
<P>
   In the clever marketing hands of the U.S. Mint's director,
Philip N. Diehl, a popular demand for Sacagawea's handsome image on
the distinctive new dollar coin is suddenly sweeping the nation.
After only a month of test circulation, Americans are searching out
the coin, clearly moving beyond their distaste for the Susan B.
Anthony dollar, a widespread failure two decades ago in its
confusing similarity to the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The demand for the new gold-colored dollar coin _ deliberately
smooth-edged and wide-bordered so it can be identified by touch _
is so great that production has already been doubled to 200 million
coins in this first month. The Mint is preparing to have 1 billion
new coins in circulation by the end of the year, phenomenally
surpassing the Susan B. Anthony dollar, which took 21 years to
reach 900 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought going in that the Golden Dollar was a tough sell,''
said Diehl, an ebullient impresario for his new star, Sacagawea.
Now banks that once were wary are demanding daily shipments from
Diehl. Customers are besieging the few retail outlets like Wal-Mart
that had the foresight to stock the coins.
</P>
<P>
   ``So now we're in the ironic situation where people want this
coin so badly _ but they want to hold it, not spend it,'' said the
Mint director, a 48-year-old Texan whose marketing flights of fancy
go far beyond wordplay when he talks of the power of change in
America. Pocket change, yes, but cultural change, above all.
</P>
<P>
   This became Diehl's mantra in his big success with the start
last year of the 10-year project to mint quarters honoring each of
the 50 states. ``Coinage has been around for 3,000 years,'' he
said, regretting that in the United States a coin's commercial
purpose had far overwhelmed its parallel societal use: ``the
inclusion of our storytelling and values, of the culture of the
country that produces the coins.''
</P>
<P>
   This storytelling faded in the last century as coinage decisions
remained conservative and dead presidents predominated. But the
cultural component seems well resurrected now with the Sacagawea
dollar and the buzz of nationwide design competitions for the new
quarters, minted at the rate of five new designs a year.
</P>
<P>
   Diehl shepherded these developments with careful focus-group
marketing research and advertising campaigns like the $40 million
blitz coming next month. This is designed to convince Americans
that the Sacagawea dollar is eminently spendable. ``They've been
disappearing instantaneously,'' he happily noted. ``We've got to
get the people to let go of them.''
</P>
<P>
   In his six years at the Mint, Diehl has learned all sorts of
surprising things, including what makes coin collectors tick: an
affection for history far more than investment profit. ``I never
collected anything as a kid,'' he said of his boyhood in Lubbock,
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   He still does not collect much beyond the varieties of berries
he painstakingly cultivates in his backyard garden. He lives in
Chevy Chase, Md., with his wife, Jacquita, an executive with MCI
WorldCom Communications, and their sons, Michael, 16, and Alex, 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``There used to be maybe 2 million coin collectors, but the new
quarters have seen 112 million more Americans collecting,'' Diehl
noted with some pride. The nation's annual demand for quarters has
jumped to 7.6 billion from 2 billion for the state versions as
collectors seek both the Denver and the Philadelphia mintings.
</P>
<P>
   This increased interest, plus modern Internet marketing methods,
has seen the Mint's profits increase sixfold in three years to an
estimated $2.7 billion this year.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, profits. Each 25-cent piece costs 4 cents to mint, Diehl
notes, while the dollar coin, an alloy of manganese, brass and
copper, costs 12 cents. The Mint reaps the difference and deposits
it in the Treasury's general fund as a ``dividend for taxpayers,''
in the business-minded jargon of the director.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He came here nine years ago, Diehl relates, to work as a
progressive Sam Rayburn-Franklin D. Roosevelt Democrat, inspired by
the civil rights struggles of the 1960s. Diehl says he was guided
by his lone Democratic uncle, Woodrow Wilson Diehl, who showed him
how to push out against his small-town, rock-ribbed Republican
environment. He became chief of staff for Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas
senator who later became secretary of the Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   A political science graduate of Austin College in Sherman,
Texas, Diehl was reluctant when Bentsen suggested the Mint job with
its passive bureaucratic image that seemed devoid of the
policy-making he craved. But he came to love it as an inviting
place to try entrepreneurial innovation in public service.
</P>
<P>
   ``I discovered this job was a diamond in the rough,'' said
Diehl, who is reviewing private- and public-sector job offers as
his term expires with the Clinton presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sacagawea was the ultimate dark-horse candidate,'' Diehl says,
recounting the difficult, arcane politics of coinage. After much
reluctance, Congress, a body jealous about its currency
prerogatives, finally approved another attempt at a dollar coin. A
coin's main selling point is a 30-year life span vs. the paper
dollar's 14-month span.
</P>
<P>
   A design competition requiring a woman from history winnowed
down 121 possibilities as Diehl made sure to have his customers,
the citizenry, studied in focus groups on the Internet. Sacagawea
was carried along in part on the strength of Stephen E. Ambrose's
popular new writings about Lewis and Clark, said Diehl, delighted
at all this freshly minted storytelling.
</P>
<P>
   ``She offered us a degree of artistic license, too,'' he noted,
because there were no historic depictions of her. Designers, he
said, made sure to right an old wrong in which Indians on past
coins often had European features. ``So her selection carried an
echo of our numismatic past,'' said the Mint director, sounding
thoroughly delighted at the quality of change lately.

CUBAN ENVOY HOLES UP IN CANADIAN EMBASSY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ A Cuban diplomat expelled from the United States
after being accused of spying is seeking sanctuary at the Cuban
Embassy in Canada, to the apparent dismay of Canadian officials.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest twist in the saga, the Cuban government Sunday
said the diplomat, Jose Imperatori, 46, would remain on a hunger
strike at the embassy in Ottawa until the United States withdraws
allegations that he engaged in espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba also accused the United States of dragging Canada into the
messy affair by flying Imperatori to Montreal aboard a US plane
Saturday night after declaring him persona non grata.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the imperialists have done . . . is throw the hot potato
to its neighbor Canada,'' Cuba charged in a statement released in
Havana, blaming the Clinton administration for the imbroglio.
</P>
<P>
   Canada has for decades irked the United States by maintaining
friendly relations with the communist regime of Fidel Castro.
However, it was clear Sunday night that the country does not want
to get caught in the latest cross-fire between Washington and
Havana and does not intend to give haven to the alleged espionage
agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canada agreed to facilitate his transfer,'' said a Foreign
Ministry spokesman, Patrick Hebert, adding that Ottawa had
consulted with both the Cuban and US governments. ``We expect he
will depart shortly'' for Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Imperatori, who hours before his expulsion from the United
States had showed a flair for the dramatic by announcing a hunger
strike to protest the allegations, caught Canada off-guard when he
bolted from the airport in Montreal for the Cuban Embassy in
Ottawa, leaving his wife and 3-year-old son to fly on to Havana.
</P>
<P>
   The Castro government has asked Canada to allow Imperatori to
stay in the country ``for the time necessary to find an honorable
solution.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban government also announced that Imperatori would
maintain his hunger strike until the United States backs down from
the spy charges. Starvation is not a standard diplomatic tactic.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between the United States and Cuba had shown signs of
modest improvement before bitter wrangling began late last year
over custody of Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old Cuban boy whose
mother drowned while trying to bring him to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators in Cuba Sunday chanted anti-US slogans and hailed
Imperatori as a national hero. Cuba said that the expulsion of
Imperatori represents a ``crude maneuver'' by the United States to
deflect attention from the plight of the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Imperatori was forced to surrender his diplomatic post with the
tiny Cuban interests section in Washington after being accused last
week of maintaining illegal contacts with Mariano Faget, a veteran
officer of the US Immigration and Naturalization Service charged
with spying on behalf of Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban officials implied that the United States had dumped
Imperatori on an unsuspecting Canada: ``The US government . . .
deceived Canadian authorities, lied to them,'' the Cuban official
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Canadian officials said they had given permission for
the transfer of the ousted diplomat via Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canada is a usual route for Cuban diplomats to go to and from
the United States,'' Hebert said. ``And we expect him to abide by
the agreement and leave soon.''

UNDER FIRE, JAPAN SECT STARTS OVER
</HEADLINE>
   (Story previously eliminated is now restored) 
(rk) 
 By CALVIN SIMS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   YOKOHAMA, Japan _ Outside the local office of the Aum Shinrikyo
religious sect here, dozens of riot police officers have been
permanently stationed to control angry Japanese mobs that gather to
denounce the sect, which killed 12 people five years ago when it
released deadly nerve gas in the Tokyo subways.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, Fumihiro Joyu, the boyish 37-year-old former spokesman
for the group who became its de facto leader after being released
from prison late last year, insists that the sect no longer
represents a threat to Japanese society. The sect no longer
espouses the same ideology, he said, though he insisted that
followers had no reason to give up their reverence for the former
leader who had led them to carry out the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japanese society has nothing to fear from us,'' Joyu said. ``I
think that the most important factor in resolving this conflict is
time. We need time to adapt ourselves to the real world without
losing our basic beliefs, and Japanese society needs time to get
used to our different kind of philosophy and values.''
</P>
<P>
   In a rare interview, Joyu, lean, clean-cut, dressed in gray
slacks and a white Yves Saint Laurent sweat shirt, candidly
discussed the difficulties that Aum is facing amid a government and
grass-roots crackdown. He outlined a series of reforms intended to
resuscitate the sect, which critics say is heading for collapse.
</P>
<P>
   He also apologized for lying to the Japanese people five years
ago when at televised news conferences he adamantly denied that Aum
had any connection to the subway attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did so substantially in order to protect our organization as
the spokesman,'' Joyu said. ``I have to admit that and apologize to
the Japanese people for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people have suggested that Joyu, by virtue of his position
in the organization, must have known that the attack was being
planned. Responding to those concerns, he said that he used to head
the sect's office in Moscow and was in Russia at the time. His
three years in prison were for a perjury conviction unrelated to
the subway attack.
</P>
<P>
   Joyu graduated from one of Japan's top schools, Waseda
University, with a master's degree in engineering. He is fluent in
English and was a college debating champion. His release from
prison was highly anticipated in Japan, and there was much
speculation that he would play a major leadership role in the sect.
</P>
<P>
   Under his direction now, the sect has already taken several
major steps toward transforming itself, he said. It has changed its
name from Aum to Aleph, which signifies new beginning, and
distanced itself from its founder, Shoko Asahara, who is on trial
for masterminding the gas attack and other crimes.
</P>
<P>
   But many Japanese are troubled that Aum still considers Asahara
a ``spiritual being.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like you wouldn't stop your connection with physical
fathers and mothers who commit a crime, we will not sever our
connection with our spiritual father,'' Joyu said. ``The master
Asahara introduced us to the world of spiritualism. He gave us our
second self and we cannot deny that.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the attack, Joyu said Aum members regarded
Asahara as a deity, were anticipating Armageddon and obeyed the
group's leadership without question. Today, he said, the sect no
longer has a dominating personality and has become more democratic
in its management and ideology.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are undertaking a kind of organizational reform and
spiritual revolution,'' Joyu said. ``We are trying to conserve the
benefits of the teachings of Master Asahara and at the same time
exclude the dangerous elements that went with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The sect has also vowed to use profits from its computer
companies and other ventures to compensate victims of crimes
committed by former sect members. And sect members are being
re-educated to become more integrated into society.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not Joyu will succeed in remaking Aum is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Shoko Egawa, a free-lance journalist who is considered an expert
on the sect, said Joyu has given Aum followers a new sense of
purpose. ``Joyu has revitalized the followers by giving them a new
goal _ to work hard to compensate the victims of Aum crimes as a
way of spreading their `Supreme Truth,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Egawa said that as long as Joyu remains the driving force behind
Aum, she doubted that the group would pose a danger to Japan.
``He's a very calculating person, a realist and he knows that such
crimes provide no benefit to him or the organization,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Egawa said she was worried that Aum would continue to use
its longtime recruitment and conversion tactics, in which followers
are stripped of their ability to think for themselves and blindly
follow what they are told.
</P>
<P>
   But Japanese antipathy for Aum runs so deep that many people
believe that the religious sect will never be accepted into society
no matter how many changes it makes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Since his release, Joyu has been a virtual prisoner inside the
cramped, second-floor office, which is dominated by a large
Buddhist altar and new-age meditation music. The police have
advised him not to leave because they cannot guarantee his safety.
</P>
<P>
   Aum's every move is being monitored by authorities under a new
law passed last year that allows the police and Justice Ministry
officials to enter sect facilities at will to conduct inspections.
The law also allows authorities to restrict sect activities deemed
dangerous to society.
</P>
<P>
   Joyu said at least 70 Aum members are continuing to suffer
because municipal governments across the country are refusing to
allow them to register as city residents. Such registration is
necessary to enter public school, receive health benefits, obtain a
driver's license, passport, or library card, and in some cases to
apply for employment or rent an apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem is with medical care,'' Joyu said. ``Some
of our members are hesitating to go to the doctor when they are ill
because it's so expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   But Joyu said he was encouraged by the Japanese government's
recent decision to advise local municipalities to allow children of
Aum residents to register for school. In the past, the government
tacitly approved of the discriminatory tactics saying that it
understood local residents' fear of Aum.
</P>
<P>
   Such difficult circumstances demanded that Joyu assume his place
as the current leader, he said, though he added that it was a role
he had not sought out. ``It is my firm belief that the head of a
religious organization is something that you should not try to be
if you like to be happy,'' he said. ``Such position or status is
not a joy but only duty.''

JOSEPH WOLFSON, SURF LEGEND, DIES IN CAR CRASH AT 50 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joseph Wolfson, an aquatic Peter Pan who was one of the first
surfboarders to master complex maneuvers on the smaller ``body
board'' in the 1970s, died in a car crash on a Los Angeles freeway
on Feb. 21. He was 50.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson became a legend known as Dr. 360 for his ability to spin
completely around while riding a big wave. He won national and
international contests in both the body board and bodysurfing. He
was the perennial California surfer, a free and flamboyant spirit
who moved to Beach Boys rhythms and had teen-age girlfriends even
as his flowing beard turned gray.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last two years of his life, he struggled with the
realization that there were no endless summers. His cancer
worsening, he attempted suicide on Nov. 11, 1998, by tethering his
board to a buoy at a beach near his Manhattan Beach apartment. He
was found unconscious, his body temperature only 81 degrees after a
night in the 59-degree water.
</P>
<P>
   At first, he was disappointed to be alive, but he then received
letters of support from the 33 surfing students who had helped
rescue him. He said he realized that he had been a bad example to
the youths and vowed to set a different example by continuing to
live.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the worst message in the world I could send them,'' he
said in a front-page article in The Los Angeles Times, part of a
giant crest of publicity that washed over his story.
</P>
<P>
   His attempted suicide and its aftermath were featured on
``20/20,'' ``Prime Time Live'' and many California television
programs. NBC bought the rights to his life story for a possible
movie, tentatively titled ``Full Circle.''
</P>
<P>
   His death came when his car veered off the Marina Freeway,
jumping an embankment and slamming into a eucalyptus tree. It is
being investigated by the California Highway Patrol and the Los
Angeles County coroner's office because of his suicidal history.
Evidence seems to point both ways: he wore a seat belt, but did not
brake, according to one witness.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been so tired lately and so worn out and stressed
out,'' said John Featherstone, his roommate and the football coach
at El Camino College.
</P>
<P>
   Born in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn on July 11, 1949,
he moved with his parents and two sisters to north Long Beach in
1956. His father, a linoleum installer and union activist, loved
the beach and took his children there frequently. ``We all fell in
love with the beach,'' his sister Paula said.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson graduated from the University of California at Los
Angeles, where he was a history major. He went to work for the city
of Carson in 1968 as a recreation manager for the parks department
and worked there for the rest of his life. He never moved from the
one-bedroom efficiency apartment in Manhattan Beach he had had
since his UCLA days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe is the unofficial beach bum of the world,'' Richard
Schraier, who worked with Wolfson in theater projects in the late
1970s, told The Los Angeles Times in 1989. ``He lives by the beach
and is ruled by the beach.''
</P>
<P>
   The defining moment in his life came in 1973 when a woman lent
him a new kind of surfboard. It was made of a Styrofoam-like
material and was about three feet long, compared with traditional
surfboards, which are made of fiberglass and can be as long as nine
feet. The boards were originally used by children very close to
shore.
</P>
<P>
   The first time he used one, Wolfson immediately ``pearled,'' a
surfing term for a nose-diving wipeout. The crowd on the beach
laughed, but Wolfson was hooked for life. He still continued to
bodysurf, which is letting waves hurl one's body shoreward like a
torpedo. He never liked larger, traditional surfboards, finding
them unwieldy.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Cody, the editor and publisher of Easy Reader, a newspaper
in Hermosa Beach, Calif., said Wolfson was one of the founders of
the sport of body-boarding, which was at first regarded as more
like sitting on a sled than like skiing.
</P>
<P>
   He perfected the art of spinning on a board while riding a big
wave, something Cody said nobody had done before him. Unlike other
body-boarders who performed the difficult maneuver lying down,
Wolfson did it sitting up.
</P>
<P>
   He won many competitions in the 1970s, as body-board surfing
began to take off as a sport. But because most contestants were far
younger, he gradually stopped competing. He continued to teach
body-boarding and organize tournaments for others.
</P>
<P>
   He cultivated his surfer image even as most people his age
drifted away from the beach scene. His longevity on the sand was
helped by his never drinking or smoking; he stayed in good-enough
shape to surf for 10 hours straight.
</P>
<P>
   He screamed ``Yahoo!'' as he surfed, had ``Dr. 360'' license
plates and paid for extravagant ``surprise'' birthday parties for
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids identify with me,'' he said in the 1989 interview.
``Here's a responsible adult who wants to remain a kid.''
</P>
<P>
   He began having lung problems in February 1998 and was initially
treated for asthma and had sinus surgery. By October, the diagnosis
had changed to lung cancer. After coughing up blood, he headed for
the beach on the starry night of Nov. 11. He screamed and rode wave
after wave, spinning wildly in his own signature style.
</P>
<P>
   Then he tied himself to the buoy. Though he wanted to die, he
did not want to drift into deeper water and be eaten by sharks. The
next morning, he was discovered unconscious, still on his board, by
a friend who was teaching the surfing class from a nearby middle
school.
</P>
<P>
   It was the letters of these children that changed his attitude.
One wrote: ``If you can ride a 20-foot wave, you can ride this.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his sister Paula, who lives in Arlington, Va.,
Wolfson is survived by another sister, Ellen of Portland, Ore.; his
father, Harry of Portland; and his mother, Rhoda of Napa, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   He said he never married because family responsibilities might
take up time he could otherwise spend surfing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was married to the ocean,'' Paula said.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson once said that ``one day the only thing that will be
left of me is a pair of shoes in the sand.'' Monday afternoon,
family, friends and local children plan to paddle into the breaking
surf of Manhattan Beach and scatter his ashes. &QL;

   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. _ Some 12,000 Russian-Americans went home
Saturday _ to the Trump Taj Mahal.
</P>
<P>
   Not for them, at least on Saturday night, the brash glitter of
the casinos. In the concert hall behind the gambling tables, there
was only one temptress: Alla Pugacheva, the self-styled goddess of
Russian pop, Moscow's Tina Turner with a hint of Edith Piaf, whose
songs have given voice to the yearnings of millions.
</P>
<P>
   If you have not heard this voice, it is because you are not
Russian _ or, to be more exact, a onetime citizen of the Soviet
Union. Back there, and among the increasing millions of emigres who
have ventured into the wide world from that once-closed one, there
was and is only one superstar: Alla.
</P>
<P>
   By various counts, in a country where many people live on $100
month or less, she has sold 150 million to 200 million records. She
was decorated by the last Soviet president, Mikhail S. Gorbachev,
and, on her 50th birthday last April, by the first Russian
president, Boris N. Yeltsin. Rare is the Russian television day
that passes without one of her many videos flashing across the
screen.
</P>
<P>
   In the gray Soviet era, Alla was a blaze of color and life. She
has big hair (red in most of her publicity photos, but on Saturday
night a mass of teased and tousled blondish curls), a big voice,
billowing concert costumes and a slightly outlandish mouth that can
utter anything from an obscenity to a religious blessing. She has
never particularly hidden her various travails with weight and
appearance; now, at 50, she simply tells her fans _ many of whom
have aged and billowed with her _ that it's OK to be older, and
rounder.
</P>
<P>
   For this kind of honesty, particularly in a system that elevated
The Lie to a political creed, she was adored. Even those who recoil
at her vulgarity never fail to praise her talent. Her music _ a
mixture of pop, rock, and Gypsy-based Russian folk with sentimental
lyrics that are nearly impossible to translate _ largely depicts a
woman struggling with her passions, a woman wronged, but determined
to go on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, we have been unhappy in our lives much more
than happy,'' said Rachel Shifrin, who arrived 13 years ago from
Soviet Georgia and on Saturday took a bus from Brighton Beach,
Brooklyn, to the New Jersey casino. ``I'm 50 now, and she's 50. She
has pain, I have pain. You know, she has something that touches us
where so few people do.'' Her eyes glistened as she brought a hand
up to her heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just her great voice,'' said Valentina Kolomeer, who
held her miniature poodle, Kity, as fur-hatted tour-bus leaders
marshaled the crowds that flocked to Saturday's two concerts from
Brighton Beach. ``She is also the only woman who achieved
everything by herself, even starving to reach her goals.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 6,000-seat concert hall, where tickets went for $35 to
$250, and henna, glitter, furs and teased hair were de rigueur, the
feeling was the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew her back there,'' said one voice from a matronly trio
_ Isabella, Fayina and Zinaida _ referring to the Soviet land of
their younger days. ``We love her, and remember,'' another one
said. ``Memories _ for us, she's really THE artist.'' A warm smile.
``It's simply a whole epoch,'' Zinaida concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Alla Borisovna, as every Russian speaker affectionately knows
her, has been singing their song for more than a whole epoch. She
first hit the Soviet airwaves at 16, then started to tour. By the
time she was 20, she was married (for the first of four times). By
24, a divorced mother. In the mid-1970s, she shot to Soviet bloc
fame with a triumphal performance at the Golden Orpheus song
contest in Bulgaria _ an unknown event in the West, but a fixture
of the often gray, sometimes maudlin universe created behind the
Iron Curtain by Communism.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the system that spawned her, Pugacheva has survived.
Indeed, to judge by the media chronicles of her native land, which
have followed her every affair, and seemingly every cigarette or
vodka shot that lent rasp to her voice, she could be the original
owner of Gloria Gaynor's motto, ``I Will Survive.''
</P>
<P>
   In Soviet times, when the state kept concerts cheap and even a
superstar was not allowed immense personal wealth, Alla Pugacheva
regularly filled sports stadiums on her concert tours. Now, she
admits, hard times and rising costs have made that harder at home.
(Though, she adds with a smile, ``I'll always get 10,000 people.'')
</P>
<P>
   For that, the world outside has opened up; after she concludes
her current six-concert U.S. and Canada tour on Sunday in Chicago,
she's off to Israel, where, as a Russian-born Israeli couple in the
audience noted with pride, ``she's seen more often than here in
your country,'' playing to the memories of a million Soviet
emigres.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, toward the end, Pugacheva was midsong, again
down in the crowd, when her husband and producer, Philipp Kikorov,
appeared. Wildly popular in his own right as a Russian rock star,
he is the author of what amounts to a hit hymn to Alla (``My little
hare, I'm your little rabbit.'') Tall and clad in leather, he
filmed her Saturday night with a digital video camera. Linking arms
and looking through the lens, the couple mounted the stage as if it
were part of their living room, making home movies before an
audience of thousands.
</P>
<P>
   Next, one of the privileged men allowed at various points to
dance with their idol, or to bestow another bouquet, offered
something special _ a glittering tiara ``to crown the queen of
Russian song.'' With unfailing instinct, Pugacheva turned to her
fans. ``Does it suit me?'' she asked. ``I don't look like a
waitress?'' Then, she offered up another song: ``I stepped on the
throne of love, a throne made of ice.''
</P>
<P>
   She finished with an encore with her daughter, the budding pop
star Christina Orbakaite, as waiflike as her mother is buxom. Alla
bade farewell. ``I experienced happiness,'' she said, glowing. ``I
can't exist without you. Thank you. Be with us forever. Until the
next time. In the name of the mother, the daughter and the Holy
Spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   Backstage, dressed in far quieter clothes, far simpler hair
framing her face and heavy eyes, she received the star's flow of
fans, patiently posing for pictures, dispensing smiles and
signatures. How does it feel to be the empress of Russian pop?
``I'm used to it,'' she purred. And then, with an irony unsuspected
on stage, added, ``Of course, that's a really modest little
answer.''

HENRY TOBLER, 34, WHO SAW THE VALUE OF FOLK ART
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va.)  (rk) 
 By ROBERTA SMITH    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Henry Jernigan Tobler, a gallery director, collector and writer
who specialized in contemporary art and folk art, died on Friday at
the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. He was 34 and lived in
New York until June, when he moved to Houston for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was leukemia, said his wife, Julia Joern, director of
publicity at Phaidon Press in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Tobler, who was called Jay, was born in Richmond, Va. He began
scouring flea markets and junk shops for folk art while still in
high school. He earned a B.A. from Yale University in 1989,
majoring in the history of art and writing his senior thesis on
African-American folk art, a project that enabled him to travel
throughout the South, visiting folk artists and folk art
environments.
</P>
<P>
   After an internship at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, he became
attracted to contemporary art and took a position at the Barbara
Gladstone Gallery in SoHo, where he worked closely with artists
Matthew Barney, Jenny Holzer and Vito Acconci. He left Gladstone
when he became ill in 1993 but returned as director in 1994,
remaining until 1997. He then worked as a freelance writer and
curator, operating on the premise that folk art should not be
separated from the mainstream of art, both historic and
contemporary.
</P>
<P>
   Tobler was the primary editor of the American Art Book, a
reference book published by Phaidon in 1999 that spans three
centuries of American art and includes many folk artists. His most
recent project was an exhibition on the work of James Castle, a
recently discovered 20th-century folk artist, which is to open
Friday at the Drawing Room at the Drawing Center in SoHo.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Tobler is survived by his mother,
Pattie, of Richmond; his father, Henry III, of Elkton, Va.; two
sisters, Anna, of Manhattan, and Mary, of Brooklyn; and a
grandmother, Helen, of Harrisonburg, Va.

ENTHUSIASTIC CROWDS GREET MCCAIN IN VIRGINIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALEXANDRIA, Va. _ As Senator John S. McCain spoke to a noisy
crowd of about 500 outside his modest campaign headquarters Sunday,
a dozen campaign staff members stood on the roof of the squat,
gray-brick building, looking down with huge grins and great
satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   They have good reason to smile. McCain on Sunday picked up the
endorsements of the New York Post and the Baltimore Sun. With the
exception of a recent California poll that showed McCain trailing
Bush in California by 25 points, (which aides said they simply do
not believe), things have been going quite well for the senator's
staff.
</P>
<P>
   Trounced in South Carolina, McCain's aides were able to turn
their sound defeat into a millstone to toss around Texas Governor
George W. Bush's neck: Political strategist John Weaver was
confident Bush's shift to the right in the Palmetto State, would
alienate voters in more moderate states like Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   And to make sure of that, the McCain campaign called Catholic
voters in Michigan to let them know of Bush's visit to Bob Jones
University, which has a reputation for intolerance. The voters
McCain did not reach soon heard about the visit to the university
from Bush himself, who loudly proclaimed his outrage over the
calls, doing McCain another unintended service.
</P>
<P>
   And McCain won Michigan, a significant setback for Bush. Sunday,
in an attempt to stanch the bleeding, the governor issued a letter
of apology for his appearance at Bob Jones University. But McCain
will probably continue to hammer the issue in the future.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush was putting his regrets into writing, McCain, who has
finessed questions over his initial denial of the Michigan calls,
appeared before large and adoring crowds over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure we're going to win on Tuesday,'' McCain said at
the rally, speaking of Virginia's primary, where Bush is still
strongly favored to win. ``But I am sure of this: Eventually, we're
going to win this nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, McCain said he would not participate in a debate in
California Thursday, as he originally planned. The debate has
already been advertised on television. That decision has spawned
yet another acrimonious exchange between the campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``They invited us both, we accepted, Bush declined. Then, the
Bush campaign started losing more primaries, getting desperate, and
they came back and accepted. We had already made other plans for
that  &UR; evening &LR; ,'' said McCain spokesman Todd Harris. ``We're not
going to have the fact that the Bush campaign is flailing dictate
our schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said Bush had not given the debate
sponsors an answer. ``We were trying to juggle our options,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio on Saturday, thousands of supporters turned out to see
McCain at a market and a university, and in the  &UR; evening &LR;  at a
Cincinnati bookstore, where 1,000 copies of his book flew off the
shelves, and where he stayed until about 8 p.m. to sign every last
one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours late for his flight to Virginia, McCain arrived at the
airport at about 8:30 p.m. to yet another adoring crowd of 800, who
had waited patiently on the tarmac to see him, and screamed for him
when he arrived.
</P>
<P>
   And many of the people in these crowds appear not to care about
policy or ideology. Sure, McCain is pushing his Republican
credentials with more energy than ever lately. But to many of his
supporters, all of that is irrelevant. Character is the thing, they
say.
</P>
<P>
   That incenses Christian Adams, a lawyer from Alexandria who was
at McCain's rally Sunday to protest the senator's ``hypocrisy.''
Adams was angered that McCain, who rails against special interests,
was pushing for more flights at nearby Reagan Washington National
Airport, a move that would benefit America West Airlines, a
campaign contributor. McCain has said he favors the flights in the
interest of competition, a view Adams does not buy.
</P>
<P>
   But for many of the Virginians in the crowd, who had waited over
an hour in a chilly drizzle to see McCain, such issues are
irrelevant. Ask voters what they think of McCain's stance on the
airport, which the Bush campaign is also trying to use against the
senator, and they will quote a line McCain himself uses all the
time, about telling the truth even if it's not what voters want to
hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd prefer less flights,'' said Blake Thomson, an independent
who said he will vote for McCain on Tuesday. ``But like he says,
you may not agree with him, but he's honest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are behind him because of character,'' said
Robert Stropky. ``I don't think the issues are as important for
this campaign.'' Stropky said he didn't hold the airport issue
against McCain, and thought it had no place in a national election.
</P>
<P>
   At rallies like this one, crowds invariably respond most
enthusiastically to McCain's claims that he will restore integrity
to the White House. Sunday, that claim was delivered by his wife,
Cindy, who rarely speaks publicly.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can count on John and I no matter what to represent you
with the kind of dignity and the kind of honor you expect,'' she
said.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ Richard Hidalgo never thought playing in the
major leagues would be this painful.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hidalgo, one of the jewels of the Astros' farm system, has seen
his promising big-league career put on hold the last two seasons
because of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a lot of bad luck,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During his rookie season in 1998, Hidalgo crashed into the
center-field wall at Denver's Coors Field and separated his right
shoulder. He missed nearly two months.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Last year, it was discovered that Hidalgo had a rare genetic
malformation in his left knee. It eventually required surgery and
sidelined him for the final two months.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he is counting on the third time being the charm.
</P>
<P>
   After spending the last two seasons playing mostly left and
center field, the 24-year-old Venezuelan returns to the comfort of
his natural position in right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to play a full season,'' said Hidalgo, who has missed
about 15 weeks of playing time since 1998. ``It's difficult to lose
two months. I think I can do a lot of things with a full season.''
</P>
<P>
   In only a short time, Hidalgo has showed glimpses of why the
Astros have refused to trade him when other clubs made inquiries
over the last few years. He batted .303 as a rookie, and he had 15
home runs and 56 RBIs last season before falling into a hitting
slump around the time he noticed pain in his knee in early August.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, Hidalgo underwent season-ending surgery. A
three-times-a-week rehabilitation program this offseason has
Hidalgo's left knee around 95 percent. He played eight games in the
Venezuela winter leagues. And during the first week of spring
training, he has shown no ill effects while taking live batting
practice and fielding baseballs in the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost as strong as the other knee,'' Hidalgo said.
</P>
<P>
   That's good news for the Astros, who, with the return of Moises
Alou in left field, will shift Hidalgo back to right field this
year. Roger Cedeno, acquired from the Mets in the Mike Hampton
trade, will patrol center in place of Carl Everett, who was dealt
to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``They believe in me and know what I've got,'' Hidalgo said. ``I
know I can do better. I'm focused on this season. I didn't worry
(about finding playing time). You just have to keep working hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Hidalgo has been working with hitting instructor Tom McCraw on
his bat grip to get around more quickly on pitches. Manager Larry
Dierker envisions Hidalgo eventually hitting 20 to 30 home runs and
driving in 90 to 100 runs a season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never really got going as a batter last season,'' Dierker
said. ``There is no concern whatsoever about his knee. In fact, I
think he's moving better this spring than I've ever seen him
move.''
</P>
<P>
   That should make Hidalgo even tougher to run on. Despite playing
a new position, left field, for the first time and battling knee
problems, Hidalgo was leading the National League with 15 outfield
assists when he went on the disabled list in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time we've had Richard Hidalgo playing in the outfield,
we've had a better defensive outfield than anything we could
configure without him,'' Dierker said. ``He's just an exceptional
fielder and can play all three positions. He gives us a lot of
flexibility in that regard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't really say that about any of the other outfielders
other than Glen Barker,'' Dierker said. ``Having him healthy is a
real asset to the team. When he's been out of action, we've really
missed him.''
</P>
<P>
   The growing pains have been especially tough, but Hidalgo and
his teammates see brighter days ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``You saw what he did last year banged up,'' second baseman
Craig Biggio said. ``Richard is getting older and smarter. He knows
what he is capable of doing now. He has a very high ceiling.''

SHAQ COOLS OFF AT LINE

 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A long road trip and a lack of practice time have
reduced Shaquille O'Neal's free-throw hot streak to a low simmer.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal appeared to turn the corner on his lifelong battle with
the foul shot, making 75.9 percent (41 of 54) over a four-game
stretch that extended through the first week of the Lakers' recent
road trip.
</P>
<P>
   But he's 12 for 31 (38.7 percent) over the last four games,
including 2 for 6 in Sunday's victory over the Houston Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Phil Jackson isn't concerned that O'Neal has reverted to
old, bad habits. He just needs practice time, which was at a
minimum as the Lakers traveled to six cities in nine days.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's out of synch,'' Jackson said, ``and I think he got out of
it because he wasn't practicing. He didn't have practice time. And
now he's back and he can take some time to do his practice routine,
get his in-synch kind of rhythm back again. He's coming up too soon
and then standing flat-footed and shooting his shots, rather than
having lift on them. And I think that bothers him.''
</P>
<P>
   A frustrated O'Neal agreed he needs practice time. But he's not
getting as much as he wants. The Lakers' recently opened training
facility in El Segundo is intended to provide players added
practice time, but O'Neal said he wasn't allowed in after-hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could (bleeping) get into that brand-new (bleeping)
facility that they just built, then I could get some (bleeping)
practice,'' he said. ``I can't get in that B.S. building at
night.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson asked all the players to come early to Sunday's game to
get extra shooting time. He said O'Neal needs to regain his touch
soon, as the Portland Trail Blazers are likely to foul him often on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hes got to be able to go to the line on the road and complete
them,'' Jackson said, ``so it's going to be important for him to
get his rhythm back.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch report: Kobe Bryant's 18-point first quarter dashed any
concern that his bruised left calf might affect his game, though
Bryant said it still hurts. For his part, Jackson jokingly said
he'd like to see Bryant back off the 360-degree dunks, like the one
he put in Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the body takes it pretty tough, to twist your legs
like that and to take off at an angle,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said the body ain't meant for that,'' Bryant said. ``I said
(begin ital)your(end ital) body ain't meant for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Silent treatment: After declining all interviews for a week and
a half, Glen Rice spoke briefly on NBC at halftime of Sunday's game
. However, he waved off local reporters again afterward. Rice has
not offered a reason for his silence.

   NEW YORK _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   As I was leaving my apartment to do errands one recent
afternoon, I stooped down to give a goodbye pat to Charlie, my cat.
Pop! Another button off my down coat. OK, I'd pick up some more
during my errands that day in my Village neighborhood. But where to
look? Old reliables like Woolworth's are gone, and the couple of
dry cleaners I checked _ figuring I'd have to pay $3 or more _
couldn't help. None had buttons to offer.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, I was near St. Luke's Thrift Shop. Surely it
would have something. Inside I was directed to an old shoe box
filled with hundreds of buttons in assorted sizes and shapes.
Fifteen cents for large ones, 10 cents for mediums and 5 cents for
smalls.
</P>
<P>
   What fun to pore over so many buttons, some old, some new, some
funny shapes and colors, but most simply classic and familiar. I
ran my hand through the pile. How delicious. It brought back
memories of my mother's classic Louis Sherry candy box of buttons
and tiny metal hooks and eyes (that had probably belonged to her
mother).
</P>
<P>
   Eventually I narrowed my choices to 20. I could afford to be
indulgent. I took my selections to the volunteer cashier and my
purchases came to $1.50, except _ my lucky day _ there was a
50-percent-off clearance sale. And so I got the lot for 75 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I've concluded that people should once again consider
keeping button boxes. They're too much fun not to have.

   George Rosenfeld, walking along East 65th Street, passed a man
talking on his cell phone. He heard this snippet: ``I am sorry, but
I cannot give you this information now, since I am in the middle of
an important business meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   It was early one Sunday evening and the bus was inching down
Ninth Avenue, taking about 40 minutes to cover 10 blocks. The
passengers began to strike up conversations. One man of a certain
age opened a worn black leather case. Suddenly the mellow clarinet
sounds of a perfectly rendered ``Danny Boy'' enveloped the bus.
</P>
<P>
   When an encore seemed to be in order, he turned to a woman with
a well-lined face who was holding a wooden cane. He said he would
play ``Besame Mucho'' for her if she would sing for him. And so she
did, her melodic voice accompanying his music.
</P>
<P>
   ``How did you know I was once a singer and dancer?'' she asked
when the song ended. ``I know these things,'' he said. ``I just
know.'' He then alighted from the bus and vanished into the night.

   Eunice M. Ganteaume finds that scarcely a day passes when she is
not reminded that she lives in a multiethnic city. The most recent
example was at the height of rush hour on Madison Avenue. She
spotted a delivery van whose driver was skillfully maneuvering
through heavy traffic, one hand grasping the wheel, the other
manipulating chopsticks.

   Leonard Finger's friend, Monique Van Vooren, is an animal lover
who knows all the animals in her apartment building. One of the
pets, a favorite, she called Mr. Jones in honor of his mistress.
(The name Jones is a pseudonym).
</P>
<P>
   Not too long ago, a notice was posted in the building that ``Mr.
Jones went to join the angels yesterday.'' Van Vooren wrote Mrs.
Jones extolling Mr. Jones' personality, noting how shiny and clean
he was and how frisky. She added that although it was difficult to
contemplate when a loss was fresh, her own experience indicated
that it was wise to replace a pet as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   A week later she encountered Mrs. Jones in the lobby. ``I
received your note, Miss Van Vooren,'' she said. ``It wasn't the
dog who died. It was my husband.''

   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   On my way to the doctor, I boarded a 96th Street crosstown bus
at the first stop on West End Avenue. A woman in a purple coat with
green trim was crocheting and I asked her where she got her yarn.
She told me she had bought 50 pounds at some out-of-town discount
place.
</P>
<P>
   I mentioned that I wanted to revive my interest in the craft and
she rummaged through her orange and white crocheted bag and came up
with a ball of deep purple yarn for me to start on. When I noted
that I didn't have a crochet hook, she rummaged through the bag
again and voila! By the time we were crossing Central Park I was
having my first lesson and I recalled some stitches I had learned
as a child.
</P>
<P>
   I got off at Fifth Avenue, sat in the doctor's office for over
an hour and for once didn't mind the wait _ I practiced on my
purple yarn.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   It was a northbound not-too-crowded Lexington Avenue subway
train. Jan Vilcek observed a middle-aged Asian woman entering with
a little girl, perhaps 5 _ very likely a grandmother and
granddaughter.
</P>
<P>
   The grandmother found a seat across the aisle from the little
girl, who wore sneakers with one shoelace untied. The grandmother,
speaking in either Mandarin or Cantonese, apparently, and very
audibly, explained to the child how to tie her shoelace. The
youngster made numerous efforts but couldn't manage it.
</P>
<P>
   When the train reached the 59th Street stop, a young man got in,
sat next to the girl and tried to help her tie the shoelace. The
grandmother screamed ``No'' and the young man gave up. The
grandmother kept on instructing and the child kept on trying, all
in vain. At the next stop, the grandmother moved to an empty seat
next to the girl and demonstrated how to tie the knot, but stopped
short of actually securing the lace.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the youngster succeeded. The passengers in the car,
most of whom could see, and all of whom were able to hear what was
going on, erupted in applause.
</P>
<P>
   Scene: Elevator at Citibank, Fifth Avenue and 13th Street.
</P>
<P>
   Players: Alice La Prelle, ready to push button, and elderly
well-dressed woman, entering hastily.
</P>
<P>
   La Prelle, politely: ``Which floor?''
</P>
<P>
   Elderly woman, lifting her skirt: ``It doesn't matter. I'm here
to pull up my tights.''

JOHN HELIKER, 91, VERSATILE PAINTER AND TEACHER 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ROBERTA SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Heliker, a painter and teacher who was a fixture of the New
York art world for nearly seven decades, died on Feb. 22 at the
Sonojee Estate, a health center in Bar Harbor, Maine. He was 91 and
had lived in New York during most of his career, spending summers
on Cranberry Island, Maine
</P>
<P>
   Heliker's art moved from representation to near abstraction and
back again with an ease that seemed more European than American.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Yonkers in 1909, he grew up on a farm. In 1923 he
dropped of high school and began visiting Manhattan to copy the old
masters at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   There he met Arshile Gorky, who was doing the same thing and who
introduced him to the work of Manet, Cezanne and Gauguin. From 1927
to 1929 he attended the Art Students League, studying with Kenneth
Hayes Miller, Boardman Robinson and Thomas Hart Benton.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1930s Heliker concentrated on landscapes that had some of
the stony, Cezannesque density of Marsden Hartley's, but he also
painted portraits and interiors.
</P>
<P>
   He moved to Greenwich Village from his parents' farm in 1938,
and through his neighbor, the composer Lou Harrison, he became good
friends with Merce Cunningham and John Cage.
</P>
<P>
   His first solo exhibitions were at the Maynard Walker Gallery in
New York in 1936, 1938 and 1940. After it closed he became
affiliated with the Kraushaar Galleries, where he had 18 shows from
1945 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
   His 19th show, a survey of drawings that has been planned for
some time, will open at Kraushaar on March 18.
</P>
<P>
   In 1948 a Prix de Rome enabled Heliker to go to Italy, which
made a lasting impression on his work and where he began a long
friendship with the painter Philip Guston, who had received the
same award. As with Guston, he was liberated by Italy's light,
landscape and history and, paradoxically, moved his work toward
abstraction.
</P>
<P>
   By 1951, the year he received a Guggenheim fellowship that
enabled him to spend an additional two summers in Italy, he was
making nearly abstract paintings, works whose layered, transparent
geometries suggested the fusions of landscapes and architecture
accomplished in real life by the hill towns of Italy. Beginning in
the mid-1950's his work became progressively softer, more painterly
and more representational, although it always retained a clarity of
light and structure that tended to transcend his imagery.
</P>
<P>
   He worked in a seemingly improvisational style, defining
landscapes, figures and still lifes in quick, stabbing brush works
and bits of drawn line. This carefully structured yet notational
style may have been its best in his spare, light-filled drawings.
</P>
<P>
   Heliker was a professor of art at Columbia University for 27
years, beginning in 1950. His students there included the artists
Charles Cajori, Sally Hazelet Drummond, Jonathan Silver, Robert La
Hotan and Angelo Ippolito, as well as the historian Karen Wilkin
and the critic Jed Perl. In 1965 he was a founding member of the
New York Studio School with Guston, Leland Bell, Alex Katz,
Nicholas Carone and Mercedes Matter. He taught there for a number
of years and frequently returned as visiting artist. He also taught
at the Art Students League and Parsons-New School.
</P>
<P>
   Heliker's work can be found in 75 public institutions throughout
the United States and was the subject of a retrospective at the
Whitney Museum of American Art in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by La Hotan, his companion of 48 years.

PHONE DEAL IN HONG KONG SAID TO GET A NEW PLAYER
</HEADLINE>
 (SUBS 1st and 5th grafs with agreement; DELETES last 2 grafs to
conform.)  
(nk) 
 By MARK LANDLER with ANDREW ROSS SORKIN 
  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation has agreed to make
a $1 billion investment in Singapore Telecommunications, which
could enable it to sweeten its offer for Hong Kong's dominant
telephone company, Cable &AMP; Wireless HKT Ltd., executives close to
the negotiations said Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The emergence of a new player came after a board meeting of the
Hong Kong company's British parent, Cable and Wireless PLC, in
London on Sunday, at which the directors were presented with
competing bids from Singapore Telecommunications and Pacific
Century Cyberworks, a Hong Kong start-up.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Century proposed to acquire Cable and Wireless HKT in a
stock-and-cash offer that values the company at $35 billion,
executives close to the talks said. Singapore Telecom's offer was
slightly lower than that, although the cash portion of its bid was
potentially larger, people briefed on the offer said.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Century also made an all-stock offer worth $38.5
billion, but executives involved in the discussions said it was not
likely to be accepted. Cable and Wireless has pressed Pacific
Century to offer more cash.
</P>
<P>
   The Cable and Wireless board meeting ended without a decision on
Sunday night, and with the News Corp. added to the mix, the battle
for Hong Kong's phone company seems to be turning into a global,
multifront corporate war.
</P>
<P>
   Executives close to Singapore Telecommunications said that as
part of its $1 billion investment, News Corporation would set up an
Internet, television, and mobile telephone joint venture in
Singapore similar to the one it announced late last year with Cable
&AMP; Wireless HKT. If the Singapore company merged with its Hong Kong
counterpart, the joint venture with News would become a region-wide
service, serving nearly 1 million Internet subscribers in the two
cities.
</P>
<P>
   In the short run, however, Murdoch's involvement would enable
Singapore Telecommunications to increase its cash offer to Cable
and Wireless, which is currently about $6.4 billion for the
company's 54.4 percent stake in HKT.
</P>
<P>
   The bidding war for Cable and Wireless HKT has riveted Asia,
because it is the first takeover battle of the Internet age here
and because it pits the archrivals Hong Kong and Singapore against
each other. Singapore Telecommunications is controlled by the
Singapore government, while Pacific Century was started by Richard
Li, the 33-year-old son of Li Ka-shing, Hong Kong's mightiest
tycoon.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Li barged into merger negotiations between Singapore
Telecom and Cable and Wireless two weeks ago when he announced that
he wanted to acquire Cable and Wireless HKT. Since then, Li has
raised $1 billion through a share placement and roughly $10 billion
in loans from a consortium of banks, including the Bank of China
and HSBC Holdings.
</P>
<P>
   HSBC's role could prove contentious. Executives close to
Singapore Telecommunications said the company was considering suing
HSBC for conflict of interest because its investment banking arm
had advised Cable and Wireless HKT. According to Singapore Telecom,
that gave HSBC access to HKT's internal financial documents, which
it could use to help Pacific Century.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for HSBC, David Hall, declined to comment on a
potential lawsuit, saying the bank had not been contacted by
Singapore Telecommunications or its lawyers. But he said, ``We wish
to make it absolutely clear that at all times, we have acted
properly in our dealings with Cable and Wireless HKT.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives close to HSBC said the London-based bank had resigned
as an adviser to Cable and Wireless HKT last week. The threat of a
lawsuit by Singapore Telecom seemed calculated to sow doubt among
board members of Cable and Wireless about the soundness of Pacific
Century's financing.
</P>
<P>
   Although Singapore Telecom would seem to have more financial
leverage than Pacific Century, it is handicapped by political
considerations. Neither the Hong Kong government nor the mainland
Chinese have welcomed the prospect of a Singapore company taking
over Hong Kong's phone company.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers in Hong Kong reported over the weekend that China
Telecom, which owns 10.7 percent of Cable and Wireless HKT, would
vote to accept Pacific Century's offer. China Telecom is the Hong
Kong-based arm of China's state telephone company and is controlled
by Beijing.

EDITORIAL: THE NEXT LEADER OF THE IMF 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Feb. 28:
</P>
<P>
   The International Monetary Fund, the guardian of global
financial stability, will soon select its next director. Unhappily,
and true to form, it is proceeding in secret, with little
opportunity for the public to appraise the leading candidates or
their views on critical questions about the future of the fund. The
lack of openness is intolerable for one of the world's most
influential organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The fund's primary mission is to stamp out currency crises like
those that struck Korea, Thailand and Russia in recent years. In
exchange for a bailout, the fund extracts commitments by
beleaguered countries to change their monetary, fiscal, banking and
other economic policies to the liking of the fund.
</P>
<P>
   Critics accuse the fund of overreaching. It intervenes in dozens
of countries, only some of which are in immediate financial
turmoil, to fight poverty or to help shift their economies from
socialism to capitalism. The fund's mixed record of success has led
powerful members of Congress to ask whether the fund should leave
issues of poverty and development to the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   There are also important questions about whether the fund should
bail out fewer countries, pour less money into bankrupt nations,
impose less onerous conditions on its loans or lift the debt of
poverty-stricken societies.
</P>
<P>
   The next director will face these and many other difficult
issues. Yet not one of the three top candidates has adequately
described in public how he would handle them or made clear whether
he would try to lead the fund in new directions.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Fischer, deputy director of the fund and a former
chairman of the the economics department at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, has been endorsed by several African and
Arab countries. He is widely respected for his intelligence, policy
acumen, experience and commitment to helping poor countries.
</P>
<P>
   If Fischer is prepared to rethink some of the fund's policies,
and can shake free of the customs of an institution that he has
helped lead since 1994, he would almost certainly be the best man
for the job. The White House, which would doubtless like to see
Fischer installed as director, cannot openly support him. The
reason is an outdated gentlemen's agreement among nations that a
European should run the IMF while an American manages the World
Bank.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, the leading European candidate is Caio
Koch-Weser, deputy finance minister of Germany and a former
official at the World Bank. Though he was effective at the World
Bank, his leadership skills and qualifications to run the fund are
questionable.
</P>
<P>
   The third candidate, Eisuke Sakakibara, a former vice minister
of finance in Japan, is a sophisticated financial expert, but he
has a parochial view of many global economic issues. He long
extolled the superiority of Japanese economic institutions, even as
his country sank into a decade-long hibernation.
</P>
<P>
   The European members of the fund may decide as early as Monday
to back Koch-Weser. The governing board of the IMF could take a
straw vote of its official candidates as early as this week. This
is much too hasty. Whatever else the fund does in days ahead, it
must shed the secrecy that surrounds its deliberations. The best
place to begin is by opening up the process of selecting its next
director.

YAHOO AND MURDOCH SAID TO BE IN TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The News Corp., the holding company for Rupert Murdoch's media
empire, and Yahoo Inc., the giant Internet portal, are discussing
an alliance that could include stock investments in each other's
operations, according to News Corp. executives close to the talks.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies are interested in joining forces to counter
the recently announced merger of America Online and Time Warner.
But the executives said any deal was probably weeks away at best.
</P>
<P>
   A report published in the most recent New Yorker said that the
talks envisioned ``a wide-ranging alliance'' providing Yahoo with
access to the Fox News Channel and News Corp.-owned newspapers like
The Times of London and The New York Post. News Corp. in turn would
gain credibility for its recently announced effort to use its
extensive satellite networks to deliver Internet services to
consumers along with its television programming.
</P>
<P>
   It is likely that any deal would include cross investments by
Yahoo and the News Corp. although neither investment would come
close to a controlling interest, the New Yorker report said.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Yang, the 31-year-old co-founder of Yahoo, and Peter
Chernin, president and chief operating officer of News Corp., have
held several meetings, the News Corp. executives said.
</P>
<P>
   Yang and Chernin could not be reached for comment. But a News
Corp. executive said that Yahoo was one of many companies the News
Corp. had been talking with in light of its announcement two weeks
ago that it planned to create a separate venture for its satellite
properties. At that time, he noted, the company said it would be
looking for partners that would invest in the venture and work with
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no agreement near with anybody,'' the executive said.
``Nothing has been nailed down.''
</P>
<P>
   Bankers and analysts said that no one would be surprised if a
substantial alliance emerged. ``Everyone has been talking to
everyone since AOL-Time Warner,'' said an investment banker
actively involved in the media industry.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo has already showed signs of rethinking its future since
America Online and Time Warner announced their deal. Where the
company Yang and David Filo created just six years ago once viewed
itself as a kind of Switzerland of the Internet, a neutral portal
through which all kinds of content providers could pass, it
recently has been moving to create content of its own, including a
financial news broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great content will win over time,'' Yang said on Sunday night
when questioned during a discussion at Stanford University on the
Internet's future about what will determine which of the many paths
to the Internet consumers will use.
</P>
<P>
   But creating content is a high-risk enterprise. Linking up with
Murdoch's empire might be a quicker and less expensive route toward
recreating Yahoo as a recognized source for specialized news and
services. The News Corp.'s digital media subsidiary, which is based
in New York, already provides some content to Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talking with the News Corporation is another indication that
their perception of what they need to survive is changing,'' said
Robert Enderle, an analyst for the Giga Information Group.

BRADLEY LAMENTS LACK OF SUPPORT FROM BLACKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ As Bill Bradley gasps for breath in his faltering race
for the White House, nothing pains him more than his unrequited
appeal to black America.
</P>
<P>
   He wishes black voters could have seen him in 1960, as he
trundled across the back roads of Illinois, so hungry that he
finally asked his traveling companion why they could not stop to
eat. His companion and family friend, Alex Maul, explained that no
one would serve them. Maul was black.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said he might not be facing the humiliating possibility
of losing 18 straight Democratic primary contests if he could throw
open a window on the intimate connection he has nurtured since
childhood with the grief and glory of the black experience in
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing because I think everybody should be able to
see the depth of my convictions,'' Bradley said in an interview.
``But that's not always the way it works in life. Those things you
hold most dear are not always recognized in the context of the
times in which you live, and it's very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has all but pleaded with black voters to see why he has
staked his bid for the presidency on a pledge to tear down the
nation's wall of ``white skin privilege.'' He renewed the appeal
Sunday in a black church in Seattle, as he sought last-minute
support for Tuesday's nonbinding primary in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But few blacks have flocked to Bradley, denying him the crucial
support he may need to survive the decisive round of 16 primaries
and caucuses on March 7. He already has lost the first three
primary contests, and a shutout on March 7 would almost certainly
end his campaign, securing the nomination for Vice President Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the reasons the numbers are where they are,''
Bradley said of his inability to attract black support.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said he wishes black voters could have seen him as a
teenager, weary after a baseball tournament in southwestern
Missouri and searching with his teammates for a place to sleep. One
hotel after another refused to accept two players because they were
black. And each time Bradley led away the entire team in protest.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also said he hopes it is not too late for the black
community to grasp the outrage he felt as a member of the New York
Knicks in the 1970s when four whites pummeled his black teammate,
Earl ``The Pearl'' Monroe, near Madison Square Garden because
Monroe was accompanied by a white woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two hours after Earl thrills 20,000 people with his skill and
reaps significant financial gains for doing so, he is just another
`nigger' to part of white America _ even a half block from center
court,'' Bradley wrote in anger at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Celtics great Bill Russell, who has spent much of his
life detecting, deflecting and denouncing racism, recalled testing
the authenticity of Bradley's racial sensibilities the first time
they met, in 1966. Russell, an 11-time NBA champion, was about to
become the league's first black coach, and Bradley was poised to
enter the league as a ``great white hope'' after studying as a
Rhodes scholar at Oxford.
</P>
<P>
   Russell confronted Bradley about his Oxford experience, asking
if he knew ``the black history'' of Cecil Rhodes, the scholarship's
founder. A British colonialist in the late 19th century, Rhodes ran
a mining conglomerate that for decades controlled much of southern
Africa. In 1923, the country Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, was named for
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew what he was saying to me,'' Bradley recalled of
Russell's query. ``He was talking about taking a Rhodes scholarship
from a racist diamond miner.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell has stood by Bradley since then. ``He knew the right
answer,'' Russell said in an interview. ``But, more importantly, he
has lived a life of complete and total integrity. That's why all
the guys respect him and like him,'' Russell said, referring to
Bradley's basketball colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley spent 10 years with the New York Knicks, playing with
many black players who had come of age in the segregated South or
northern ghettos.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days, Bradley's black teammates often tested him,
taunted him, treated him with the diminished respect they might
have received as intruders in a predominantly white group. The
captain, Willis Reed, spurned Bradley's pleas to call him ``Bill,''
calling him ``Bradley'' instead. Others called him ``Dollar Bill''
for his penny pinching, and they mocked his rumpled, tweedy
wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   One teammate, Cazzie Russell, once viewed Bradley as a
beneficiary of the white ownership's racial bias. Bradley and
Russell were waging an intense competition for a starting position,
a job that Bradley won when Russell was forced from the lineup with
a broken ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Russell filled in when Bradley was sidelined with an
injury. But unlike Bradley, who had stayed in the starting lineup
when Russell recovered from his injury, Russell was sent back to
the bench when Bradley healed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt a little forsaken, and the first thing that came to
mind was, they were giving Bradley the job because he's white,''
said Russell, now the men's basketball coach at Savannah College of
Art and Design. ``I thought, What about me? I've got feelings. I've
got a heart that pumps blood, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell, who is also a minister, said he no longer believes race
played a role in the episode.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Russell is among many black athletes who have praised
Bradley for forgoing hundreds of thousands of dollars in
endorsement offers because Bradley believed the bulk of the
opportunities flowed his way because he was white.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also tapped his NBA earnings to form a nonprofit group,
the Back Forty, to help prepare inmates for life outside prison.
And he spent off-seasons tutoring students at a street academy in
Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned so much from teammates about the strength of their
character, the dedication of their families, and their belief in
hard work,'' Bradley said. ``But I also realized how much I would
never know what it was like to be black in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Calvin Hill, the former Dallas Cowboys running back and father
of NBA star Grant Hill, visited Harlem in the 1960s and asked
community leaders which Knicks volunteered time there. ``I was
surprised I didn't hear any of the black names,'' Hill said. ``But
Bill's name always came up.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill said he recently attended his aunt's funeral in Cross
Hills, S.C., a predominantly black farm town where he grew up. ``It
dawned on me in that black Baptist church that Bill Bradley has
been to a place like this,'' Hill said. ``He could walk up the
steps on any porch in the community and be comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   The trouble for Bradley is too few blacks know his story. A vast
number, particularly women, give little or no weight to his support
among black athletes. And far too many others are aligned with
Gore, largely because of his association with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Gore received a much more rousing reception than Bradley did
Saturday night at an NAACP dinner in Seattle. The audience politely
applauded Bradley's recollections of his personal struggle against
racial hatred, but they cheered Gore as he trumpeted the Clinton
administration's commitment to race relations.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the most intimate personal experience with
racial justice that Gore related was his father's politically
costly opposition to segregationist policies as a Tennessee senator
in the 1950s. ``I'm honored to have that heritage in my family,''
Gore said to applause. ``You know, when something is in your bones,
it's different from having it in your head.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley believes it's in his heart and soul. And, still, despite
Michael Jordan's commercials endorsing him, Bradley remains a
stranger to black America.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just don't know me,'' Bradley said. ``But it never stops
moving me in terms of how stupid racial division is, how many
missed opportunities we've had, and how often I think, Why can't
everybody see it the way I see it?''
</P>

 BUSH SAYS HE REGRETS BOB JONES UNIVERSITY VISIT
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Abruptly dropping his defense of a visit to Bob
Jones University earlier this month, Governor George W. Bush Sunday
expressed remorse for his failure to speak out at the time against
anti-Catholic views voiced by school officials, calling the event a
``missed opportunity causing needless offense, which I deeply
regret.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Cardinal John O'Connor, leader of the 2.4
million-member archdiocese of New York, Bush said he regretted not
distancing himself more clearly from the anti-Catholic views. The
letter, sent 11 days before the New York primary, followed weeks of
attacks by Bush's chief opponent for the Republican presidential
nomination, Senator John S. McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``On reflection, I should have been more clear in disassociating
myself from anti-Catholic sentiments and racial prejudice,'' said
the letter, mailed Friday. Bush repeated his regret at a news
conference in Austin Sunday before leaving to campaign in
Washington state, an aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's Feb. 2 appearance at the South Carolina school, in which
he was introduced as a man who ``deeply loves the Lord,'' followed
by one day his crushing defeat in the New Hampshire primary, and
was seen at the time as an overt bid for support from the
evangelical Christian community. Bush spoke almost exclusively
about his conservative values, mentioning the word ``conservative''
six times in a single minute, and did not address the school's
policy of banning interracial dating, or its founder's description
of Roman Catholicism as a ``Satanic cult.''
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, Bush faced intense criticism for the visit.
</P>
<P>
   Under fire, he told reporters he was unaware of the school's
policies. He defended his views as separate from those of the
university, citing his record of inclusion as Texas governor and
invoking his brother and sister-in-law, both of whom are Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush was unable to neutralize the controversy as he headed
into Michigan, home of many Catholics. The McCain campaign later
used the Bob Jones appearance as material for a campaign script,
telephoning thousands of Michigan residents to tell them the views
the school espouses, and of Bush's appearance. McCain won in
Michigan on Feb. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, Bush refused to admit he had made a mistake. As
recently as last week, Bush said: ``I don't make any apologies for
what I do in the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   But by last Friday, having ``thought long and hard about this
matter,'' Bush had become ``deeply troubled by impressions'' that
he endorsed the views of the school, spokesman Ari Fleischer said.
He chose to express that sentiment directly to Cardinal O'Connor
because the two are friends, Fleischer said. Earlier this year,
Bush met with O'Connor and ``specifically discussed anti-Catholic
bigotry,'' he said. In the Feb. 25 letter, no mention was made of
the March 7 New York primary, which could prove crucial in deciding
the Republican presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone should be cited for religious divisiveness, Bush aides
said Sunday, it should be McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears John McCain is intent on reversing one of the great
accomplishments of John F. Kennedy, which is an end to the politics
of religious division,'' Fleischer said. ``It's a real step back in
time.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, Democrats in both the House and the Senate hope to
introduce resolutions condemning Bob Jones University for what
Democrats are calling bigoted and racist views. Bush has not said
whether he will back those resolutions. But, Fleischer said,
``Obviously, the governor has repudiated the anti-Catholic and
anti-interracial dating policies of Bob Jones, so he supports
anything that repudiates them.''

EDITORIAL: FORFEITURES AND FAIRNESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Feb. 27:
</P>
<P>
   The civil forfeiture laws that allow the government to
confiscate the property of narcotics dealers even in the absence of
a criminal conviction have proved to be a valuable weapon against
wealthy drug dealers, some of whom fear losing their money more
than they fear prison. But the laws have also spawned a growing
number of cases in which people guilty of no wrongdoing have had
their assets seized _ giving rise to civil liberties concerns, as
well as a promising reform movement in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   There is now widespread agreement that the forfeiture rules tilt
too far in favor of government power. To justify a seizure, law
enforcement officials need only make a showing of ``probable
cause'' that the property is subject to forfeiture, an easy
standard to meet. The burden then shifts to the property owner to
prove that the seized property was not illegally used or acquired.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, the House overwhelmingly approved a measure that
would shift the burden of proof to the government, where it
belongs. It was sponsored by Rep. Henry Hyde, the chairman of the
House Judiciary Committee, and Rep. John Conyers Jr., the
committee's ranking Democrat _ two lawmakers who rarely agree.
Their bill would permit forfeitures only if the government could
show by ``clear and convincing evidence'' that the property figured
in a crime.
</P>
<P>
   A similar reform measure backed by the leaders of the Senate
Judiciary Committee, Sen. Orrin Hatch, its Republican chairman, and
Sen. Patrick Leahy, its ranking Democrat, is now pending before the
committee. It would sensibly set the evidentiary bar for the
government somewhat lower than the House, allowing forfeitures
based on ``a preponderance of the evidence'' _ the standard that
applies generally in all civil cases. Some of its other worthy
provisions borrow from the House bill. These include new
protections for innocent owners, court-appointed counsel for at
least some indigent owners and abolition of the unreasonable
requirement that property owners pay a bond for the privilege of
challenging a seizure.
</P>
<P>
   A competing version put forward by Sen. Jeff Sessions, the
Alabama Republican, and Sen. Charles Schumer, the New York
Democrat, is favored by the justice department. It also embraces
the sound ``preponderance of evidence'' standard, but is too
forfeiture-friendly in other respects. For example, it retains the
bond requirement for claimants, and would allow the government to
demand that owners produce documents even before any civil
complaint has been filed against them or the government has
articulated its reason for suspecting wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, none of the proposals address the impetus for
abuse created by the current scheme for sharing forfeiture proceeds
between federal authorities and local police. Still, there is a
chance now to strike a better balance between legitimate law
enforcement needs and protection of individual rights. It should
not be missed.

FARNHAM PROVIDES SPIRIT FOR BRUINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Losers of six of seven, on the brink of NCAA
Tournament elimination, desperate and discouraged and searching for
help, the UCLA Bruins turned to ... (begin ital)Sean Farnham?(end
ital)
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Sean Farnham, the ebullient senior forward with modest
skills and irrepressible spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Bruins coach Steve Lavin inserted Farnham into the starting
lineup against the Oregon schools and removed slumping forward
Jerome Moiso. Although his numbers weren't impressive (five points,
four rebounds), Farnham provided a much-needed passion injection.
</P>
<P>
   After their weekend sweep, the Bruins improved to 10-1 with
Farnham in the lineup in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's our leprechaun,'' Lavin said, smiling. ``Well, not
really. He just does the simple things well.''
</P>
<P>
   For Farnham, a former walk-on who has played sparingly most of
his career, the timing couldn't be better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have gotten down,'' he said. ``There were four games
in a row (a few weeks ago) that I didn't see the court, and we
weren't performing well. But I kept my head up. It's been great to
get starts in two of my last four games in Pauley Pavilion.''
</P>
<P>
   Positive pine time: Moiso had no objection to his new role. In
fact, he enjoys being a reserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``It allows him to watch things and he gets more comfortable,''
Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   Moiso had 16 points and eight rebounds against Oregon State, his
best game in weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The spring is back: UCLA's grueling schedule might ultimately
propel the Bruins into the NCAA Tournament. But in one instance -
playing at Syracuse on a Sunday, rather than a Saturday - it did
them more harm than good.
</P>
<P>
   With a Saturday game, the Bruins would have returned that night,
taken Sunday off, then had full practices Monday and Tuesday before
leaving for Arizona State on Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they got home late Sunday night, took Monday off, then
crammed everything into Tuesday and an abbreviated workout
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's suicide to play that game in Syracuse, on a Sunday, with
a road trip the following week,'' a Pac-10 coach said. ``That takes
a lot out of you.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins had little choice in the matter; CBS set the date. To
their credit, they did not use heavy legs as an excuse for the
debacle in Tempe. But there's no doubt they looked refreshed
against the Oregon schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did play three road games in a week,'' guard Earl Watson
said. ``Maybe that took a little out of us. I'm not sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Moving up: UCLA climbed to 37th in the latest Sagarin power
ratings and 29th in the latest RPI rankings.
</P>
<P>
   But take note, Bruin fans: The RPI approximates the ratings used
by the NCAA Selection committee; it does not duplicate. For
instance, Kentucky is No. 2 in the latest RPI, which corresponds to
one of the four No. 1 seeds in the tournament. But there's no
chance the eight-loss Wildcats will be a top seed.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, UCLA's lofty ranking does not guarantee an
at-large bid.
</P>
<P>
   And finally: A ruling on JaRon Rush's appeal is expected today.

GORE, BRADLEY CAMPAIGN HEAVILY IN WASHINGTON STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Vice President Al Gore bonded with Boeing strikers and
bashed health-care insurers Sunday, treating his 14th visit to
Washington since the 1996 election as a primary eve chance to put
away the Democratic challenge of former New Jersey Sen. Bill
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, with the state party apparatus and leading politicians
behind him, fired back at Bradley, who has attacked Gore's record,
consistency and credibility on issues of abortion rights, gun
control and campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Bradley has stepped down to the level of personal
vilification, and I will not follow him into that,'' Gore said
during an interview Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president did appear curiously grateful to Bradley for
pressing the fight. ``I think the competition has been good for me
in helping me become a far better candidate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also tested themes for the general election, criticizing
Republican candidate Gov. George W. Bush for his environmental
record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under George W. Bush's stewardship, Texas has become number
one of the 50 states _ number one in polluting the air, the water
and the land,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore-Bradley contest in Tuesday's primary is merely a beauty
contest, with no delegates at stake.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley needs a showing that will shine national attention
on his campaign with big primaries in California, New York, Ohio
and Massachusetts next week. He has campaigned in Washington for
the past six days, using speeches, radio ads and mailings to
criticize Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spent much of the weekend campaigning to see that Bradley
doesn't get the traction he needs. Each of the Democratic
candidates has spent an estimated $400,000 on media here, according
to state Democratic chairman Paul Berendt.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who also stopped to show solidarity with striking
Boeing workers, on Sunday delivered one of his most personal and
deeply felt speeches of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The former New York Knicks forward told an overflow congregation
at the First African Methodist Episcopal Church how he learned
about racial discrimination in the 1950s when his Little League
baseball team was thrown out of restaurants because the catcher and
left fielder were black.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley talked of how he was ``stunned'' at the New York jury
verdict Friday that acquitted four white police officers in the
shooting death of Amadou Diallo, an immigrant from West Africa. The
officers fired 41 bullets, 19 of which struck Diallo. They claimed
Diallo appeared to be reaching for a gun. It turned out to be his
wallet.
</P>
<P>
   ``What that experience says to me is that this is a tragedy, but
there is a deeper tragedy we must solve,'' Bradley said. He
identified the problem as racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``A wallet in the hand of a white man looks like a wallet (to a
police officer),'' Bradley said. ``A wallet in the hand of a black
man looks like a gun.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Sunday, Gore was running as both the candidate of good
economic times, and as a tough Mr. Fix It. He fixed on the medical
crisis facing one Everett, Wash., family, calling for Congress to
enact a patient's bill of rights and bashing a major American
health insurer.
</P>
<P>
   Before a rally at Franklin High School here, Gore met with Dylan
and Christine Malone, whose six-month-old son, Ian, suffered severe
birth injuries. With the Malones' consent, Gore made public their
emergency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kid can't swallow,'' Gore told the rally. ``His lungs fill
with fluid. He requires around the clock nursing care. Right now,
his life is at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   The family's insurance company, Aetna, has refused to pay for
the boy's nursing care. The boy's 12 hours of daily nursing care
will end March 2. Aetna will provide eight hours of care a day
through mid-March, after which Ian will receive no skilled care at
all. The cost of nursing runs to $200 a day.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had a message for Aetna. ``Don't do this! Don't do this!''
he shouted. ``Don't cut off this child's coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Give 'em hell, Al!'' shouted one of the 500 supporters, mainly
union members, who cheered Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Dylan Malone said he had faxed a newspaper article about Dylan
to the vice president's office, and received a call requesting that
he meet with Gore. ``He was honestly moved,'' said Malone, a
graphic artist. ``He said he would contact Aetna personally and put
pressure on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Ian has become an accidental poster child for a health care
bill of rights, fine,'' added the young father. ``I don't want him
to become a martyr.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Norm Dicks, D-Wash., a friend of Gore's for 24 years,
Sunday described Gore and Bill Clinton as ``a tremendous
partnership.''
</P>
<P>
   During his weekend visit, the somewhat guarded Gore showed what
he has learned about images and symbols of politics from the
outgoing Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bradley and Gore talked Saturday night to an NAACP dinner
in Seattle. They each defended affirmative action. Each decried
Republican candidates for failing to take a stand against flying
the Confederate battle flag from the South Carolina statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, however, was able to point to a woman named Donna Brazile
in the audience, and declare: ``She is the first African-American
presidential campaign manager in the history of campaigns.'' A
beaming Brazile received a standing ovation and more cheers than
her candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president has also used his powers of office to help
what is a must-win state for Democrats in November. Talking about
how Gore has ``delivered for Washington,'' Dicks delivered a litany
of federal spending projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked him to put $100 million for West Coast salmon into
the budget,'' Dicks said. ``The money went into the budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has spent the past week dwelling on what the
Clinton-Gore administration has not done. He has stressed, for
instance, that there are 44 million Americans without health
insurance _ more than when the Democrats took over the White House.
He has decried lack of action on campaign finance reform,
describing special interest money as a ``wall'' that blocks
Americans' access to political leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to have a cold mountain stream flow through Washington
(D.C.) and carry away the corruption,'' Bradley has told audiences
around the state.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has also hammered at Gore's record as a senator and
congressman from Tennessee, notably Gore's support for amendments
restricting federal funding of abortions, and pro-gun votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at Al Gore in the past, and Al Gore in the
present, it is hard to know where his convictions lie,'' Bradley
has told audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Gore fired back Sunday, lifting a vote that Bradley cast for a
package of spending reductions in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't vote for Ronald Reagan's budget cuts and then
campaign like Robert Kennedy,'' he told backers at Franklin High.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's challenge has brought about a spate of furious
finger-pointing and letter writing in the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Led by state chairman Berendt, the Democratic establishment has
accused Bradley of running a campaign of ``personal attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing to Bradley, Dicks told the former senator: ``While you
talk about keeping our environment clean, your negative radio ads,
and now your misleading direct mail pieces pollute Washington
airwaves and mailboxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's campaign has fired back, accusing the state Democratic
party of violating a pledge of neutrality. ``You have complained
publicly of the need to not divide the party: Why not start with
yourself?'' Walt Bowen, Thurston County Democratic chairman, wrote
to Berendt.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has tried to stay above the fray. ``I knew from the
beginning that I was up against entrenched power,'' he said in an
interview, ``but just before the primary I am not about to pick a
fight with the state Democratic Party.''

   &UR; INTERNATIONAL _ (Moved in ``i'' category)  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   HEZBOLLAH-FUTURE (Beirut, Lebanon) _ Hezbollah has much to
celebrate these days. Prime Minister Ehud Barak's commitment to
withdraw Israel's 1,000-man contingent from southern Lebanon by
July 7 has opened the way for Hezbollah to declare itself the lone
Arab force ever to ``defeat'' Israeli forces. But nothing has been
simple in Lebanese politics since the country began to deconstruct
in the mid-1970s, and Hezbollah's moment of triumph could also be
prelude to a painful transition for the Islamic group. By John F.
Burns.
</P>
<P>
   COLOMBIA-TALKS (Bogota, Colombia) _ Officially, peace talks
between the Colombian government and the largest rebel group are
stalled, with no date set for them to resume. Yet just the other
day, the government's chief negotiator boasted that ``we have
advanced further this month than in 40 years of conflict.'' That
apparent paradox is the result of an unusual new twist to efforts
to negotiate an end to a civil conflict that has killed 35,000
Colombians in the past decade. By Larry Rohter.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-CULT (Yokohama, Japan) _ It is not easy to visit the new
leader of the embattled Aum Shinrikyo religious cult who has been
holed up in the sect's branch office here since being released from
prison late last year. Visitors must pass through dozens of riot
police, submit to a body search, and often endure the heckling of
angry Japanese mobs that gather to denounce the cult, which was
behind the nerve gas attack that killed 12 people in the Tokyo
subways five years ago. By Calvin Sims.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL _ GENERAL (Moved in ``a'' category) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   NY-PUERTO-RICANS (New York) _ Being Latino in New York City used
to mean being Puerto Rican. But over the last decade, the number of
Puerto Rican New Yorkers decreased for the first time since they
began arriving in the city in great numbers 60 years ago. Experts
say the decline is destined to continue. By Mireya Navarro.

<P>
   LARAMIE-PLAY (Denver) _ A play called ``The Laramie Project,''
based on the Matthew Shepard case, opened in Denver on Saturday
night, and many in the audience were people who were characters in
the play and residents of the Wyoming town where the gay college
student was murdered. By Michael Janofsky.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CAMPAIGN _ (Moved in ``p'' category) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   REPUBS-CALIF (Pasadena, Calif.) _ As the presidential campaign
moves to the biggest states, George W. Bush and John McCain are
battling squarely for the biggest prize of all: California, whose
once-mighty Republican Party propelled Richard Nixon and Ronald
Reagan to the White House but has languished and feuded for much of
the 1990s as President Clinton and the Democrats came to dominate
the state. By Todd S. Purdum.

</P>
<P>
   CAMPAIGN-MEDIA (Seattle) _ With limited resources and a
staggering media challenge _ getting their messages out in 17
states holding primaries in the next nine days _ the four leading
Republicans and Democrats in the race for president are engaged in
a feverish hopscotch of the nation, targeting television markets in
certain states, bypassing others and relying to an even larger
extent than before on the ``free media'' supplied by the press to
make their cases. By Peter Marks.
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY-WASH (Seattle) _ Everyone says it's over, but Bill
Bradley has once again found his voice and hit his stride in the
unlikely battleground of Washington state. By James Dao.
</P>
<P>
   GORE-WASH (Redmond, Wash.) _ Washington state, which will
account for only 2.2 percent of the delegates at the Democratic
National Convention this year, has unexpectedly emerged as a
battleground for the two men seeking the party's presidential
nomination, and Al Gore spent much of the weekend here trying to
make sure Bill Bradley would have nothing to show for his huge
investment of time and energy in the state's presidential primary
on Tuesday. By Robert Pear.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-ASSESS (Washington) _ Gov. George W. Bush touched all the
right bases Sunday in expressing regret to Cardinal John O'Connor
of New York over his journey to Bob Jones University: the cardinal
is the de facto leader of the Roman Catholic Church in the United
States and he is widely respected across religious lines. Bush was
determined to muffle the outcry before crucial primaries in New
York, California, Illinois and other states with large Catholic
constituencies. And the Texas governor sent a signal to voters _
and his contributors _ that he is not too high and mighty to admit
a blunder. But there was one big problem: Bush's turnabout may have
come about 24 days too late. By Richard L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WASHINGTON _ (Moved in ``w'' category)  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   AMTRAK-NEW-ROUTES _ After years of trying to balance its books
by cutting service, Amtrak has concluded that to succeed it should
instead create new routes, offer more frequent service on existing
lines and organize itself more like the airlines, so people can
change from train to train and get to places more efficiently. By
Matthew L. Wald.
</P>
<P>
   MINT-DIRECTOR-PROFILE _ The director of the mint introduces the
country to Sacagaweya. By Francis X. Clines.

<P>
   AIRPLANE-COMFORT (Undated) _ Passengers flying in coach may soon
find they have more room _ if they can get seats. American Airlines
is adding space between coach seats for those paying full fares,
and others, including British Airways and United, are segmenting

J. Morrow.

<P>
   STALLED-MEMORIAL (Washington) _ Conceived as a way of giving the
5,000 black soldiers and sailors who fought in the Revolutionary
War their rightful place in the nation's history, the memorial to
honor them remains unbuilt. Now 15 years, four presidents and four
missed deadlines later, the charity created to erect the memorial
is $7 million short of the $8 million it needs by October to avoid
losing its premiere site in Washington between the Lincoln Memorial
and the Washington Monument. By Reed Abelson.
</P>
<P>
   MICROSOFT-RESEARCH (Redmond, Wash.) _ Many of the world's
computer laboratories are cutting budgets and narrowing their focus
to research that promises more immediate product applications and
financial payoffs. But Microsoft Research will grow by as much as
20 percent in the next year, and part of its work deals with
technologies that are not expected to result in products or profits
for many years. By John Markoff. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HEALTHCARE-ONLINE (Undated) _ Healtheon/WebMD has riveted
investors as its stock price rode a roller coaster while the
company announced a dizzying array of mergers and alliances to link
patients, doctors and insurers online with just about every player
in the vast industry. The plan is to promote self-help for patients
while saving untold time and money by eliminating paperwork and
insurance company phone centers. But analysts say the company must
start delivering on its promises, before investors lose confidence.

   MAGAZINES-SEX-MEDIA (Undated) _ Redbook and other members of
that prim cadre of magazines known as the Seven Sisters, which are
aimed most intently at married women with children, are feeling the

   REORGANIZE-AD-COLUMN (Undated) _ Two giant agency companies _
Omnicom Group and Grey Advertising _ are making changes in fields
outside the realm of traditional advertising. The moves are

<P>
   Y2K-LEAP-COMPUTERS (Undated) _ Because computers have
encountered far fewer year 2000 date failures than anticipated, the

2000 precautions. By Barnaby J. Feder.
</P>
<P>
   DIGITAL-TV (Washington) _ Under threat from the chairman of the
Federal Communications Commission, the cable television and
consumer-electronics industries have said that they have solved a
vexing problem slowing the transition to digital TV. But the issue
is still not fully resolved. It is the second time the two
organizations have made such an announcement. By Joel Brinkley.
</P>
<P>
   IBM-CHIP-TECHNOLOGY (Undated) _ Technologists for IBM Corp. will

<P>
   EMTV-MUPPETS-MEDIA (Munich, Germany) _ Though almost unknown
outside of Germany, Thomas Haffa, founder of EM.TV &AMP;
Merchandising,_ an 11-year old company built on selling just about
anything to do with children's television _ last week clinched the
biggest deal of his life: an agreement to buy the Jim Henson Co.
and its legendary Muppets for $680 million. A company profile. By

books soared on the windstream of Harry's Nimbus 2000 flying broom.

selling well and steadily over the years until Hogwarts magic gave
it a sudden lift. By Doreen Carvajal.
