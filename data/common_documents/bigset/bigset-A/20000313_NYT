UCLA'S RECOVERY STARTED WITH COACHES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Three weeks ago, they were on the brink of NCAA
Tournament elimination, they had lost six of seven, and they were
spiraling toward one of the worst seasons in modern school history.
The players were confused and discouraged. The coaches were under
fire.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the UCLA Bruins have a six-game winning streak. They're
in the tournament as the No. 6 seed in the Midwest, and they're one
of the hottest teams in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   How have they turned it around? Just as JaRon Rush's 24-game
absence wasn't the only reason for their struggles, his return
isn't the only reason for their success.
</P>
<P>
   Coaching has something to do with it. In particular, four moves
have fueled UCLA's recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The practices: Since the Bruins staggered home from Arizona,
their practices have been more efficient and more demanding.
Attention to detail is at a three-year high. Intensity is soaring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coaches' preparation helps our preparation, and they've
really been on their game,'' forward Rico Hines said. ``We were
focused at the beginning of the season, but the last three weeks
there's been a sense of urgency. That's the biggest turnaround.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Steve Lavin's best move was dusting off the grueling
``60-point game,'' an old favorite designed to improve
ballhandling. There are two teams of five. Offense gets one point
per pass. No dribbling allowed. Possession changes on turnovers.
Loser runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The drill is about passing, cutting, staying low and
pivoting,'' Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   After the 45-turnover weekend in Arizona, Lavin ordered the
60-point game for the first time this season. In the six games
since, the Bruins have cut their turnovers to 15.6 per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get a little crazy sometimes,'' Rush said, ``and the
60-point game has taught us to take care of the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The offense: The Bruins installed a new offense in October (the
1-4 high) that's designed to exploit big men Dan Gadzuric and
Jerome Moiso in the low post.
</P>
<P>
   In early February, after weeks of inconsistency, UCLA returned
to the freewheeling motion offense it had used for years.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, the Bruins ran nothing but motion - and committed 45
turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   After Arizona, Lavin re-committed to the 1-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hard offense, and it takes time to learn,'' said
assistant Jim Saia, who oversees the offense. ``The guys struggled
with it and didn't believe in it. But once we got back from Arizona
and showed them the 1-4 is how we beat North Carolina and Purdue,
they bought into it. They were searching for answers, and we had a
reference point for success.''
</P>
<P>
   But the 1-4 attack the Bruins have run recently is not the 1-4
they ran earlier in the season. After the Arizona trip, Saia and
Lavin made two crucial adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   First, they stationed players in predetermined spots around the
3-point line - instead of letting them float to openings. This has
allowed Gadzuric and Moiso to make instantaneous passes when the
double-teams arrive - they don't waste time locating teammates -
and greatly enhanced offensive flow.
</P>
<P>
   Second, they eliminated stagnation by ordering Gadzuric and
Moiso to dive from the top of the key, where they aren't threats to
score, to the low post, where they do the most damage. Both have
thrived in the revised attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lesson we learned is that instead of abandoning the 1-4,
we needed to fix it,'' Saia said. ``The way the offense looked at
Stanford is the way it's supposed to look.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense: Just as the Bruins committed to the 1-4 offense
when they returned from Arizona, so did they commit to an
aggressive defense. The compact 2-3 zone deployed earlier in the
season is gone. Pressure man-to-man - a long-standing UCLA approach
- is back.
</P>
<P>
   The results are irrefutable: Pac-10 opponents shot 46 percent
from the field in the first 12 games; in the last six, they're
shooting 41.3 percent. (UCLA's improved ballhandling has helped the
defense, since fewer turnovers mean fewer fast-break opportunities
for the opponent.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The zone worked against a few teams, but some were able to
pick it apart,'' said assistant Steve Spencer, who oversees the
defense. ``In the last few weeks, coach Lavin has really emphasized
ball pressure. We've increased it all over the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, when you're backed into a corner like we were, you come
out swinging, and for us, that means ball pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   The point guard: No player has improved more in recent weeks
than point guard Earl Watson. During the six-game winning streak,
Watson has 37 assists and 16 turnovers, and he's shooting
44.4-percent from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   The offensive adjustments have helped. So did inserting point
guard Ryan Bailey into the lineup for several games; his presence
reduced Watson's ballhandling responsibilities and allowed him to
relax.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even his demeanor with his teammates has been different, and
his on-court conversations have been different,'' assistant Michael
Holton said. ``Once Earl relaxed, the team did the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most important ingredient in Watson's development
was a series of discussions with Holton, who played point guard for
UCLA from 1980-83. They talked about leadership, decision-making
and point-guard philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've definitely helped,'' Watson said. ``The information he
gives me is as important as my experience. When things weren't
going well earlier, it was a real challenge. Talking with Coach
Holton has made me feel more comfortable.''

MARICHAL PITCHER PERFECT AS MARTINEZ ROLE MODEL 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic _ This is how it was in the
old days: You're a 20-year-old Dominican whose prior travel
experiences consisted of trips to Puerto Rico, Aruba, and Mexico.
Now you find yourself being paid to play baseball in Michigan City,
Ind. The April weather, of course, was a nightmare. But that wasn't
the worst of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were two of us Dominicans on the team,'' recalls the
young man in question. ``Myself and Jose Tartabull. We didn't even
know how to say `glass of water.' We would go to a restaurant and
look to see what was on people's plates. If we saw something we
liked we would point to it and ask for the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitching was always the easy part for Juan Marichal. He won 21
games for that 1958 Michigan City team (``Don't forget the two wins
in the playoffs''), and that was the springboard to Cooperstown.
Marichal remains the most decorated Latin American pitcher who has
ever lived. He won 243 games. He was a six-time 20-game winner. He
was a supreme stylist. And he is the only Latin-born pitcher to be
enshrined in the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   What pleases him now is the knowledge that he will not be the
last.
</P>
<P>
   What pleases the Red Sox is that they enjoy the services of
another Dominican-born pitcher who, barring injury, someday will be
a Hall of Fame member.
</P>
<P>
   And what further pleases Marichal is that he can claim a measure
of responsibility for Pedro Martinez's success on more than one
level. He certainly served as a model by becoming the first
successful Dominican pitcher in the big leagues, and he even played
a role in Pedro committing himself to the Red Sox after the trade
that brought him from Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan Duquette came here and talked to me,'' Marichal said. ``He
wanted me to talk to Pedro to see if I could convince Pedro to sign
with the Red Sox.''
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, this seems like a reach. Marichal wasn't Luis
Tiant. He didn't spend seven-plus years in Boston, as Looie did. He
wore the Red Sox uniform briefly in 1974; that's all. But they
apparently were good days.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time the Red Sox had Roger Moret, Luis Tiant, and
Diego Segui,'' Marichal says. ``We had a group of Latin pitchers,
and we were all treated very well. To me, the Red Sox were one of
the best organizations back then, and I know Dan (Duquette) very
well, and he's a gentleman.''
</P>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn might disagree, but we digress . . .
</P>
<P>
   Martinez is hardly the second coming of Marichal, style-wise.
Then again, no one is. Marichal was noted for his extraordinarily
high leg kick, and for his variety of release points. He could
throw straight overhand, three-quarters, or sidearm. Pedro's motion
is more conventionally compact.
</P>
<P>
   But the elder master maintains there definitely is a major
similarity between himself and the new Dominican Dandy in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Pedro prepares himself for every game very well, and I
used to do that, too,'' Marichal says. ``I used to go to bed early
the night before I pitched. I used to take care of myself and keep
myself in top condition. You have to make sacrifices in your
lifestyle, give up the discos and things like that. In order to be
successful, you have to give up a lot of things, and Pedro is
willing to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Marichal had the standard repertoire, enhanced by his variety of
release points. But he says his out pitch, the one that kept him in
the majors so long, was his screwball. That pitch is supposed to be
an arm-killer, but Marichal says throwing it never bothered him
because ``I threw it by using my shoulder to turn, and not just by
using my arm from my wrist to my elbow.''
</P>
<P>
   As has been well-documented, Pedro's out pitch is his
devastating changeup, which Marichal admires because it starts out
low and then drops even lower. Beyond the equipment, Marichal says
he and Pedro have the same understanding of how to get guys out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The secret of pitching is to throw strikes, to study the
hitter, to throw the ball where he can't hit it, or, if he does hit
it, to make sure he doesn't hit it with power,'' said Marichal. ``I
think Pedro has studied everything about pitching. That's why he's
so great.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez is 27, with 107 career wins. He is getting better and
better, with a 42-11 record in Boston and two Cy Young Awards in
the past three years. Marichal never won a Cy Young Award himself,
primarily because some of his prime years were spent competing with
the likes of Sandy Koufax and Bob Gibson, but there are many who
believe he was the best righthander of the past four decades. As
the years go on, the comparisons between the two will become more
and more compelling.
</P>
<P>
   Marichal is no old fuddy-duddy, extolling the superior virtues
of the old vs. the new. He is proud to have played in a wonderful
baseball era, but he is very willing to give Pedro his just due.
``I would rank Pedro right at the top of the list,'' Marichal said.
``He is right up there with everyone. If Pedro were playing in our
days, I think he would be doing the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Times are different for the young Dominican ballplayers. If they
are selected to attend one of the many baseball academies, they get
to spend a couple of years studying English, learning about good
nutrition, and, of course, honing their baseball skills before
being sent to the United States. Teams are far more enlightened and
sensitive to the cultural travails of the young Dominicans than
they were in Marichal's day.
</P>
<P>
   But not knowing anything about America didn't stop Juan Marichal
from becoming Juan Marichal, who was great not just because of what
hung from his right shoulder, but also because of what beat inside
his chest.
</P>
<P>
   That's another reason Marichal can identify with Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day I played, I felt like I was in heaven, because I was
playing baseball,'' Marichal says. ``There are some players who do
it because they get paid. You look at Pedro and you can see he does
it because he loves it.''
</P>
<P>
   Please remember that, as good as Pedro is, he's still got a ways
to go before he becomes Juan Marichal.

DESPITE OFFENSIVE WOES, KINGS STAY IN CHASE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The last time Vancouver followed Calgary on their
schedule, the Los Angeles Kings were rolling on offense.
</P>
<P>
   Back on Feb. 23 the Kings routed the Flames 7-2, then came back
and beat the Canucks 5-2. It gave them four victories in the first
six games on their last road trip. But it also marked the end one
of their better scoring stretches of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Kings continue to head toward a Western Conference
playoff spot, their scoring drought has in some ways overshadowed
their success.
</P>
<P>
   They are 3-3-1 since their victory in Vancouver, a pace that
virtually guarantees them the sixth seed and a first-round matchup
with either Colorado or Edmonton. Not bad for a team that has
failed to reach the postseason five of the past six years.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is that lack of playoff experience that keeps the Kings
bandwagon from filling up. Heading into tonight's game against the
Canucks at Staples Center, the Kings are 2-1 in their last three
games. They also have had a five-on-three power play four times and
failed to score.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to block out everything that is said and keep
working hard,'' Luc Robitaille said. ``I think we've done a good
job of that. We're not scoring, but we're winning games. I'll take
that anytime.''
</P>
<P>
   After Sunday's workout in El Segundo, Kings coach Andy Murray
answered repeated questions about the faulty power play until
stopping to ask, ``We did win last night, didn't we?''
</P>
<P>
   But since scoring three power-play goals against Calgary almost
three weeks ago, the Kings have three in the last eight games. They
went 0 for 8 Saturday vs. the Flames, are 0 for 19 in their last
three games and are in a 2-for-35 slump.
</P>
<P>
   One reason the Kings are holding steady in the standings is
their penalty-killing unit, In the last six games, they have killed
off 26 of 30.
</P>
<P>
   But a closer look at the offense shows the Kings' top
goal-scorers have not been producing overall. Robitaille does not
have a goal in four games and just one in his last eight. Ziggy
Palffy scored the Kings' first goal Saturday, but it was his first
in five games. Second-line center Bryan Smolinski had an
empty-netter Thursday, his first goal in 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   Against Calgary, Murray inserted his checking line into the
power-play rotation, playing Ian Laperriere, Craig Johnson and
Marko Tuomainen. They didn't score, but Murray liked their energy
on the ice and said he wouldn't mind doing it again.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Kings virtually play every other day for the rest of
the regular season, there is little time for on-ice power-play
tinkering. It was brought up in Sunday's team meeting, but Murray
has been trying to conserve the team's energy by keeping them off
the ice between games.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this season, the Kings held often-grueling practices
between games and lightened up on the day-of-game morning workouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we go harder on the days of games,'' Murray said. ``We're
in a playoff run. No one said it would be easy.''

SUDDEN STOPS KEEP CELTICS ON GO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Suddenly, it's fun to watch the Celtics again. After a
season of mostly despair, they are making converts of those who
only a week ago refused to believe they had a legitimate, although
slim, playoff possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Before a sellout crowd of 18,624 Sunday, the Celtics had no
trouble in a 93-77 matinee rout of the Philadelphia 76ers. It was
Boston's fourth straight victory, tying a season high. The 76ers
fell behind early and were never a serious threat again as the
defense-minded Celtics (27-35) smothered Allen Iverson and Co. like
few have done this year.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Paul Pierce and Antoine Walker led the Celtics'
offense, combining for 54 points. Walker had 25 points and 13
rebounds, shaking off the effects of a sore left foot that cost him
about eight minutes in the second quarter. Boston also got an
11-point effort off the bench from Tony Battie.
</P>
<P>
   But this win was mostly about the defense, led by Calbert
Cheaney, who was all over Iverson (21 points, 8-of-18 shooting).
The Celtics had 14 steals. Toni Kukoc, recently acquired by
Philadelphia from Chicago, played 25 minutes and scored just 6
points. The 76ers are a solid playoff team. But the Celtics have
vowed that nobody is going to dominate them in their home. However,
seven of the next nine games, including Monday night's in Detroit,
are on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish we had been playing like this the whole season,'' said
Walker. ``Every time they made a run, we made a run.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, the Celtics ran away from the Bulls, 104-74, and
few expected they could improve on that performance. But when
Boston rolled to a 31-21 lead after the first period, it became
clear the Celtics had continued their emphasis on defense.
Philadelphia got within 6 in the third period, 61-55. But Boston
went on a 12-2 run for a 73-57 lead and never looked back.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played better than us,'' said Philadelphia coach Larry
Brown. ``We shot 50 percent from the line and they (hurt) us on the
boards. You can't be a pro team and shoot 50 percent from the line.
I think the Celtics played with a lot of energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheaney and Dana Barros were on Iverson like glue. By being
aggressive, switching off, and keeping Iverson from penetrating the
middle, the Celtics were able to keep the 76ers off their normal
game. They made it look easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Philadelphia is a wonderful team that if you play half-court
against, you're going to come up losers,'' said Boston coach Rick
Pitino. ``We had to play the up-tempo game against them. We're a
very good team when we have time to go over the other team's
offense. We can cover for each other. But there is nobody else who
can excel one-on-one better than Calbert.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see the team evolving into something that I didn't see in
the first half of the season. Steals are the result of knowing the
other team's offense, having good vision, and putting good pressure
on the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure could have been on the Celtics. Walker had to leave
at 11:23 of the second after suffering a sprain of his left foot.
At 4:35, Walker strolled back onto the court with a smile on his
face. His teammates had built a 15-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, they said it was like (Danny Fortson's) injury,''
said Pitino, ``A possible fracture. I'm glad it was only a sprain.
I'm not surprised he came back. Some players play with pain, some
don't. Since I've known him at Kentucky, he's always played in
pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Good defense is no accident, added Pitino, who pointed out
Philadelphia's lack of second-chance points.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this stretch, we have played great team defense,'' he said.
``When someone came down the lane, we choked it down. We waited so
long for this, to set up in the lanes. To have five men react.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker said he's played in pain before. ``It's just something I
had to block out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce said if the Celtics expect to make the playoffs, they
must do it with the kind of effort of the last four games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lately, it's been a lot of fun,'' he said. ``We're really
coming together. The guys are helping out each other. We're
listening to our coaches and then going out and executing. We don't
get down when we lose Antoine. All that means is that other guys
have to step up, and that's what we're doing.''

BRUINS ENJOYING THEMSELVES LATELY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Rob Tallas can't pinpoint exactly when the day came,
only that he knows it arrived recently. He can't put his finger on
the single moment, the final straw, the split second when the
Bruins got so tired of losing, so weary of negativity, so fed up
with every god-awful thing that has happened to the club this year.
</P>
<P>
   The young goalie can't say just when that happened, only that it
did, and for the last three games the Bruins have decided the
pressure is off. They've decided they're going to enjoy themselves
rather than brood over what could've been. It took a long time to
get there, but there they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a point and we've talked about that point,'' said
Tallas, who backstopped Boston to a 5-3 win over the Canadiens in
Montreal Saturday night. ``We've tried to address it, going back
months, saying, `Let's try to relax and have fun.' Then all of a
sudden, something happens wrong and everything tightens up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The energy is so high right now. You have to remember, a lot
of these guys played in Providence last year on a championship
team. They're up here getting a chance and they're flying. We've
done that the last three games, it's awesome to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear the laughter and how much fun the guys are having and
it's real fun. Before, we were making it up and trying to (force
it). It was fake fun. Now, it's for real and it's enjoyable.''
</P>
<P>
   Mathematically, the Bruins still have a shot at making the
playoffs. Realistically, it's the longest of long shots since
Boston is six points out of a playoff spot with 13 games remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Tallas said no matter what happens, there are no long faces,
there is no moping. There was the stunning period when Ray Bourque
announced he wanted to be dealt away from Boston after nearly 21
years, but the team weathered that loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of the game and we know about trades,'' said Tallas.
``With Ray, I think we were just more or less happy to see him go
somewhere to get an opportunity rather than think, `We have really
lost a big part of our team, we're in trouble.' We were already in
trouble. So it was `Congratulations, Ray, and good luck to you.' I
don't think there was a lot of sadness or a down point.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Pat Burns, under fire for much of the year, has seemed
much more relaxed lately.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a lot of pressure on us,'' said Burns. ``The
pressure is a lot on the other teams. (Our players are) having fun.
I let them have fun. I tried to put in a system that's a little bit
easier for them. We've changed so many times this year, we've had
so many players. We've had 38 different players playing on our
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to have a system that everybody understands and
everybody believes in when you have 38 guys going through one
hockey club. We've tried to put something together and they believe
in it. Until the other team figures it out, we'll have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   No one can be sure if, in their last three games, during which
the Bruins earned five of a possible six points, their opponents
took them lightly. But perception, as well as the Bruins' play,
could have had an impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a team like us coming in, they look at our lineup and
they go, `They've got seven or eight guys from the American League,
this is going to be easy,' '' said Burns. ``All of a sudden, we go
out there and play our hearts out and you win hockey games.''
</P>
<P>
   But can they win enough to extend the season beyond April 9? It
seems highly unlikely, but the team is feeling optimistic enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this team were to make the playoffs . . . what a turnaround
and what an experience for all of us,'' said Tallas. ``We would
officially be the Bad News Bears if we did make the playoffs. I
think guys are just enjoying it. No one is really talking about the
playoffs. It's more about keeping the feeling we've got.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The newest Bruin, Mike Knuble, who came to Boston from the
Rangers in exchange for Rob DiMaio, made his debut against Montreal
and logged more than 20 minutes and picked up an assist. It was a
lot more work than he was getting with the Rangers and it left
Knuble sucking serious wind.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not used to getting all the ice time,'' said Burns with a
chuckle. ``Every guy I seem to get that plays on the third or
fourth lines on other teams end up on the second line of our club.
They're playing power plays and killing penalties and their tongues
are sticking out. But they'll adapt.''
</P>
<P>
   Knuble said it's early, but he feels very comfortable with his
new team despite the fatigue factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last bit in New York, I hadn't played nearly that much,''
said Knuble. ``But it was great. I enjoyed every second of it. It
was fun. It was a while since I've had fun playing hockey. The guys
played their hardest. I was pretty impressed. To come here and get
a chance, it's great. That's what you want.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns said the addition of forward Brian Rolston, who came from
Colorado in the Bourque deal, has made a big difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brian has been really good for us,'' said the coach. ``He's
fit in well and he's shown a little bit of leadership which we
needed. He's not a centerman. I'm playing him there because I don't
have any right now. I asked him if he could do the job and he said,
`I'll do anything you want me to do,' and he's been doing a good
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Knuble said he was more used to being across the ice from
Rolston rather than on the same side.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always kicking our (butt),'' said Knuble. ``His team
always seemed to get the better end when I was at Michigan and he
was at Lake Superior State. He's a hell of a player.''

OVERTON EATS UP THIS ASSIGNMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARVIN PAVE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Saturday night, Philadelphia-born-and-bred Doug Overton
went to dinner with some of his old friends from the 76ers.
</P>
<P>
   Around 2 o'clock Sunday, though, Overton handed the visitors
their lunch _ a long 3-point jumper late in the third quarter that
so upset former teammate Eric Snow that he slammed the basketball
to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Sixers coach Larry Brown, who waived Overton last fall, called a
quick timeout, but the damage had been done. What had been a Philly
comeback that cut an 18-point Celtics lead to 6, was blunted by
Overton's bomb that increased Boston's lead to 67-55, part of a
10-0 Boston flurry en route to its 93-77 victory at the
FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   With Kenny Anderson in early foul trouble and Dana Barros also
picking up three quickies, Overton logged 19 minutes, including the
key third-quarter stretch. He played more minutes than Anderson
(15) or Barros (14).
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year-old veteran, who played at Dobbins Tech and La Salle
University in his hometown, could afford to joke about his
otherwise bricklayer-like performance _ just 1 for 11 from the
floor _ while taking pride in his only points of the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody was really looking at me and I'm glad I made it because
I missed everything else, I had nothing to lose,'' said Overton,
who was signed as a free agent Nov. 8 and who appeared with
Orlando, Philadelphia, and New Jersey last season. ``It was a good
play at the right time, though. We built some momentum from that
play on.
</P>
<P>
   ``That felt good, being from Philly, and my job was to just get
out there and run and help keep the tempo up,'' added Overton, who
dribbled out the final seconds, then stopped near the Sixers bench
and offered a friendly wave.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a playoff team that's fighting for home position,''
said Overton, a second-round pick of the Pistons who was with
Philadelphia for the 1996 and 1997 seasons. ``We should be proud of
the way we played against them, especially Cal Cheaney and the job
he did on Allen Iverson.''
</P>
<P>
   Overton sees many of the Sixers every summer, and adds, ``I've
got a lot of friends on that team. We hung out together last night.
I learned a lot from Coach Brown.''
</P>
<P>
   Being third man in at the point is tough, he acknowledged, ``but
that's the beauty of a day like this. It makes you feel good, and
besides there are still a lot of guys who'd like my job. I've just
got to be ready at all times. Unfortunately, Kenny and Dana got in
foul trouble, but it gave me a chance to play.''
</P>
<P>
   That was just the role Celtics general manager Chris Wallace
envisioned for Overton, who was urged by captain Antoine Walker to
keep taking the ball to the basket and keep the Sixers' defense
off-balance. Walker said Overton played a ``huge'' game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had to come in at a moment's notice and being a third guard
is a lot different than being a third quarterback holding a
clipboard,'' said Wallace. ``Kenny had injury problems in the past,
as had Dana, and that's the reason we brought an experienced point
guard like Doug in and let (rookie) Wayne Turner go. We looked
around at the experienced point guards and we felt more comfortable
with his overall package, not to mention his several thousand
minutes in the NBA pilot's seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``He not only helped hold the fort today, he was in there when
we lengthened the lead,'' Wallace added. ``And, of course, he knows
that team so well.''
</P>
<P>
   And Overton, who said, ``I've got a lot of love for those guys
from Philly,'' proved it Sunday with his 3-point goodbye kiss.

GARCIAPARRA DEBUT A HIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ Start the season tomorrow, Nomar Garciaparra
said, and he'd be ready to go.
</P>
<P>
   After missing the team's first 10 days of games because of a
sprained collateral ligament in his right knee, it took Garciaparra
just three pitches Sunday to collect his first hit of the spring, a
line single to center field off Phillies starter Paul Byrd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not fully ready,'' Garciaparra said, ``but if the season
were opening tomorrow, I probably would have played in some games
last week. But we were just playing it safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra, the defending American League batting champion, is
not scheduled to travel with the team to Jupiter Monday for its
game with the Expos, but will be back in the lineup Tuesday, when
Jimy Williams may have a chance to unveil the lineup he'll use on
Opening Day April 4 in Seattle. Don't be surprised to see
Garciaparra hitting cleanup behind Carl Everett.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me it doesn't matter,'' said Garciaparra, who had expressed
to Everett a preference for hitting in the No. 4 hole, which is
where he hit last season. ``Maybe Jimy will sit down with us and
ask us, see what he wants to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The game takes on a certain rhythm for a player depending on
where he hits in the order, Garciaparra said. If he prefers the
4-hole now, he said, it's only because ``I'm used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Sox batting around in a seven-run first, Garciaparra,
who was hitting leadoff, popped to short on his second turn through
the order, then came out of the game after three innings. That was
the plan all along.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice to see him out there,'' said Sox pitcher Tim
Wakefield, ``although on a couple of throws it looked like he
hadn't picked up a ball in two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra was charged with an error when he bounced a throw to
novice first baseman Gary Gaetti on Kevin Jordan's grounder in the
first, and was spared another error when Gaetti dug out another low
throw on Jordan's grounder in the third. But on the next play,
Garciaparra went into the hole and delivered one of his patented
across-the-body throws while on the run.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an easier ball, if you ask me,'' said Garciaparra, who
attributed the error to feeling ``antsy'' before his first game
this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra was asked about Pat Burrell, the Phillies phenom who
was No. 1 overall in the 1998 draft and hit a double and home run
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to be a great player and he's a good guy,'' said
Garciaparra, who first met Burrell when Burrell was still at the
University of Miami. ``And he has good size. Geez, they keep making
'em bigger. That's why I keep busting my butt.''

ROMAR BECOMING THE SAINT IN SAINT LOUIS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Saint Louis University is why you don't pop off
like Billy Packer and declare teams dead before the last jumper is
buried.
</P>
<P>
   There undoubtedly are many who, in the fumbling tradition of the
boorish broadcaster who wrote off UCLA in the final minute of its
overtime win at Stanford, expected to see Elvis at this year's NCAA
Tournament before Lorenzo Romar.
</P>
<P>
   From No. 9 seed to Cloud Nine, records and power ratings don't
begin to explain how Romar's Saint Louis University squad beat
Southern Mississippi, top-ranked Cincinnati, Tulane and DePaul on
consecutive days last week to win the Conference USA Tournament and
the automatic NCAA berth that goes with it.
</P>
<P>
   Romar is a God-fearing man who knows the Bible as well as he
does the NCAA rulebook. Given how tight he is with our Creator,
it's easy to conclude Romar got a timely assist from Him. But the
more plausible explanation is defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Billikens, who will meet Utah on Thursday in a Midwest
sub-regional game in Cleveland, held their four conference
tournament foes to an average of 51 points and 35.7 percent
shooting from the field.
</P>
<P>
   And while much was made of the wounded leg that sidelined
Cincinnati's best player, Kenyon Martin, in the fourth minute of
the Bearcats' game against St. Louis, the Billikens' wounded pride
was no small factor in the 68-58 result.
</P>
<P>
   Five days earlier, Cincinnati had handed St. Louis a 43-point
defeat on the Bearcats' Senoir Day and the embarrassed Billikens
sorely wanted to make amends. ``There was a look in our guys' eyes
after that,'' said Romar, a Compton native who took the job in St.
Louis last March after coaching for three seasons at Pepperdine.
``They lost their poise in that game and their pride was hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   The Billikens showed a lot of polish last week and in doing so,
they buffed the repute of their coach. It got a little scuffed up
on this coast when Romar's successor at Pepperdine, Jan van Breda
Kolff, coached Romar's recruits to the West Coast Conference
regular season title and an NCAA Tournament berth using a more
up-tempo system than the one Romar had employed.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine athletic director John Watson recently was quoted as
saying, more than a bit uncharitably, if you ask us, that the
Waves' success this year ``is almost entirely a credit to Jan. He
took the players that he inherited and has instilled in them
confidence in a number of areas.... He has brought life back into
our basketball program.''
</P>
<P>
   Who knew it needed CPR? The program looked pretty hale last year
when Romar guided the Waves to their first postseason appearance in
five years, albeit in the NIT. Pepperdine, which showed an 11-game
improvement in Romar's first season, finished 19-13 in his third
and last at the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt this year would be our best team at Pepperdine,''
Romar said Sunday afternoon from his home in St. Louis. ``We just
felt we'd be really good. It was tough to walk away from it.''
</P>
<P>
   An assistant at UCLA for four seasons (1992-96) prior to taking
the Pepperdine job, Romar had rebuffed a couple of very attractive
head-coaching overtures from Pacific-10 schools while in Westwood
and Malibu out of loyalty to his employers and his players.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Billikens' job came packaged like a Cartier watch,
Romar said it wasn't an easy decision to leave Southern California
for Saint Louis. ``It was extremely, extremely difficult because I
knew some of the players had transferred to Pepperdine trusting I'd
be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Transfers Nick Sheppard (LSU), David Lalazarian (Notre Dame) and
Tommie Prince (ASU) came into their own this season under van Breda
Kolff, as did Brandon Armstrong, who had redshirted last season.
</P>
<P>
   Romar was thrilled to see it.
</P>
<P>
   Really.
</P>
<P>
   The world is full of people who start to build something, leave
it for somebody else to finish and then can't see the edifice for
their ego. Then there's Romar, who said, ``When I've watched
Pepperdine play this year (on television) I've had fun watching
them. Some of the comments (coming out of Malibu), some people may
look at them as a knock on myself and my staff. I look at
Pepperdine's success this season as a great thing. I just can't
tell you how happy I am for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember talking to John Watson about the next coach coming
in and I remember thinking to myself, `I hope it's a guy that's
going to be successful.' Jan has helped complete what we started.
He's done a great job.''
</P>
<P>
   If Romar had an ounce of arrogance, he'd say the same thing
about himself. He took a Saint Louis team that returned three
starters from a group that finished 15-16 and guided it to a 19-13
record by - forgive us if this sounds familiar - stepping up the
pace. The Billikens scored at least 70 points in 12 games despite
employing a patchwork backcourt for much of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Saint Louis lost senior point guard John Redden for 10 games
when he broke his foot in their season opener. And the Billikens
have been without freshman Marque Perry since he dislocated his
left ankle during an eight-point loss at Louisville last month.
</P>
<P>
   They've lost games (one badly), they've lost players, but the
one thing the Billikens never lost is hope. Romar has his players
believing all things are possible. Everyone else will just have to
get up to speed.

FIXING RAMPART FALLS ON CAPTAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Also moving in the ``a'' national news file.) 
By BETH BARRETT AND GRET GITTRICH 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The foot-long ``CRASH'' sign on the dark blue door
of Rampart Division's anti-gang unit recently came down,
symbolizing the LAPD's effort to remove the stain of scandal left
by rogue officers who may have sent hundreds of innocent people to
jail.
</P>
<P>
   Taking down a sign was easy. What's not so simple is to
rehabilitate an entire division, especially one at the heart of the
worst corruption scandal in LAPD history.
</P>
<P>
   That job went to Capt. Robert B. Hansohn, a 29-year veteran with
five commands in his dossier. Hansohn, 53, exhibits a
soft-spokenness that belies his reputation for never having backed
down from a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he wasn't prepared for what he found at Rampart.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became evident right away something was wrong,'' Hansohn
said in an interview with the Daily News last week. ``Each command
has its own personality, but this was the most unusual I'd
encountered. There were some amazing conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Hansohn, who started as a rookie at Rampart in 1972, said he
expected to find an ethic of hard work, a high number of arrests
and tremendous officer loyalty. He was shocked at how those ideals
had been perverted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those things can work for or against you,'' he said. ``In
CRASH, they went to the dark side.''
</P>
<P>
   Hansohn took over in August 1998 after investigators had turned
up evidence that significant misconduct may have occurred in
Rampart. He was assigned the task of restructuring the division.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen months later, the worst abuses have been cleaned up,
but morale still is fragile as officers cope with around-the-clock
news cameras and rising violence among emboldened gang members _ up
nearly 40 percent in the first two months of this year.
</P>
<P>
   A confidential Los Angeles Police Protective League survey of
captains departmentwide found more than 50 Rampart officers were
discouraged that Hansohn seems so fixated on the scandal he's not
stepping forward to promote their efforts and boost the station's
image.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of the bad kid in the family syndrome, where parents
forget the good kids need a pat on the back now and then,'' said
police union director/secretary Ken Hillman. ``He got high marks
for integrity and trustworthiness, but they think the division
needs someone who will get out in front for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Detective Danny Burzumato, who has worked upstairs from the
CRASH unit for years, said it's tough being painted by a corruption
scandal that ended internally many months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a pretty severe hit,'' he said. ``It's embarrassing.
People have done a lot of good work here.''
</P>
<P>
   In July 1998, Hansohn was enjoying his first day of vacation
away from the Harbor Division when he received an urgent call from
a superior telling him to report ``post-haste'' to Rampart, that
there were ``some problems'' there.
</P>
<P>
   The details were sketchy, Hansohn recalled. The investigation
into dirty cop Rafael Perez, now the government's key witness, was
so hush-hush that no one mentioned it to the new captain.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Bernard C. Parks last month explained during a press
conference he needed a strong veteran to handle the Rampart
emergency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hansohn's a 100 percent company man,'' said union President
Ted Hunt.
</P>
<P>
   As the new guy, Hansohn said, he expected some resistance from
Rampart cops, who were devoted to their former captain. But he said
he had never before encountered such defensiveness, such
``anti-managerial, anti-chief'' sentiment as when he walked through
the door at Rampart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was distrusted by the officers, many of whom felt I was
brought in to clean up Rampart,'' Hansohn said.
</P>
<P>
   The division included two station houses, one holding 450 mostly
patrol officers, the other 150 detectives and the anti-gang CRASH
unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were all these subtle things, little signals that there
were serious underlying problems,'' Hansohn said. ``There were a
tremendous number of rumors and other symptoms of an organization
under stress.''
</P>
<P>
   Hansohn said only his intuition, which warned him of entrenched
problems, prepared him for the corruption scandal that was about to
explode and put the station in international headlines.
</P>
<P>
   Within two weeks of his arrival, investigators told him that one
of his CRASH officers, Perez, was about to be arrested for stealing
eight pounds of cocaine from a department evidence locker.
</P>
<P>
   Hansohn said he stood face-to-face with Perez for the first and
last time a couple of days later to take away his gun and badge.
</P>
<P>
   The officer, ``who, if the truth be known, may have felt he ran
CRASH,'' didn't have much to say, Hansohn said.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, Hansohn was standing in front of a
near-mutinous CRASH unit that refused to believe one of its most
popular comrades could have committed such a crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was total disbelief,'' Hansohn said. ``There was a
general sense among some that the department's management must have
fabricated this crazy charge against Perez. They wouldn't believe
he could have committed the criminal theft of narcotics.''
</P>
<P>
   The strain within CRASH intensified as other favorite
supervisors and CRASH officers were quickly transferred, or later
placed on administrative leave, including a captain and four
lieutenants and sergeants.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   It would emerge later in the confidential testimony of Perez,
which was obtained by the Daily News, that Hansohn was methodically
dismantling ``Fort Apache,'' the self-proclaimed and self-selected
CRASH elite. The clique included members who wore a ``dead man's
hand'' patch off duty and who attended drinking parties, or ``mug''
parties, at the Police Academy while still on duty and in uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Morale was terrible,'' he added. ``I was the only person in
the world no one liked. Their anger was directed at me. I was
standing alone, but I thought we would push through it
eventually.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Rampart officers were supposed to be fighting
crime on the city's toughest streets, where 300,000 people co-exist
in eight square miles with some of the most notorious street gangs
in the country. The 16 CRASH officers and two sergeants were a
critical cog in that effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like trying to fix an old car while you're driving it
to work,'' Hansohn said. ``At some point you have to take the
engine out.''
</P>
<P>
   Hansohn said he deliberately held officers to the highest
possible standards. He said he wanted to change a culture where
loyalty to fellow officers superseded responsibility to the
community.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I was different from any captain they'd had before
because I was holding everyone accountable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, officers who had routinely failed to properly
investigate citizen complaints were stunned when they were required
to fill out reports for minor lapses.
</P>
<P>
   Hansohn said the first time he asked for a ``comment card,'' the
officer and sergeant were shocked that a document would be required
for something ``trivial.'' Hansohn said he was just as disturbed by
their reaction to what's a standard law enforcement practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The negative reaction was disproportionate,'' he said. ``The
sergeant had never considered doing this before.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was his own audits, spanning about two years, that
convinced Hansohn that the station was cloaking its misdeeds, and
neglecting, if not trampling upon, the public's interests and
rights.
</P>
<P>
   A number of citizen complaints were ``not fairly adjudicated,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, cases that pitted an officer's word against a
citizen's word were often classified as ``unfounded'' because the
officer was automatically believed. They should have been
classified as ``unresolved,'' which would have given the benefit of
the doubt to both parties.
</P>
<P>
   Properly classified ``unresolved'' complaints could have raised
a red flag that an officer was engaged in misconduct, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hansohn said as new CRASH officers were brought into Rampart, he
preached that all arrests had to be within the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you peel it all back, this is a community that by and
large doesn't care what we do to suspects,'' he said. ``But we
can't subscribe to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez described in the transcripts an ``us vs. them'' mind-set
in justifying the ruthless and lawless culture within the Community
Resources Against Street Hoodlums unit. Hansohn said he quickly
squelched any such ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only difference between 'us and them' is that we have to
follow the rules,'' he said. ``If we don't we're worse than they
are. There's no place where the ends justify the means.''
</P>
<P>
   Hansohn said good police work is the key ingredient to making
arrests, not illegal searches, planted evidence and perjury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suspects aren't that hard to arrest,'' he said. ``We're as
smart, or smarter, and we have better resources.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no quota for arrests, though Hansohn proudly notes that
in a recent week Rampart did lead the city's LAPD divisions in that
category.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're going to do it the right way, the clean way,'' he
said. ``If they do it that way, I don't really care about the
numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Hansohn said he has changed the station by being firm and fair.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're like a coach,'' he said. ``You can't walk with your
head down and you have to have a good sense of humor. You can't be
cynical and you can't be defeatist.''
</P>
<P>
   Hansohn said he plans to retire in a year, and that Rampart may
be the end of his career. He said the task now is to regain the
community's trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day,'' he said, ``we do that by going out and doing the
right thing, by following the rules and treating people with
respect.''

BRUINS' FIRST STEP IS USUALLY TRICKY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA is in Minneapolis. It is the No. 6 seed in
the Midwest. It will play Ball State on Thursday in the first round
of the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Which begs the question: So what?
</P>
<P>
   A series of lackluster first-round performances has rendered
location and opposition meaningless for the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we can get beat by anybody,'' forward Rico Hines said.
``We found that out last year against Detroit. And two years ago,
(first-round opponent) Miami was tougher than Michigan (in the
second round).
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is getting past the first round. It doesn't matter who
we play. We just have to be focused.''
</P>
<P>
   They rarely are, at least in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have lost three of their last four first-round games
when they've been seeded lower than No. 2 (i.e.: when they haven't
played a patsy).
</P>
<P>
   As a No. 5 seed in 1994, they lost to No. 12 Tulsa.
</P>
<P>
   As a No. 4 seed in 1996, they lost to No. 13 Princeton.
</P>
<P>
   As a No. 5 seed last year, they lost to No. 12 Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   The only victory in that stretch came two years ago, when the
No. 6 Bruins edged No. 11 Miami in the final minute.
</P>
<P>
   But UCLA was fortunate this Selection Sunday. Ball State, the
Mid-American Conference champion, does not play the same grinding
style as Princeton, Miami and Detroit. And the Bruins' potential
second-round foe, No. 3 Maryland, also plays plenty fast.
</P>
<P>
   No, it wasn't a bad draw - unless they make it one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we'll let up,'' Hines said. ``There was no sigh
of relief (when the pairings were announced). If we prepare like we
have the last three weeks, we can do some special things in the
tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins (19-11) are familiar with the one-and-done pressure
of March Madness. Since returning from the disastrous trip to
Arizona, they've approached each game with a single-elimination
attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, Thursday's matchup is an extension of their regular
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last three weeks, we've had to play with a tournament
sense of urgency,'' coach Steve Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   If Lavin feels attention wane, a quick history lesson should
grab his players' attention: MAC teams have won first-round games
in four of the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Miami-Ohio stunned No. 5 Arizona. In 1996, Eastern
Michigan beat No. 8 Duke. In 1998, Western Michigan upset No. 6
Clemson. And last year, Miami-Ohio beat No. 7 Washington.
</P>
<P>
   That's a better first-round record than UCLA's.
</P>
<P>
   Note: Forward Jason Kapono became the first UCLA freshman to
earn All-Pacific-10 honors. He was also named co-freshman of the
year with Stanford's Casey Jacobsen.

   CHINA-WINE (Shanghai) _ Red wine is the drink of the moment in
China, and winemakers around the world are feeling the effects.
Demand for wine picked up after the government began promoting
fruit-based alcohol a few years ago, and Western winemakers rushed
in, shipping wine in giant 22,000 liter containers. But now the
Chinese want domestic wine, so much of the Western supply is being
sold at happy-hour prices by Customs after sitting for months in
government warehouses. This isn't doing much for the wine
exporters, and it isn't exactly helping the Chinese develop a taste
for the grape. It's common for Chinese wine drinkers to mix red
wine with Sprite and white with Coke and to drink the concoctions
in gulps. By Craig S. Smith.

the theaters suffered through stickups, recessions and aborted
development projects and survived to see a renewed Midtown rise
around them. But now the redevelopment of 42nd Street is altering
the theaters' future. The local development corporation that helped
create the strip now known as Theater Row is closing four of the
playhouses as it prepares to break ground on an apartment tower and
collection of new stages west of the area. By Julian E. Barnes.

ANOTHER NO. 1 DOESN'T FAZE UCONN 
</HEADLINE>
 WOMEN'S TOURNEY-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY VAN HANDLE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Let others whoop and holler. The nation's No. 1 women's
team treated Selection Sunday just as nervelessly as it would an
overmatched opponent in a regular-season game.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there were hands slapped and glasses raised across
the country as the 64 participants in the NCAA women's basketball
tournament were revealed Sunday, but in Storrs, Conn., it was a
relaxed group of Huskies who watched the ESPN telecast and learned
that they were being joined by five other New England schools.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, it was a windfall for schools within the six-state
region, but for Boston College, hopes of hosting a sub-regional
were dashed when the Eagles were seded fifth in the Mideast
Regional and forced to travel to Knoxville, Tenn., and a
first-round game against Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   The near-annual ritual of gaining a No. 1 seed, which has been
awarded to UConn six of the last seven years, along with a host
site for the first two rounds, hasn't created any drama for either
the Huskies or their near-obsessive fans.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, at times it appeared the UConn players and coaches were
taking notes in class rather than learning who they'd be playing as
their chase for a national championship begins to take shape.
</P>
<P>
   How casual was it? A 30-1 record and start-to-finish No. 1
ranking prompted Geno Auriemma to break a cardinal rule for any
coach _ to look past his team's potentially first four tournament
games and to the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that it is in Philadelphia makes it special,'' said
Auriemma, a native of the city. ``It also brings more pressure. Now
we have a chance to win the national championship . . . in front of
my family and friends.'
</P>
<P>
   Still, the news that the Huskies drew 16th-seeded Hampton in
Friday's first round of the East Regional at Gampel Pavilion
elicited the requisite responses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great feeling to know that not only are we in the
tournament, we're the No. 1 seed,'' said junior Shea Ralph, who
celebrated her 22d birthday Sunday. ``To know we're going in as the
No. 1 team in the nation for the entire year, it gives us a little
bit of confidence, and hopefully we'll play like that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are uncontrollables in the tournament,'' said Auriemma.
``Any team that wins the tournament has to feel they got a break.
I'm like everyone else, I've got my fingers crossed.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's hard to believe that the Huskies are fretting about the
prospect of playing the Lady Pirates, who have only been a Division
1 team since 1995. They're in the tourney with a 16-14 record
thanks to winning the first Mid-Eastern Athletic title.
</P>
<P>
   ``You play all season long to get to the NCAA tournament,''
Auriemma said. ``Our players are ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know anything can happen,'' said sophomore forward Tamika
Williams. ``You just have to go up and play every night.''
</P>
<P>
   For UConn, which is making its 12th NCAA appearance, the tourney
will afford the opportunity to make up for last year's
disappointing postseason. The Huskies nearly lost a second-round
game in Storrs and were blown out in the Round of 16 by Iowa State.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies' second-round opponent would be the winner of No. 8
Drake (23-6) and No. 9 Clemson (18-11). The winner moves on to play
in Richmond. There are no rematches with any regular-season
opponent on the Huskies' tourney schedule _ except for potentially
one.
</P>
<P>
   If UConn does go to the Final Four for the third time _ but
first since 1996 _ and win its second national title, there is the
potential for a championship game against Tennessee, the No. 1 seed
in the Mideast Region.
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Vols, who are a top seed for the 13th time and a
six-time national champ, handed the Huskies their only loss by a
point in late January at Gampel Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the seedings were as easy as 1-2-3-4. Tennessee (28-3),
the nation's No. 2 team, was joined as a No. 1 seed by third-ranked
Louisiana Tech (28-2) in the Midwest and fourth-ranked Georgia
(29-3) in the West.
</P>
<P>
   The Southeastern Conference, as usual, has the most teams with
six, but the Big 12 matched that. It's the first time since 1992
that another conference has as many teams as the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlantic Coast Conference landed five teams. The Big East,
Big Ten, and Pacific-10 each has four.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee and Louisiana Tech are the only teams to play in all
19 NCAA tournaments since the women's division started play in
1982. Georgia will be playing in its 17th.

WITH NO CLEAR FAVORITE, IT'S OPEN SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
 TOURNAMENT-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ So now it is crunch time in the college basketball
season, the one-and-done phase known as the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Moreso than any other season in recent memory, it truly seems to
be an ``open'' tournament, with as many as nine teams capable of
putting together a six-game winning streak starting Thursday or
Friday and concluding three weeks hence in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates? Start with Duke, still regal after all these
years, able to come back from the early defection of the core of
last year's national runner-up to climb back to No. 1, not only in
the Atlantic Coast Conference, but perhaps in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils breezed through the ACC regular season and
topped that off Sunday with a tough win over Maryland in the ACC
tournament final.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Michigan State, the preseason No. 1 in many
corners, back near the top after adjusting to an early-season
injury to All-America point guard Mateen Cleaves, then adjusting
again when he came back.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the champion will emerge from the West Coast, where
Stanford and Arizona staged a season-long duel that Arizona won in
the final week. Both have the credentials, the coaching necessary
to at least reach the Final Four, and No. 1 seeds, Arizona in the
West, Stanford in the South.
</P>
<P>
   For sentimentalists, there is Temple, coached by wise old Owl
John Chaney, who may have his best team and his best chance to
reach the elusive Final Four. Temple is always tough and ornery but
this year's team can shoot, and that is a big difference.
</P>
<P>
   Before last Thursday, the odds-on favorite to win it all was
Cincinnati. But when All-American and Player of the Year candidate
Kenyon Martin suffered a broken leg during a Conference USA
tournament loss to Saint Louis, the Bearcats became damaged goods
in many minds. Cincinnati was tucked in as the No. 2 seed in the
South.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps another magical story will be written out of Storrs,
Conn., this season. Coach Jim Calhoun's Connecticut Huskies started
out on top as defending national champions, went through a
midseason slump, and have started to pick up the pace to a
championship level again, their 80-70 loss to St. John's in the Big
East tournament final Saturday night notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fine,'' Calhoun said after the loss to St. John's. ``We
just came up empty emotionally, which happens when you play four
games in four days. But that's behind us now. We're playing well
and I think we're ready to make another run.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what the Huskies do, they will have to do it coming
from off the pace. They are the No. 5 seed in the South, which
could be worse because UConn probably matches up best against the
South's Stanford among the No. 1 seeds.
</P>
<P>
   If not UConn or one of the top seeds, then who? Maybe the Final
Four will again have a New England flavor with the presence of Ohio
State, featuring coach Jim O'Brien and guard Scoonie Penn, both
formerly of Boston College.
</P>
<P>
   The Buckeyes surprised most by reaching the Final Four last
season. They have not lost much and have gained experience. Don't
bet against them making a strong run, coming out of the South,
although they will have to contend with in-state rival Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Also look out for St. John's, dubbed Team Turmoil by some after
all the internal squabbling and NCAA investigations of guard Erick
Barkley. The Red Storm, seeded second in the West, are talented
enough to beat anyone, but whether they have the depth and poise to
handle it all remains uncertain. Thus far, they seem to have the
right stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe a sleeper will emerge. But remember: Since the NCAA
started seeding its tournament in 1979, only three teams seeded
lower than No. 4 have won it all _ No. 6 North Carolina State beat
Houston in 1983, No. 8 Villanova beat Georgetown in 1985, and No. 6
Kansas beat Oklahoma in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   So the field is set. Fill out those brackets, sit back, and
enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   March Madness is back.

CYCLONE WARNING FOR CENTRAL CONNECTICUT 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW BRITAIN, Conn. _ This is for certain: They didn't want
Temple.
</P>
<P>
   When members of the Central Connecticut State basketball team
saw that the second-seeded Owls were playing 15th-seeded Lafayette
in the first round of the NCAA tournament, they rendered a
collective sigh of relief.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Devils players were more upbeat _ though not elated _ when
they saw the school name flash across the screen as the 15th seed
in the Midwest, slated to play second-seeded Iowa State Thursday in
Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Central, in its 14th season as a Division 1 team, earned an
automatic bid last Monday when it won the Northeast Conference
tournament. The Blue Devils, who ran off a 15-game win streak this
season, are 25-5, which is a far cry from the team's 4-22 campaign
of two seasons ago while competing in its first year in the
Northeast Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Central, which has approximately 12,000 students, will be making
its first trip to the tournament since moving up to Division 1.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some folks were surprised the Blue Devils didn't show much
emotion when their school's pairing was announced.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's because our name was beside Iowa State's,'' said point
guard Rick Mickens. ``They're a team not to be jumping up and down
about playing. They're a good team and they're a No. 2 seed for a
reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Still Central players and coaches said they enjoyed Sunday's
festivities. About 200 fans were on hand in the gym to help
celebrate the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   A few of the players said they watched Sunday's Iowa
State-Oklahoma contest for the Big 12 championship and were
impressed by the Cyclones.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew that whoever we played, they were going to be a great
team,'' said coach Howie Dickenman, who was once an assistant at
UConn. ``(The Big 12 is) one of the top conferences, and Iowa State
is the best team.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickenman said the team will leave for Minneapolis Tuesday. ``We
going to work hard, and we will be mentally prepared, emotionally
prepared, and physically prepared for the game,'' he said.

DUKE SHOULD MEET MATCH IN TEMPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The top half of the bracket should provide Duke with
enough tests to get ready for the bottom half, which will be
extremely tough for the Blue Devils.
</P>
<P>
   In Winston-Salem, N.C., Duke can relax in its first-round game
against Lamar (No. 16) and the winner of the game between DePaul
(No. 9) and Kansas (No. 8) won't be much of an obstacle. Both teams
are soft and Duke is too good, too quick, and too well-coached.
</P>
<P>
   But the action in Buffalo will be like a combat zone. Temple
(No. 2) is there and the Owls are primed. Lafayette (No. 15) will
be in for a short stay. (Did you check out the first half of the
Owls' win over St. Bonaventure in the Atlantic 10 final?) Then
comes a challenge. Both Oregon (No. 7) and Seton Hall (No. 10) are
dangerous. Seton Hall has not been playing well and Oregon is an
unknown to much of the country. The Ducks won't be after they beat
Seton Hall.
</P>
<P>
   The other half of the bracket has a legitimate sleeper in
Oklahoma State (No. 3). Watch out. Eddie Sutton's teams always play
well in March. They are tough, physical, and well-coached. Hofstra
(No. 14) can stay with them, but only for a while. After that, the
winner of Indiana-Pepperdine looms. And watch out for Pepperdine
(No. 11). The Waves can play defense and shoot, and could beat
Indiana (No. 6). They can't beat Oklahoma State, however.
</P>
<P>
   That sets up a massive battle of Oklahoma State and Temple in
the regional semifinal at Syracuse, along with a Duke-Florida
pairing. Sort of beauty and the beast of college basketball. Duke
should be able to handle Florida, but it won't be easy. If Florida
has its running and shooting games going, the Gators could be tough
to handle. But Duke also can play that style and should win in a
shootout of epic proportions. Oklahoma State and Temple will be a
stark contrast and we think the Owls will have enough outside
firepower to overcome the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to Temple-Duke. Sounds familiar, doesn't it?
Duke won that matchup a year ago in the East final at the
Meadowlands in a cakewalk.
</P>
<P>
   This will be anything but. Duke is not as good. Temple is
better. The Owls can and will win this one and John Chaney can
dance all the way to Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Teams to watch: Pepperdine, Florida
</P>
<P>
   Upset special: Pepperdine over Indiana
</P>
<P>
   Moving to Syracuse: Duke, Florida, Oklahoma State, and Temple

EASY TRIP AWAITS SPARTANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Someone on the NCAA committee loves Michigan State. How
else to explain this region, which is tilted to the top-seeded
Spartans.
</P>
<P>
   They start with two warmup games in Cleveland. No. 16 Valparaiso
will merely show up and the winner of the game between No. 9 Saint
Louis and No. 8 Utah should not produce much of a challenge. In the
bottom half of the bracket, we have more Jell-O. No. 4 Syracuse has
been struggling. Let's see if the Orangemen can get their game
faces back. They should do it against St. Bonaventure (No. 12) and
probably can beat No. 5 Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Out in Minneapolis, we have more uncertainties. No. 6 UCLA plays
No. 11 Ball State in the first game. The Bruins look like they are
back in form, but that should only last a game as No. 3 Maryland
should be waiting for them. Normally, we're not real high on Gary
Williams's teams in March, but we'll take a flyer and see if they
can beat UCLA, although this one could be dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   On the bottom half of the draw, Iowa State sits at No. 2. How
good are the Cyclones? Tough to figure. No. 15 Central Connecticut
could beat them, but could lose by 40. No. 10 Creighton is the team
to watch and is another dangerous opponent in the second-round
game.
</P>
<P>
   The wild-card team here is No. 7 Auburn. The Tigers made a
pretty good run in the SEC tournament without Chris Porter, but ran
out of energy against Arkansas. Or maybe they were saving it.
That's a key question. Auburn, even without Porter, is pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't really matter after that, however, as we'll stick
with some form and assume Maryland and Iowa State emerge. Edge? The
ACC we feel, which will put the Terps in a regional final. That
hasn't happened since 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Now things really toughen up for Michigan State. The regional
moves to Auburn Hills, which happens to be in . . . Michigan. The
Spartans should find Syracuse waiting. Michigan State is a team
Syracuse would have trouble beating in Beverly Hills. Maybe that's
too harsh. Jim Boeheim is a better coach than a lot of people
think. But it won't be enough to prevent Michigan State from
getting to the regional finals. And as much as we think Maryland
will play up to the level of its talent, we will not lose our
senses completely. Maryland will not be in the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   Team to watch: Creighton
</P>
<P>
   Upset special: Creighton over Auburn
</P>
<P>
   Moving to Auburn Hills: Iowa State, Maryland, Syracuse, and
Michigan State

EXPERIENCE SHOULD BE AN ALLY FOR BUCKEYES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Stanford got a No. 1 seed. Fine. But we still feel the
Cardinal (26-3) are the softest of the No. 1s and not as good as
some of the second seeds.
</P>
<P>
   We will find out quickly once play starts at Birmingham, Ala.
Facing No. 16 South Carolina State should be no problem. But after
that things could get dicey. Unless North Carolina (No. 8) is
fooling everyone with its play, the Tar Heels look like a
one-and-done team. Missouri (No. 9) is poised and tough and hungry.
The Tigers win that one and face Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   Watch out for an upset. And we haven't even gotten to the other
half of the bracket, much less the winners from the bracket in
Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Let's talk about UConn. Are the fifth-seeded Huskies ready for a
run? We say yes. It starts with a game against Utah State (No. 12)
and that's dangerous. Utah State is better than people think. After
that, it gets tougher. Tennessee (No. 4) is a strange team to
figure, but the Volunteers should have their act together against
Louisiana-Lafayette (No. 13). Whether the Vols will have it against
UConn remains to be seen. UConn should survive and move on with . .
. Missouri to Austin, Texas, for the regionals.
</P>
<P>
   The other half of the draw is filled with danger as well. Ohio
State (No. 3), Cincinnati (No. 2), and Miami (No. 6) are capable of
runs, although the Bearcats without Kenyon Martin remain a question
mark.
</P>
<P>
   UNC-Wilmington (No. 15) will not be much of a problem for
Cincinnati after the game's first few minutes, but Tulsa (No. 7)
and UNLV (No. 10) will be. We love Tulsa's toughness, and the
Golden Hurricane should beat the Runnin' Rebels in a shootout and
will be primed and ready for Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State, which is ready for another Final Four run, got a
decent draw. Appalachian State (No. 14) will be a nice warmup, but
the Buckeyes have too much experience in the backcourt with Scoonie
Penn and Michael Redd. The winner of the Miami-Arkanas game will be
a challenge, however. Miami (No. 6) plays some nasty defense and
Arkansas (No. 11) is on a roll. The good thing for the Buckeyes is
that the winner won't have a whole lot of time to prepare for them.
Advantage: Buckeyes.
</P>
<P>
   Now we move to Austin. Ohio State vs. Tulsa will be an all-out
war. The difference will have to be in the backcourt. Penn and Redd
again have an edge and don't underestimate the power of coach Jim
O'Brien in close games. He can coach, folks.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting in the other half should be UConn, which will be
thanking Missouri for doing its grunt work by taking care of
Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies will take care of Missouri, setting up a rematch of
last year's national semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, we feel the edge is with the Buckeyes.
</P>
<P>
   Teams to watch: Missouri, Ohio State, and Utah State
</P>

   Upset special: Missouri over Stanford

ARIZONA SHOULD AVOID UPSET SPECIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Remember when Arizona was the losing team in everyone's
upset special? Well, those days appear to be over. The top-seeded
Wildcats have turned themselves into a pretty tough team and they
should prove it this year.
</P>
<P>
   First-round game in Salt Lake City: No. 16 Jackson State. Move
on.
</P>
<P>
   Second-round game: the winner of No. 8 Wisconsin and No. 9
Fresno State. Both made surges to get into the NCAA as at-large
entries. Both are decent. Both aren't as good as Arizona. Move on.
</P>
<P>
   That gets the Wildcats to Albuquerque, which is where they will
wait to see who also shows up.
</P>
<P>
   In the other half of the bracket, we think it will be a surprise
team, Indiana State. No Larry Bird is not back. But the No. 12
Sycamores are going to win a game or two. They start with No. 5
Texas. Can't fathom the Longhorns, but Rick Barnes coaching in
March raises some alarms and we say those alarms will be ringing
loud Thursday afternoon when Indiana State turns in the first
Cinderella upset of the tournament. The problem with upsets is that
they use so much energy. And when the second round arrives
Saturday, with some team like No. 4 LSU waiting, there will be
nothing left in the tank.
</P>
<P>
   Down in Tucson, there are some interesting challenges
developing. Start with No. 2 St. John's. Despite all the trouble of
the past few weeks, the Johnnies are good. They should roll over
No. 15 Northern Arizona _ if no one takes a leave of absence _ then
will find an interesting second-round game awaiting them. No. 7
Louisville is always an enigma. Let's take a chance and say the Red
Storm will play No. 10 Gonzaga. Doing it two games in a row? Nah.
Edge to St. John's.
</P>
<P>
   The other half has a few quality teams. No. 6 Purdue and No. 3
Oklahoma should emerge from their first-round games. No one seems
to give Purdue and coach Gene Keady any credit. He's the Jim
Boeheim of the Big Ten. But the man can coach and he should win.
Not once, not twice, but three times, which means that he will find
himself in the regional final.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting should be Arizona. The Wildcats will be able to handle
LSU in their regional semifinal and they are more talented than
Purdue.
</P>
<P>
   Teams to watch: Purdue, Indiana State
</P>
<P>
   Upset special: Indiana State over Texas
</P>

FINLEY SLOWED BY FLU, DOUBLE TEAMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CALVIN WATKINS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ He is the Mavericks' lone All-Star, but Michael Finley
has been anything but that of late.
</P>
<P>
   Finley leads the team with 22 points per game, but he hasn't
been dominating games as he did in the first half of the season,
when he earned the all-star selection.
</P>
<P>
   After Saturday night's victory against Phoenix, coach Don Nelson
said Finley was struggling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finley hasn't played well in two weeks,'' Nelson said. ``He's
in a slump. He's trying, but he's not getting the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley has been slowed with his recovery from the flu and by
constant double teams from opponents. He also leads the NBA in
minutes played per game at 41.7.
</P>
<P>
   ``The double team has been there every time I got the ball,'' he
said. ``In an isolation situation or a postup situation the double
team has been there, and it's making it difficult for me to get
good looks at the basket.''
</P>
<P>
   For the season, Finley has shot 44.5 percent from the field and
in the past five games, he has led the team in scoring only once.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's up to my teammates to make the open shot, and I have
confidence in my teammates that they can do that,'' Finley said.
``Hopefully it can work in my benefit. You don't want one guy to
beat you on this team. I guess I'm that guy when I get double- or
triple-teamed, it's respect. I've just got to take it.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley has been getting open looks at the basket, but that's
after getting through a double- or triple-team.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, Finley made a 3-pointer in the waning moments of
the Mavericks' 104-99 victory against Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he didn't take over the game.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Erick Strickland led the way with a career-high 36 points.
Finley finished with 22 points on 7-of-13 shooting in 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't been the same in a long time,'' Nelson said. ``I
don't know what the reason is. We have a hard time winning unless
he has a big game for us.'' BRADLEY PLAYS WELL
</P>
<P>
   With Cedric Ceballos slowed with a broken left pinky finger,
Shawn Bradley has raised his game a notch.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has scored 43 points and grabbed 21 rebounds the past
two games.
</P>
<P>
   With his five blocks Saturday, Bradley became the Mavericks'
all-time leading shot blocker with 616.
</P>
<P>
   After missing two games because of the flu two weeks ago,
Bradley has struggled. He scored only seven points combined against
Seattle and Sacramento last week. But he led the team in scoring
with 26 points in a loss to Minnesota on Thursday and he recorded a
double-double Saturday with 17 points and 12 rebounds against
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just go out there and try to have some fun every night,''
Bradley said. ``I know the other guys are trying hard too.''
BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ Former Los Angeles Lakers and Milwaukee Bucks coach Del Harris
attended Saturday night's game, leading to speculation that he
could join the Mavericks' coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   _ Nelson said the team is still looking to add another
frontcourt player. The Mavericks are down to 11 playersafter the
release of Dennis Rodman last week.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Mavericks improved their record to 11-4 Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   _ Erick Strickland had a career night on Saturday. Besides his
36 points, he had career highs in free throws made (13), free
throws attempted (17) and field goals attempted (19). He also tied
his career-high of field goals made (11).

PEPPERDINE, UCLA MAKE IT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The odds were long, Mark Trakh knew. Still, he
figured, what the heck.
</P>
<P>
   The Pepperdine women's basketball coach gathered his team to
watch the NCAA Tournament selection show Sunday, just in case.
</P>
<P>
   As the tournament's Mideast region unfolded, Trakh joked that
13th seed had the Waves' name on it.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, it did.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine (21-9) made the NCAA Tournament for the first time
and will play No. 4 Virginia (23-8) at Charlottesville, Va., on
Friday. The winner will play either No. 5 Boston College or No. 12
Nebraska on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   There was no surprise for UCLA. The 18-10 Bruins earned the
Mideast's 10th seed and will open Friday at South Bend, Ind.
against No. 7 George Washington (25-5). Second-seeded Notre Dame
and No. 15 San Diego also are there.
</P>
<P>
   USC's women made the Women's National Invitation tournament for
the first time. The Trojans, who finished fifth in the Pacific-10,
open Thursday at Santa Clara. A win would pit them against either
Arizona State or Colorado State.
</P>
<P>
   Cal State Northridge didn't make either tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine's task beating a seeded team on its home court
</P>
<P>
   is daunting. Right now, the Waves don't care. They celebrated
for 10 minutes after seeing their name.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels great,'' Trakh said. ``We jumped and danced and
hugged each other. Some were crying.... half those kids, they
could've dunked.''
</P>
<P>
   Even senior Jody Sackville, whose career is complete after
suffering three concussions this season, couldn't contain her
giddiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing well. Very well. Couldn't be better,'' Sackville
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves did what the NCAA liked - they finished strong,
winning 17 out of their last 20 games and earned respect despite
losses to quality teams such as Connecticut, UCLA and Mississippi
State.
</P>
<P>
   After the celebration came the work.
</P>
<P>
   Trakh spent Sunday night and was to spend part of this morning
calling every team on Virginia's schedule looking for game tape.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA didn't have to look as far for tape of George Washington.
Assistant coach Pam Walker has a friendship with a GW coach,
something that partially explains the fist slamming on a table when
she and the Bruins learned of their fate.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins don't mind their draw - it's better than Arizona
traveling to top-seed Tennessee or Stanford heading to Georgia,
another top seed - but falling all the way to a 10th seed after
being a preseason top-four choice can be tough to handle.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what we set up for ourselves,'' forward Maylana Martin
said. ``We've been really inconsistent.''
</P>
<P>
   Injuries had everything to do with that.
</P>
<P>
   From point guard Erica Gomez's torn labrum and LaCresha
Flannigan's knee before the season began to Michelle Greco's
concussions and thigh bruises to Carly Funicello's stress fracture
in her foot, UCLA players missed 30 games to injury.
</P>
<P>
   The results led to the Bruins falling out of the top 10, then
out of the Pac-10 race and finally out of the top 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they expect much from us,'' Martin said. ``I
think we might be able to sneak up on them. But not George
Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   USC in NIT: After winning seven of its final nine games, USC
(15-13) was selected to play in the Women's NIT, and will travel to
Santa Clara on Thursday for a 7 p.m. opening-round contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm real happy for the team and for the statement it makes
about what our team accomplished after finishing last a year ago,''
USC coach Chris Gobrecht said.
</P>
<P>
   This will be USC's first postseason appearance in Gobrecht's
three years as head coach.

VERMONT BASKS IN OLD GLORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY VAN HANDLE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Keith Cieplicki was in the background as an assistant
coach when Vermont posted back-to-back perfect regular seasons and
participated in NCAA women's basketball tournament in 1992 and
1993.
</P>
<P>
   When head coach Cathy Inglese accepted a similar job at Boston
College, Cieplicki went along and watched as his former assistant
partner, Pam Borton, led the Catamounts to another NCAA berth the
following season.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Cieplicki has his turn in the NCAA spotlight as Vermont
earned the 11th seed in the Mideast and a date with Tulane Friday
in a first-round game at Lubbock, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real credit to the year we had, to be playing a 6,''
said Cieplicki, in his third year. ``It feels great, and as a
native Vermonter, it means a lot to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Catamounts earned an automatic bid by routing Maine by 27
points in the America East title game Saturday. They were joined in
the NCAA tourney by the Black Bears, who were awarded a 12th seed
in the West Region as an at-large team.
</P>
<P>
   Holy Cross (Patriot League) and Dartmouth (Ivy), along with
Boston College (at-large) and Connecticut (Big East), are the other
New England representatives in the NCAA, matching the record six
accomplished last season and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Inglese's Catamounts created a frenzy for women's basketball in
Burlington, and this season's team (25-5) has brought back the
glory days with players like 6-foot-2-inch Karalyn Church, who led
the NCAA in field-goal percentage this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the the crown jewel for her,' said Cieplicki, who said
he knows little about his first-round foe except that it has ``one
exceptional player. I'll start looking at the tapes (Sunday
night).''
</P>
<P>
   After losing to Vermont Saturday, Maine repeated its feat of a
year ago by being chosen as an at-large team out of a less-visible
conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Black Bears play North Carolina, the 1994 national champion
from the Atlantic Coast Conference, Saturday in Santa Barbara,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always grateful that we were chosen, since so many good
teams don't get in,'' said Joanne Palombo-McCallie, who is coaching
her sixth NCAA tourney team. ``It's a validation by the committee
of the teams we beat and the teams we played.''
</P>
<P>
   Maine defeated Weatern Athletic Conference champ Rice and took
No. 1 seed Georgia to overtime. Last season's first-round defeat of
Stanford and a close second-round loss to Old Dominion also played
a role.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the variables came together,'' said Palombo-McCallie.
</P>
<P>
   For Holy Cross, tournament selections are beginning to resemble
a given. Try three straight years, five of the last six, and eight
overall, second only to UConn for most NCAA appearances for New
England teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're never disappointed when you're in the NCAAs,'' said
coach Bill Gibbons, whose team plays host Rutgers Friday. ``We're
at the point where we're going down there to win, not to just not
be embarrassed or just to make a good showing.''
</P>
<P>
   In its fourth appearance, Dartmouth (20-7) was granted the
highest seed for an Ivy women's team _ 13th _ to play defending
national champion Purdue Saturday at the Boilermakers' home court.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're not going to get No. 1 then we'll take No. 13,'' said
coach Chris Wielgus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know the adversity that we are going to have to overcome,
and we know the environment that we are going into.''

SEEDING POINTS EAGLES AWAY FROM HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ There was a festive atmosphere in the Conte Forum
meeting room where the Boston College women's basketball team
gathered Sunday to eat pizza, drink soda, and watch ESPN's NCAA
selection show on a wide-screen television with the hopes of
earning a high enough seed to host the first two rounds.
</P>
<P>
   But the mood quickly turned dour when the Eagles learned they
had been seeded fifth in the Mideast Regional and dispatched to
Charlottesville, Va., for a first-round game Friday against
12th-seeded Nebraska. It will be the first meeting between the
schools. The starting time has yet to be announced.
</P>
<P>
   BC coach Cathy Inglese quickly tried to perk up her players when
she said, ``We're going to Virginia, ladies!''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Eagles had their hearts set on playing in Conte
Forum, where they were undefeated in 14 games this season. Last
year, BC earned its first NCAA berth as the No. 8 seed in the East
Regional in Knoxville, Tenn., where the Eagles were ousted in the
second round by the top-seeded Volunteers, 89-62.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, all 16 teams that hosted the first two rounds
advanced to the Sweet 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, obviously the kids wanted to play at home,'' said
Inglese, who believed her team had a strong enough ranking in the
ratings percentage index (16th) and a good enough overall (25-8)
and conference record (12-4) to merit consideration as a host
school. ``I think we had a great chance to play at home, because we
had been playing wonderfully at home. We also wanted to do it for
the fans. We think it would've been great to bring super NCAA
basketball here to Boston. We also knew that it would be really
close and coming in fifth was really close. We don't mind going on
the road and playing. We started out with the Preseason NIT. We did
a lot of traveling, so we're used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the BC-Nebraska game will face either No. 13
Pepperdine or No. 4 Virginia Sunday night. Virginia earned the
right to host despite having an RPI ranking (23d) lower than BC's
and a 2-1 record against common opponents Duke, Kent, and Syracuse.
BC went 4-0 against those teams, including two victories against
Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   It is interesting that Bernadette McGlade, an assistant
commissioner with the Atlantic Coast Conference, served as chair of
the NCAA women's selection committee. The Big East, which had three
other teams (No. 1 seed Connecticut and No. 2 seeds Rutgers and
Notre Dame) make the field as host schools, were represented on the
selection committee by Carol Sprague, Pittsburgh's senior associate
athletic director.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if UConn's reputation for drawing large crowds to Gampel
Pavilion may have had an influence on the committee's decision to
ship out the Eagles, Inglese said, ``I don't think that played a
part in it, but you never know. You kind of try to guess what the
committee is thinking, but I don't think that was an idea. If it
is, it shouldn't. It should be your RPI, your strength of schedule,
and the fact you won 25 games _ and 25 games against very good
teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we're disappointed, but we don't mind going on the road.
We're ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Cal Bouchard, BC's leading scorer at 16 points per game,
``When we were sitting there and saw that N.C. State did not get a
home date and that Auburn did not get a home date, we knew that
there were some slots open and we started getting our hopes up.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when we saw where we were going and what we were seeded,
yeah, there was some disappointment in the room,'' Bouchard added.
``We would've liked to have been a four (seed), but still we're
excited about getting to travel. That's the fun part of the
tournament. It's going to places you've never been to before.''
</P>
<P>
   Although BC had other ideas about its postseason plans,
traveling to Virginia certainly beats not playing at all.

TRIBUNE CO. IS SEEN IN TALKS ON UNION WITH TIMES MIRROR

<P>
   The boards of the Times Mirror Co., a media giant whose flagship
newspaper, The Los Angeles Times, shaped and dominated Southern
California for 119 years, and the company that publishes The
Chicago Tribune were in advanced talks Sunday night on a possible
combination, according to a Times Mirror executive.
</P>
<P>
   Although details were scarce, if the two companies were to
combine, either in a merger or acquisition, the result would form a
media conglomerate with 11 dailies, 22 television stations and a
combined market value of $11.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   A joined company would hardly be the largest in a landscape that
includes the merged America Online-Time Warner. Still, it would
have enough heft, with $6.3 billion in combined annual revenues in
1999, to keep unwanted suitors at bay and to continue the Tribune
Co.'s acquisition strategy and its push into Internet properties.
</P>
<P>
   An announcement, which could come as early as Monday after a
weekend of intensifying rumors, would end five years in which Times
Mirror was reshaped by the cost-cutting zeal and combative optimism
of its chief executive, Mark H. Willes. After arriving in the
spring of 1995, Willes presided over the closing of both The
Baltimore Evening Sun and New York Newsday and began asset sales
that left the company pared largely to its basic newspaper
operations.
</P>
<P>
   His determination to see his papers buck the economic tide, win
new readers and lead Times Mirror to new profit, won Wall Street's
favor for his first two years, but this strategy appeared to falter
over the last 18 months, as circulation growth came in smaller
increments and profits at the flagship newspaper fell below
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Any combination would raise questions about the new company's
ownership of both a newspaper and a television station in the
markets of New York, Los Angeles and Hartford, Conn., an
arrangement ordinarily prohibited by federal regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The company's options would include seeking a Federal
Communications Commission waiver of this requirement or divesting
itself of some of the properties involved _ The Los Angeles Times
and KTLA, a Warner Brothers affiliate; Newsday and WPIX a Warner
Brothers affiliate in New York; and The Hartford Courant and WTIC,
a Fox affiliate in Hartford, Conn.

ST. ROSE SENDS BENTLEY PACKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN VELLANTE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUDONVILLE, N.Y. _ Thirty-three times this season, the women of
the College of St. Rose went to the well and 33 times they quenched
their thirst.
</P>
<P>
   Trip 34 was no exception. This one, though, was more satisfying
than the others because it came when it counted most.
</P>
<P>
   The top-ranked Golden Knights tripped Bentley, 82-72, Sunday
night in the Division 2 Northeast Regional at the Marcelle Center,
giving St. Rose its first berth in the NCAA Elite Eight, which
begins March 22 in Pine Bluffs, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   That's something that had been the exclusive domain of Bentley
(27-4), which was the Northeast representative the past four
seasons _ three times at the expense of St. Rose.
</P>
<P>
   The Golden Knights proved that their perfect record and fifth
straight New York Collegiate Athletic Conference title were no
flukes. They are the real deal with a wealth of talent.
</P>
<P>
   All five starters _ led by tournament MVP Nicole LaRocque (25
points) _ hit double figures. Mbuyi Mukendi had 17 and her
Congolese compatriot Nana Ngalulu Lukengu had 11, as did Kristin
Zeh and Colleen Sheridan.
</P>
<P>
   St. Rose stifled Bentley's high-powered inside game, effectively
shutting down twin towers Kelly Barker (14 points) and Lauren
Fuller (6), and forcing the Falcons to the perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't get enough inside and that (outside shot) appeared
to be our only weapon,'' said Bentley coach Barbara Stevens. ``They
did a great job defensively, they harassed us all night and kept
Fuller from getting any kind of decent position down low.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, she's a major key to our success. We were able to go
to second options, but we needed a force inside, which we didn't
have. That's a credit to their defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Bentley point guard C White (22 points, 18 from well outside the
3-point arc) agreed with Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   ``When our inside and outside game is on, we're a team that's
hard to beat,'' said White, who played 38 minutes. ``Tonight we'd
get it inside and couldn't get the position that we wanted. That
forced us to the perimeter and when just one asset of your game
isn't working, it's going to be tough to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons scored half of their points (36) from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   After a rugged first half, Bentley held a 37-36 lead.
</P>
<P>
   It was only the fourth time this season that St. Rose had
trailed at the break.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we weren't concerned, we knew we'd come out strong,'' said
Bailey. ``We've played some of our best basketball this season in
the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   LaRocque opened the half with a driving layup to give St. Rose
the lead for good. When Bentley pulled to within 43-42 with 15:52
to play, LaRocque went on a 10-point tear that left Bentley
staggering.
</P>
<P>
   In less than 2 minutes, she drained back-to-back treys, hit a
pair of free throws, and stole an inbounds pass and went in
unmolested for a layup. In a blink, St. Rose led, 53-45.
</P>
<P>
   St. Rose, the nation's only undefeated team in either Division 1
or 2, never trailed by less than 7 from that point on.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're looking for a word to describe how I feel, call it
euphoric,'' said Bailey. ``We've made four straight Sweet 16
appearances and lost all four by a total of 14 points. We know the
feeling of disappointment. Finally, we experienced the joy of
winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, in terms of the future of this program, we can go into a
postseason tournament and not have to deal with the fact that these
kids choke and can't win the big one. We dispelled that myth
tonight.''

LAKERS' STREAK SURVIVES MAJOR TEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Push it, stretch it, fold it over backwards and
flex it to the point of snapping under the strain. No measure of
abuse seems to put a permanent crease in the Lakers' winning ways.
</P>
<P>
   Their latest winning streak was pushed to the brink Sunday
evening by the unpredictable Sacramento Kings. It was ready to
crack and crumble, but the Lakers' foundation proved stronger than
anything the Kings could muster.
</P>
<P>
   That would be Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, who made a pitch
for co-MVPs by combining for 79 points in a remarkable 109-106,
comeback victory before 18,997 at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Almost left for dead under a double-digit deficit, The Streak
instead grew to 18 straight games.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings led from the opening tip and by as many as 16 points
in the second half. The Lakers, with Bryant and O'Neal combining
for 27 fourth-quarter points, took their first lead of the game
with 5:12 left, then rode their dynamic duo to a down-to-the-wire
finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow,'' coach Phil Jackson said, ``what a game. That was a
pretty exciting game for our team, and for our fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant scored a career-high 40 points (on 15 of 24 shooting) to
go with 10 rebounds and eight assists, edging out O'Neal for
game-high honors. O'Neal finished with 39 points, 20 rebounds and
five assists.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time since March 5, 1976 that two Lakers scored
35 points or more in the same game.
</P>
<P>
   They needed it. Glen Rice struggled early and sat out the last
16 minutes of the game. He went to the bench having hit 3 of 11
shots for six points and five rebounds, before giving way to Rick
Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaq has played like an MVP all year,'' said Fox, ``and Kobe
joined him tonight for the game. You know that you have two guys,
one who should win the MVP this year and one who probably will
eventually down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers extended their home winning streak to nine games and
for the moment dispelled the hex the Kings have on them. Sacramento
had won three of the prior four meetings. They meet twice more this
season, once in each city.
</P>
<P>
   If the season ended today, the Lakers and Kings would meet in
the first round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento was without two key pieces -- starting off guard Nick
Anderson and reserve forward Scot Pollard, both injured. But Peja
Stojakovic, subbing for Anderson, again played big against the
Lakers, scoring 22 points. Chris Webber led the Kings with 24
points.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on the Lakers' pair of lengthy winning streaks, coach
Phil Jackson said the recent one stands as the more impressive of
the two.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it tells us we that were able to win and do this on
the road, under different circumstances,'' he said. ``Most of (the
16-game streak ) came on the home stretch, although we did have one
small road sequence in there. This one is generated by the six wins
on the road, and post-All-Star week. I thought that was significant
for this team to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   The 17-game streak includes an active nine-game road streak that
stands as the third longest in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings led from the opening tip and shot 56.1 percent on the
way to a 59-52 halftime lead. It was an ominous sign for the
Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   They hadn't trailed at halftime in 13 games, since their Feb. 16
victory at Charlotte. And the seven-point halftime deficit was the
biggest they had faced since Feb. 1 in San Antonio -- the site of
their last loss prior to the winning streak. The Spurs took a
10-point halftime lead in t hat game.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal (16 points) and Bryant (18 points) both turned in strong
performances in the half, Bryant hitting 7 of 10 shots. But Rice
was just 3 for 9, and the Lakers made only 23 of 53 field goals
(43.4 percent).
</P>
<P>
   After trailing by as many as many as 12 points, the Lakers put
together a late run and eventually whittled the deficit to 48-46,
but the Kings proved stubborn. Peja Stojakovic immediately hit a
3-pointer. A minute later, the Lakers cut the lead to one point,
only to have the Kings answer with two more 3-pointers, from
Williams and Stojakovic, to close out the half.

UMASS GETS NIT DATE WITH SIENA

<P>
   AMHERST, Mass. _ University of Massachusetts men's basketball
coach Bruiser Flint arrived in his office from a recruiting trip
Sunday &UR;  &LR; night at 8, then sat and waited to find out whether the
Minutemen's season would continue.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours later, the fourth-year coach still didn't know whether
UMass had been selected to the National Invitation Tournament, and
that left him to respond to a dozen phone inquiries like this:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, how you doin'? . . . No, we don't know yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Flint got the call he was waiting for at 10:15 p.m. and it was
the news he wanted to hear.
</P>
<P>
   UMass (17-15) was selected to play in the NIT, and, as many
expected, will play at Siena (23-8) in the first round. The contest
is scheduled for 7 p.m. Thursday. The winner will meet the winner
of the first-round contest between Penn State and Princeton March
20 or 21.
</P>
<P>
   UMass had been an NCAA participant for so many years (seven
straight in the 1990s) that Flint couldn't remember what it was
like to wait to discover whether his team was going to the NIT. He
said he was pleased to make the field and happy that his team,
notably his seniors, reached postseason play. But the wait was
another story. ``This is more nerve-wracking than the NCAA because
with this you don't know anything,'' said Flint. ``I mean, we've
been in here for more than two hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to get in here and work and watch some tape on
(Siena) and get going. I know they like to run up and down the
floor, they shoot well on the perimeter, and they like to press.''
</P>
<P>
   It marks the third time UMass has made the postseason in Flint's
tenure.

LAKERS WIN 18TH STRAIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Push it, stretch it, fold it over backwards and
flex it to the point of snapping under the strain.
</P>
<P>
   No measure of abuse seems to put a permanent crease in the Los
Angeles Lakers' winning ways.
</P>
<P>
   Their latest winning streak was pushed to the brink Sunday
evening by the unpredictable Sacramento Kings. It was ready to
crack and crumble, but the Lakers' foundation proved stronger than
anything the Kings could muster.
</P>
<P>
   That would be Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, who made a pitch
for co-MVPs by combining for 79 points in a remarkable 109-106,
comeback victory before 18,997 at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Almost left for dead under a double-digit deficit, The Streak
instead grew to 18 straight games.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings led from the opening tip and by as many as 16 points
in the second half. The Lakers, with Bryant and O'Neal combining
for 27 fourth-quarter points, took their first lead of the game
with 5:12 left, then rode their dynamic duo to a down-to-the-wire
finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow,'' coach Phil Jackson said, ``what a game. That was a
pretty exciting game for our team, and for our fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant scored a career-high 40 points (on 15 of 24 shooting) to
go with 10 rebounds and eight assists, edging out O'Neal for
game-high honors.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal finished with 39 points, 20 rebounds and five assists.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time since March 5, 1976 that two Lakers scored
35 points or more in the same game.
</P>
<P>
   They needed it. Glen Rice struggled early and sat out the last
16 minutes of the game. He went to the bench having hit 3 of 11
shots for six points and five rebounds, before giving way to Rick
Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaq has played like an MVP all year,'' said Fox, ``and Kobe
joined him tonight for the game. You know that you have two guys,
one who should win the MVP this year and one who probably will
eventually down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers extended their home winning streak to nine games and
for the moment dispelled the hex the Kings have on them. Sacramento
had won three of the prior four meetings. They meet twice more this
season, once in each city.
</P>
<P>
   If the season ended today, the Lakers and Kings would meet in
the first round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento was without two key pieces - starting off-guard Nick
Anderson and reserve forward Scot Pollard, both injured. But Peja
Stojakovic,subbing for Anderson, again played big against the
Lakers, scoring 22 points. Chris Webber led the Kings with 24
points.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on the Lakers' pair of lengthy winning streaks,
Jackson said the recent one stands as the more impressive of the
two.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it tells us we that were able to win and do this on
the road, under different circumstances,'' he said. ``Most of (the
16-game streak) came on the home stretch, although we did have one
small road sequence in there. This one is generated by the six wins
on the road, and post-All-Star week. I thought that was significant
for this team to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   The streak includes an active nine-game road streak that stands
as the third longest in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings led from the opening tip and shot 56.1 percent on the
way to a 59-52 halftime lead. It was an ominous sign for the
Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   They hadn't trailed at halftime in 13 games, since their Feb. 16
victory at Charlotte. And the seven-point halftime deficit was the
biggest they had faced since Feb. 1 in San Antonio - the site of
their last loss prior to the winning streak. The Spurs took a
10-point halftime lead in that game.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal (16 points) and Bryant (18 points) both turned in strong
performances in the half, Bryant hitting 7 of 10 shots. But Rice
was just 3 for 9, and the Lakers made only 23 of 53 field goals
(43.4 percent).
</P>
<P>
   After trailing by as many as many as 12 points, the Lakers put
together a late run and eventually whittled the deficit to 48-46,
but the Kings proved stubborn.
</P>
<P>
   Stojakovic hit a 3-pointer. A minute later, the Lakers cut the
lead to one point, only to have the Kings answer with two more
3-pointers, from Williams and Stojakovic, to close out the half.

IGNORED TROJANS CAN'T BELIEVE IT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC braced itself for the worst possible scenario
this week, but when the news came Sunday night that the Trojans had
been ignored by the National Invitation Tournament, it didn't go
down any easier to a stunned group of players.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NIT doesn't care who deserves to be in the NIT, all they
care about is making money,'' USC forward Brian Scalabrine said.
``I just don't believe it. Cal is in? Are you serious? I can't
believe that.''
</P>
<P>
   Scalabrine was upset that the NIT selected California (16-14,
7-11), which finished two games behind the Trojans (16-14, 9-9) in
the Pacific-10 Conference standings. Arizona State (18-12, 10-8)
also made the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Cal did sweep the Trojans this season, and is the defending NIT
champion. But more importantly, the Golden Bears offer the NIT a
virtual guarantee of 12,000 fans for home games, and making money
is the tournament's top priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have 12,000 fans that come out,'' USC coach Henry Bibby
said. ``How does the NIT justify taking Cal? I don't know their
reasoning. It wasn't in the cards to be there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had to be more Cal winning the thing and that Cal can host
games. You can't say they're more deserving than we are. I thought
we had a better chance to make it than Cal.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bibby didn't place too much blame on the NIT, instead
focusing on the Trojans' shortcomings, which included losing eight
of their final 12 games, not to mention a mediocre 7-5
nonconference record.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have controlled it,'' Bibby said. ``We can't blame
the committee. They have their reasons. We can't be upset with
them. It never should have come to that. If we do what we're
supposed to do, we don't have this problem.''
</P>
<P>
   USC hoped if it swept the Washington schools last weekend, it
would have enough momentum to secure a bid with 16 victories. Last
year, the Trojans were selected to the NIT with a 15-12 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``How did we get in last year and not this year? I can't believe
any of this,'' Scalabrine said. ``We won our last game, and now our
season is over.''
</P>
<P>
   The NIT was just one more casualty of the Trojans' problems once
forward Sam Clancy went down with a broken foot in late January,
and USC dropped seven of 10 games in his absence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably a different ball game with Sam Clancy,'' Bibby
said. ``You win at least two more games. Of the five games we lost
by five points or less, I'd say we win two of those.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year's done. You think the committee would say they do
have Sam Clancy back. He played really good.''
</P>
<P>
   Clancy's injury came when USC was tied for first place in the
Pac-10 with a 6-1 record. After spending the final two months of
the season hoping for an at-large berth to the NCAA Tournament, the
Trojans suffered a greater indignity by failing to make any
postseason tournament for the second time in Bibby's four years as
coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``To miss both tournaments is very disappointing,'' guard Jeff
Trepagnier said. ``I was pretty sure we were in. We'll have to work
hard to not have a season like this. I've thought about six or
seven games that we could have won.
</P>
<P>
   ``When our season started sliding, we still thought we would get
to the NIT.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Scalabrine was selected to the All-Pacific-10 team....
Laguna Beach High guard Travis Hanour, who committed to USC last
month, visited Arizona over the weekend.

SOME NCAA TOURNAMENT OBSERVATIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ Three things are perfectly clear from the
64-team NCAA men's basketball tournament bracket revealed Sunday
afternoon:
</P>
<P>
   __Long Beach State's 24-5 basketball team wasn't even on The
Bubble.
</P>
<P>
   __The Big West is to the NCAA as Pluto is to our solar system.
</P>
<P>
   __The selection committee envies the weather teams on the west
coast enjoy, and punishes them by sending them packing during the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   There's also validity to the belief that the committee could
have done a better seeding job by picking names out of a cap, but
local things first.
</P>
<P>
   Aware of the committee's tendencies and the national disregard
for the Big West, no one in 49er-ville held out any real hope that
Wayne Morgan's team would get a bid, especially when teams like St.
Louis (fifth in its division of Conference USA), Creighton (fourth
in Missouri Valley) and Arkansas (7-9 in SEC play) won post-season
tourneys to grab an automatic berth.
</P>
<P>
   But when you look at the wins and schedules of a few teams that
grabbed at-large bids, you can at least create an argument.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin (8th seed in West, 18-13) had a win over Temple, but
it also lost to Wake Forest (by 19), Seth Greenberg's South Florida
squad, Northern Illinois, and Penn State twice. The Badgers got
their boost from the Big Ten's overall power rating.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri (9th, South, 18-12), a sixth entry from the Big XII,
had just one win against a winning team in Big XII play, and four
non-league wins were against Princeton, UNC-Asheville, Western
Carolina and Morgan State. The Tigers were 2-10 against Top 30
teams.
</P>
<P>
   Seton Hall (10th, East, 20-9), the last of four teams from the
Big East, had just two notable wins, over St. John's and Syracuse,
while piling up victories against east coast versions of Dominguez
Hills and Monterey Bay -- Quinnipiac, Drexel, St. Peter's,
Columbia, Army, Stony Brook and Wagner.
</P>
<P>
   DePaul (9th, East, 21-11) beat St. John's and lost to Duke by
one, but it also had wins against Howard, American-Puerto Rico,
South Carolina, Chicago State, Monmouth, Nicholls State, Northern
Illinois and Elon. The Blue Demons were 2-6 versus Top 30 teams.
</P>
<P>
   St. Bonaventure (12th, Midwest, 21-9) beat Temple (as well as
Florida International, Cleveland State and Niagara) but lost to
Fordham -- twice. Another 12, Indiana State (Midwest, 22-9) has one
good-looking win (Indiana) to go with Montana State, Western
Illinois, Eastern Illinois, North Texas and Tennessee State. The
Sycramores also lost a game to Southern Illinois by 19, a team the
49ers beat in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no short cuts,'' said Bill Shumard, the 49ers
Athletic Director. ``You have to play good teams and do well when
you do. We reached our first goal, to be one of the (96) teams
playing in March (NCAA and NIT). We'll keep upgrading our
schedule.'' The 49ers play Cal in the NIT first-round Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   It certainly would help the 49ers and other Big West teams if
they had an advocate or lobbyist working on their behalf. For the
seventh straight year, the conference will only have one team in
the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The Big West coincidentally hasn't had an official on the
selection committee over the same span. Its lack of influence and
stature is visible by the placement of Utah State. The tournament
champ has more wins (28) than 59 other teams in the field, but they
were seeded 12th in the South.
</P>
<P>
   That's quite a slap. Out-of-nowhere entrants like Saint Louis
(9) and Arkansas (11) were seeded higher, and so were teams with
double-digit losses, like Wisconsin (8), Missouri and DePaul (9s).
</P>
<P>
   One can make the case that Utah State is better than the tourney
champs of the WAC and Mountain West. UNLV (23-7), seeded 10th in
the South, built its record on wins over Mississippi Valley State,
Fairfield, Austin Peay, Cal Poly SLO, Eastern Kentucky, Florida
Atlantic and something called High Point. It also lost to BYU twice
and suffered losses by 14 (Oklahoma State), 24 (North Carolina, 40
(Cincinnati) and 44 (Utah).
</P>
<P>
   Utah State beat Fresno State. With apologies to Jerry Tarkanian,
the Bulldogs' schedule included twinkies like Georgia State,
Florida International, Florida Atlantic, Wagner, Cornell and good
old High Point. He also suffered losses to Northridge, USF and UAB.
</P>
<P>
   ``The politics are what they are: The football schools rule the
roost even when it comes to basketball,'' said Shumard. ``If you're
in one of the other conference, it's almost like you're held to a
different standard.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not the Big West deserved more bids or higher seeds,
the same committee prejudice against the west coast continues. One
shouldn't be fooled by seeing Stanford and Arizona earn No. 1
seeds. Those placements were a function of Cincinnati losing Kenyon
Martin and other top ten teams (Syracuse, Ohio State, Tennessee)
taking their conference tournaments lightly.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford and Utah State will both play in the South Regional,
starting in Birmingham. Las Vegas also goes south to the other
bracket in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Pac-10 third place team Oregon and WCC at-larger Pepperdine must
open the East Regional in Buffalo. Should they survive, they then
go back to Syracuce.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA is stuck in the Midwest Regional, opening against Ball
State in Minneapolis. Utah, also in the Midwest, opens in
Cleveland, both teams hoping to advance to another beautiful city,
Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four area teams blessed to be in the West Regional,
there's one contender (Arizona) and three longshots from the bottom
half of the 64-team draw, Fresno State, Northern Arizona and
Gonzaga.
</P>
<P>
   Only three high-seed teams have comparable travel logistics:
Oklahoma State (Buffalo, East), LSU (Salt Lake City, West) and St.
John (Tuscon, West). One might include Ohio State (Nashville,
South) and Connecticut (Birmingham, South).
</P>
<P>
   Given the opportunity, the 49ers (24-5) would be happy to play
in Buffalo, Birmingham or even Beijing. Instead, they'll try to
make a statement in the NIT finals in New York and wait for next
year's Final Four guide, which will add them to the list headlined
``Teams with fewest losses not to make tournament.''

NCAA'S MISGUIDED HUNCH BET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There's a letter of support with the signatures of
Mike Krzyzewski, Bob Knight, Roy Williams, Bill Guthridge and Nolan
Richardson attached to an NCAA-backed piece of legislation that's
making its way through Capitol Hill this week. The bill is trying
to make it illegal to bet on college games as well as all other
amateur sporting events.
</P>
<P>
   The $80 million in wagers placed legally on just the NCAA men's
basketball tournament this week - added to $1 billion changing
hands in Las Vegas on all college sports each year - isn't anything
to pooh-pooh.
</P>
<P>
   But what have the rent-a-cops at the NCAA offices done on their
own about this issue? Once, they told newspapers to stop running
odds on games. That was pretty impactful.
</P>
<P>
   This past season, their enforcement of archaic rules resulted in
the suspension of several top athletes at some high-profile
universities. That's only added intrigue to this year's tournament,
which could actually heighten interest of those participating in
the office pools.
</P>
<P>
   No one wants adults messing with kids' games, but the NCAA can't
hide behind this premise when pushing through this kind of
publicity- seeking bill. Senate hearings will likely take place in
the next few weeks, right at the peak of tournament interest.
That's not by accident.
</P>
<P>
   So will the Feds start busting up the two-bucks-a-pop operations
at the corporate offices like Pizza Hut - an official tournament
sponsor - that threaten to rip apart the fabric of the sport if
this bill passes? 'Course not. But lock the doors and bar the
windows, just in case.
</P>
<P>
   There's enough sewage for the NCAA to wade through these days.
The sooner they figure out that they can never level the playing
field, the better.
</P>
<P>
   --Booker T. Turner's resignation after 10 years as head of the
Pacific-10 officials was probably easier for him than hiring three
dozen new qualified referees....
</P>
<P>
   --Research by Forbes magazine indicates that the Magic Johnson
Foundation spent $715,000 last year, but with a 72 percent
overhead, only $200,000 went to charity....
</P>
<P>
   --New Tigers pitcher Hideo Nomo decided to pick No. 23 because
Kirk Gibson once wore it. Asked what he knew of Gibson, Nomo said:
``I know he played well for the Dodgers and the Tigers.''...
</P>
<P>
   --Brokers who have magic tickets to the Giants' Pac Bell Park
regular-season opener against the Dodgers on April 11 are fetching
upwards of $2,700 from the Silicon Valley sycophants....
</P>
<P>
   --For what it's worth, the Dodgers' 1-11 exhibition start
compares unfavorably to the Lakers' 2-5 preseason....
</P>
<P>
   --Frankie Muniz, the kid who stars in Fox's new sit-com
``Malcolm in the Middle,'' told Bryant Gumbel on CBS' ``The Early
Show'' last week that someday he'd like to own the Clippers because
they ``rule ... I love 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankie's in a fog ...
</P>
<P>
   --Tiger Woods' net worth is more than $150 million, his pop told
Golfweek magazine....
</P>
<P>
   --From one of America's biggest soccer stars, Alexi Lalas gives
Gear magazine this assessment about his sport: ``I understand the
pacing of the game, and quite honestly, I don't have the patience.
It takes a certain kind of person to watch and as heavily
identified as I am with the game, I may not be that kind of person.
I am a product of the money shot. It's MTV's fault.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   --A highly underpublicized four-team Spring Football League,
with a franchise in L.A. playing against those in Houston, Miami
and San Antonio, is supposed start at the end of April and play its
title game on May 27 in Miami....
</P>
<P>
   --On April 9, less than 200 people will wonder if the Avengers
won, lost or folded.

   LOS ANGELES _ Before you actually take the time to figure out
the odds of correctly picking the outcome of all 63 games of an
NCAA Tournament bracket, some lucky guy at ESPN.com has done so.
</P>
<P>
   Try 9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   There are almost 9 quintillion online tournaments to enter by
Thursday morning to prove that the chance of going 63-0 is about as
remote as Kenyon Martin taking Cincinnati to the title.
</P>
<P>
   Do it, however, and there's a $10 million payoff awaiting, at
not one but two sites hosting online pools - CNNSI.com
(hoopschallenge.cnnsi.com) and a combined promotion by Sandbox.com,
Rivals.com and FoxSports.com (www.itsmadness.com).
</P>
<P>
   On the second tier, accomplishing the same feat at online sports
book Intertops.com will earn $2 million. Predictit.com and
FansOnly.com have $1 million payouts.

   For those with enough cash in hand, the champions at ESPN.com,
CBS Sportsline.com, Lycos' game (www.gamesville.com) and
Sunshinenetwork.com are rewarded with a trip for two to the 2001
Final Four, a new Oldsmobile SUV, a 550-inch stereo projection TV
and three days and two nights at a resort in the Bahamas,
respectively, for throwing darts correctly.
</P>
<P>
   All of these contests are free to enter.
</P>
<P>
   Something else to chew on: Of the 402,109 who entered ESPN.com's
contest a year ago, only 4,489 had a correct Final Four. The
winner, a weather forecaster at Vance Air Force Base in Oklahoma,
went 46-17 and was the only one to have all eight teams advancing
from the Sweet 16 (as well as picking eventual champion UConn).
</P>
<P>
   No word on whether his weather forecasting is as sharp as his
bracket prognostications.

LAKERS WIN 18TH STRAIGHT

   LOS ANGELES _ Push it, stretch it, fold it over backward and
flex it to the point of snapping under the strain. No measure of
abuse seems to put a permanent crease in the Los Angeles Lakers'
winning ways.
</P>
<P>
   Their latest winning streak was pushed to the brink Sunday
evening by the multitalented and ever-unpredictable Sacramento
Kings. It was ready to crack and crumble, but the Lakers'
foundation proved stronger than anything the Kings could muster.
</P>
<P>
   Meet the foundation: Shaquille O'Neal, MVP. And his friend mini-
MVP, Kobe Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   The pair combined for 79 points as the Lakers fought back from a
16-point deficit to pull out a remarkable 109-106 victory in front
of 18,997 at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow,'' said coach Phil Jackson, ``what a game. That was a
pretty exciting ball game for our team, and for our fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Folded, spindled, nearly mutilated, The Streak survived, growing
to 18 consecutive games, tied for the third longest in NBA history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're playing at a top level right now,'' Jackson
said.
</P>
<P>
   If ever it was going to end, Sunday seemed like the time, and
the Kings seemed like the team. They had won three of the last four
meetings and present all manners of matchup problems for the
Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   That was in evidence, as Chris Webber (24 points), Predrag
Stojakovic (22 points) and Vlade Divac (15 points) took command
from the opening tip, and the Kings led continuously until late in
the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Then Bryant and O'Neal took over, combining for 27 points in the
fourth quarter, and making another bit of history.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant finished with a career-high 40 points (on 15-of-24
shooting) to go with 10 rebounds and eight assists. O'Neal finished
with 39 points, 20 rebounds and five assists. It was the first time
since March 5, 1976 that two Lakers scored 35 points or more in the
same game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaq has played like an MVP all year,'' said Rick Fox, ``and
Kobe joined him tonight for the game. You know that you have two
guys, one who should win the MVP this year and one who probably
will eventually down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   They needed both MVPs. Third option Glen Rice struggled early
and sat out the last 16 minutes of the game. He went to the bench
having hit 3 of 11 shots for six points.
</P>
<P>
   Said Bryant of the two-man game, ``It's good, because you keep
the defense off-balance, kind of play them a little bit. ... They
don't know if they should slide in or stay with Shaq or whatever it
may be. We just wanted to take whatever they gave us. It was that
simple. We just wanted to play for the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the Lakers (52-11) made their defensive stand. Fox checked
Stojakovic and Corliss Williamson. Brian Shaw and Derek Fisher took
turns hounding Jason Williams. And Robert Horry confounded Webber
into 2-for-7 shooting as the Lakers held the Kings to 31.8 percent
shooting in the final quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Energy,'' Bryant said of the turnaround. ``We were able to dig
deep and find some energy, and rotate a lot quicker (on defense).''
</P>
<P>
   It just took longer than usual to do it. The Lakers got their
first lead of the game, 93-91, on Bryant's 7-foot jumper with 5:12
left. Stojakovic tied it again, 100-all with 1:20 remaining. Then
O'Neal took the game back. He hit a bank shot over Webber, then at
the other end blocked a Stojakovic jumper, with the Kings claiming
goaltending.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant's jam and 3-point play with 28.5 seconds left effectively
put the game away, 105-100, as the Kings tossed up a flurry of
errant 3-point tries in the waning seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers extended their home winning streak to nine games and
for the moment dispelled the hex the Kings have on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finding a way to win is a must for good teams,'' Fox said.
``Guys that aren't considered good teams, they fold after being
down 16 points, and against a team like Sacramento, where they
didn't let up, it was up to us to pressure defensively and to find
ways to score. You learn a lesson by losing sometimes more than you
do by winning, but at this stage of the season, you take a win like
that as a learning experience.''

NIT SNUBS NORTHRIDGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Try telling Oregon's men's basketball team Cal
State Northridge is not one of the top 100 teams in the nation this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Ask the Fresno State players if the Matadors are
postseason-worthy.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN beat both those NCAA Tournament teams in December. But it
wasn't enough for the National Invitation Tournament committee,
which passed on Northridge Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors were traveling when the NIT field was announced.
Earlier in the day, coach Bobby Braswell talked about the potential
impact of the first postseason berth in the school's 10-season
history in Division I.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a huge step for the program,'' Braswell said from
his hotel room in Missoula, Mont., where CSUN lost in the Big Sky
Conference tournament final the night before to Northern Arizona in
overtime 85-81. ``The players deserve it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the NIT selection committee looks for attractive matchups,
and the domino effect of upsets in conference tournaments forced
some NCAA Tournament bubble teams into the NIT.
</P>
<P>
   And that ripple effect hurt CSUN, which had a No. 94 ranking in
the NCAA's Ratings Percentage Index (RPI) entering the tournament
final.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Long Beach State's loss in the semifinals of the Big
West tournament. The 49ers were not going to get an NCAA at-large
bid, so they went to the NIT and gobbled up a West Coast slot that
could have gone to Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a gut-wrenching process,'' said Braswell, who went to the
NIT while an assistant at Oregon in 1996, just before becoming
CSUN's coach. ``You just don't know. Literally, it's a group behind
closed doors (making the NIT field). I told our guys last night
that we still had a great season.''
</P>
<P>
   There were several arguments for CSUN getting in:
</P>
<P>
   --Its victory mark.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors finished 20-10, and teams from mid-major
conferences usually get into the postseason with 20 wins. The Big
Sky is on the cusp of respectability, earning an RPI ranking higher
than the Big West this year.
</P>
<P>
   But there was precedent for the NIT snubbing CSUN: Northern
Arizona went 21-8 last year and didn't get an invitation
</P>
<P>
   and the Lumberjacks lost in the Big Sky title game.
</P>
<P>
   --Quality wins.
</P>
<P>
   Northridge clearly played one of the toughest schedules in the
Big Sky; the Matadors' 19 wins against Division I teams were the
most in the conference. And they beat Oregon and Fresno State and
had two wins over Oral Roberts (ORU handed No. 17 Tulsa one of its
four losses).
</P>
<P>
   The wins over the Ducks and Bulldogs were also on the road,
which the NIT likes. CSUN would not have hosted an NIT game at
1,600-seat Matador Gym.
</P>
<P>
   --A strong finish.
</P>
<P>
   The loss to NAU ended a five-game CSUN winning streak, the
longest in the Big Sky up to that point. To get to the final,
Northridge eliminated the defending champion (Weber State) and the
tournament host (Montana).
</P>
<P>
   In the tournament, the Matadors were the second-best offensive
team and the best defensive team.
</P>
<P>
   All of this looked like a bid. Braswell thought so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we deserve it? Absolutely,'' he said after Saturday night's
game. ``To be quite honest with you, the NIT is very political.
I've seen some very strange things. Our goal was to get to the NCAA
Tournament and try to take care of our own business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a definite disappointment for these guys (if there
was no NIT bid).''

LONG BEACH STATE HEADED TO NIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GORDON VERRELL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ D'Cean Bryant was all smiles Sunday evening
at the Pyramid upon learning Long Beach State's men's basketball
team's season was not over, that the 49ers had been selected to
play in the National Invitation Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   It was a far cry from Bryant's emotions the other evening in
Reno, Nev., after the 49ers had lost in overtime to New Mexico
State in the Big West Conference tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to cry,'' Bryant said. ``Other guys were crying, and
I wanted to. But I couldn't. I was in shock.''
</P>
<P>
   And now?
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we can show America what we have . . . prove that we are a
good team,'' Bryant said. ``We can show people that we are not a
fluke, that we have a good program here at Long Beach State.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``proving,'' as Bryant calls it, begins Wednesday night at
7:30 when the 49ers take on the University of California in a
first-round game at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Cal is the defending NIT champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another season,'' said 49er forward Antrone Lee. ``If we
can win the NIT it will make up for (losing in) the Big West
tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Losing in the Big West tournament meant losing out on an
automatic bid to the more prestigious NCAA Tournament. And losing
in the semifinals meant losing any shot at an at-large bid.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Wayne Morgan, the 49ers' coach, said he was still holding
out hope as he watched the NCAA pairings being unveiled Sunday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a long shot hope,'' Morgan acknowledged, ``but I was
hoping something would happen, that somebody would recognize that
we've won 22 of our last 24 games.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone did. The NIT.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at (the NIT) as a postseason tournament,'' Morgan
said. ``It's an opportunity to play more basketball and to bring
more respectability to Long Beach State.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not what we had in mind,'' said Lee, one of four seniors
on the team. ``But we're going to try to go out and win it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited that we accomplished some of our goals,'' Lee
added. ``We won 20 games and we won the Western Division.''
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers take their 24-5 record against Cal (16-14), which
finished seventh in the Pac-10 with a 7-11 conference record.
</P>
<P>
   It's a similar situation to last season for Cal. The Bears were
just 8-10 in the Pac-10 and tied for fifth. Yet they went on to win
the NIT and finished with a 22-11 overall record.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers and Golden Bears have never faced one another on the
basketball court.
</P>
<P>
   The winner will meet the winner between Virginia and Georgetown
in the second round next week.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Braun, the Cal coach, insisted its a major plus to be
selected for the NIT.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're excited,'' he said Sunday night. ``There are some
outstanding teams in this tournament. Any notion that this is a
loser's bracket tournament is dispelled when you look around and
see so many quality teams, and Long Beach State is certainly one of
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen them, and I've been very impressed how well they've
played. No question, they're a quality team.''
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers played one Pac-10 team earlier, beating USC, 76-66, at
the Pyramid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know SC came away impressed,'' Braun said.
</P>
<P>
   Cal played two Big West teams this season and won them both,
beating Pacific, 76-72, on Nov. 27 and beating UC Irvine, 88-61, on
Dec. 18.
</P>
<P>
   It will be the 49ers' first appearance in the postseason in five
years, since they won the Big West tournament in 1995 and then lost
to Utah in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. They will be
making their fifth NIT appearance but first in eight years.
</P>
<P>
   New Mexico State, which knocked the 49ers out of the Big West
tourney last week, is also in the NIT and will meet Arizona State
in the opening round.
</P>
<P>
   One sidebar to a Cal-Long Beach State matchup is Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams would like to land Bryant's brother, Travon, a
standout at Jordan High.
</P>
<P>
   Braun admitted as much, saying, ``I've seen Long Beach play
several times . . . one reason is that we're recruiting the brother
of one of their players.''
</P>

THIS WEEK'S TV HIGHLIGHTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
TODAY 
Check this out: The Cincinnati Enquirer reported last week that a
bank in Ohio filed suit against Denver Nuggets guard Nick Van Exel,
alleging that he fraudulently claimed he couldn't afford to pay his
$19,000 credit card balance. He sent a $12,000 check, and the
employee of the company who accepted it later admitted he was
unaware that Van Exel was an overpaid professional athlete. As the
Lakers start a six-game road trip in Denver tonight, Kobe and Shaq
will remind their former teammate that it's better to push your
credit limit than a nearby referee. NBA: Lakers at Denver, Channel
9, 6 p.m. live. (KCAL also has Thursday's game in Washington on
two-hour delay at 6 p.m. and Friday's game in Detroit on one-hour
delay at 6 p.m.; NBC has Sunday's game in New York at 9 a.m.,
live) 
TUESDAY 
This second installment of ESPN's ``NHL Rules!'' means you can send
e-mail to the analysts during the game. See how Bill Clement reacts
to spamming in the crease. NHL: Ducks at Colorado, ESPN, 5 p.m.
WEDNESDAY 
One team desperate to keep a hold of a good playoff spot. The other
desperate to get into the playoffs. Oh, and they're cross-town
rivals. Drop the puck and get the heck out of the way. NHL: Kings
at Ducks, Fox Sports Net 2, 7:30 p.m. 
THURSDAY 
And the No. 1 reason why UCLA will brush aside Ball State, the alma
mater of David Letterman: 'Cause if they don't, Dave's heart won't
be able to handle a collapse of this proportion. NCAA Tournament:
Midwest and West Regional first rounds, Channel 2, 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.
and 4:30 to 9:30 p.m. (Tipoff for UCLA-Ball State will be
determined today) 
FRIDAY 
And there's more where that came from, as the Malibooers will
attest. NCAA Tournament: East and South Regional first rounds,
Channel 2, 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. and 4:30 to 9:30 p.m. (Tipoff for
Pepperdine-Indiana will be determined today). Also: CBS day-long
coverage continues with the second round at 10 a.m. Saturday and
Sunday) 
SATURDAY 
All's well at the new Indian Wells tennis stadium, especially if
Anna Kournikova decides to make this her first pro tournament win.
Tennis:Tennis Masters Series: Women's final, Channel 11, 1 p.m.;
Men's semifinals, ESPN, 5 and 11 p.m. (tape) (Also: Fox has the
men's final Sunday at noon and ESPN has weekday coverage at noon
each day, plus the women's semifinals at 6 p.m Thursday and noon
Friday). 
SUNDAY 
If Tiger Woods can tear himself away from watching Stanford's Sweet
16 prospects, he might rattle the rims in Arnold Palmer's Bay Hill
Invitational, his first tourney appearance since losing in match
play at La Jolla a few weeks ago. PGA Tour: Bay Hill Invitational,
final round, Channel 4, 1 p.m. (NBC also has the third round
Saturday and USA Network has the first two rounds Thursday and
Friday)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; THE TIMES OF MY LIFE: And My Life With The Times &LR;  By Max
Frankel. Delta, $15.95. The former correspondent and later
executive editor of The New York Times looks back on over 40 years
at the paper, a remarkable career shaped by the Cold War and his
family's escape from Nazi Germany when he was a youth. ``It's a
smart, tough, scrupulous book,'' Ward Just wrote in The New York
Times Book Review in 1999. ``Every reader will learn a very great
deal about how a newspaper works.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SOUTH OF THE BORDER, West of the Sun &LR;  By Haruki Murakami.
Vintage International, $12. This spare, erotically charged tale by
the author of ``The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle'' tracks the intertwined
lives of two Japanese lovers who connect briefly as 12-year-olds
before drifting apart in adolescence. When they meet again as
adults, they still have vivid memories of each other but their
worldly crassness prevents them from recapturing the lost
perfection of their youth. Murakami ``manages, in his sexual
explicitness, to make intimacy real _ appealing and unembarrassing,
innocent even,'' Mary Hawthorne said in The New York Times Book
Review last year. ``This wise and beautiful book is full of hidden
truths.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DEAR GENIUS: The Letters of Ursula Nordstrom &LR;  Collected and
edited by Leonard S. Marcus. HarperCollins, $16.95. The children's
book editor who nurtured writers like E.B. White and Maurice Sendak
reveals her wizardry in nearly 50 years' worth of correspondence,
collected by Leonard S. Marcus. Much of it was composed during her
long career as director of Harper &AMP; Row's Department of Books for
Boys and Girls. Her ``genius glows from these letters,'' Rebecca
Pepper Sinkler wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In  &UR; MARGARET WISE BROWN: Awakened by the Moon &LR;  (Quill/Morrow,
$14), Marcus profiles one of the most famous authors cultivated by
Nordstrom, the prolific and eccentric creator of children's
classics like ``Goodnight Moon.'' In 1992 the reviewer Edith
Kunhardt Davis called this ``an absorbing biography.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HEAVY WATER: And Other Stories &LR;  By Martin Amis. Vintage
International, $12. The author displays startling bravado and
cleverness as he imagines a world in which heterosexuals are
oppressed by the homosexual majority, poets bask in money and
celebrity and a Martian robot knows the fate of the world. ``Amis
applies his comic timing, his perfect pitch and his curatorial eye
to some of the burning issues of our time,'' A.O. Scott wrote last
year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; RIPLEY BOGLE &LR;  By Robert McLiam Wilson. Ballantine, $12.95.
Ripley Bogle is a downtrodden but acutely perceptive Belfast native
who wanders the streets of London recalling the hell of his
childhood and his descent into poverty. In 1998 the reviewer Liam
Callanan called this an uneven novel that details ``the painful
minutiae of homeless existence with aching accuracy.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MAWSON'S WILL: The Greatest Polar Survival Story Ever Written &LR; 
By Lennard Bickel. Steerforth, $15. In 1912 an Antarctic expedition
led by the Australian geologist Douglas Mawson faced disaster when
one of its members disappeared into a crevasse 300 miles from base,
along with a team of dogs and most of the supplies. This is ``a
riveting account'' of their struggle to survive, The New York Times
Book Review wrote in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   During the same period, Robert Falcon Scott was searching for
the South Pole, a journey that ended with the death of Scott and
four others on the return trip, just 11 miles from safety. In  &UR; A
FIRST RATE TRAGEDY: Robert Falcon Scott and the Race to the South
Pole &LR;  (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $14), Diana Preston, a British
journalist, portrays Scott as both a bungler and a genuine hero. In
1998 the reviewer Robert R. Harris called this ``a concise and
readable account'' of Scott's adventures.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SECOND HAND SMOKE &LR;  By Thane Rosenbaum. St. Martin's Griffin,
$13.95. This novel is about a son of Holocaust survivors who grows
up in a home dominated by his tormented mother and later becomes a
Nazi-hunting lawyer. ``The author exhibits considerable grace in
interweaving themes and time frames,'' Richard Lourie wrote in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE LANGUAGE OF CLOTHES &LR;  By Alison Lurie. Owl/Holt, $22.50.
This quirky, illustrated history of fashion and its uses in Western
society was originally published in 1982 and has been reissued with
a new introduction by the author. ``Lurie's contribution ...
appears mainly in the form of droll observations and pithy asides,
especially about sex,'' Walter Goodman wrote.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EAST BAY GREASE &LR;  By Eric Miles Williamson. Picador USA, $13.
T-Bird Murphy, the teen-age narrator of this first novel, takes
refuge from his hard-bitten parents and their world of bikers and
auto garages by combing Oakland's waterfront bars and playing
trumpet. Williamson's ``prose cuts loose in torrid rhythms that
evoke the peril and exuberance of jazz,'' Sally Eckhoff wrote last
year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WIVES OF THE FISHERMEN &LR;  By Angela Huth. Bard/Avon, $12.50. This
novel explores the lifelong friendship between two women _ one
plain, the other beautiful and flirtatious _ in a secluded fishing
village in Scotland. In 1998 the reviewer Julie Gray praised Huth's
``precise and piquant'' prose.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, March 12, moved Saturday and are repeated Monday.
</P>
<P>
   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   POLITICAL-PRINCES-REVIEW (Undated) _ Despite all the
primary-season chatter about a new kind of politics, the contest
has narrowed to these two: Albert A. Gore Jr. and George W. Bush, a
senator's only son and a president's firstborn, and their
respective namesakes. They are political princes with dissimilar
styles but astonishingly similar inheritances. Historians and
political analysts cannot recall an election when both nominees
came of age in the same generation and circumstances. By Frank
Bruni. (`a' category)
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-PUTIN-PETER-REVIEW (Undated) _ A portrait of Peter the
Great hangs in the office of Vladimir Putin. Those who have heard
Putin's paeans to free enterprise and democracy will find this
heartening, invoking an image of Peter as the Westernizing reformer
and the scourge of Russia's xenophobes. Others, who have nervously
watched Putin destroy Grozny or have sensed his belief in a
powerful Russian state, might find the identification alarming,
recalling Peter's singleminded pursuit of a mighty empire. So it
may be helpful to look back at who Czar Peter I really was. By
Serge Schmemann. (`i' category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   SOUTH-POLITICS-REVIEW (Atlanta) _ The South was once solidly
Democratic, then began to shift toward being solidly Republican.
But for now, it seems to be a region where, depending on the place,
the year, the candidates, their resources, the economy and the
issues, either party can prevail. Because the South is more
conservative than other regions, it poses a challenge for Democrat
Al Gore. But in the last two years, Southern Democrats have managed
to stall the GOP advance, and some believe this offers hope for
Gore. If he can split the South, as Bill Clinton did by winning 4
of 11 states in 1992 and 1996, Gore is likely to follow his mentor
to the Oval Office. By Kevin Sack. WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   POPE-APOLOGY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Pope John Paul II's apology for
historical transgressions committed in the name of the Catholic
Church is remarkable but should be viewed within its theological
context _ it will, after all, take place during a Mass and is
consistent with the Christian requirement of repentance for
misdeeds. In an ecumenical sense, the apology is the dramatic
culmination of an unusual period of public penance by major
Christian groups. By Gustav Niebuhr.
</P>
<P>
   GEFFEN-BIO-REVIEW (Hollywood) _ Entertainment mogul David Geffen
is angry about a new biography, ``The Operator,'' that depicts him
as smart, ruthless, abrasive, calculating, generous and
complicated. But while hardly flattering, it's not quite as brutal
as he says it is. It follows two biographical traditions: that of a
famous and powerful subject seeking a respectable biographer _ but
then not wanting the author to probe too deeply _ and that of the
traditional Hollywood biography _ often by writers who are either
flattered and intimidated by their subjects or who have come to
loathe them. By Bernard Weinraub.
</P>
<P>
   HACKER-HANDLES-REVIEW (Undated) _ The fascination with malicious
hacker culture has spawned a profusion of wannabes who tend to be
adolescent denizens of online chat rooms and Internet junkies who
assume nicknames meant to convey tough-guy personas with super-hero
powers but whose actual intimidation factor is closer to Super
Nerd. Indeed, their real threat to national security might be
starting a run on acne medication, but judging from their online
handles, you'd think some of these pretenders could wipe out the
Kremlin with a keystroke while bench-pressing Rush Limbaugh. By
Matt Richtel.
</P>
<P>
   POLITICAL-INSULTS-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Hand-wringing aside,
negative campaigning has been shown to work. But what more can
George W. Bush and Al Gore say after they've called each other a
fool, a liar, a bigot and worse? Plenty, one suspects. As a public
service, here is a trove of insults that can be adapted phase by
phase as the campaign takes off.
</P>
<P>
   F16-SALES-REVIEW (Washington) _ A look at issues involved in
U.S. sales of F-16 fighter aircraft to other countries. By
Elizabeth Becker.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-LEBANON-REVIEW (Jerusalem) _ In less than four months,
Israel may conclude its 18-year national nightmare and end its
occupation of southern Lebanon. Already the Hezbollah has begun to
boast about driving out the Israelis. While that may be true _
Israelis are sick of losing their sons in order to preserve an
occupation of dubious strategic value _ it is also true that Israel
deliberately chose the time and manner of its departure. Any
American tempted to think that the Israeli pullout evokes the
dispiriting U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam should keep that last fact
in mind. By Susan Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   CZECH-ALBRIGHT-REVIEW (Prague) _ Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright will be out of a job in 10 months. So what's a friend to
do? Vaclav Havel had an idea: Albright should succeed him as the
president of the Czech Republic, her birthplace. And as an
absurdist playwright, Havel had no intention of taking no for an
answer. By Steven Erlanger.

   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-to,

list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

   Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending March 4 at
almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000 other

changes in book buying.

   A Primary Loser Who's Something of a Winner &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley is going on vacation. John McCain is going back to
the Senate. And Americans who were energized and entertained by
their candidacies have gone into mourning.
</P>
<P>
   That includes the national press corps. ``I now think of John
McCain as `Uncle Fun,''' said Jonathan Alter, the Newsweek writer
and NBC News commentator, after the Super Tuesday drubbings, from
Maine to New York to Ohio to California, that forced McCain and
Bradley out of the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley withdrew from the race Thursday morning, and McCain did
the same an hour later, as he stood in the brilliant sunlight of
Sedona, Ariz. Which was entirely apt, because of the two, McCain
cast the broader shadow. The unlikely coalition he mobilized, of
independents, moderate Republicans and disaffected Democrats, now
constitutes a crucial swing block in the general election, a group
over which the presumptive nominees, Gov. George W. Bush and Vice
President Al Gore, are now expected to wage a fierce contest.
</P>
<P>
   Although neither of the vanquished contenders offered a ringing
endorsement of the survivors, it was McCain who at week's end was
playing the harder to get. Bush, seeking a rapprochement, sent out
feelers; Gore went out of his way to acknowledge McCain and invite
the senator's fans into his tent.
</P>
<P>
   The finality of Super Tuesday, with 16 states voting the closest
the country has come to a national primary, paved the way for a
long general election campaign. With their war chests all but
depleted _ some $200 million was spent on the primary campaign _
and the polls showing a virtual dead heat, Gore and Bush stand
shoulder to shoulder at the starting line.
</P>
<P>
   That, say analysts across the political spectrum, could make
McCain a de facto kingmaker. ``McCain has lost the Republican
nomination,'' said the conservative pundit William Kristol, ``but
he and what he stands for remain the central issues in the
campaign.''

   The 50-Year-Old Man and the Sea
</P>
<P>
   Normally, when crossing an ocean, a traveler might focus on
having enough legroom. Does it concern Remy Bricka? Nah! As he
crosses the Pacific, he'll have all the room he needs. He's
walking.
</P>
<P>
   No, this is not some loopy gimmick. Bricka, for whatever reason,
has done this sort of thing before. His walk across the Atlantic in
1988 landed him in the Guinness Book of World Records.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe ``walk'' isn't the right word. Bricka, a 50-year-old
French entertainer, has mini-canoes on his feet, a paddle and,
behind him, a catamaran for provisions and naps. Presumably he
doesn't have e-mail, but, yes, there is a Web site
(www.stoeffler.com) that, for French speakers, helps track
``l'homme qui marche sur l'eau.''

   Dow Takes a Sharp Drop While Nasdaq Hits a New High  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The tale of two stock markets continued to confound investors.
It was the best of times for the Nasdaq Composite, which surpassed
the 5,000 mark for the first time on rising technology stocks. But
the more established companies in the Dow Jones industrial average
fell, bringing the average down to 9,796.03 on Tuesday. The split
in the two markets reflects investors' ardor for so-called new
economy stocks, thought to be immune to the ill effects of rising
interest rates. But market strategists doubt that hot technology
companies can remain a safe haven forever.

   The Price for Taking Bribes
</P>
<P>
   China executed Hu Changqing, a former provincial vice governor,
for taking $600,000 in bribes. The government is seeking to
demonstrate its resolve in cracking down on high-level corruption,
which is damaging the Communist Party's reputation. Hu was the
highest official ever put to death for corruption. An investigation
has already linked dozens of relatively high-level local officials
with a $10 billion smuggling ring in Xiamen in southern China. But
many Chinese are skeptical that China's leaders will pursue the
campaign to the top party ranks. When the Xiamen investigation was
about to implicate the wife of the Beijing party chief, Jia
Qinglin, party propaganda departments sprang to life, professing
her innocence.

   American drivers will have plenty of gasoline this summer, say
Energy Department analysts. And they'll pay plenty for it: a
national average $1.56 for a gallon of regular unleaded, much more
in high-cost areas like New York City and California. By 2001,
prices will be on their way down, the analysts said, assuming that
oil countries step up production, as expected, and that there is no

   Boston's ``Big Dig,'' the monumental project to sink the city's
raised Central Artery underground, is presenting even more of a Big
Bill than expected. Its overseers were grilled by lawmakers about
why the federal- and state-financed project will cost at least $12
billion, not the supposedly set-in-stone $10.8 billion, and why
they did not reveal the overrun earlier. They responded that not
everything is controllable when an undertaking is the most complex
urban infrastructure project in the country's history. They have
until Wednesday to come up with a plan to pay for the overrun.

   California Votes In Conservative Initiatives
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by a surge in conservative primary voters, two of the
most controversial measures on the California ballot were
overwhelmingly approved: a ban on the recognition of same-sex
marriages and tough new penalties for juveniles who stray from the
law.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 21, the juvenile crime initiative, allows
prosecutors to try 14-year-olds charged with violent crimes as
adults without a judicial review and makes it easier to incarcerate
youths with adult inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 22, the ``limitations on marriage'' initiative,
anticipates that one day marriage between same-sex couples may be
sanctified somewhere and allows California the right not to
acknowledge those unions.

Developed by a 19-year-old college dropout, the program compiles a

making it easy to find and copy almost any musical selection, free.
A trade association representing the major record labels is suing
the start-up company that distributes the program for contributing

have to sue the college students who are Napster's most avid users

   A Primary Loser Who's Something of a Winner &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley is going on vacation. John McCain is going back to
the Senate. And Americans who were energized and entertained by
their candidacies have gone into mourning.
</P>
<P>
   That includes the national press corps. ``I now think of John
McCain as `Uncle Fun,''' said Jonathan Alter, the Newsweek writer
and NBC News commentator, after the Super Tuesday drubbings, from
Maine to New York to Ohio to California, that forced McCain and
Bradley out of the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley withdrew from the race Thursday morning, and McCain did
the same an hour later, as he stood in the brilliant sunlight of
Sedona, Ariz. Which was entirely apt, because of the two, McCain
cast the broader shadow. The unlikely coalition he mobilized, of
independents, moderate Republicans and disaffected Democrats, now
constitutes a crucial swing block in the general election, a group
over which the presumptive nominees, Gov. George W. Bush and Vice
President Al Gore, are now expected to wage a fierce contest.
</P>
<P>
   Although neither of the vanquished contenders offered a ringing
endorsement of the survivors, it was McCain who at week's end was
playing the harder to get. Bush, seeking a rapprochement, sent out
feelers; Gore went out of his way to acknowledge McCain and invite
the senator's fans into his tent.
</P>
<P>
   The finality of Super Tuesday, with 16 states voting the closest
the country has come to a national primary, paved the way for a
long general election campaign. With their war chests all but
depleted _ some $200 million was spent on the primary campaign _
and the polls showing a virtual dead heat, Gore and Bush stand
shoulder to shoulder at the starting line.
</P>
<P>
   That, say analysts across the political spectrum, could make
McCain a de facto kingmaker. ``McCain has lost the Republican
nomination,'' said the conservative pundit William Kristol, ``but
he and what he stands for remain the central issues in the
campaign.''

<P>
   Normally, when crossing an ocean, a traveler might focus on
having enough legroom. Does it concern Remy Bricka? Nah! As he
crosses the Pacific, he'll have all the room he needs. He's
walking.
</P>
<P>
   No, this is not some loopy gimmick. Bricka, for whatever reason,
has done this sort of thing before. His walk across the Atlantic in
1988 landed him in the Guinness Book of World Records.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe ``walk'' isn't the right word. Bricka, a 50-year-old
French entertainer, has mini-canoes on his feet, a paddle and,
behind him, a catamaran for provisions and naps. Presumably he
doesn't have e-mail, but, yes, there is a Web site
(www.stoeffler.com) that, for French speakers, helps track
``l'homme qui marche sur l'eau.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoeffler, a French food company, is sponsoring Bricka's
7,800-mile, six-month slog from Los Angeles to Sydney. The company

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ In less than four months, Israeli soldiers may well
turn their backs on the nation's 18-year national nightmare and
give up their occupation of southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Already the Hezbollah militia, which successfully waged a war of
attrition against the Israeli forces, has begun to crow that its
guerrillas drove out the strongest army in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   While that may be true _ Israelis are sick of losing their sons
on Lebanese soil in order to preserve an occupation of dubious
strategic value _ it is also true that Israel deliberately chose
the time and manner of its departure.
</P>
<P>
   Any American tempted to think that the pullout from southern
Lebanon evokes the profoundly dispiriting U.S. pullout from Vietnam
should keep that last fact in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a better analogy would be a chess move: By retreating
with his knights (and his pawns in the South Lebanon Army) from the
Lebanese board, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has exposed his
opponents' king.
</P>
<P>
   Syria is the backstage ruler in Lebanon, and it is Syria's power
that Israel is ultimately interested in holding in check. Syria has
more than 30,000 of its own soldiers based in Lebanon, securing not
only Syrian interests but supply lines for Hezbollah whenever
arming the guerrillas suits the regime in Damascus. (Syria can also
veto independent moves by Lebanon's own weak government).
</P>
<P>
   Lately Hezbollah has been particularly aggressive in attacking
Israeli soldiers in the occupied zone. While this has made the
guerrillas look even more heroic in the eyes of many young Arabs in
the region, the mounting casualties also have concentrated minds in
Israel on the significance of Syria and especially the mischief it
could commit through Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in a decision made last week, the Israeli Cabinet has
publicly gotten behind Barak in his determination get Israeli
soldiers out of Lebanon by July, even if there is no peace deal
with Syria to provide a mechanism and cover for the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   It was revealing that instead of unalloyed satisfaction at the
prospect of seeing the back of retreating Israeli soldiers,
Lebanese and Syrian officials reacted to the news with immense
pique.
</P>
<P>
   The view in Israel, expressed with no lack of self-satisfaction,
is that Syria has now lost a bargaining chip in its dealings with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   If there are no more Israelis to kick around in southern
Lebanon, this reasoning goes, it will be too risky diplomatically
and militarily for Syria to allow Hezbollah to continue its
attacks, because the only Israeli targets would be in Israel
itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Syrians want a deal, then unilateral withdrawal will
facilitate it,'' said Foreign Minister David Levy last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli move also undercuts the unusual outbreak of Arab
solidarity that emerged in the last three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the Hezbollah attacks in the security zone in
southern Lebanon, in which seven Israelis were eventually killed,
Israel mounted fierce bombing raids on Lebanese civilian targets.
The destruction of Lebanese electrical generating plants galvanized
the Arab Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Within a week, senior Arab officials were making the pilgrimage
to Beirut to pledge solidarity with Lebanon against Israel and its
occupying force. Even Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, a staunch
advocate of reconciliation between Arab states and Israel, flew to
Lebanon to show his support _ the first time he had ever visited.
</P>
<P>
   It was the greatest display of Arab unity in more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Yet with a single vote in the Cabinet, Israel cracked the common
front. Although nearly all of Israel's neighbors in the Middle East
expressed reservations about a unilateral withdrawal from southern
Lebanon, none could complain too loudly after so forcefully and
recently calling for an end to the Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Rearranging the board, however, is not all to Israel's
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah remains a political force in Lebanon, one that might
become especially emboldened after an Israeli withdrawal to demand
a bigger role in the political and military life of the country. Or
a unilateral Israeli pullout could be followed by still more
attacks and counter-attacks that might escalate to involve Syria or
destabilize Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   A fractured Lebanon is a frightening prospect. For the many Arab
states, it evokes the long civil war that, in 1989, prompted them
to invite Syria to enter Lebanon to bring order. And for Israel,
instability in Lebanon was the justification for invading the
country in 1982, the beginning of the nightmare that is ending only
now.

   The view in Israel, expressed with no lack of self-satisfaction,
is that Syria has now lost a bargaining chip in its dealings with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   If there are no more Israelis to kick around in southern
Lebanon, this reasoning goes, it will be too risky diplomatically
and militarily for Syria to allow Hezbollah to continue its
attacks, because the only Israeli targets would be in Israel
itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Syrians want a deal, then unilateral withdrawal will
facilitate it,'' said Foreign Minister David Levy last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli move also undercuts the unusual outbreak of Arab
solidarity that emerged in the last three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the Hezbollah attacks in the security zone in
southern Lebanon, in which seven Israelis were eventually killed,
Israel mounted fierce bombing raids on Lebanese civilian targets.
The destruction of Lebanese electrical generating plants galvanized
the Arab Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Within a week, senior Arab officials were making the pilgrimage
to Beirut to pledge solidarity with Lebanon against Israel and its
occupying force. Even Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, a staunch
advocate of reconciliation between Arab states and Israel, flew to
Lebanon to show his support _ the first time he had ever visited.
</P>
<P>
   It was the greatest display of Arab unity in more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Yet with a single vote in the Cabinet, Israel cracked the common
front. Although nearly all of Israel's neighbors in the Middle East
expressed reservations about a unilateral withdrawal from southern
Lebanon, none could complain too loudly after so forcefully and
recently calling for an end to the Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Rearranging the board, however, is not all to Israel's
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah remains a political force in Lebanon, one that might
become especially emboldened after an Israeli withdrawal to demand
a bigger role in the political and military life of the country. Or
a unilateral Israeli pullout could be followed by still more
attacks and counter-attacks that might escalate to involve Syria or
destabilize Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   A fractured Lebanon is a frightening prospect. For the many Arab
states, it evokes the long civil war that, in 1989, prompted them
to invite Syria to enter Lebanon to bring order. And for Israel,
instability in Lebanon was the justification for invading the
country in 1982, the beginning of the nightmare that is ending only
now.

NICKNAMES ON THE NET: BIGGER BARK THAN BITE 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)  
(bl) 
 By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A young man who goes by the nickname Kaos confided several
months ago that he wouldn't mind being perceived as a bad-guy
computer hacker, but reputation-wise, things weren't working out.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the menacing image his moniker might conjure, the
19-year-old Kaos wore a retainer and his voice squeaked when he got
excited. ``Even if you're not capable of instilling fear, you think
your alter ego has to be able to,'' said Kaos, whose mom knows him
as Corey.
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubt that computer vandalism is a serious threat, as
evidenced by the arrest last week of Denis M. Moran, 17, for
allegedly hacking into the Web site of the anti-drug organization
DARE, and also by the recent rash of attacks on major e-commerce
sites.
</P>
<P>
   But the fascination with malicious hacker culture has spawned a
profusion of wannabes whose bark is far worse than their bite. They
tend to be adolescent denizens of online chat rooms and Internet
junkies who assume nicknames meant to convey tough-guy personas
with superhero powers but whose actual intimidation factor is
closer to Super Geek.
</P>
<P>
   Their real threat to national security might be starting a run
on acne medication, but judging from their online handles, you'd
think they could wipe out the Kremlin with a keystroke while
bench-pressing Rush Limbaugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extremely important _ your nickname defines who you
are,'' said 25-year-old Brian Hansel, a k a Noid, at last summer's
Defcon, an annual gathering of serious computer hackers,
enthusiasts and hangers-on held in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Hansel explained that his nom de Net derived from an impish
character in a Domino's Pizza advertising campaign, which may say
more about his diet than his hacking prowess. Like many
self-proclaimed hackers, Hansel says he has burned through more
than one ``nick.'' He originally called himself Punisher, but
decided it was too run-of-the-mill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody can call themselves Deathmonger,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It might seem that someone who calls himself Deathmonger would
carry a heavy burden of dishing out death on a whim, but V1RU5 cast
doubt on that theory. ``You know Evil Pete?'' asked V1RU5, whose
name refers to computer viruses but who signs his checks Robert
Lupo. ``He's one of the nicest guys in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The people with the most menacing names are the nicest
people,'' said the 30-something V1RU5, who added that hackers take
their names much less seriously as they age. ``The people with the
least-menacing names are the biggest jerks.''
</P>
<P>
   That's probably an overgeneralization, though Moran's screen
name, Coolio, doesn't sound especially threatening. And Analyzer,
who was arrested in 1998 in Israel in connection with an attack on
U.S. and Israeli government computer systems, chose a nickname that
makes him sound less like a hacker than a psychologist.
</P>
<P>
   Or take Death Veggie, whose nickname seems fairly benign unless
you happen to be a zucchini. Yet the group to which he belongs,
Cult of the Dead Cow, has published software used to break into and
control computers installed with Microsoft's Windows operating
system.
</P>
<P>
   It goes to show that you can't tell much about a person from a
handle _ though in some cases what you see is what you get. Squeak,
a young man no older than 16, said he chose his nickname because of
his high voice. Another teen-ager, Sloth, confessed to being pretty
lazy.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, what you get is more like Walter Mitty. Mistress
Evyl, 21, acknowledged that she's been known to show her unfriendly
side only if someone messes with one of her inner circle. And Spew
said he's had his nickname for a long time, even though he's never
really hacked into anything and frankly isn't very computer savvy.
``Really, I'm more into playing games,'' he said shyly, standing
around with Sloth at Defcon.
</P>
<P>
   Some purists don't like nicknames, whether or not they are apt.
True hackers do constructive work, they say, not by trespassing in
computer systems but by taking apart software programs and
improving them. These hackers don't require the bravado associated
with flashy, ostentatious nicknames.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Raymond, president of Open Source Initiative, a group that

NICKNAMES ON THE NET: BIGGER BARK THAN BITE 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)

<P>
   A young man who goes by the nickname Kaos confided several
months ago that he wouldn't mind being perceived as a bad-guy
computer hacker, but reputation-wise, things weren't working out.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the menacing image his moniker might conjure, the
19-year-old Kaos wore a retainer and his voice squeaked when he got
excited. ``Even if you're not capable of instilling fear, you think
your alter ego has to be able to,'' said Kaos, whose mom knows him
as Corey.
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubt that computer vandalism is a serious threat, as
evidenced by the arrest last week of Denis M. Moran, 17, for
allegedly hacking into the Web site of the anti-drug organization
DARE, and also by the recent rash of attacks on major e-commerce
sites.
</P>
<P>
   But the fascination with malicious hacker culture has spawned a
profusion of wannabes whose bark is far worse than their bite. They
tend to be adolescent denizens of online chat rooms and Internet
junkies who assume nicknames meant to convey tough-guy personas
with superhero powers but whose actual intimidation factor is
closer to Super Geek.
</P>
<P>
   Their real threat to national security might be starting a run
on acne medication, but judging from their online handles, you'd
think they could wipe out the Kremlin with a keystroke while
bench-pressing Rush Limbaugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extremely important _ your nickname defines who you
are,'' said 25-year-old Brian Hansel, a k a Noid, at last summer's
Defcon, an annual gathering of serious computer hackers,
enthusiasts and hangers-on held in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Hansel explained that his nom de Net derived from an impish
character in a Domino's Pizza advertising campaign, which may say
more about his diet than his hacking prowess. Like many
self-proclaimed hackers, Hansel says he has burned through more
than one ``nick.'' He originally called himself Punisher, but
decided it was too run-of-the-mill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody can call themselves Deathmonger,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It might seem that someone who calls himself Deathmonger would
carry a heavy burden of dishing out death on a whim, but V1RU5 cast
doubt on that theory. ``You know Evil Pete?'' asked V1RU5, whose
name refers to computer viruses but who signs his checks Robert
Lupo. ``He's one of the nicest guys in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The people with the most menacing names are the nicest
people,'' said the 30-something V1RU5, who added that hackers take
their names much less seriously as they age. ``The people with the
least-menacing names are the biggest jerks.''
</P>
<P>
   That's probably an overgeneralization, though Moran's screen
name, Coolio, doesn't sound especially threatening. And Analyzer,
who was arrested in 1998 in Israel in connection with an attack on
U.S. and Israeli government computer systems, chose a nickname that
makes him sound less like a hacker than a psychologist.
</P>
<P>
   Or take Death Veggie, whose nickname seems fairly benign unless
you happen to be a zucchini. Yet the group to which he belongs,
Cult of the Dead Cow, has published software used to break into and
control computers installed with Microsoft's Windows operating
system.
</P>
<P>
   It goes to show that you can't tell much about a person from a
handle _ though in some cases what you see is what you get. Squeak,
a young man no older than 16, said he chose his nickname because of
his high voice. Another teen-ager, Sloth, confessed to being pretty
lazy.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, what you get is more like Walter Mitty. Mistress
Evyl, 21, acknowledged that she's been known to show her unfriendly
side only if someone messes with one of her inner circle. And Spew
said he's had his nickname for a long time, even though he's never
really hacked into anything and frankly isn't very computer savvy.
``Really, I'm more into playing games,'' he said shyly, standing
around with Sloth at Defcon.
</P>
<P>
   Some purists don't like nicknames, whether or not they are apt.
True hackers do constructive work, they say, not by trespassing in
computer systems but by taking apart software programs and
improving them. These hackers don't require the bravado associated
with flashy, ostentatious nicknames.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Raymond, president of Open Source Initiative, a group that
promotes the free publication of computer programming languages
owned by corporations, said real hackers give their names readily
while wannabes and malicious types ``try to build a mystique
through concealment and secrecy.''
</P>
<P>
   But Raymond and others probably don't have much to fear from the
likes of Kaos and Spew, whose real assault is on traditional syntax
and spelling.

THE GEFFEN BIOGRAPHY: NOT READY FOR HIS CLOSE-UP 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)  
(bl)

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ He had a quick temper, and friends found it ugly. He
was profane, rapacious and Machiavellian _ a brilliant strategist
who rarely took a step without anticipating the consequences. He
wept easily _ but one film director said he fed on other people
with the hunger of a praying mantis.
</P>
<P>
   These harsh comments were made about the legendary Hollywood
moguls David O. Selznick, Harry Cohn and Louis B. Mayer. Compared
with these men _ whom he idolizes _ David Geffen, the billionaire
entertainment mogul, seems almost benign. Yet Geffen is outraged
and depressed about a new biography, ``The Operator,'' published by
Random House last week, that depicts him as _ surprise! surprise! _
smart, ruthless, abrasive, calculating, generous and complicated.
</P>
<P>
   What especially disturbs Geffen is that he handpicked his
biographer, Tom King. King believes he was chosen because he is a
reporter with The Wall Street Journal and because, like Geffen,
he's gay. What Geffen wanted was a book that treated him like the
Omaha investor Warren Buffett _ another idol. But his personality
is more colorful than that of Buffett, who never wanted to marry
Cher or pal around with Calvin Klein.
</P>
<P>
   So Geffen got a warts-and-all biography that, while hardly
flattering, is not quite as brutal as he says it is. The book
details Geffen's climb from an unhappy Brooklyn boyhood to the
pinnacle of Hollywood success in the music business and, currently,
as a partner at DreamWorks SKG. Along the way, his relationships
soured with several artist-clients and music executives, and he is
portrayed, at worst, as a bully willing to sacrifice friends to
achieve enormous wealth.
</P>
<P>
   ``David very much wanted a serious book about him,'' King said.
``I think he was bowled over by the notion that a Wall Street
Journal reporter would spend two years examining his life.'' King
said it was ``enormously brave'' of Geffen to open virtually every
door to him, including interviews with a psychiatrist the mogul saw
as a child and several former lovers. ``Even though David withdrew
his cooperation roughly halfway through,'' he said, ``to my
knowledge he didn't once tell people after that point that they
shouldn't talk to me.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the Geffen book follows two biographical
traditions. One is of the well-known, powerful and controlling
subject seeking a respectable biographer _ but then not wanting
candor. The most recent example is Edmund Morris' biography of
Ronald Reagan, ``Dutch'' (Random House, 1999). Morris, a Pulitzer
Prize winner who was handpicked by the Reagans, spent 10 years
researching the former president's life and created a bizarre
biography, using fictional devices. The portrayal was extremely
harsh.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the Hollywood tradition of biographies _ often
by writers who are either flattered and intimidated by their
subjects or come to loathe them. ( King seems neutral about
Geffen.) Certainly Geffen took an unusual risk that other Hollywood
moguls, like Michael Ovitz and Michael Eisner, avoided. He sought a
serious biographer who controlled what he wrote. Compare that with
Ovitz, whose pallid biography in 1997 never caused a stir. Or
compare it with Eisner, whose autobiographical book, ``Work in
Progress'' (Random House, 1998), was criticized for its lack of
candor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Biographies here tend to be simplistic, veering from
hagiography to portrait of the devil as a young man,'' said Robert
Bookman, a top literary agent at Creative Artists Agency. ``They're
often either black or white, as opposed to a more complex and
realistic portrayal.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeanine Basinger, chairman of the film studies department at
Wesleyan University and author of several scholarly books about
Hollywood, put it another way: ``There's sort of an attitude _
everyone hates a mogul. If you write a nasty book about a star,
half the people out there may be fans who won't like it and won't
buy it. But if you write about a mogul, no one cares. No one
defends moguls. They don't have fans. They're guys who care about
money and power.''
</P>
<P>
   Geffen cares, most certainly, about money and power. But he is
not quite in the same league as the great moguls of the 1930s and
'40s whose power and cultural influence _ far more than he has ever
had _ were matched by outsized, often savage personalities. In his
book ``An Empire of Their Own'' (Crown, 1988), Neal Gabler called
Jack Warner, who founded Warner Brothers with his brother, Harry,
``crude, vulgar, shallow, flashy, contrary and galling.'' ( Geffen
purchased Harry Warner's 13,600-square-foot mansion in Beverly
Hills, and all its contents, for $47.5 million in 1990.)
</P>
<P>
   The brilliant but irascible Harry Cohn, who built a movie empire
as president of Columbia Pictures, kept a photo of Mussolini in his
office. ``He was the meanest man I ever knew _ an unreconstructed
dinosaur,'' Budd Schulberg, the writer, once said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohn provoked perhaps the most famous quotation ever made about
a Hollywood mogul. His funeral in 1958 included some of the biggest
stars in town. Mourners packed two studio sound stages. After
attending the funeral, the comedian Red Skelton said, ``Well, it
only proves what they always say _ give the public something they
want to see, and they'll come out for it.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Geffen, the archetype of the contemporary mogul, is
complex, benevolent at times with his money and even a bit
vulnerable. But a mogul is a mogul. ``None of these guys got to be
moguls by being a boy scout,'' King said. On that point, Geffen
would probably agree with his biographer.

MEA CULPA: THE POPE APOLOGIZES FOR HIS CHURCH 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)  
(bl) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With his special Mass at the Vatican on Sunday, Pope John Paul
II has set out to do what none of his 262 predecessors felt called
to do: apologize for historical transgressions committed by Roman
Catholics in the name of the church.
</P>
<P>
   In so doing, John Paul _ whose pontificate has been remarkable
in many ways, from his globe-circling pastoral travels to his
support for democratic change in Eastern Europe _ is acknowledging
the grim side of the church's past, in eras distinguished by forced
conversions, support for the Crusades (whose violence fell on Jews,
Muslims and Eastern Orthodox Christians) and creation of the
Inquisition.
</P>
<P>
   No one can deny that his statement of mea culpa will be a
significant event in the life of the church, as it may also be for
the descendants of those who fell victim to its persecution. But
the pope's apology should also be viewed within its theological
context _ it will, after all, take place during a Mass and is fully
in keeping with the Christian belief that repentance of misdeeds is
necessary to future service to God. ``Forgive us our trespasses,''
asks the prayer that, according to the Gospels, Jesus taught his
disciples.
</P>
<P>
   In an ecumenical sense, the apology is the dramatic culmination
of an unusual period of public penance by major Christian groups.
In the mid-1990s, for example, three American Protestant
denominations issued statements of repentance _ the Southern
Baptists for supporting slavery and segregation, the Evangelical
Lutheran Church in America for anti-Jewish writings by the
Reformation leader Martin Luther, and the United Methodists for the
brutality of a lay preacher who led a Civil War-era Indian massacre
in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Of greater global impact, however, was another, recent statement
by the Vatican _ the 1998 ``call to penitence'' on behalf of
Catholics who remained silent in the face of the Holocaust. ``We
deeply regret the errors and failures of those sons and daughters
of the church,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   That document provoked a contentious reaction, some hailing it
as a boon to Catholic-Jewish relations, others criticizing its
cautious tone and failure to acknowledge Pope Pius XII's refusal to
speak out publicly against the Nazi genocide.
</P>
<P>
   This apology may evoke a similar response. A preliminary
document released by the Vatican two weeks ago made it clear that
the apology would have limits, that it will be offered on behalf of
the church's ``sons and daughters,'' but not the church itself,
which is considered holy, the bride of Christ. It was also most
unlikely that the pope would discuss blame for specific events _ no
naming names, in other words.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a kind of politically correct exercise in
self-abnegation,'' said George Weigel, a senior fellow at the
Ethics and Public Policy Center in Washington and author of a
recent biography of John Paul II, ``Witness to Hope''
(HarperCollins). ``This is the pope making plain in a liturgical
context that the people of the church have failed to make plain the
truth that the church bears.''
</P>
<P>
   Some may wonder whether the pope will somehow undercut the
church's doctrine of papal infallibility by effectively rejecting
actions of some of his predecessors. But his apology can also be
understood as affirming that doctrine, which applies to the
church's teaching on Christian faith and morals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the acts which contradict the teachings, which make the
apology pertinent,'' said the Rev. Michael J. Baxter, a professor
of theology at the University of Notre Dame. The apology
acknowledges that the church, through the men and women who make up
its ranks, ``has strayed from its own mission,'' Baxter said. ``And
yet that doesn't undermine the integrity of the mission, which
impresses its importance on us all the more.''
</P>
<P>
   One might ask, too, why now? After all, it's been centuries
since the Crusades and Inquisition.
</P>
<P>
   The answer may lie in timing, personal outlook and recent
history: the symbolic significance of the dawn of the third
Christian millennium, combined with the readiness of this
particular pontiff to face the past, and a watershed event in the
church's history (the reformist Second Vatican Council of the
1960s) that provided the institutional basis for making such a
reckoning possible.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the pope's apology comes during a Year of Jubilee,
a Holy Year, when tens of millions of Catholics are expected to
make a pilgrimage to Rome. March 12 is also the first Sunday in
Lent, the 40-day fast in the church calendar that precedes Easter.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's no coincidence, I'm quite sure,'' said Baxter. ``Lent
is a time of reconciliation.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea that in order to follow Christ, ``one needs to begin
from a disposition of repentance'' is a recurring and vital theme
in John Paul's encyclicals, Baxter said, adding that it has been an
essential tradition of the church that a confessional examination
of the past is required if one is to move forward faithfully into
the future.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Baxter said, by offering an apology for past
transgressions, a gesture that would include the Crusades and the
Inquisition, the pope is giving a new endorsement to the most
controversial document of the Second Vatican Council, the
Declaration on Religious Freedom, promulgated in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   That document, heavily influenced by the thinking of the
American theologian John Courtney Murray, rejected the idea that
religious and political power should be linked. It treated the idea
of religious pluralism with respect and declared that people accept
faith as a free act and cannot be compelled to do so. ``In order to
convey the truth,'' Baxter said, ``how one conveys it makes all the
difference in the world. And one cannot convey that unless one
embodies the peace of God revealed in Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   But what effect will the pope's apology have in the wider
Catholic world? Will it inspire Catholics in Europe (scene of the
Crusades and Inquisition) to reflect more positively on religious
minorities in their midst? ``Now the question is, how much of this
will be implemented at the pew level?'' said Rabbi Leon Klenicki,
interreligious affairs director of the Anti-Defamation League of
B'nai B'rith.

of the church,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   That document provoked a contentious reaction, some hailing it
as a boon to Catholic-Jewish relations, others criticizing its
cautious tone and failure to acknowledge Pope Pius XII's refusal to
speak out publicly against the Nazi genocide.
</P>
<P>
   This apology may evoke a similar response. A preliminary
document released by the Vatican two weeks ago made it clear that
the apology would have limits, that it will be offered on behalf of
the church's ``sons and daughters,'' but not the church itself,
which is considered holy, the bride of Christ. It was also most
unlikely that the pope would discuss blame for specific events _ no
naming names, in other words.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a kind of politically correct exercise in
self-abnegation,'' said George Weigel, a senior fellow at the
Ethics and Public Policy Center in Washington and author of a
recent biography of John Paul II, ``Witness to Hope''
(HarperCollins). ``This is the pope making plain in a liturgical
context that the people of the church have failed to make plain the
truth that the church bears.''
</P>
<P>
   Some may wonder whether the pope will somehow undercut the
church's doctrine of papal infallibility by effectively rejecting
actions of some of his predecessors. But his apology can also be
understood as affirming that doctrine, which applies to the
church's teaching on Christian faith and morals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the acts which contradict the teachings, which make the
apology pertinent,'' said the Rev. Michael J. Baxter, a professor
of theology at the University of Notre Dame. The apology
acknowledges that the church, through the men and women who make up
its ranks, ``has strayed from its own mission,'' Baxter said. ``And
yet that doesn't undermine the integrity of the mission, which
impresses its importance on us all the more.''
</P>
<P>
   One might ask, too, why now? After all, it's been centuries
since the Crusades and Inquisition.
</P>
<P>
   The answer may lie in timing, personal outlook and recent
history: the symbolic significance of the dawn of the third
Christian millennium, combined with the readiness of this
particular pontiff to face the past, and a watershed event in the
church's history (the reformist Second Vatican Council of the
1960s) that provided the institutional basis for making such a
reckoning possible.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the pope's apology comes during a Year of Jubilee,
a Holy Year, when tens of millions of Catholics are expected to
make a pilgrimage to Rome. March 12 is also the first Sunday in
Lent, the 40-day fast in the church calendar that precedes Easter.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's no coincidence, I'm quite sure,'' said Baxter. ``Lent
is a time of reconciliation.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea that in order to follow Christ, ``one needs to begin
from a disposition of repentance'' is a recurring and vital theme
in John Paul's encyclicals, Baxter said, adding that it has been an
essential tradition of the church that a confessional examination
of the past is required if one is to move forward faithfully into
the future.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Baxter said, by offering an apology for past
transgressions, a gesture that would include the Crusades and the
Inquisition, the pope is giving a new endorsement to the most
controversial document of the Second Vatican Council, the
Declaration on Religious Freedom, promulgated in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   That document, heavily influenced by the thinking of the
American theologian John Courtney Murray, rejected the idea that
religious and political power should be linked. It treated the idea
of religious pluralism with respect and declared that people accept
faith as a free act and cannot be compelled to do so. ``In order to
convey the truth,'' Baxter said, ``how one conveys it makes all the
difference in the world. And one cannot convey that unless one
embodies the peace of God revealed in Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   But what effect will the pope's apology have in the wider
Catholic world? Will it inspire Catholics in Europe (scene of the
Crusades and Inquisition) to reflect more positively on religious
minorities in their midst? ``Now the question is, how much of this
will be implemented at the pew level?'' said Rabbi Leon Klenicki,
interreligious affairs director of the Anti-Defamation League of
B'nai B'rith.

CAMPAIGNING IN THE NEW, NOT-SO-SOLID SOUTH 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Once it was solid, solidly Democratic. Then it began
shifting, seemingly inexorably, toward becoming solidly Republican.
And now? For the moment, at least, the South seems to have settled
into a state of bipartisan equilibrium, where depending on the
place, the year, the candidates, their resources, the economy and
the issues, either party can prevail.
</P>
<P>
   That new dynamic could make the South an interesting place to
watch in November. Because the region remains more conservative
than the rest of the country, it poses formidable challenges for
the presumptive Democratic nominee, Vice President Al Gore. Indeed,
recent polls show Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the apparent
Republican nominee, with a healthy lead over Gore in the South,
even as he trails the vice president in the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, however, Southern Democrats have managed
to stall the Republican advance, even in the most conservative
states, and some believe those successes provide a glimmer of hope
for Gore. If the vice president can split the South, as President
Clinton did by winning four of 11 Southern states in both 1992 and
1996, he is likely to follow his mentor to the White House. In the
three presidential elections before Clinton, the Democratic Party's
sole Southern success was Jimmy Carter's 1980 victory in his native
Georgia (one of only six states he won nationwide in that
Republican landslide election.) .
</P>
<P>
   As the remnants of the presidential primary campaign move south
this week, with contests on Tuesday in Texas, Florida, Tennessee,
Louisiana, Mississippi and Oklahoma, the candidates will encounter
a kinetic political landscape that is still searching for partisan
definition. Recent elections suggest there simply is no majority
party these days in the South, a region where the politics of the
moment are often pitched by crosscurrents of race, religion,
migration and economics.
</P>
<P>
   Today's South is a place where conservative whites in
southwestern Georgia can embrace a black Democratic congressman,
Sanford D. Bishop Jr., while their compatriots in South Carolina
and Alabama rally for the Confederate battle flag .
</P>
<P>
   To prevent Bush from restoring the Republican lock on the South,
Gore will have to follow a formula tested in recent years by an
array of Democratic candidates. It calls for focusing on mainstream
concerns like education, Social Security, managed care and urban
sprawl, depicting Republicans as right-wing extremists, and
maximizing black turnout.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans maintain that recent Democratic successes may
be as attributable to local circumstances as to any regional
realignment. But Democrats argue that more enduring forces may be
at work. Clinton, though disdained for his moral lapses, has
demonstrated that Democrats can manage the economy, they say.
Welfare reform has disarmed the Republicans of one of their most
lethal weapons, and prosperity has quieted the clamor for tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   A smoking economy and the passage of time have softened racial
tensions, raising the stakes for Republican candidates who employ
racial tactics. And while they are predominantly Republican, the
more than 1 million migrants who flood into the region each year
tend to be less conservative than native white Southerners.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy E. Barnes of Georgia, who has won high ratings by
championing school reform and fighting sprawl, maintains that
Southern Democrats have learned how to win again. ``We centrist
Democrats and the African-American community have come together in
a coalition that encompasses a base of middle-class whites,'' he
said. ``It's a new emerging common ground, and let me tell you,
it's a force to be reckoned with.''
</P>
<P>
   Although troubled by Democratic victories in 1998 and 1999,
Southern Republicans assert that there is plenty of room for their
party to grow with help from continuing immigration, term limits,
reapportionment and redistricting. The key, as in the rest of the
country, may be whether Republicans can reassure the middle by
distancing themselves from the unbending social conservatism
promoted by the party's right wing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to be better politicians and learn how to package
our campaigns,'' said Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La. ``We've got to hold
to our conservative credentials and yet speak in more moderate
terms.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last 40 years, the 11 states of the old Confederacy have
undergone a striking political transformation. First gradually, and
then with runaway speed, a party that barely existed has supplanted
a party that dominated at every level.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, there were no Southern Republicans in the U.S. Senate,
none serving as governor, and only seven among the region's 106
members of the House. As recently as 1980, only 17 percent of
Southern state legislators were Republicans, and there were
legislative houses in three separate Southern states _ Alabama,
Arkansas and Louisiana _ without a single Republican member.
</P>
<P>
   By 1998, the apex of Republican strength, the numbers presented
nearly a mirror image. Eight of the South's 11 governors, 15 of its
22 U.S. senators and 71 of its 125 members of Congress were
Republicans. In state legislatures, where the power of incumbency
has made change more grudging, Republicans now hold 42 percent of
all seats and control six chambers. Republicans also have made
gains in the suburbs of metropolitan areas like Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that the South did not grow appreciably more
conservative during these years. But they indicate that beginning
in the Reagan years, conservative Southerners have increasingly
identified themselves as Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half of the 20th century, solid Democratic control
of the South was vital to the preservation of white supremacy. That
rationale began to disintegrate when national Democratic leaders
broke with the party's Southern wing and aligned with the cause of
civil rights.

   Many Southern whites then found a home in the Republican Party,
which was already compatible with their views on economics and
defense, and which lured defectors by playing the race card.
Paradoxically, Southern blacks, many of them just gaining the right
to vote, then flocked to the once-segregationist Democratic Party
because of its national leaders' views on race.
</P>
<P>
   The result was an almost exclusively white Republican Party,
which is now dominated by religious conservatives, and a biracial
Democratic Party where black voters play an equally influential
role. That racial dynamic has generated a tried-and-true electoral
equation, said Merle Black, an Emory University political
scientist. ``The Democrats can count on 90 percent of the black
vote but typically need 40 percent of the white vote to win,'' he
said. ``The Republican Party starts with almost nothing of the
black vote and thus needs 60 percent of the white vote.''
</P>
<P>
   For most of the last two decades, that calculus has favored the
Republicans. But in the last two years the trend lines have
shifted.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Democratic candidates defeated Republican incumbent
governors in Alabama and South Carolina, hung on to the Georgia
governorship in a tough race and lost the seat in Florida. The
Democrats also picked up one Senate seat that year, in North
Carolina. They stopped the Republican advance in the House and gave
up only eight legislative seats in 1,782 elections, far fewer than
usual. Last year, the Democrats added the governorship of
Mississippi. In addition, there has been a slowdown in
Democrat-to-Republican party switching.
</P>
<P>
   Those results suggested that centrist Democrats have learned to
unite voters around kitchen-table issues, even if their positions
upset Democratic interest groups. Republicans, by contrast, remain
bewildered about how to both accommodate and control their right
wing, a point driven home by this year's primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to the Democrats in the '70s and '80s is now
replaying itself with the Republicans,'' said Rep. Harold E. Ford
Jr., D-Tenn. ``There's a discomfort on the part of many Republicans
for their party to be known for prayer in schools, pro-life, racial
intolerance, Bob Jones and the Confederate flag.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, a Republican, said that Southern
voters are now less concerned with party labels than with
performance in areas like education and children's health care.
``The Republicans who have proven winners are ones who have tried
not to sell their brand but have tried to sell their cereal,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Rep. Gene Taylor, a conservative Mississippi
Democrat, said that his party has been helped by the anemic record
of the Republican Congress. ``What I now see is people falling out
of love with the Republicans,'' he said. ``It doesn't necessarily
mean they're in love with the Democrats, but the infatuation with
the Republicans has passed. So it's now up to the individual
candidates to prove their case. And that's the way it should be.''

PETER AND PUTIN: EASTERN OR WESTERN? BOTH. AND NEITHER. 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)  
(bl) 
 By SERGE SCHMEMANN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is said that a portrait of Peter the Great hangs in the
office of Vladimir Putin, the acting president of Russia, who seems
likely to win the presidential election March 26.
</P>
<P>
   Those in the West who perceive Peter as the Westernizing
reformer and scourge of xenophobes, and who have heard Putin's
paeans to free enterprise and democracy, are likely to find this
heartening.
</P>
<P>
   Others, who know Peter primarily for his unrelenting pursuit of
power and empire, and who have nervously watched the Kremlin's new
master, a former KGB agent, presiding over the destruction of
Grozny and expounding the glories of a strong Russian state, might
find the identification alarming.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the presumed dichotomy between the ``good'' westernizing
reformer and the ``reactionary'' Russian nationalist has shaped _
and sometimes distorted _ much of the discussion about Putin, as it
has about other Soviet and Russian leaders. In the end, they have
all defied these imposed categories, from the ``whiskey sipping''
Yuri Andropov to the democratic champion Boris Yeltsin, forever
leaving a disappointed West wondering, ``Who lost Russia?''
</P>
<P>
   So it might be useful at this juncture in Russian history to
look back at the ruler who first turned Russia westward, and at why
the Russians anointed him as ``the Great.''
</P>
<P>
   Russians' historical image of Czar Peter I, who ruled from 1682
to 1725, was shaped by their greatest poet. Ask a provincial pupil
or a vodka-addled bum how St. Petersburg was founded, and they will
instinctively launch into the opening lines of Pushkin's ``Bronze
Horseman'': ``On the shore of desolate seas/ stood he, full of
great thoughts . . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``He'' is a mighty giant _ Peter stood 6 foot 7 and could rip
leather soles with his bare hands _ who imposes greatness on a
backward-looking, indolent nation through sheer force of will.
Pushkin's Peter is an almost mystical czar/creator, a ``powerful
master of fate,'' a ``miracle-working builder.'' Ordaining that his
brilliant new capital be raised in the swampy delta of the Neva
River, he proclaims: ``By nature we are fated here/ To hew a window
into Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   That this epic feat opened Russia to the West and established it
as a major power certainly qualifies Peter to be remembered as
``the Great.'' But it is another question whether that ranks him as
a westernizer or a Russian nationalist _ or whether these have ever
been the relevant categories for judging any Russian leader, Putin
included.
</P>
<P>
   That the superhuman image of Peter was sculpted for the Russians
by a poet who otherwise bridled at any authority is curious, but
not surprising. The window Peter opened into Europe created the
dynamic clash of East and West in which a brilliant culture was
forged, and in which Pushkin himself was reared a century later.
</P>
<P>
   It was a culture in which poets like Pushkin or Brodsky were
forever worshiped as bearers of a higher truth and forever hounded
as threats to the omnipotence of the state. This gave their art a
power that neither East nor West alone could have sustained.
</P>
<P>
   Also curious, and unsurprising, is that the greatest antipathy
for Peter persists among Russian xenophobes of the sort who believe
in a mythical and unique ``Holy Russia.'' That he expanded Russia's
borders far beyond Muscovy's swampy forests and assumed the
grandiose title of Emperor of All the Russias has always been of
little consolation to hard-core Russophiles; to this day they
cannot forgive Peter for his hostility to Holy Russia _ for rudely
hacking off the great beards of the boyars, subjugating the
Orthodox Church to the state and abandoning ancient Moscow for a
Rococo new capital designed by Europeans. Indeed, he gave this new
capital a consummately foreign name, the Dutch ``Sankt-Piterburkh''
(it was Russified as Petrograd in World War I, and known as
Leningrad during the Soviet era).
</P>
<P>
   That identification of reform with Western models, and of
resistance to it with the symbols of Holy Russia, set the model for
all subsequent reformers _ Alexander II imposing Western-style
uniforms and sidewhiskers on his officers, Lenin in a three-piece
suit forcing peasants into collectives, Mikhail Gorbachev launching
his perestroika with an assault on vodka.
</P>
<P>
   So it should not have come as the surprise it did to the
Kremlin's servile ideologues that Stalin chose not to purge Peter
along with the rest of Russia's ``feudal'' past; instead, he kept
Peter _ or at least a politically correct version of him _ in the
Bolshevik version of Russian history. Perhaps the notion of a
predecessor who thought nothing of sacrificing tens of thousands of
his subjects for the greater good of the state found a certain
resonance in the master of the gulag.

</P>
<P>
   In the West, meanwhile, Peter evolved into something of a great
individualist driven by the longing to reform his backward society,
to make it Western. He became the template for the sort of Russian
the West believes it likes to do business with _ Catherine the
Great, Andropov, Gorbachev, the ``liberal reformers'' of Yeltsin's
administrations.
</P>
<P>
   No matter that Peter's real intention for his perestroika, much
like Gorbachev's for his, was not to emulate or join the West, but
to use it _ in the czar's own elegant (and possibly apocryphal)
phrase, ``We need Europe for a few decades, then we must show it
our rear end.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter that the pursuit of happiness by his people was never
even remotely a factor in Peter's reforming zeal, and that he never
entertained the notion that his subjects had rights. Once it
identifies a reformer, it takes a lot for the West to lose faith _
or, in the presumptuous parlance of Washington, to lose Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that is Peter's true greatness, that in his enormous
contradictions _ his voracious appetites and his extraordinary
curiosity, his frightening cruelty and his grand visions, his
physical prowess and his bouts of madness, his hatred of Russian
slovenliness and his profound Russianness _ he both fostered and
reflected the ambivalent greatness of his nation.
</P>
<P>
   In Pushkin's masterpiece, Peter is the ``powerful master of
fate,'' but he is also a terrible apparition of a relentless and
oppressive bronze horseman that drives a poor clerk to madness and
death in the flood-soaked alleys of St. Petersburg. Peter's pursuit
of greatness and power, and the misery and sacrifice they created,
have defined all subsequent cycles of Russian and Soviet history.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, of course, is no Peter. The KGB lieutenant colonel who
was abruptly bumped into the presidential throne of a nation in
total disarray comes nowhere near ``the Great'' in ambition,
potential, drive or physical height. And too little is known at
this stage to predict his behavior once he is elected.
</P>
<P>
   But in any speculation about whether he is reformer or
nationalist, autocrat or democrat, Western or Eastern, it must be
kept in mind that in Russia these have never been mutually
exclusive; that the most potent driving force in Russian history
has been neither the sentimental xenophobia of bearded Slavophiles
nor the pursuit of American-style happiness, but a deep-seated
conviction that the Russian state is destined for greatness, power
and respect. That has been true whether Russia aspired to being an
empire, a utopia or a presidential republic.
</P>
<P>
   The cyclical bouts of westernizing and reforming have always
more to do with power than with democracy, more with matching the
West than with joining it, more with discipline than with rule of
law.

PETER AND PUTIN: EASTERN OR WESTERN? BOTH. AND NEITHER. 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)  
(bl) 
 By SERGE SCHMEMANN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is said that a portrait of Peter the Great hangs in the
office of Vladimir Putin, the acting president of Russia, who seems
likely to win the presidential election March 26.
</P>
<P>
   Those in the West who perceive Peter as the Westernizing
reformer and scourge of xenophobes, and who have heard Putin's
paeans to free enterprise and democracy, are likely to find this
heartening.
</P>
<P>
   Others, who know Peter primarily for his unrelenting pursuit of
power and empire, and who have nervously watched the Kremlin's new
master, a former KGB agent, presiding over the destruction of
Grozny and expounding the glories of a strong Russian state, might
find the identification alarming.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the presumed dichotomy between the ``good'' westernizing
reformer and the ``reactionary'' Russian nationalist has shaped _
and sometimes distorted _ much of the discussion about Putin, as it
has about other Soviet and Russian leaders. In the end, they have
all defied these imposed categories, from the ``whiskey sipping''
Yuri Andropov to the democratic champion Boris Yeltsin, forever
leaving a disappointed West wondering, ``Who lost Russia?''
</P>
<P>
   So it might be useful at this juncture in Russian history to
look back at the ruler who first turned Russia westward, and at why
the Russians anointed him as ``the Great.''
</P>
<P>
   Russians' historical image of Czar Peter I, who ruled from 1682
to 1725, was shaped by their greatest poet. Ask a provincial pupil
or a vodka-addled bum how St. Petersburg was founded, and they will
instinctively launch into the opening lines of Pushkin's ``Bronze
Horseman'': ``On the shore of desolate seas/ stood he, full of
great thoughts . . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``He'' is a mighty giant _ Peter stood 6 foot 7 and could rip
leather soles with his bare hands _ who imposes greatness on a
backward-looking, indolent nation through sheer force of will.
Pushkin's Peter is an almost mystical czar/creator, a ``powerful
master of fate,'' a ``miracle-working builder.'' Ordaining that his
brilliant new capital be raised in the swampy delta of the Neva
River, he proclaims: ``By nature we are fated here/ To hew a window
into Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   That this epic feat opened Russia to the West and established it
as a major power certainly qualifies Peter to be remembered`ls
``the Great.'' But it is another question whether that ranks him as
a westernizer or a Russian nationalist _ or whether these have ever
been the relevant categories for judging any Russian leader, Putin
included.
</P>
<P>
   That the superhuman image of Peter was sculpted for the Russians
by a poet who otherwise bridled at any authority is curious, but
not surprising. The window Peter opened into Europe created the
dynamic clash of East and West in which a brilliant culture was
forged, and in which Pushkin himself was reared a century later.
</P>
<P>
   It was a culture in which poets like Pushkin or Brodsky were
forever worshiped as bearers of a higher truth and forever hounded
as threats to the omnipotence of the state. This gave their art a
power that neither East nor West alone could have sustained.
</P>
<P>
   Also curious, and unsurprising, is that the greatest antipathy
for Peter persists among Russian xenophobes of the sort who believe
in a mythical and unique ``Holy Russia.'' That he expanded Russia's
borders far beyond Muscovy's swampy forests and assumed the
grandiose title of Emperor of All the Russias has always been of
little consolation to hard-core Russophiles; to this day they
cannot forgive Peter for his hostility to Holy Russia _ for rudely
hacking off the great beards of the boyars, subjugating the
Orthodox Church to the state and abandoning ancient Moscow for a
Rococo new capital designed by Europeans. Indeed, he gave this new
capital a consummately foreign name, the Dutch ``Sankt-Piterburkh''

all subsequent reformers _ Alexander II imposing Western-style
uniforms and sidewhiskers on his officers, Lenin in a three-piece
suit forcing peasants into collectives, Mikhail Gorbachev launching
his perestroika with an assault on vodka.

FROM THE RULING CLASS, MEET THE NEXT PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)  
(DUPLICATION NOTICE: Also filed in `p' category) 
(bl) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of them was born just a dozen blocks from the White House
and reared, at least when Congress was in session, in a hotel set
amid the embassies of Washington. The other knew 1600 Pennsylvania
Avenue as the place where his father worked for a dozen years in
successive jobs: vice president of the United States for two-thirds
of that time, president for the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Their parallel paths of privilege took them past landmarks that
were different in name but identical in spirit: St. Albans School
and Harvard University for one, Phillips Academy and Yale
University for the other.
</P>
<P>
   And politics pumped so strongly in their blood that one of them
first ran for a seat in the House of Representatives _ the same
seat his father had once occupied _ in 1976, at the age of just 28.
(He won.) The other lagged only two years behind, making his own
bid for Congress in 1978 at the age of 32. (He lost.)
</P>
<P>
   Now, despite all the primary-season chatter about giving
Americans a new kind of politics, despite the tussles in both
parties over which presidential contender could bring a fresh and
unjaded perspective to governing, the contest has narrowed to these
two: Albert A. Gore Jr. and George W. Bush, a former senator's only
son and a former president's firstborn _ namesakes and political
princes with dissimilar styles but astonishingly similar
inheritances.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential historians and political analysts said they could
not recall a previous election in American history when the
nominees (presumptive, for now) of both major parties were not only
such prominent political heirs but also from such similar stations
and members of the same generation.
</P>
<P>
   That equivalence could simply be accidental, the analysts said,
but several said it speaks in part to the state of politics and the
mood of the electorate. It also imbues this year's presidential
race with an unusual and fascinating dynamic: among the challenges
facing both Vice President Gore and Bush, the Texas governor, is
how they relate to their political ancestries, particularly the
degree to which they reap the benefits of their backgrounds while
avoiding the drawbacks. That balancing act has been a theme in both
men's careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think either of them is going to have a slogan of
`Vote for me, keep the tradition alive,''' said Bill Carrick, a
Democratic strategist, adding that such bald elevations of pedigree
over merit would surely invite rejection.
</P>
<P>
   But to some extent, he and other political analysts noted, the
Democratic voters who backed Gore and the Republican voters who
supported Bush were indeed choosing to keep certain traditions
alive.
</P>
<P>
   In Gore's case, the more relevant tradition may have been the
last seven years of the Clinton administration. But in the cases of
both candidates, voters were choosing someone with an almost
congenital grasp of politics, all the social and material
advantages that went along with that life style and milieu and a
relative unfamiliarity with hardship or tests of character on the
scale of Sen. John McCain's five and a half years as a prisoner of
war in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bush both dealt with that war in a way that reflected
their memberships in a younger, more coddled generation. Gore went
to Vietnam, but only briefly, and as an Army journalist. Bush got a
coveted spot as a pilot in the Texas Air National Guard and was
able to stay close to home.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were in a recessionary period, where class distinctions
are more on the surface, there might have been more of a dialogue
about that,'' said Don Sipple, a Republican strategist. Similarly,
he said, if the nation were in the grip of a crisis, voters might
reject any semblance of the status quo and seek someone who seemed
just a bit more idiosyncratic and adventurous, a bit less destined.
</P>
<P>
   A brief period of economic fright yielded the man from Hope,
Bill Clinton. A nationally devastating corruption of the public
trust yielded the man from Plains, Jimmy Carter. With the world
relatively peaceful and the nation phenomenally prosperous, there
is no such invitation this time around for a slightly unusual
upstart or self-styled maverick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Bradley or McCain understood that,'' said
Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster. ``There's sometimes an
assumption that Americans are risk-takers in good times. But
Americans are really only risk-takers in bad times. There's a real
interest out there in finding someone who is going to preserve what
we have, someone who knows the ropes.''
</P>
<P>
   Lake said that in some focus groups she has conducted, voters
expressed both an assumption that Bush might call his father at
crucial times and a sense of comfort _ not alarm _ in that
likelihood.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, Bush and their supporters say it is the men's
accomplishments that have made them credible presidential
contenders. But their ancestries undeniably helped start and guide
them on their way in politics, providing them with networks, access
to money, instantly high profiles and other tactical advantages.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, their fathers' careers _ especially their failures
_ taught them valuable lessons, some reflected in their current
campaigns. When Albert Gore Sr.'s many distinguished years as a
senator from Tennessee ended with his defeat at the polls in 1970,
one reason was his Republican rival's nasty and negative approach,
which Gore did not match. His son exhibited no such reticence in
taking on former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey over the last nine
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``His father's political demise was as instructive to him as
anything that his father did while in office,'' said Bill Turque,
author of a recent biography of the vice president, ``Inventing Al
Gore'' (Houghton Mifflin). ``It taught him the power of attack
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has a similar reference point: his father's failed bid for
a second term as president in 1992. President Bush ran a campaign
more responsive than assertive and hampered by dissension and
disloyalty in the ranks. His son sought to avoid those mistakes,
quickly putting McCain on the defensive and entrusting his effort
to a tightly knit circle of longtime political allies.
</P>
<P>
   And yet both candidates' relationships to their patrimony are
more complicated. They recognize that if they seem to be trading
too heavily on their backgrounds, it could turn off voters. They
also realize that their backgrounds inform and play into some of
their most potent liabilities: in Gore's case, that his life and
world view are utterly circumscribed by politics; in Bush's case,
that his late-blooming political prominence is the result of his
father's connections, not his own talents and toilings.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; BC-POLITICAL-PRINCES-REVIEW-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: and toilings. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the years between 1992, when Gore won the vice presidency and
his father said publicly that ``we raised him for it,'' and 1998,
when his father died, Gore's advisers sometimes sought to steer
reporters away from his dad.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Gore almost constantly invokes Albert Gore Sr. on
the campaign trail, but largely to emphasize what a self-made man
his father was. He mentions that his father was poor and had to
attend law school at night. The vice president need not worry that
voters will think he is trying to trade on Americans' affection for
his father, because only older voters in Tennessee would have the
requisite memory of the man.
</P>
<P>
   Former President George Bush, by contrast, is keenly remembered
_ he left office only seven years ago _ and that creates both an
added impetus for his son to mention him and a greater danger that
some voters will raise an eyebrow when he does so. So the Texas
governor is artful and sparing about it.
</P>
<P>
   For much of last year, Bush's stump speech included a passage in
which he acknowledged that the leap from governor to president
would be a big one. ``But,'' he added, `'I've had some pretty good
training.''
</P>
<P>
   He then went on to talk about running Texas, but the pauses he
took before and after that line, and the applause it reliably
elicited, left no doubt about its intent. Bush was saying, without
quite saying, that being his father's son should give Americans
some reassurance.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the New Hampshire primary, Bush and his advisers
abandoned such subtlety, putting the governor's parents on a stage
with him. The event was deemed by many to be a disaster, signaling
to voters that a torch was being passed, rather than earned.
</P>
<P>
   It was odd, because Bush usually goes out of his way to avoid
that impression. His almost strenuously folksy side _ the cowboy
boots he sometimes wears, the hyper-informal manner that recently
prompted him to address several of the physicians at a recent
campaign event as ``Doc'' _ seems like a self-conscious purging of
the blue in his blood.
</P>
<P>
   Gore takes his own stabs at a common touch. Did you know that he
once lived in a trailer park? That he likes and watches ``The
Simpsons''? Voters at his town hall-style meetings do, because Gore
has made a point of telling them.
</P>
<P>
   It promises a somewhat surreal spectacle between now and
November: two candidates whose life stories could not be more
entwined in establishment politics, and whose current situations
owe a great deal to those circumstances, competing to convince
Americans that they have just the right distance from it all.

   Additionally, their fathers' careers _ especially their failures
_ taught them valuable lessons, some reflected in their current
campaigns. When Albert Gore Sr.'s many distinguished years as a
senator from Tennessee ended with his defeat at the polls in 1970,
one reason was his Republican rival's nasty and negative approach,
which Gore did not match. His son exhibited no such reticence in
taking on former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey over the last nine
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``His father's political demise was as instructive to him as
anything that his father did while in office,'' said Bill Turque,
author of a recent biography of the vice president, ``Inventing Al
Gore'' (Houghton Mifflin). ``It taught him the power of attack
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has a similar reference point: his father's failed bid for
a second term as president in 1992. President Bush ran a campaign
more responsive than assertive and hampered by dissension and
disloyalty in the ranks. His son sought to avoid those mistakes,
quickly putting McCain on the defensive and entrusting his effort
to a tightly knit circle of longtime political allies.
</P>
<P>
   And yet both candidates' relationships to their patrimony are
more complicated. They recognize that if they seem to be trading
too heavily on their backgrounds, it could turn off voters. They
also realize that their backgrounds inform and play into some of
their most potent liabilities: in Gore's case, that his life and
world view are utterly circumscribed by politics; in Bush's case,
that his late-blooming political prominence is the result of his
father's connections, not his own talents and toilings.

 &UR; UNDATED: and toilings. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the years between 1992, when Gore won the vice presidency and
his father said publicly that ``we raised him for it,'' and 1998,
when his father died, Gore's advisers sometimes sought to steer
reporters away from his dad.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Gore almost constantly invokes Albert Gore Sr. on
the campaign trail, but largely to emphasize what a self-made man
his father was. He mentions that his father was poor and had to
attend law school at night. The vice president need not worry that
voters will think he is trying to trade on Americans' affection for
his father, because only older voters in Tennessee would have the
requisite memory of the man.
</P>
<P>
   Former President George Bush, by contrast, is keenly remembered
_ he left office only seven years ago _ and that creates both an
added impetus for his son to mention him and a greater danger that
some voters will raise an eyebrow when he does so. So the Texas
governor is artful and sparing about it.
</P>
<P>
   For much of last year, Bush's stump speech included a passage in
which he acknowledged that the leap from governor to president
would be a big one. ``But,'' he added, `'I've had some pretty good
training.''
</P>
<P>
   He then went on to talk about running Texas, but the pauses he
took before and after that line, and the applause it reliably
elicited, left no doubt about its intent. Bush was saying, without
quite saying, that being his father's son should give Americans
some reassurance.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the New Hampshire primary, Bush and his advisers
abandoned such subtlety, putting the governor's parents on a stage
with him. The event was deemed by many to be a disaster, signaling
to voters that a torch was being passed, rather than earned.
</P>
<P>
   It was odd, because Bush usually goes out of his way to avoid
that impression. His almost strenuously folksy side _ the cowboy
boots he sometimes wears, the hyper-informal manner that recently
prompted him to address several of the physicians at a recent
campaign event as ``Doc'' _ seems like a self-conscious purging of
the blue in his blood.
</P>
<P>
   Gore takes his own stabs at a common touch. Did you know that he
once lived in a trailer park? That he likes and watches ``The
Simpsons''? Voters at his town hall-style meetings do, because Gore
has made a point of telling them.
</P>
<P>
   It promises a somewhat surreal spectacle between now and
November: two candidates whose life stories could not be more
entwined in establishment politics, and whose current situations
owe a great deal to those circumstances, competing to convince
Americans that they have just the right distance from it all.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Once it was solid, solidly Democratic. Then it began
shifting, seemingly inexorably, toward becoming solidly Republican.
And now? For the moment, at least, the South seems to have settled
into a state of bipartisan equilibrium, where depending on the
place, the year, the candidates, their resources, the economy and
the issues, either party can prevail.
</P>
<P>
   That new dynamic could make the South an interesting place to
watch in November. Because the region remains more conservative
than the rest of the country, it poses formidable challenges for
the presumptive Democratic nominee, Vice President Al Gore. Indeed,
recent polls show Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the apparent
Republican nominee, with a healthy lead over Gore in the South,
even as he trails the vice president in the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, however, Southern Democrats have managed
to stall the Republican advance, even in the most conservative
states, and some believe those successes provide a glimmer of hope
for Gore. If the vice president can split the South, as President
Clinton did by winning four of 11 Southern states in both 1992 and
1996, he is likely to follow his mentor to the White House. In the
three presidential elections before Clinton, the Democratic Party's
sole Southern success was Jimmy Carter's 1980 victory in his native
Georgia (one of only six states he won nationwide in that
Republican landslide election.) .
</P>
<P>
   As the remnants of the presidential primary campaign move south
this week, with contests on Tuesday in Texas, Florida, Tennessee,
Louisiana, Mississippi and Oklahoma, the candidates will encounter
a kinetic political landscape that is still searching for partisan
definition. Recent elections suggest there simply is no majority
party these days in the South, a region where the politics of the
moment are often pitched by crosscurrents of race, religion,
migration and economics.
</P>
<P>
   Today's South is a place where conservative whites in
southwestern Georgia can embrace a black Democratic congressman,
Sanford D. Bishop Jr., while their compatriots in South Carolina
and Alabama rally for the Confederate battle flag .
</P>
<P>
   To prevent Bush from restoring the Republican lock on the South,
Gore will have to follow a formula tested in recent years by an
array of Democratic candidates. It calls for focusing on mainstream
concerns like education, Social Security, managed care and urban
sprawl, depicting Republicans as right-wing extremists, and
maximizing black turnout.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans maintain that recent Democratic successes may
be as attributable to local circumstances as to any regional
realignment. But Democrats argue that more enduring forces may be
at work. Clinton, though disdained for his moral lapses, has
demonstrated that Democrats can manage the economy, they say.
Welfare reform has disarmed the Republicans of one of their most
lethal weapons, and prosperity has quieted the clamor for tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   A smoking economy and the passage of time have softened racial
tensions, raising the stakes for Republican candidates who employ
racial tactics. And while they are predominantly Republican, the
more than 1 million migrants who flood into the region each year
tend to be less conservative than native white Southerners.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy E. Barnes of Georgia, who has won high ratings by
championing school reform and fighting sprawl, maintains that
Southern Democrats have learned how to win again. ``We centrist
Democrats and the African-American community have come together in
a coalition that encompasses a base of middle-class whites,'' he
said. ``It's a new emerging common ground, and let me tell you,
it's a force to be reckoned with.''
</P>
<P>
   Although troubled by Democratic victories in 1998 and 1999,
Southern Republicans assert that there is plenty of room for their
party to grow with help from continuing immigration, term limits,
reapportionment and redistricting. The key, as in the rest of the
country, may be whether Republicans can reassure the middle by
distancing themselves from the unbending social conservatism
promoted by the party's right wing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to be better politicians and learn how to package
our campaigns,'' said Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La. ``We've got to hold
to our conservative credentials and yet speak in more moderate
terms.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last 40 years, the 11 states of the old Confederacy have
undergone a striking political transformation. First gradually, and
then with runaway speed, a party that barely existed has supplanted
a party that dominated at every level.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, there were no Southern Republicans in the U.S. Senate,
none serving as governor, and only seven among the region's 106
members of the House. As recently as 1980, only 17 percent of
Southern state legislators were Republicans, and there were
legislative houses in three separate Southern states _ Alabama,
Arkansas and Louisiana _ without a single Republican member.
</P>
<P>
   By 1998, the apex of Republican strength, the numbers presented
nearly a mirror image. Eight of the South's 11 governors, 15 of its
22 U.S. senators and 71 of its 125 members of Congress were
Republicans. In state legislatures, where the power of incumbency
has made change more grudging, Republicans now hold 42 percent of
all seats and control six chambers. Republicans also have made
gains in the suburbs of metropolitan areas like Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that the South did not grow appreciably more
conservative during these years. But they indicate that beginning
in the Reagan years, conservative Southerners have increasingly
identified themselves as Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half of the 20th century, solid Democratic control
of the South was vital to the preservation of white supremacy. That
rationale began to disintegrate when national Democratic leaders
broke with the party's Southern wing and aligned with the cause of
civil rights.

   Many Southern whites then found a home in the Republican Party,
which was already compatible with their views on economics and
defense, and which lured defectors by playing the race card.
Paradoxically, Southern blacks, many of them just gaining the right
to vote, then flocked to the once-segregationist Democratic Party
because of its national leaders' views on race.
</P>
<P>
   The result was an almost exclusively white Republican Party,
which is now dominated by religious conservatives, and a biracial
Democratic Party where black voters play an equally influential
role. That racial dynamic has generated a tried-and-true electoral
equation, said Merle Black, an Emory University political
scientist. ``The Democrats can count on 90 percent of the black
vote but typically need 40 percent of the white vote to win,'' he
said. ``The Republican Party starts with almost nothing of the
black vote and thus needs 60 percent of the white vote.''
</P>
<P>
   For most of the last two decades, that calculus has favored the
Republicans. But in the last two years the trend lines have
shifted.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Democratic candidates defeated Republican incumbent
governors in Alabama and South Carolina, hung on to the Georgia
governorship in a tough race and lost the seat in Florida. The
Democrats also picked up one Senate seat that year, in North
Carolina. They stopped the Republican advance in the House and gave
up only eight legislative seats in 1,782 elections, far fewer than
usual. Last year, the Democrats added the governorship of
Mississippi. In addition, there has been a slowdown in
Democrat-to-Republican party switching.
</P>
<P>
   Those results suggested that centrist Democrats have learned to
unite voters around kitchen-table issues, even if their positions
upset Democratic interest groups. Republicans, by contrast, remain
bewildered about how to both accommodate and control their right
wing, a point driven home by this year's primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to the Democrats in the '70s and '80s is now
replaying itself with the Republicans,'' said Rep. Harold E. Ford
Jr., D-Tenn. ``There's a discomfort on the part of many Republicans
for their party to be known for prayer in schools, pro-life, racial
intolerance, Bob Jones and the Confederate flag.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, a Republican, said that Southern
voters are now less concerned with party labels than with
performance in areas like education and children's health care.
``The Republicans who have proven winners are ones who have tried
not to sell their brand but have tried to sell their cereal,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Rep. Gene Taylor, a conservative Mississippi
Democrat, said that his party has been helped by the anemic record
of the Republican Congress. ``What I now see is people falling out
of love with the Republicans,'' he said. ``It doesn't necessarily
mean they're in love with the Democrats, but the infatuation with
the Republicans has passed. So it's now up to the individual
candidates to prove their case. And that's the way it should be.''

   One of them was born just a dozen blocks from the White House
and reared, at least when Congress was in session, in a hotel set
amid the embassies of Washington. The other knew 1600 Pennsylvania
Avenue as the place where his father worked for a dozen years in
successive jobs: vice president of the United States for two-thirds
of that time, president for the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Their parallel paths of privilege took them past landmarks that
were different in name but identical in spirit: St. Albans School
and Harvard University for one, Phillips Academy and Yale
University for the other.
</P>
<P>
   And politics pumped so strongly in their blood that one of them
first ran for a seat in the House of Representatives _ the same
seat his father had once occupied _ in 1976, at the age of just 28.
(He won.) The other lagged only two years behind, making his own
bid for Congress in 1978 at the age of 32. (He lost.)
</P>
<P>
   Now, despite all the primary-season chatter about giving
Americans a new kind of politics, despite the tussles in both
parties over which presidential contender could bring a fresh and
unjaded perspective to governing, the contest has narrowed to these
two: Albert A. Gore Jr. and George W. Bush, a former senator's only
son and a former president's firstborn _ namesakes and political
princes with dissimilar styles but astonishingly similar
inheritances.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential historians and political analysts said they could
not recall a previous election in American history when the
nominees (presumptive, for now) of both major parties were not only
such prominent political heirs but also from such similar stations
and members of the same generation.
</P>
<P>
   That equivalence could simply be accidental, the analysts said,
but several said it speaks in part to the state of politics and the
mood of the electorate. It also imbues this year's presidential
race with an unusual and fascinating dynamic: among the challenges
facing both Vice President Gore and Bush, the Texas governor, is
how they relate to their political ancestries, particularly the
degree to which they reap the benefits of their backgrounds while
avoiding the drawbacks. That balancing act has been a theme in both
men's careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think either of them is going to have a slogan of
`Vote for me, keep the tradition alive,''' said Bill Carrick, a
Democratic strategist, adding that such bald elevations of pedigree
over merit would surely invite rejection.
</P>
<P>
   But to some extent, he and other political analysts noted, the
Democratic voters who backed Gore and the Republican voters who
supported Bush were indeed choosing to keep certain traditions
alive.
</P>
<P>
   In Gore's case, the more relevant tradition may have been the
last seven years of the Clinton administration. But in the cases of
both candidates, voters were choosing someone with an almost
congenital grasp of politics, all the social and material
advantages that went along with that life style and milieu and a
relative unfamiliarity with hardship or tests of character on the
scale of Sen. John McCain's five and a half years as a prisoner of
war in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bush both dealt with that war in a way that reflected
their memberships in a younger, more coddled generation. Gore went
to Vietnam, but only briefly, and as an Army journalist. Bush got a
coveted spot as a pilot in the Texas Air National Guard and was
able to stay close to home.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were in a recessionary period, where class distinctions
are more on the surface, there might have been more of a dialogue
about that,'' said Don Sipple, a Republican strategist. Similarly,
he said, if the nation were in the grip of a crisis, voters might
reject any semblance of the status quo and seek someone who seemed
just a bit more idiosyncratic and adventurous, a bit less destined.
</P>
<P>
   A brief period of economic fright yielded the man from Hope,
Bill Clinton. A nationally devastating corruption of the public
trust yielded the man from Plains, Jimmy Carter. With the world
relatively peaceful and the nation phenomenally prosperous, there
is no such invitation this time around for a slightly unusual
upstart or self-styled maverick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Bradley or McCain understood that,'' said
Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster. ``There's sometimes an
assumption that Americans are risk-takers in good times. But
Americans are really only risk-takers in bad times. There's a real
interest out there in finding someone who is going to preserve what
we have, someone who knows the ropes.''
</P>
<P>
   Lake said that in some focus groups she has conducted, voters
expressed both an assumption that Bush might call his father at
crucial times and a sense of comfort _ not alarm _ in that
likelihood.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, Bush and their supporters say it is the men's
accomplishments that have made them credible presidential
contenders. But their ancestries undeniably helped start and guide
them on their way in politics, providing them with networks, access
to money, instantly high profiles and other tactical advantages.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, their fathers' careers _ especially their failures
_ taught them valuable lessons, some reflected in their current
campaigns. When Albert Gore Sr.'s many distinguished years as a
senator from Tennessee ended with his defeat at the polls in 1970,
one reason was his Republican rival's nasty and negative approach,
which Gore did not match. His son exhibited no such reticence in
taking on former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey over the last nine
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``His father's political demise was as instructive to him as
anything that his father did while in office,'' said Bill Turque,
author of a recent biography of the vice president, ``Inventing Al
Gore'' (Houghton Mifflin). ``It taught him the power of attack
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has a similar reference point: his father's failed bid for
a second term as president in 1992. President Bush ran a campaign
more responsive than assertive and hampered by dissension and
disloyalty in the ranks. His son sought to avoid those mistakes,
quickly putting McCain on the defensive and entrusting his effort
to a tightly knit circle of longtime political allies.
</P>
<P>
   And yet both candidates' relationships to their patrimony are
more complicated. They recognize that if they seem to be trading
too heavily on their backgrounds, it could turn off voters. They
also realize that their backgrounds inform and play into some of
their most potent liabilities: in Gore's case, that his life and
world view are utterly circumscribed by politics; in Bush's case,
that his late-blooming political prominence is the result of his
father's connections, not his own talents and toilings.

<P>
   In the years between 1992, when Gore won the vice presidency and
his father said publicly that ``we raised him for it,'' and 1998,
when his father died, Gore's advisers sometimes sought to steer
reporters away from his dad.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Gore almost constantly invokes Albert Gore Sr. on
the campaign trail, but largely to emphasize what a self-made man
his father was. He mentions that his father was poor and had to
attend law school at night. The vice president need not worry that
voters will think he is trying to trade on Americans' affection for
his father, because only older voters in Tennessee would have the
requisite memory of the man.
</P>
<P>
   Former President George Bush, by contrast, is keenly remembered
_ he left office only seven years ago _ and that creates both an
added impetus for his son to mention him and a greater danger that
some voters will raise an eyebrow when he does so. So the Texas
governor is artful and sparing about it.
</P>
<P>
   For much of last year, Bush's stump speech included a passage in
which he acknowledged that the leap from governor to president
would be a big one. ``But,'' he added, `'I've had some pretty good
training.''
</P>
<P>
   He then went on to talk about running Texas, but the pauses he
took before and after that line, and the applause it reliably
elicited, left no doubt about its intent. Bush was saying, without
quite saying, that being his father's son should give Americans
some reassurance.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the New Hampshire primary, Bush and his advisers
abandoned such subtlety, putting the governor's parents on a stage
with him. The event was deemed by many to be a disaster, signaling
to voters that a torch was being passed, rather than earned.
</P>
<P>
   It was odd, because Bush usually goes out of his way to avoid
that impression. His almost strenuously folksy side _ the cowboy
boots he sometimes wears, the hyper-informal manner that recently
prompted him to address several of the physicians at a recent
campaign event as ``Doc'' _ seems like a self-conscious purging of
the blue in his blood.
</P>
<P>
   Gore takes his own stabs at a common touch. Did you know that he
once lived in a trailer park? That he likes and watches ``The
Simpsons''? Voters at his town hall-style meetings do, because Gore
has made a point of telling them.
</P>
<P>
   It promises a somewhat surreal spectacle between now and
November: two candidates whose life stories could not be more
entwined in establishment politics, and whose current situations
owe a great deal to those circumstances, competing to convince
Americans that they have just the right distance from it all.

   One of them was born just a dozen blocks from the White House
and reared, at least when Congress was in session, in a hotel set
amid the embassies of Washington. The other knew 1600 Pennsylvania
Avenue as the place where his father worked for a dozen years in
successive jobs: vice president of the United States for two-thirds
of that time, president for the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Their parallel paths of privilege took them past landmarks that
were different in name but identical in spirit: St. Albans School
and Harvard University for one, Phillips Academy and Yale
University for the other.
</P>
<P>
   And politics pumped so strongly in their blood that one of them
first ran for a seat in the House of Representatives _ the same
seat his father had once occupied _ in 1976, at the age of just 28.
(He won.) The other lagged only two years behind, making his own
bid for Congress in 1978 at the age of 32. (He lost.)
</P>
<P>
   Now, despite all the primary-season chatter about giving
Americans a new kind of politics, despite the tussles in both
parties over which presidential contender could bring a fresh and
unjaded perspective to governing, the contest has narrowed to these
two: Albert A. Gore Jr. and George W. Bush, a former senator's only
son and a former president's firstborn _ namesakes and political
princes with dissimilar styles but astonishingly similar
inheritances.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential historians and political analysts said they could
not recall a previous election in American history when the
nominees (presumptive, for now) of both major parties were not only
such prominent political heirs but also from such similar stations
and members of the same generation.
</P>
<P>
   That equivalence could simply be accidental, the analysts said,
but several said it speaks in part to the state of politics and the
mood of the electorate. It also imbues this year's presidential
race with an unusual and fascinating dynamic: among the challenges
facing both Vice President Gore and Bush, the Texas governor, is
how they relate to their political ancestries, particularly the
degree to which they reap the benefits of their backgrounds while
avoiding the drawbacks. That balancing act has been a theme in both
men's careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think either of them is going to have a slogan of
`Vote for me, keep the tradition alive,''' said Bill Carrick, a
Democratic strategist, adding that such bald elevations of pedigree
over merit would surely invite rejection.
</P>
<P>
   But to some extent, he and other political analysts noted, the
Democratic voters who backed Gore and the Republican voters who
supported Bush were indeed choosing to keep certain traditions
alive.
</P>
<P>
   In Gore's case, the more relevant tradition may have been the
last seven years of the Clinton administration. But in the cases of
both candidates, voters were choosing someone with an almost
congenital grasp of politics, all the social and material
advantages that went along with that life style and milieu and a
relative unfamiliarity with hardship or tests of character on the
scale of Sen. John McCain's five and a half years as a prisoner of
war in Vietnam.

   WASHINGTON _ When the United Arab Emirates bought 80 Block 60
F-16 fighter jets from Lockheed Martin Corp. in February, it got
special fuel tanks above the wing, a new color cockpit display, a
forward-looking infrared targeting system and a radar dish in the
nose cone.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the emirates are an oil-rich ally, and the United
States wants them to have a robust (and expensive) air defense.
</P>
<P>
   The F-16 is among the world's most sophisticated fighter jets.
Lockheed Martin has sold 3,992 of them since production began in
1978, for more than $50 billion. Foreign nations bought 1,686 of
those. Over the past 10 years F-16s have been purchased by Egypt,
Israel, Turkey, South Korea, Bahrain, Greece and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   Each of these sales must be approved by the State Department,
which determines just how sophisticated these planes should be. The
department must ask the following questions: Does Washington trust
the purchasing government? Does it have nearby enemies? Is it an
enemy of one of America's friends? Depending on the answers, the
purchaser may, like the emirates, get the highest performing
machine money can buy. Or something less.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when Washington allowed Block 50 model F-16s to be
sold to Greece and Turkey, there was just enough difference between
the two planes to maintain something like a strategic balance
between those rivalrous nations.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey got the basic model with night-time capability, use of
precision weaponry and the exterior lantern system for targeting
and navigation. Greece, with a much smaller fighter fleet, bought
the Block 50 plus model, with greater range and an internal
electronic warfare system that could presumably confound Turkey's
radar system.
</P>
<P>
   When Taiwan bought some F-16s several years ago, the United
States, to calm China, would only approve sales of the older Block
20 model. But they also quietly approved the latest onboard
avionics.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Lonely in right field
 &HT;    (For release March 15, 2000.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I have just come from a kiddie baseball game in which the left
fielder was hit in the head by a ground ball. (Picture it!) The
event, however brief, was documentation that outfielders do get
balls hit to them. How they are fielded is another matter.
</P>
<P>
   This was very important. The right fielder on the team is my
grandson, and he's yet to have the opportunity to stop a grounder
with his skull _ or even his oversized glove.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin has been wailing ever since his Khoury League season
began. Being ostracized to the outfield is, to him, a disaster of
immense proportion, likely an indignity that will affect the
remainder of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Just 9 years old, Kevin has been moping about being shipped to
right field. As one who decades earlier was ostracized to the same
location, I can commiserate with him. I split my time between
second base and right field in my sandlot baseball days _ the
determination not based so much on my ability to field grounders
but on my paltry batting average.
</P>
<P>
   In the kid leagues, if you don't hit, you go to right. Not left,
not center, but right.
</P>
<P>
   This is not how it works in the big leagues. Usually, the most
fearsome of hitters are out there. Based on that, I tried to build
the prestige of an adolescent right fielder by telling him about
the great ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you know that Roberto Clemente played right field?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know who he is.''
</P>
<P>
   I tried again.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, you heard of Babe Ruth, right?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh-huh.''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, well Babe Ruth played right field.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He did?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Indeed he did.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And Pete Rose, he played right field too.''
</P>
<P>
   This revelation brought nothing but a blank stare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you ever hear of Hank Aaron?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, he played right field too.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin may have heard of Hank Aaron, but he didn't know who he
was. Much the pity, much the time warp.
</P>
<P>
   We did not drift over to center field, where Willie Mays, Ty
Cobb, Joe DiMaggio and Mickey Mantle once ruled and where Ken
Griffey Jr. now rules. Kevin never has been awarded center field
because, in addition to his being sluggish, there is not a center
fielder, per say, on the team. There are two of them, one in left
center and one in right center; a picket line of dubious fielding
talent. Like the right fielder, they cannot hit either. And the
only thing the left fielder seems to be able to hit is his head _
up against a ground ball.
</P>
<P>
   In two games over the weekend, I watched Kevin come to bat six
times. He walked five times and struck out once. With the exception
of a swing at the third strike in his last time up, Kevin never
took the bat off his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   It's not so much that Kevin can't hit, it's that he won't hit.
If he can be convinced to swing at the pitches, he might connect _
thus earning his ticket out of right field.
</P>
<P>
   That's his ambition: to get away from the outfield, where few
balls come out to you and you spend time watching a game on the
other field. Nothing I can say about the baseball greats who
patrolled right field will convince him he is at a prestigious
position because, at his age, right field is the Siberia of
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   It was when I was his age and I suppose it always will be.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Reserve `Nazi' for the Nazis
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bristly New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is hard to love
even from a safe distance several states away, but he doesn't
deserve this: to be portrayed as a Nazi in the Whitney Museum's
biennial show of cutting-edge American art.
</P>
<P>
   But there the mayor is, in the company of Hitler and other Nazis
with the recorded sound of marching boots in the background, all
parts of an installation by artist Hans Haacke, with assorted
quotes written in that Gothic typeface that is one of the homages
our neo-Nazi web sites pay to the originals.
</P>
<P>
   This is payback for the mayor making a cheap-shot stink over a
piece of art in a show at the Brooklyn Museum. Giuliani nosily
denounced a depiction of the Virgin Mary as blasphemous, though
that clearly was not its intent, and threatened the museum's public
funding.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani deserves a comeuppance for his demagoguery, but he
doesn't deserve to be cast as a Nazi, for the simple reason that
the only people who deserve that defamation are other Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   Grant the Nazis their uniqueness. Their Holocaust had rivals in
its century _ Stalin's devastation of Russia's kulaks, the Khmer
Rouge's mass murder of fellow Cambodians _ but it had no equals.
</P>
<P>
   No other social or political crime set out to kill every man,
woman, child and infant just because of who they were _ Jews _ at
the moment of their birth. And certainly no other crime came so
horrifyingly close to actually achieving that.
</P>
<P>
   It cheapens the sacrifice of the Holocaust's victims, and
trivializes the Holocaust's evil, to make glib slanders from that
awesome tragedy. Giuliani's political grandstanding against a minor
work of art is a piffling offense in comparison to this work of
art's implied claim that the act was on a par with Nazism.
</P>
<P>
   _ Poor George W. He can't get John McCain's endorsement and he
can't get rid of Pat Robertson's.
</P>
<P>
   _ Vice President and pending Democratic presidential nominee Al
Gore has declared for campaign funding reform.
</P>
<P>
   This is, of course, Good. What it is not, is Believable.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most Republicans, most Democrats have talked a good
funding-reform game. They have yet to play one, however. Democratic
rhetoric is strongest in the years when Democrats fail to control
either the White House or Congress and can plead political
impotence. They somehow forget about reform when they have the
power to enact it.
</P>
<P>
   Gore particularly has a steep hill of skepticism to crest on the
issue. There is no evidence he was personally culpable for the
funding excesses at that Buddhist temple hustle in the '96
campaign, at any mention of which the GOP draws itself up into
pious indignation, but he was very much a part of unseemly
money-grubbing throughout that season.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's conversion might be more credible if he and
the congressional Democratic leaders drafted specific legislation
that could be examined and debated this year and pledged themselves
to its enactment if they prevail in the elections.

 &HT;    Small town paper allows escape from everyday drama
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CEDAR KEY, Fla. _ I'm tired of current events. Politics and
other general stupidities have lost their luster. That's why I'm
sitting here on my rented porch counting pelicans and watching the
tide roll in. No television and no newspapers _ except for the
local weekly.
</P>
<P>
   I do not wish to read another word about George W. and his visit
to Bob Jones University. Frankly, if I'd been writing that headline
it would have read: Dumb and Dumber go to college.
</P>
<P>
   And the details of candidate McCain's alienation of non-meat
eaters with his naive pronouncement that he doesn't care where his
votes come from, interest me not at all. It's not my problem if he
goes around saying stupid stuff like: ``I welcome support from
across the social spectrum _ Independents, Democrats,
</P>
<P>
   Libertarians, and vegetarians.''
</P>
<P>
   American politics, folks, is adrift in a sea of ennui.
</P>
<P>
   And so is television. Do any of us honestly want to hear another
word about the maybe-or-maybe-not millionaire, Rick Rockwell, and
his ``add money and stir'' instant bride? I don't think so.
</P>
<P>
   But for those of us who still enjoy the smudge of print on our
fingers, there is a solution. Subscribe to a small town weekly,
like the one I'm reading this morning and for a change, enjoy the
news.
</P>
<P>
   The lead story in this week's Cedar Key Beacon, is about a
contest of a different kind. A front page photo shows an award
ceremony being held in the city park's gazebo to honor a local
garden club woman for ``leading the charge against Brazilian pepper
plants,'' a non-native, and highly invasive pest that's trying to
take over the island.
</P>
<P>
   The program was followed by a ``work morning in the Fenimore
Mill area'' and a plea for more volunteers to help in the battle
against the exotic nuisance.
</P>
<P>
   On page 3 is a column by the publisher/managing editor. ``Monday
morning,'' she writes, ``I strolled into work, sat down to my
computer, looked up and there was this gigantic spider hanging on
my curtain. I mean this spider was as big as my foot!''
</P>
<P>
   Now this is the kind of news with which ordinary folks can
identify, particularly the part about how when she hollered for
help, the paper's circulation manager came to the rescue _ more or
less. While he dithered about whether to shoot the hairy-legged
invader or just catch him, the bug got away only to show up a
couple of days later in the publisher's desk drawer. At last
report, ``Spider Man'' is still on the loose.
</P>
<P>
   The fishing news on page 5 tells us ``sheepshead are running
real big on the offshore reefs, some up to 10 to 12 pounds,'' and
the ``best action from the pier this week has been the run of black
drum, which have been running 40 to 60 pounds, and should keep it
up through March.''
</P>
<P>
   The writer closes with sage advice for all fishermen: ``Early to
bed, early to rise. Fish like hell, and make up lies.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, I missed ``Waffles and Art'' at the Cedar Key
Arts Center where folks were invited to come for breakfast and
bring their works-in-progress for helpful critique.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a graduate of the Boston Museum School of Fine Arts
hosts ``Basic Drawing Classes'' for the community. Next year a
couple of totem carvers from Oregon will be bringing their work to
town.
</P>
<P>
   Page 13 offers a recipe for baked soft-shell crabs; rinse,
drain, drizzle with butter and lemon juice, and top with a sprinkle
of parsley. Simple enough, but I don't cook anything that's looking
at me or still wearing its wigglers.
</P>
<P>
   On page 19 is the picture of a stilt house for sale. Has its own
elevator. If I could afford to, I'd buy it and move here, since I
already like the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, I like it so much that I've been toying with the
notion of stopping in and swapping a few small-town newspapering
stories with the Beacon folks _ just as soon as I hear they've
caught the spider.

 &HT;    Latest demolition game lets you be a `Crazy Taxi' driverBy Staff
Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE CONSOLE:
</P>
<P>
   If you're searching for an awesome demolition game that includes
a bit of racing, look no further than Sega's Crazy Taxi ($50,
www.crazytaxi.com). This game is the best smash 'em, crash 'em
console game since Playstation's ``Demolition Derby.'' In ``Crazy
Taxi,'' you become one of four taxi driver personas cruising the
streets of San Francisco. Each driver has a different car with
different attributes. Some cars might handle better but have lousy
acceleration. After choosing your ride, you hit the streets,
picking up and dropping off fares as quickly as possible. This
means mowing down whatever is in your way. ``Crazy Taxi'' is a
blast to play and the best joy-ride to hit the console world in
quite some time.
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE DESKTOP:
</P>
<P>
   Old school gamers will appreciate Nox ($50, PC,
www.westwood.com), Westwood Studios' new game that combines the
top-down perspective of ``Diablo'' with old-fashioned
monster-hunting and simple quests. The action/adventure game puts
you in the body of a regular guy living in a trailer who is
transported to a medieval fantasy world in which he must stop the
busty-but-evil Queen Hecubah. With easy action (drag your right
mouse button around to move your character, click with your left to
hack at monsters), the game is a breeze to play. And with lots of
spells, characters and environments to explore, it's deeper than
expected. The game's flaw, if any, is that the storyline is a
little too cheeky (although it's a nice reprieve from dark
``serious'' games) and the game never inspires the awe of the game
it most resembles, Blizzard Entertainment's original ``Diablo.''
But until ``Diablo II'' ships later this year, this is a fun and
breezy way to kill time, either in single or multiplayer modes.
</P>
<P>
   You might never think that a M1A2 tank could be used in a subtle
fashion, but NovaLogic's pixel-pushing tank simulation does well to
educate gamers on the finer nuances of tank command in Armored Fist
3 ($20; PC; www. novalogic.com). Game play is initially daunting in
spite of an excellent tutorial. However, most multifaceted elements
of tank operation and squad command can be optionally automated,
which makes this game potentially as simple and straightforward as
a sledgehammer. NovaLogic has opted to utilize its famous/notorious
``voxel'' technology for this offering, rather than the modern-day
rendered polygons. While that can make for brilliant graphics and
glorious gaseous explosions, it also causes frame-rate bogs if
things get busy _ which is exactly when speed and fluidity of
battle is paramount. Finding adversaries online is difficult too,
though there are a few out there banging around in fun but
frivolous death matches. We came. We saw. We blew up stuff. A
sledgehammer is cheaper and never bogs.

 &HT;    Low-end, with an upside
 &HT;    By Shaun Conlin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It seems everybody and her Barbie is coming out
with an ``affordable'' (read: ``cheap'') digital camera these days,
and KBGear is no exception. The JamCam ($90; www.kbgear.com) offers
tolerable photographic quality to anyone with a home computer and
penchant for fun and frivolous photography. Nearly useless in low
light and with a misaligned viewfinder at close range, the JamCam
nevertheless serves up quick pics of Junior's 1st birthday ready to
e-mail to reluctant friends and relatives who've managed to avoid
slide shows for years. With its bundled software the JamCam can
also capture that great stunt your pal just pulled at the
skateboard park and paste it onto a customized bubblegum card. Even
the struggling, cost-minded Realtor can now display that massive
walk-in closet all over the Web. It's a low-end digital camera that
doesn't purport to be anything else.

 &HT;    A little tough to tackle
 &HT;    By Dale Roe
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Humongous Entertainment's Junior Sports division
has a new addition to the lineup. Backyard Football ($20,
www.humongous.com) lets kids organize pick-up games with some
familiar Junior Sports Backyard Bunch characters and adds
Humongously rendered kid versions of real NFL stars such as John
Elway and Jerry Rice. The game's interface is comparable to other
Junior Sports games (Backyard Baseball, Backyard Soccer) but play
is more difficult to master, perhaps because children in the game's
target age range (5-10) are less familiar with football than these
other sports. As in Backyard Baseball, kids can choose different
neighborhood fields on which to play, but the ability to designate
weather conditions is a fun, new feature exclusive to Backyard
Football. Humongous' new Junior Sports Network allows players with
Windows systems to play real-time with other children over the
Internet _ fun for them but a bummer for kids with Macs. We were
hoping for another Humongous touchdown, but this title might be
spending more time on the bench than in the CD-ROM drive.
</P>
<P>
   Backyard Football for Windows 98/95 requires a Pentium 90 or
better processor, 16MB RAM and a 4x CD-ROM. On a Macintosh, you'll
need a 133 Mhz or better PowerPC, System 7.5.3 or newer, 32 MB RAM
and a 4x CD-ROM.

 &HT;    Free access to Internet
 &HT;    By Sue Cleere and Jacki Rudd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   Will you provide me with the companies that provide free
Internet access?
</P>
<P>
   _Larry Morrow Sr.,
</P>
<P>
   Sue: There are tons. Your e-mail address indicated you already
are using AOL. Do a simple Web search for ``free Internet,'' and
you'll find a slew of options.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Here are a few that we dug out: Juno (juno.com), Free ISP
(www.isps-free.com/) or freeinternet (www.freeinternet.com/).
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Freeinternet.com made getting online a piece of cake. In a
few clicks I downloaded the application and set up my computer. It
even has a Mac client.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Also, if you are currently not online, sweet-talk a buddy
who has Internet access into helping you sign up. Many sites will
ask you to register online, download configuration information and
necessary dial-up applications. Or many of them will ship you a CD
with everything you need.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   I need help with e-mail, I just don't know how to: send link,
send page, forward message, carbon copy, blind copy. Can you
suggest anywhere I can get help?
</P>
<P>
   _Henry Reid, St. Simons Island
</P>
<P>
   Sue: You know, Henry, Jacki's trying real hard to finagle a trip
to St. Simons out of this. She's a lighthouse freak and always
dreams up excuses to get there.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Hey, be nice. There are several tutorials at your
fingertips, depending on your e-mail client. If you are new to
e-mail, go to Newbie-U (www.newbie-u.com/) and click on the e-mail
link. You can pick up some basics.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Newbie-U also has links that explain specific information
about how to use three of the biggie e-mail clients: Microsoft,
Netscape and Eudora. You also could hit the FAQs or tech support
links for these clients. Microsoft:
support.microsoft.com/directory/; Netscape:
help.netscape.com/faqs/mail.html; or Eudora:
www.eudora.com/techsupport/tutorials/.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   I have an iMac and an Epson 740 printer. When I changed from
Navigator 4.0 to Netscape Communicator 4.7, the printer prints tiny
print and pictures from the Net. The printer prints OK in
everything but Communicator. I installed Apple's firmware and patch
1.1. Suggestions?
</P>
<P>
   _William Akers
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: It sounds like your Page Setup needs a little tweakin'.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: From File, select Page Setup and change Page Attributes to
Netscape Communicator. In there you will see an option to Fit to
Page if possible. Deselect that option.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Also, take a look at Scale while you are in Page Setup.
Is it set to 20 percent or something? Bump up the percentage. Once
you've deselected it, be aware that you may end up printing extra
pages (usually blank) that pick up the edges of the page. When you
print, take a guess at how many pages it might be and change your
page range.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Page Setup options may vary depending on your printer
driver.

 &HT;    Surfing for personal pages brings fond Web memories
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When the World Wide Web was young, it was an
amateurish place, in a good way. It was not nearly as commercial as
it is today. Besides the academic and government pages, there were
personal Web pages that gave a true glimpse of the lives of
ordinary people from all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   The personal pages are still there _ in fact, like every other
part of the Web, the number of them has grown greatly. However, the
personal aspect of the Web has diminished as it has become more of
a tool for selling and providing information.
</P>
<P>
   Since personal pages are difficult to find compared with
commercial ones, our starting point will be at one of the largest
providers of free home pages on the Web: GeoCities. Go to
geocities.yahoo.com/home/ and you will see that the pages are
organized in neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Simply click on one of the neighborhoods _ say, Hollywood _ and
you'll find that these pages have been grouped by a topic that
suits the name Hollywood. You'll find personal pages and those
created by organizations devoted to fandom.
</P>
<P>
   If you hanker for something even more personal, select the
Heartland neighborhood instead, where you'll find family home pages
and pages devoted to personal topics.
</P>
<P>
   One warning _ and GeoCities is a relatively clean town by Web
standards, so this applies to all the personal pages you'll see:
Home pages are not generally censored. So, if you make this search
a family activity, make sure that you screen any of the pages
before your children see them.
</P>
<P>
   Our next stop is a fascinating collection of links to personal
home pages called Personal Homepages on the Web at
imc.iit.edu/internet.access/personalhomepages.html. Using the links
you find here, you'll be able to literally trace the history of
personal pages on the Web. For instance, click on the link for the
Well and you'll find a place (www.well.com:80/Community/) that, as
described on this page, was ``one of the earliest Internet service
providers ... a true community. Of course, it's in San Francisco,
so it's a different kind of community. ...'' It has all kinds of
pop culture represented, as well as San Francisco's (and other
cities') gay population.
</P>
<P>
   Other links on the compilation page will take you to personal
home pages selected for their novelty and interest by the Mining
Company, a professional Web search organization. You'll find those
Web pages at www.cs.ucla.edu/csd /people/undergrads.html.
</P>
<P>
   Still, from the compilation page, you'll be able to visit the
Web pages maintained by college students at schools such as UCLA
(www.cs.ucla.edu/csd/people/undergrads.html), Florida State
(www.cs.fsu.edu/people/undergrads.html), Carnegie-Mellon
(www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/usr) and Stanford
(www.stanford.edu/leland/dir.html).
</P>
<P>
   Soon you won't need any links or help, if you enjoy this type of
old-fashioned Web surfing (a term that is pretty much out of
fashion these days).
</P>
<P>
   One of the interesting things about visiting the lives of
strangers is that _ on at least half the pages _ you'll find links
to other personal Web pages maintained by friends and relatives.
And, with any luck, you'll meet people from around the world and
experience some of the feeling of what things were like in the
earliest days, when the surf was up.

 &HT;    Wireless now name of the game
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It was once a big deal when a business installed a
computer network. The laying of the wires for that network signaled
a real advance in the way people worked.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, wires are out; wireless is in. You'll see exactly why
and how that is happening in the April issue of PC Computing. One
of the cover stories, ``The Wireless Revolution,'' says the key to
increased productivity now ``is cutting the cables. Smart companies
are using wireless technologies to work from anywhere.''
</P>

   Big brother just got some help watching the e-mail you send from
work. There's a new program, aimed at businesses, called
MailMarshal (from Networking Technologies) that watches for leaks
of confidential information and personal abuses by ``customized
filtering of all incoming and outgoing e-mail and attachments.''
</P>
<P>
   While you are unlikely to buy the product to use at home, you
may want to know about it if you are an employee or an employer.
Networking Technologies says the program is in use at
Scientific-Atlanta, Campbell Soup and Volkswagen of America.
</P>
<P>
   Oh baby! Now you can buy what is described on the package as a
``virtual bundle of joy.'' It's a program called Babyz from
Mindscape Entertainment, and what you get is an on-screen baby who
can learn to talk and who lives in a virtual computerized house.
Users design their own baby's appearance and then watch him grow.
The program is available for PCs with at least a Pentium
166-megahertz processor and sells for about $40.

   It's mid-March and almost time for the swallows to come back to
Capistrano. Legend has it that the swallows first came to an old
mission in the California city ``seeking sanctuary from an
innkeeper who destroyed their nests. ... They return to the site
each year to nest, knowing their young can be safe within the
mission walls.''
</P>
<P>
   If you'd like to make sure that the swallows get home in good
shape this year, you can follow the progress at

</P>
<P>
   You'll be able to leave questions and get answers. However, keep
in mind that the accuracy of those answers from other investors may
be suspect. The really successful ones may be out on their yachts,
not typing answers on a computer.

 &HT;    Let your talking do your dialing
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Innovation comes in waves.
</P>
<P>
   The invention of the printed book saved us the hassle of having
to listen to someone tell a story. Then the radio came along and
saved us from having to read. Now we could listen to someone while
in our bathrobes if we wanted. Television meant we didn't have to
picture what the storytellers looked like anymore, and phones meant
we could let our fingers do the walking.
</P>
<P>
   But we still had to dial the seven, or 10, digits.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently. A company called Digital Acoustics has software
that lets you pick up a phone and dial a number as simply as saying
``Mom'' or ``pizza.''
</P>
<P>
   The software, Tell A Phone, works on any phone; special phones
are not needed. A user just picks up the telephone, listens for a
dial tone and speaks the name associated with a number he or she
wants dialed. The software confirms the number before it dials. The
process takes less than three seconds, according to the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site, www.digitalacoustics.com/tellaph, offers some
basic information about the software:
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can I use voice-dial from all the phones in my home?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, Tell A Phone works with every phone connected to the
same line as your compatible modem or Voice Dial Manager.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What if I have two phone lines in my home or office?
</P>
<P>
   A: Tell A Phone voice-dials on one line. If your modem is
connected on a line that is normally not used for your telephone
calls, you would need to add a compatible modem devoted for
voice-dialing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do I need to leave my computer on all the time?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, to use the features of Tell A Phone, you need to have
your computer turned on. This should not be a major issue or
expense. Modern computer power management uses less power than a
single, low-wattage light bulb. In standby mode, it is even less.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can I use my existing address book with the Tell A Phone
software?
</P>
<P>
   A: Tell A Phone uses its own phone book that imports from
personal information manager databases, including Lotus Organizer,
Microsoft Outlook, Symantec ACT and Palm Pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Which family members can use Tell A Phone's voice-dialing?
</P>
<P>
   A: Tell A Phone uses a speech-recognition engine that does not
require training. Once a name is typed into the phone directory, it
is available for voice-dialing. There is no age or gender
requirement, although our tests have shown that children under 6-7
years do not provide the speech patterns required for reliable
speech recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is Tell A Phone language- or accent-dependent?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, Tell A Phone Version 2.3 works with ``American
English.'' Other accents and languages are available, such as
Canadian English, British English, French, Canadian French, Spanish
and 10 other languages.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can I dial by speaking partial names, rather than full names,
in my phone list?
</P>
<P>
   A: Tell A Phone offers the option of speaking any part of a
two-word name or phrase. If the option ``Recognize Partial Names''
is enabled, you can say ``John,'' ``Smith'' or ``John Smith'' to
dial the same number entered for ``John Smith.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is Dial Logging?
</P>
<P>
   A: A feature available in Tell A Phone. Every time you dial,
Tell A Phone will record the digits you've dialed in your ``call
log.'' If you forget a number, Tell A Phone will have a record of
that number.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is a Caller ID announcement?
</P>
<P>
   A: If you subscribe to Caller ID through your local telephone
company, you can have Tell A Phone announce incoming calls from
your PC.
</P>
<P>
   To use Tell A Phone, you need a computer with a Pentium 90 or
greater processor, 32 megabytes of RAM, 20 megabytes of hard disk
space and a Windows 95 or newer operating system. You also would
need a Windows-compatible sound card and speakers, a serial or USB
port, and Caller ID for your telephone.

 &HT;    Some lessons on e-mail
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sometimes I think I should give e-mail lessons. For
one thing, just because I've been using e-mail for more years than
some of my readers have lived, I have a lot of practice. For
another, I have made a living writing for a long, long time.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of that writing was at big advertising agencies,
convincing people to buy everything from bags of charcoal to boxes
of fruit. You've got to figure that, if I had been a bricklayer for
30 years or so instead of a writer, that even a slow student would
learn a few skills along the way. If a person does that sort of
work long enough and survives, he learns a little bit about using
words in an effective way.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us would like to do that with e-mail. But judging from
the e-mail I get, a lot of people out there don't take the time to
do it well. Whether you're using e-mail _ as I did the other day _
to complain to an airline about lousy service, or to network with
potential employers, or even just to stay in touch with friends,
there are some ways to do a better job.
</P>
<P>
   So today, I'll take off my techno-guru hat, put on my writer hat
and give you some advice about simple ways to make your e-mail more
fun and more effective.
</P>
<P>
   Rule One: Have something to say and say it positively. Spend a
little time trying to figure out how to craft what you want to say.
Since e-mail is such an instant communication, some people type
without thinking. This rule is especially important with business
mail. If you react angrily, or with a mean spirit, you've made
things worse. Remember that, with this type of e-mail, you are
often trying to accomplish something, to convince someone. And _
just as is true in face-to-face conversations _ insults or
posturing seldom accomplish much in a positive way.
</P>
<P>
   Rule Two: Use simple and direct sentences. There's nothing worse
_ and I get plenty of e-mail like this _ than a wordy e-mail that
leaves me wondering what that person is trying to say. I've
literally gotten some where I can't tell if the person is
complaining, praising or asking a question. Remember that, unlike
in spoken conversation, the reader can't ask what you mean, can't
see your expression (or in my case, the way I'm waving my arms
around), so if you have to choose between clarity and drama, pick
clarity. Use complete sentences, and read your mail back to
yourself to see if it would make sense to you if you'd never met
the person sending it.
</P>
<P>
   Rule Three: Be friendly, even when you don't feel that way. Some
people believe that _ to demonstrate their strong feelings _ they
have to start off an e-mail with an insult. That makes it difficult
for the reader to absorb the rest of the message with an open mind.
Unless the whole notion of the e-mail is to show how angry you are
(and there are times when that's appropriate), try to sound
reasonable and friendly. If you are trying to convince someone to
do something or think something or to listen to you, you'll
accomplish more by coming across as a reasonable person. You can
still disagree strongly without insulting someone. Let's say the
rental car folks messed up. In a face-to-face encounter you
wouldn't (I hope) stalk up to the car rental counter and say:
You're an idiot, and I want you to help me. You know that wouldn't
get you much help. Instead, you'd try to win the person over, get
him or her on your side. The same rules apply in e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Rule Four: Rely on facts, not just opinions. It's just another
way of saying: Back up what you say; prove it. Don't just make
empty claims.
</P>
<P>
   Rule Five: When you have had your say, shut up.
</P>
<P>
   I'm going to follow Rule Five right now.

 &HT;    A couple of tricks can help expose elusive path name
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Responding to a column about using the Windows Find
tool to locate files on your hard drive, a reader says he has
trouble determining the path name of something this handy program
has located.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, of course, is that the path name of a file a couple
of directories deep is partially obscured by the Size and Type
columns.
</P>
<P>
   There are a couple of simple work-arounds for this.
</P>
<P>
   The Find Files window is usually about 5 inches square. All you
need do is click the enlarge box in the upper-right corner to zoom
it up to full screen, which will reveal the entire path name.
</P>
<P>
   If enlarging the window isn't feasible, put your cursor on the
dividing line between the In Folder column and the Size column. It
will turn into a four-way arrow. Click, hold, and move the dividing
line to the right, squeezing the Size and Type columns out of
sight, or nearly so. This will generally reveal enough of the path
name to locate the file.
</P>
<P>
   Another reader says that he recently upgraded Microsoft Internet
Explorer to Version 5 and in doing so seems to have lost the
ability to print. What to do? Well, that's hard to say, since he
didn't give details. I assume the problem is universal and not
confined to printing from Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't an uncommon problem across the board. I've had my
printer go west after installing a program, and it had nothing to
do with Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing one needs to know is exactly what happens when
you try to print. Do you get an error message? Probably not, in my
experience. Nothing at all happens. Go to the Control Panel
(Settings on the Start menu), select printers and click on the icon
of the selected printer.
</P>
<P>
   This should bring up the print queue. See if the file you're
trying to print is in the queue and what the status is. If printing
is suspended, turn it back on.
</P>
<P>
   If that doesn't work, go back to the Control Panel and select
System. From the System window, select Device Manager. When the
list of devices appears, click on printer. Select the driver tab.
Mostly likely you will see that the printer driver has wandered
off.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, the task at hand is to reinstall the printer
driver. You do this with the Update Driver button at the bottom of
the driver window.
</P>
<P>
   This can be a maddening task due to the software routines, which
appear to have been designed by people who don't like us and want
to make us feel bad.
</P>
<P>
   However, in the case of printers, direct the program to the
folder containing your printer utility software. This will
generally get the ball rolling.
</P>
<P>
   If it doesn't, well ... good luck.

 &HT;    Latest demolition game lets you be a `Crazy Taxi' driverBy Staff
Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE CONSOLE:
</P>
<P>
   If you're searching for an awesome demolition game that includes
a bit of racing, look no further than Sega's Crazy Taxi ($50,
www.crazytaxi.com). This game is the best smash 'em, crash 'em
console game since Playstation's ``Demolition Derby.'' In ``Crazy
Taxi,'' you become one of four taxi driver personas cruising the
streets of San Francisco. Each driver has a different car with
different attributes. Some cars might handle better but have lousy
acceleration. After choosing your ride, you hit the streets,
picking up and dropping off fares as quickly as possible. This
means mowing down whatever is in your way. ``Crazy Taxi'' is a
blast to play and the best joy-ride to hit the console world in
quite some time.
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE DESKTOP:
</P>
<P>
   Old school gamers will appreciate Nox ($50, PC,
www.westwood.com), Westwood Studios' new game that combines the
top-down perspective of ``Diablo'' with old-fashioned
monster-hunting and simple quests. The action/adventure game puts
you in the body of a regular guy living in a trailer who is
transported to a medieval fantasy world in which he must stop the
busty-but-evil Queen Hecubah. With easy action (drag your right
mouse button around to move your character, click with your left to
hack at monsters), the game is a breeze to play. And with lots of
spells, characters and environments to explore, it's deeper than
expected. The game's flaw, if any, is that the storyline is a
little too cheeky (although it's a nice reprieve from dark
``serious'' games) and the game never inspires the awe of the game
it most resembles, Blizzard Entertainment's original ``Diablo.''
But until ``Diablo II'' ships later this year, this is a fun and
breezy way to kill time, either in single or multiplayer modes.
</P>
<P>
   You might never think that a M1A2 tank could be used in a subtle
fashion, but NovaLogic's pixel-pushing tank simulation does well to
educate gamers on the finer nuances of tank command in Armored Fist
3 ($20; PC; www. novalogic.com). Game play is initially daunting in
spite of an excellent tutorial. However, most multifaceted elements
of tank operation and squad command can be optionally automated,
which makes this game potentially as simple and straightforward as
a sledgehammer. NovaLogic has opted to utilize its famous/notorious
``voxel'' technology for this offering, rather than the modern-day
rendered polygons. While that can make for brilliant graphics and
glorious gaseous explosions, it also causes frame-rate bogs if
things get busy _ which is exactly when speed and fluidity of
battle is paramount. Finding adversaries online is difficult too,
though there are a few out there banging around in fun but
frivolous death matches. We came. We saw. We blew up stuff. A
sledgehammer is cheaper and never bogs.

 &HT;    Low-end, with an upside
 &HT;    By Shaun Conlin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It seems everybody and her Barbie is coming out
with an ``affordable'' (read: ``cheap'') digital camera these days,
and KBGear is no exception. The JamCam ($90; www.kbgear.com) offers
tolerable photographic quality to anyone with a home computer and
penchant for fun and frivolous photography. Nearly useless in low
light and with a misaligned viewfinder at close range, the JamCam
nevertheless serves up quick pics of Junior's 1st birthday ready to
e-mail to reluctant friends and relatives who've managed to avoid
slide shows for years. With its bundled software the JamCam can
also capture that great stunt your pal just pulled at the
skateboard park and paste it onto a customized bubblegum card. Even
the struggling, cost-minded Realtor can now display that massive
walk-in closet all over the Web. It's a low-end digital camera that
doesn't purport to be anything else.

 &HT;    A little tough to tackle
 &HT;    By Dale Roe
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Humongous Entertainment's Junior Sports division
has a new addition to the lineup. Backyard Football ($20,
www.humongous.com) lets kids organize pick-up games with some
familiar Junior Sports Backyard Bunch characters and adds
Humongously rendered kid versions of real NFL stars such as John
Elway and Jerry Rice. The game's interface is comparable to other
Junior Sports games (Backyard Baseball, Backyard Soccer) but play
is more difficult to master, perhaps because children in the game's
target age range (5-10) are less familiar with football than these
other sports. As in Backyard Baseball, kids can choose different
neighborhood fields on which to play, but the ability to designate
weather conditions is a fun, new feature exclusive to Backyard
Football. Humongous' new Junior Sports Network allows players with
Windows systems to play real-time with other children over the
Internet _ fun for them but a bummer for kids with Macs. We were
hoping for another Humongous touchdown, but this title might be
spending more time on the bench than in the CD-ROM drive.
</P>
<P>
   Backyard Football for Windows 98/95 requires a Pentium 90 or
better processor, 16MB RAM and a 4x CD-ROM. On a Macintosh, you'll
need a 133 Mhz or better PowerPC, System 7.5.3 or newer, 32 MB RAM
and a 4x CD-ROM.

 &HT;    Free access to Internet
 &HT;    By Sue Cleere and Jacki Rudd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   Will you provide me with the companies that provide free
Internet access?
</P>
<P>
   _Larry Morrow Sr.,
</P>
<P>
   Sue: There are tons. Your e-mail address indicated you already
are using AOL. Do a simple Web search for ``free Internet,'' and
you'll find a slew of options.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Here are a few that we dug out: Juno (juno.com), Free ISP
(www.isps-free.com/) or freeinternet (www.freeinternet.com/).
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Freeinternet.com made getting online a piece of cake. In a
few clicks I downloaded the application and set up my computer. It
even has a Mac client.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Also, if you are currently not online, sweet-talk a buddy
who has Internet access into helping you sign up. Many sites will
ask you to register online, download configuration information and
necessary dial-up applications. Or many of them will ship you a CD
with everything you need.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   I need help with e-mail, I just don't know how to: send link,
send page, forward message, carbon copy, blind copy. Can you
suggest anywhere I can get help?
</P>
<P>
   _Henry Reid, St. Simons Island
</P>
<P>
   Sue: You know, Henry, Jacki's trying real hard to finagle a trip
to St. Simons out of this. She's a lighthouse freak and always
dreams up excuses to get there.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Hey, be nice. There are several tutorials at your
fingertips, depending on your e-mail client. If you are new to
e-mail, go to Newbie-U (www.newbie-u.com/) and click on the e-mail
link. You can pick up some basics.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Newbie-U also has links that explain specific information
about how to use three of the biggie e-mail clients: Microsoft,
Netscape and Eudora. You also could hit the FAQs or tech support
links for these clients. Microsoft:
support.microsoft.com/directory/; Netscape:
help.netscape.com/faqs/mail.html; or Eudora:
www.eudora.com/techsupport/tutorials/.

   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   I have an iMac and an Epson 740 printer. When I changed from
Navigator 4.0 to Netscape Communicator 4.7, the printer prints tiny
print and pictures from the Net. The printer prints OK in
everything but Communicator. I installed Apple's firmware and patch
1.1. Suggestions?
</P>
<P>
   _William Akers
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: It sounds like your Page Setup needs a little tweakin'.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: From File, select Page Setup and change Page Attributes to
Netscape Communicator. In there you will see an option to Fit to
Page if possible. Deselect that option.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Also, take a look at Scale while you are in Page Setup.
Is it set to 20 percent or something? Bump up the percentage. Once
you've deselected it, be aware that you may end up printing extra
pages (usually blank) that pick up the edges of the page. When you
print, take a guess at how many pages it might be and change your
page range.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Page Setup options may vary depending on your printer
driver.

 &HT;    Surfing for personal pages brings fond Web memories
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When the World Wide Web was young, it was an
amateurish place, in a good way. It was not nearly as commercial as
it is today. Besides the academic and government pages, there were
personal Web pages that gave a true glimpse of the lives of
ordinary people from all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   The personal pages are still there _ in fact, like every other
part of the Web, the number of them has grown greatly. However, the
personal aspect of the Web has diminished as it has become more of
a tool for selling and providing information.
</P>
<P>
   Since personal pages are difficult to find compared with
commercial ones, our starting point will be at one of the largest
providers of free home pages on the Web: GeoCities. Go to
geocities.yahoo.com/home/ and you will see that the pages are
organized in neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Simply click on one of the neighborhoods _ say, Hollywood _ and
you'll find that these pages have been grouped by a topic that
suits the name Hollywood. You'll find personal pages and those
created by organizations devoted to fandom.
</P>
<P>
   If you hanker for something even more personal, select the
Heartland neighborhood instead, where you'll find family home pages
and pages devoted to personal topics.
</P>
<P>
   One warning _ and GeoCities is a relatively clean town by Web
standards, so this applies to all the personal pages you'll see:
Home pages are not generally censored. So, if you make this search
a family activity, make sure that you screen any of the pages
before your children see them.
</P>
<P>
   Our next stop is a fascinating collection of links to personal
home pages called Personal Homepages on the Web at
imc.iit.edu/internet.access/personalhomepages.html. Using the links
you find here, you'll be able to literally trace the history of
personal pages on the Web. For instance, click on the link for the
Well and you'll find a place (www.well.com:80/Community/) that, as
described on this page, was ``one of the earliest Internet service
providers ... a true community. Of course, it's in San Francisco,
so it's a different kind of community. ...'' It has all kinds of
pop culture represented, as well as San Francisco's (and other
cities') gay population.
</P>
<P>
   Other links on the compilation page will take you to personal
home pages selected for their novelty and interest by the Mining
Company, a professional Web search organization. You'll find those
Web pages at www.cs.ucla.edu/csd /people/undergrads.html.
</P>
<P>
   Still, from the compilation page, you'll be able to visit the
Web pages maintained by college students at schools such as UCLA
(www.cs.ucla.edu/csd/people/undergrads.html), Florida State
(www.cs.fsu.edu/people/undergrads.html), Carnegie-Mellon
(www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/usr) and Stanford
(www.stanford.edu/leland/dir.html).
</P>
<P>
   Soon you won't need any links or help, if you enjoy this type of
old-fashioned Web surfing (a term that is pretty much out of
fashion these days).
</P>
<P>
   One of the interesting things about visiting the lives of
strangers is that _ on at least half the pages _ you'll find links
to other personal Web pages maintained by friends and relatives.
And, with any luck, you'll meet people from around the world and
experience some of the feeling of what things were like in the
earliest days, when the surf was up.

 &HT;    Wireless now name of the game
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It was once a big deal when a business installed a
computer network. The laying of the wires for that network signaled
a real advance in the way people worked.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, wires are out; wireless is in. You'll see exactly why
and how that is happening in the April issue of PC Computing. One
of the cover stories, ``The Wireless Revolution,'' says the key to
increased productivity now ``is cutting the cables. Smart companies
are using wireless technologies to work from anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   In that same issue, look at the complex and sometimes mystifying
world of Internet domain names. If you're selling widgets, then the
Internet address of www. widgets.com (already taken, by the way)
can become a real asset to your business.
</P>
<P>
   The article is called ``The Name Game,'' and you'll learn why
some companies are paying as much as $7.5 million just for the
rights to use a specific name. You'll also find out how at least
one man is getting rich because of that.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Big brother just got some help watching the e-mail you send from
work. There's a new program, aimed at businesses, called
MailMarshal (from Networking Technologies) that watches for leaks
of confidential information and personal abuses by ``customized
filtering of all incoming and outgoing e-mail and attachments.''
</P>
<P>
   While you are unlikely to buy the product to use at home, you
may want to know about it if you are an employee or an employer.
Networking Technologies says the program is in use at
Scientific-Atlanta, Campbell Soup and Volkswagen of America.
</P>
<P>
   Oh baby! Now you can buy what is described on the package as a
``virtual bundle of joy.'' It's a program called Babyz from
Mindscape Entertainment, and what you get is an on-screen baby who
can learn to talk and who lives in a virtual computerized house.
Users design their own baby's appearance and then watch him grow.
The program is available for PCs with at least a Pentium
166-megahertz processor and sells for about $40.

   It's mid-March and almost time for the swallows to come back to
Capistrano. Legend has it that the swallows first came to an old
mission in the California city ``seeking sanctuary from an
innkeeper who destroyed their nests. ... They return to the site
each year to nest, knowing their young can be safe within the
mission walls.''
</P>
<P>
   If you'd like to make sure that the swallows get home in good
shape this year, you can follow the progress at
www.sanjuancapistrano.org/theswallows.htm.
</P>
<P>
   If you're trying to do a better job investing your money but
need a little help in these volatile times for the stock market,
check out a Web site at
www.ragingbull.com/mboard/boards.cgi?board &QC; QA.
</P>
<P>
   You'll be able to leave questions and get answers. However, keep
in mind that the accuracy of those answers from other investors may
be suspect. The really successful ones may be out on their yachts,
not typing answers on a computer.

 &HT;    Let your talking do your dialing
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Innovation comes in waves.
</P>
<P>
   The invention of the printed book saved us the hassle of having
to listen to someone tell a story. Then the radio came along and
saved us from having to read. Now we could listen to someone while
in our bathrobes if we wanted. Television meant we didn't have to
picture what the storytellers looked like anymore, and phones meant
we could let our fingers do the walking.
</P>
<P>
   But we still had to dial the seven, or 10, digits.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently. A company called Digital Acoustics has software
that lets you pick up a phone and dial a number as simply as saying
``Mom'' or ``pizza.''
</P>
<P>
   The software, Tell A Phone, works on any phone; special phones
are not needed. A user just picks up the telephone, listens for a
dial tone and speaks the name associated with a number he or she
wants dialed. The software confirms the number before it dials. The
process takes less than three seconds, according to the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site, www.digitalacoustics.com/tellaph, offers some
basic information about the software:
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can I use voice-dial from all the phones in my home?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, Tell A Phone works with every phone connected to the
same line as your compatible modem or Voice Dial Manager.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What if I have two phone lines in my home or office?
</P>
<P>
   A: Tell A Phone voice-dials on one line. If your modem is
connected on a line that is normally not used for your telephone
calls, you would need to add a compatible modem devoted for
voice-dialing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do I need to leave my computer on all the time?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, to use the features of Tell A Phone, you need to have
your computer turned on. This should not be a major issue or
expense. Modern computer power management uses less power than a
single, low-wattage light bulb. In standby mode, it is even less.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can I use my existing address book with the Tell A Phone
software?
</P>
<P>
   A: Tell A Phone uses its own phone book that imports from
personal information manager databases, including Lotus Organizer,
Microsoft Outlook, Symantec ACT and Palm Pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Which family members can use Tell A Phone's voice-dialing?
</P>
<P>
   A: Tell A Phone uses a speech-recognition engine that does not
require training. Once a name is typed into the phone directory, it
is available for voice-dialing. There is no age or gender
requirement, although our tests have shown that children under 6-7
years do not provide the speech patterns required for reliable
speech recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is Tell A Phone language- or accent-dependent?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, Tell A Phone Version 2.3 works with ``American
English.'' Other accents and languages are available, such as
Canadian English, British English, French, Canadian French, Spanish
and 10 other languages.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can I dial by speaking partial names, rather than full names,
in my phone list?
</P>
<P>
   A: Tell A Phone offers the option of speaking any part of a
two-word name or phrase. If the option ``Recognize Partial Names''
is enabled, you can say ``John,'' ``Smith'' or ``John Smith'' to
dial the same number entered for ``John Smith.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is Dial Logging?
</P>
<P>
   A: A feature available in Tell A Phone. Every time you dial,
Tell A Phone will record the digits you've dialed in your ``call
log.'' If you forget a number, Tell A Phone will have a record of
that number.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is a Caller ID announcement?
</P>
<P>
   A: If you subscribe to Caller ID through your local telephone
company, you can have Tell A Phone announce incoming calls from
your PC.
</P>
<P>
   To use Tell A Phone, you need a computer with a Pentium 90 or
greater processor, 32 megabytes of RAM, 20 megabytes of hard disk
space and a Windows 95 or newer operating system. You also would
need a Windows-compatible sound card and speakers, a serial or USB
port, and Caller ID for your telephone.

 &HT;    A couple of tricks can help expose elusive path name
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Responding to a column about using the Windows Find
tool to locate files on your hard drive, a reader says he has
trouble determining the path name of something this handy program
has located.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, of course, is that the path name of a file a couple
of directories deep is partially obscured by the Size and Type
columns.
</P>
<P>
   There are a couple of simple work-arounds for this.
</P>
<P>
   The Find Files window is usually about 5 inches square. All you
need do is click the enlarge box in the upper-right corner to zoom
it up to full screen, which will reveal the entire path name.
</P>
<P>
   If enlarging the window isn't feasible, put your cursor on the
dividing line between the In Folder column and the Size column. It
will turn into a four-way arrow. Click, hold, and move the dividing
line to the right, squeezing the Size and Type columns out of
sight, or nearly so. This will generally reveal enough of the path
name to locate the file.
</P>
<P>
   Another reader says that he recently upgraded Microsoft Internet
Explorer to Version 5 and in doing so seems to have lost the
ability to print. What to do? Well, that's hard to say, since he
didn't give details. I assume the problem is universal and not
confined to printing from Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't an uncommon problem across the board. I've had my
printer go west after installing a program, and it had nothing to
do with Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing one needs to know is exactly what happens when
you try to print. Do you get an error message? Probably not, in my
experience. Nothing at all happens. Go to the Control Panel
(Settings on the Start menu), select printers and click on the icon
of the selected printer.
</P>
<P>
   This should bring up the print queue. See if the file you're
trying to print is in the queue and what the status is. If printing
is suspended, turn it back on.
</P>
<P>
   If that doesn't work, go back to the Control Panel and select
System. From the System window, select Device Manager. When the
list of devices appears, click on printer. Select the driver tab.
Mostly likely you will see that the printer driver has wandered
off.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, the task at hand is to reinstall the printer
driver. You do this with the Update Driver button at the bottom of
the driver window.
</P>
<P>
   This can be a maddening task due to the software routines, which
appear to have been designed by people who don't like us and want
to make us feel bad.
</P>
<P>
   However, in the case of printers, direct the program to the
folder containing your printer utility software. This will
generally get the ball rolling.
</P>
<P>
   If it doesn't, well ... good luck.

 &HT;    Some lessons on e-mail
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sometimes I think I should give e-mail lessons. For
one thing, just because I've been using e-mail for more years than
some of my readers have lived, I have a lot of practice. For
another, I have made a living writing for a long, long time.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of that writing was at big advertising agencies,
convincing people to buy everything from bags of charcoal to boxes
of fruit. You've got to figure that, if I had been a bricklayer for
30 years or so instead of a writer, that even a slow student would
learn a few skills along the way. If a person does that sort of
work long enough and survives, he learns a little bit about using
words in an effective way.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us would like to do that with e-mail. But judging from
the e-mail I get, a lot of people out there don't take the time to
do it well. Whether you're using e-mail _ as I did the other day _
to complain to an airline about lousy service, or to network with
potential employers, or even just to stay in touch with friends,
there are some ways to do a better job.
</P>
<P>
   So today, I'll take off my techno-guru hat, put on my writer hat
and give you some advice about simple ways to make your e-mail more
fun and more effective.
</P>
<P>
   Rule One: Have something to say and say it positively. Spend a
little time trying to figure out how to craft what you want to say.
Since e-mail is such an instant communication, some people type
without thinking. This rule is especially important with business
mail. If you react angrily, or with a mean spirit, you've made
things worse. Remember that, with this type of e-mail, you are
often trying to accomplish something, to convince someone. And _
just as is true in face-to-face conversations _ insults or
posturing seldom accomplish much in a positive way.
</P>
<P>
   Rule Two: Use simple and direct sentences. There's nothing worse
_ and I get plenty of e-mail like this _ than a wordy e-mail that
leaves me wondering what that person is trying to say. I've
literally gotten some where I can't tell if the person is
complaining, praising or asking a question. Remember that, unlike
in spoken conversation, the reader can't ask what you mean, can't
see your expression (or in my case, the way I'm waving my arms
around), so if you have to choose between clarity and drama, pick
clarity. Use complete sentences, and read your mail back to
yourself to see if it would make sense to you if you'd never met
the person sending it.
</P>
<P>
   Rule Three: Be friendly, even when you don't feel that way. Some
people believe that _ to demonstrate their strong feelings _ they
have to start off an e-mail with an insult. That makes it difficult
for the reader to absorb the rest of the message with an open mind.
Unless the whole notion of the e-mail is to show how angry you are
(and there are times when that's appropriate), try to sound
reasonable and friendly. If you are trying to convince someone to
do something or think something or to listen to you, you'll
accomplish more by coming across as a reasonable person. You can
still disagree strongly without insulting someone. Let's say the
rental car folks messed up. In a face-to-face encounter you
wouldn't (I hope) stalk up to the car rental counter and say:
You're an idiot, and I want you to help me. You know that wouldn't
get you much help. Instead, you'd try to win the person over, get
him or her on your side. The same rules apply in e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Rule Four: Rely on facts, not just opinions. It's just another
way of saying: Back up what you say; prove it. Don't just make
empty claims.
</P>
<P>
   Rule Five: When you have had your say, shut up.
</P>
<P>
   I'm going to follow Rule Five right now.

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service AUSTIN, Texas _Q: Last-minute question!
<TEXT>
My two boys are learning Spanish. I'd like to reinforce that by
taking them to Mexico for three to four days during spring break.
They would like to see some ancient Indian ruins, but none of us
has a passport. Any suggestions? _ K.S.W.
<P>
   A: Valid passports are the best form of citizenship
identification. However, it is possible to travel to Mexico without
one. Each traveler needs a certified copy of a birth certificate
and photo identification. Traveling without Dad? A notarized
consent from the other parent is necessary when children travel
with one parent, alone or in someone else's custody.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm looking for a catalog that had T-shirts that when you
wear them, it looks like you're wearing a bikini back and front. _
B.F.
</P>
<P>
   A: These T-shirts are available for $29.95 (plus shipping and
handling) through Caribbean Tan. To order the bikini T-shirt
(regular or XL) and other ``trompe l'oeil'' beach wear (for
example, ``He-Man'' T-shirt or the Mermaid T-shirt), visit
www.sexybikinis.com or call (612) 938-7799
</P>
<P>
   Q: The PBS television show ``Ballykissangel'' lists in its
credits that it is filmed/taped in parts of Ireland. Is there a
place called Ballykissangel? If so, where is it? _ Les Bearss
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, yes and no. No town in the Republic of Ireland is
actually named Ballykissangel although there is a Ballycastle, a
Ballymoney (in Northern Ireland) and a Ballyshannon. This popular
BBC-distributed series about the lusts, loves and lives of a rural
Irish community is filmed in Avoca, County Wicklow (south of Dublin
in eastern Ireland) _ at least the exterior shots are. Interiors
are filmed at Ardmore Studios just outside Dublin. Avoca has been
besieged by tourists, says KLRU's Maria Rodriquez, since the
series' inception.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I design needlepoint canvases with a religious theme. I have
a question regarding St. Jude. A small flame is present on his
forehead in all the paintings I have seen of him _ the prayer card,
his statue at the hospital for children. In all my research I have
found no explanation for it. _ Judy Harper
</P>
<P>
   A: The flame is the traditional sign of Pentecost, an event in
which the Holy Spirit descended upon the Apostles 50 days after the
Resurrection of Jesus, on the ancient Jewish festival called the
``feast of weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Because St. Jude was one of the 12 Apostles, many depict him
with this flame, says Helen Osman, spokeswoman for the Catholic
Diocese of Austin. St. Jude is the patron saint of lost causes and
desperate situations because he sent a letter to the faithful
admonishing them to persevere during difficult circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We are having a baseball theme wedding and a reception with
ballpark food. I would like to give out miniature key chain bats _
ideally with personalized bats. I could surf the Web, but I'm not
that savvy or that patient. If the bats are not available, then
personalized baseballs or pennants would be fun, too. I am not
going with baseball caps because I have more than 300 guests and am
trying to keep favors below $2. _ G.M.E.
</P>
<P>
   A: Wearing white and donning a tux are not enough for some
couples. Here are items that fit your requirements (about $2 each
with imprint when you purchase 300) from ADnet (339-9695): baseball
bat key tags, baseball bat pens or baseball and bat combination key
chains. Enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   Q: During the latter part of April my family will visit our
nation's capital. I've read that tours of public buildings and
monuments are free but passes are required that can be obtained
through my local representatives. Whom do I need to contact, and if
possible could you send my family of four tour passes? _ Hope
Rogers-Eldridge
</P>
<P>
   A: Fresh out of tickets, and you may be too late to get them
from officials like senators or representatives. Most require two
months' advance notice. Try calling your senator's Washington
office and ask for the tour officer. Special or advance tours may
be arranged for sites such as the Bureau of Engraving and Printing,
the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Kennedy Center, and the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We are having an argument about the reptiles in the Budweiser
advertisements. Someone says they are chameleons; I say they are
not. _ O. Patton
</P>
<P>
   A: They're not chameleons; they are not even lizards. These
creatures are the creation of the product designers, claim the
folks at Anheuser-Busch. Did you bet on their names? Frank and
Louie.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My daughter moved into a previously owned home with carpeting
less than two years old. She reports a strong pet odor, apparently
from dogs left inside. The carpeting has been steam-cleaned
professionally, but the smell lingers. Any suggestions? She left
Austin with heels dragging, and I would like to make this
experience as pleasant as possible.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jeri Porter
</P>
<P>
   A: Odor neutralizers include ammonia or vinegar in diluted
quantities (rinse well). Odor may linger in the padding or the
porous concrete slab _ even if the carpet is replaced. Cleaning and
sealing the slab before recarpeting may be necessary.

<P>
   FACING UP TO MUSTACHELESS LIVING
</P>
<P>
   Allow me to make this clear: I am not a candidate for public
office.
</P>
<P>
   If nominated, I will not run; if elected, I will not serve. I
will not
</P>
<P>
   accept contributions of hard money, soft money, firm money,
fluffy
</P>
<P>
   money or beer money.
</P>
<P>
   This must be said up front because I took an action that could
be
</P>
<P>
   open to all manner of misinterpretation and malicious
speculation.
</P>
<P>
   Something that traditionally is a sure tip-off someone is about
to
</P>
<P>
   enter the political arena.
</P>
<P>
   I shaved my mustache.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign consultants routinely force their clients to lose
beards,
</P>
<P>
   mustaches and even overabundant eyebrows before they form the
</P>
<P>
   first exploratory not-quite campaign committee.
</P>
<P>
   We haven't had a president with a mustache since William Howard
</P>
<P>
   Taft. And although the Florida governorship went reliably to men
</P>
<P>
   with mustaches from 1901 to 1913 the Golden Age of Public
</P>
<P>
   Servant Mustaches the tradition came to an end with the bland,
</P>
<P>
   clean-shaven face of Park Trammell, never to return.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know what killed the mustache from American political
life
</P>
<P>
   after World War I, but it's the Republic's loss.
</P>
<P>
   We are told that voters find a mustachioed man untrustworthy.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Albert Schweitzer, Gandhi and Captain Kangaroo wore
</P>
<P>
   them. Perhaps it's because the public detects the smile of a
</P>
<P>
   straddler underneath the lip hair. A man who wants it both ways.
</P>
<P>
   Someone who craves both the respectability of the clean-shaven
</P>
<P>
   and the rakishness of the bearded. Somehow, being partly
</P>
<P>
   untrimmed suggests you're a trimmer.
</P>
<P>
   The demise of the mustache has even moved into more flamboyant
</P>
<P>
   world entertainment, Tom Selleck and even Weird Al Yankovic have
</P>
<P>
   stopped fighting the cultural tide and come clean.
</P>
<P>
   In my own case, credibility is not an issue. I'm a columnist.
People
</P>
<P>
   only half-believe any of us on a good day. Nor am I slavishly
</P>
<P>
   following fashion. The fashion sense of the average American
</P>
<P>
   journalist vies with that of software engineers, physicists and
</P>
<P>
   people who serve beer in places that have broken cue sticks
</P>
<P>
   strategically placed beneath the cash register.
</P>
<P>
   No, I blame spring. The urge for a new beginning, a new
identity.
</P>
<P>
   We overestimate the way a face can be overhauled by the removal
</P>
<P>
   of facial hair. In movies, an escaped convict, a man on the run,
a
</P>
<P>
   secret agent who must be on the next plane across the border
will
</P>
<P>
   slip into a washroom, shave his mustache and be utterly
</P>
<P>
   transformed. As unrecognizable as if he grew a new head. (Maybe
</P>
<P>
   this is a reason why we won't vote for mustached men: we don't
</P>
<P>
   want them to escape us undetected.)
</P>
<P>
   Shearing myself before the bathroom mirror, I imagined the ease
</P>
<P>
   with which I'd sneak out of the country unrecognized. ``He
looked
</P>
<P>
   like that guy, only older and not as trustworthy,'' witnesses
would
</P>
<P>
   say pointing at me.
</P>
<P>
   The urge for a new face is a difficult thing to explain. When
people
</P>
<P>
   ask why I did it, I have no ready answer. The proper pose is to
</P>
<P>
   make it sound like a spontaneous, no-big deal kind of decision.
In
</P>
<P>
   truth, there are only 10 reasons one can legitimately give for
</P>
<P>
   shaving a mustache. These are, in order of popularity of use:
</P>
<P>
   -- I just got tired of it. (The hands-down champ. It is simple
and
</P>
<P>
   can't be gainsaid. It denies, without any specifics, that there
was
</P>
<P>
   anxiety, second-thoughts or girlfriend-generated pressure
</P>
<P>
   associated with the move.)
</P>
<P>
   -- Beer gets in it.
</P>
<P>
   -- It gets all itchy in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   -- Don't tell anyone but I have a job interview.
</P>
<P>
   -- I don't want to look like the photo in the post office.
</P>
<P>
   -- So viewers will know that I'm the one who is the good twin.
</P>
<P>
   -- It made it impossible to really rock out on the trombone.
</P>
<P>
   -- I'm sick of the Saddam Hussein jokes.
</P>
<P>
   -- Interferes with my space suit's respirator.
</P>
<P>
   -- To show solidarity with Burt Reynolds in these difficult
times.
</P>
<P>
   That's it. Anything else sounds vain or pathetic.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the real reasons, I am enjoying a newfound taste for
ice
</P>
<P>
   cream and the half-second of nonrecognition that strikes me when
I
</P>
<P>
   first appear before the mirror each morning.
</P>
<P>
   It feels like a new face. And it's a lot cheaper than surgery.

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service AUSTIN, Texas _Q: Last-minute question!
<TEXT>
My two boys are learning Spanish. I'd like to reinforce that by
taking them to Mexico for three to four days during spring break.
They would like to see some ancient Indian ruins, but none of us
has a passport. Any suggestions? _ K.S.W.
<P>
   A: Valid passports are the best form of citizenship
identification. However, it is possible to travel to Mexico without
one. Each traveler needs a certified copy of a birth certificate
and photo identification. Traveling without Dad? A notarized
consent from the other parent is necessary when children travel
with one parent, alone or in someone else's custody.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm looking for a catalog that had T-shirts that when you
wear them, it looks like you're wearing a bikini back and front. _
B.F.
</P>
<P>
   A: These T-shirts are available for $29.95 (plus shipping and
handling) through Caribbean Tan. To order the bikini T-shirt
(regular or XL) and other ``trompe l'oeil'' beach wear (for
example, ``He-Man'' T-shirt or the Mermaid T-shirt), visit
www.sexybikinis.com or call (612) 938-7799
</P>
<P>
   Q: The PBS television show ``Ballykissangel'' lists in its
credits that it is filmed/taped in parts of Ireland. Is there a
place called Ballykissangel? If so, where is it? _ Les Bearss
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, yes and no. No town in the Republic of Ireland is
actually named Ballykissangel although there is a Ballycastle, a
Ballymoney (in Northern Ireland) and a Ballyshannon. This popular
BBC-distributed series about the lusts, loves and lives of a rural
Irish community is filmed in Avoca, County Wicklow (south of Dublin
in eastern Ireland) _ at least the exterior shots are. Interiors
are filmed at Ardmore Studios just outside Dublin. Avoca has been
besieged by tourists, says KLRU's Maria Rodriquez, since the
series' inception.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I design needlepoint canvases with a religious theme. I have
a question regarding St. Jude. A small flame is present on his
forehead in all the paintings I have seen of him _ the prayer card,
his statue at the hospital for children. In all my research I have
found no explanation for it. _ Judy Harper
</P>
<P>
   A: The flame is the traditional sign of Pentecost, an event in
which the Holy Spirit descended upon the Apostles 50 days after the
Resurrection of Jesus, on the ancient Jewish festival called the
``feast of weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Because St. Jude was one of the 12 Apostles, many depict him
with this flame, says Helen Osman, spokeswoman for the Catholic
Diocese of Austin. St. Jude is the patron saint of lost causes and
desperate situations because he sent a letter to the faithful
admonishing them to persevere during difficult circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We are having a baseball theme wedding and a reception with
ballpark food. I would like to give out miniature key chain bats _
ideally with personalized bats. I could surf the Web, but I'm not
that savvy or that patient. If the bats are not available, then
personalized baseballs or pennants would be fun, too. I am not
going with baseball caps because I have more than 300 guests and am
trying to keep favors below $2. _ G.M.E.
</P>
<P>
   A: Wearing white and donning a tux are not enough for some
couples. Here are items that fit your requirements (about $2 each
with imprint when you purchase 300) from ADnet (339-9695): baseball
bat key tags, baseball bat pens or baseball and bat combination key
chains. Enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   Q: During the latter part of April my family will visit our
nation's capital. I've read that tours of public buildings and
monuments are free but passes are required that can be obtained
through my local representatives. Whom do I need to contact, and if
possible could you send my family of four tour passes? _ Hope
Rogers-Eldridge
</P>
<P>
   A: Fresh out of tickets, and you may be too late to get them
from officials like senators or representatives. Most require two
months' advance notice. Try calling your senator's Washington
office and ask for the tour officer. Special or advance tours may
be arranged for sites such as the Bureau of Engraving and Printing,
the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Kennedy Center, and the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We are having an argument about the reptiles in the Budweiser
advertisements. Someone says they are chameleons; I say they are
not. _ O. Patton
</P>
<P>
   A: They're not chameleons; they are not even lizards. These
creatures are the creation of the product designers, claim the
folks at Anheuser-Busch. Did you bet on their names? Frank and
Louie.

porous concrete slab _ even if the carpet is replaced. Cleaning and
sealing the slab before recarpeting may be necessary.

 &HT;    Who wants to harry a network?
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Pondering the schlock TV scandal that has had
tongues wagging for what seems like forever, we have to wonder why
this pathetic two-hour spectacle of bad taste and sexism has become
such a Big Deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who Wants To Marry a Multimillionaire?'' certainly wasn't the
first trash TV special and, despite Fox's protestations to the
contrary, won't be the last. Depending on whether you're judging on
morality or grossness, it's not even the worst.
</P>
<P>
   If Fox finally crossed a line, whose and what line was it? Was a
marriage contest, based solely on looks and wealth, really so much
worse than a disgruntled restaurant worker spitting into an
unsuspecting customer's food? Or a sweet-faced pooch suddenly
turning on its owner and chewing up his face?
</P>
<P>
   Viewers weren't terribly offended by any of the above, least of
all ``Multimillionaire.'' They tuned in by the millions _ 23
million to be exact _ when the show aired Feb. 15. It was the first
program to beat ABC's red-hot game show ``Who Wants To Be a
Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody seemed to be publicly troubled until the mainstream media
told them to be. The backlash started with the New York Times,
which discovered that multimillionaire Rick Rockwell (a) might not
be the real estate tycoon he said he was and (b) may have slapped
and threatened to kill a former fiancee. So if Rockwell had been a
bona fide fat-cat with no hint of impropriety, this farcical
marriage would have been OK?
</P>
<P>
   Unearthing the dirt on Rick was a legitimate news story, but the
revelations gave the Big Three networks an opportunity to have a
major conniption. Without missing a beat, they jumped in and
started braying about ``Multimillionaire'' and Fox's penchant for
trash TV. Was it coincidence that they managed to capitalize on a
competitor's screw up? Not a bit.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Three love to bash Fox because it makes them feel
superior _ despite the fact that CBS has two potentially
exploitative reality shows planned for summer and NBC was once
caught staging a truck explosion on ``Dateline.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox has a reputation as an upstart, and the Big Three have felt
threatened by it for years. Besides the ratings-grabbing reality
specials, Fox has produced some innovative programs, including the
much-talked-about ``Ally McBeal,'' the long-running classic ``The
Simpsons,'' the genre-bending ``X-Files'' and the red-hot newcomer
``Malcolm in the Middle.''
</P>
<P>
   If ``Who Wants To Marry a Multimillionaire'' had been on ABC or
NBC, would it have provoked such a stink? Probably not, at least
not on the so-called legitimate TV news programs. The other
networks stretched the controversy into a week-long gala of
Fox-bashing, exploiting the exploiters for their own gain. In the
heart of the February sweeps, ABC and NBC were able to reap the
rewards of the Fox scandal while seeming to stand above the fray.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Sawyer, breathlessly asking about consummation,
practically salivated while grilling bride Darva Conger on ``Good
Morning America.'' This hand-wringing went on for two days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I was thinking clearly,'' Darva whined. ``This
was a terrible mistake in judgment on my part, but it does not
represent who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dateline NBC'' sounded like it had broken a political scandal
when it crowed about having nabbed failed stand-up comic Rockwell.
Good 'ol Rick lived up to his reputation as a jerk by grinning when
asked if he'd ever threatened to kill his fiancee. The next act in
the Rick-and-Darva Circus found him sobbing on ``Entertainment
Tonight.'' ``I'm really hurting right now,'' he sniveled.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the fall-out coverage actually tried to generate
sympathy for the unhappy couple. What in the world for? Both got
what they deserved and, indeed, what they asked for. They made a
mockery of an institution many people consider sacred. The
producers may have dreamed up the notion of turning holy matrimony
into a blind date, but these two profited from it. Even after the
anticipated annulment, Darva will walk away with $100,000 in
prizes, and Rick will have enough publicity to jump-start his
stand-up career.
</P>
<P>
   The embarrassing mess also became fodder for newspaper
editorials. Jumping on their anti-TV bandwagons, they banged their
drums for days.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Globe wrote: ``Who wants to take a shower after
watching 'Who Wants To Marry a Multimillionaire?' ... All culture
needn't be Shakespeare and Virginia Woolf. But television should at
least aim for outrageousness without the high-glitz humiliation of
parading around like cattle to win a husband who may or may not
have a criminal record.''
</P>
<P>
   The Orlando Sentinel chimed in: `` 'Multimillionaire' reduces
male-female relationships to their most primitive, stereotypical
essence: Girls want a guy with money. Boys want a looker for sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, sure it was an awful show, but whose fault is it that TV
is littered with such trash? Is it the TV networks or the viewers?
It's both, but we can only take responsibility for ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   For TV programmers, cheap-to-produce reality shows that generate
big buzz and big ratings are a narcotic. It's a dog-eat-dog world
out there, and reality specials are tasty Milk-Bones. Last week's
pledge from Fox chairman Sandy Grushow to ditch all exploitative
reality shows was disingenuous at best. After all, he made the same
promise in January before a roomful of TV critics. Even as he
spoke, his network was screening hundreds of potential
multimillionaire grooms and thousands of potential golddigger
brides.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, Grushow also said last week he would ``get to
the bottom'' of how ``Multimillionaire'' wound up on Fox to begin
with. Oh, please. Does anyone really believe the head of the
network doesn't know what's on his schedule? Of course he knew, and
he was probably thrilled when his publicity department bragged the
next day that the Rick and Darva Show was ``the most-watched
marriage ceremony since Charles and Diana.''
</P>
<P>
   I stayed away from the the Fox spectacle, even though I probably
should have watched it as part of my job. But there is a line I'm
unwilling to cross, and ``Multimillionaire'' was on the other side,
along with most of the other trash specials. My stomach can only
take so much. The networks may not have a line, but viewers should.
</P>
<P>
   I've said this a thousand times, and I'll say it again: Ignore
this trash, and it will disappear. If Diane Sawyer and the other
network stars want to wallow in this slop, fine. But the rest of us
shouldn't.

 &HT;    Grab the stock market by the horns
 &HT;    By Jeffry Scott
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Do your parents ever seem nervous when they're
watching TV news about the stock market?
</P>
<P>
   It's probably because they own stock. When you buy stock, you
buy a small part of a large company. You are one of the owners of
the company. But so are thousands of other people, known as
stockholders.
</P>
<P>
   About 80 million Americans own stock, known as ``shares,'' in
more than 10,000 companies. Not all companies sell shares, but most
of the big ones do.
</P>
<P>
   But all of this doesn't explain why your parents are worried,
does it? Your parents own lots of stuff, but you don't see Dad
nervous about the hedge clippers he bought last week, do you?
</P>
<P>
   One difference is that when you buy stock, it's hard to know if
you made the right choice. There are thousands of stocks available,
from companies such as Coca-Cola, Home Depot, Toys ``R'' Us,
Wal-Mart and the Gap. The value of all these stocks goes up and
down constantly.
</P>
<P>
   When people buy stock that goes down, they lose money _
sometimes a lot of money. But people who bought stock in Atlanta
companies Coca-Cola and Home Depot years ago made a good buy. Some
of them are now millionaires!
</P>
<P>
   BUY CAREFULLY
</P>
<P>
   Buying stock is different from buying other things. Most people
don't buy stock to keep it. Instead, they hope to sell it later for
more money than they paid. That's called an investment.
</P>
<P>
   If they made a smart investment, they will make money _ a profit
_ when they sell the stock. If they bought the wrong stock, they
made a bad investment. When they sell the stock, they'll get less
money than they paid. Instead of a profit, they'll have a loss.
</P>
<P>
   Buying and selling stocks can get very complicated. People who
talk about the stock market sometimes use lots of strange words to
describe it.
</P>
<P>
   LEARN THE WORDS
</P>
<P>
   Some of the terms they use, such as ``bear market'' and ``bull
market,'' can be pretty cool.
</P>
<P>
   A bear market is when the prices of many stocks go down, and
many investors sell their stock because they're afraid prices will
go even lower.
</P>
<P>
   A bull market is when the prices of many stocks go up, and many
investors buy stock because they hope the prices will go even
higher.The stock market is also known as ``Wall Street,'' the
street in New York City where the New York Stock Exchange is
located. These days, people buy and sell stock in many ways, often
by telephone or over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   If you're interested in the stock market, there are Web sites
that explain the stock market to young people.
</P>
<P>
   The Young Investor site (www.smgww.org) is great because it also
has ``The Stock Market Game.'' In the game, you pretend that you've
invested $100,000 in the stock market. You can research the
companies first, then place your bets.
</P>
<P>
   After 10 weeks, see what your stock is worth. You might be a
``millionaire.'' Or, if you chose some bad stocks, you might have
``lost'' a lot of money in the game and wonder why.
</P>
<P>
   Why did I buy that stock?
</P>
<P>
   Why didn't I put all my money into hedge clippers?
</P>
<P>
   If I had, I'd be so much happier!
</P>
<P>
   HOW MUCH IS GRIFFEY WORTH?
</P>
<P>
   One simple way to understand how the stock market works is to
compare it to trading baseball cards.
</P>
<P>
   Like stock, a baseball card is really a popularity contest. The
more people want a card, or a stock, the more they are willing to
pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   The Ken Griffey Jr. rookie baseball card is a great example of
that. In 1989, Griffey's first year in the major leagues, you could
buy his Upper Deck card for $3. Because he became such a superstar,
today that card is worth $150!
</P>
<P>
   Another good example is the baseball card of Mark McGwire. Even
though McGwire has always been a star, he wasn't as popular as
Griffey until two seasons ago, when he broke Roger Maris' season
home run record.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, according to Bryan Theis, the owner of Ballpark
Cards in Germantown, Md., McGwire's rookie card sold for only $5.
Try to buy one today, and it will cost $200!
</P>
<P>
   No wonder, then, that your parents may be so interested in the
news about Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices usually change every day, every hour and sometimes
every minute. If your parents' stock went up today, Wall Street
news can be the most fun show on television. If the stock went
down, it can be the scariest show on television.
</P>
<P>
   But tomorrow everything could change!

 &HT;    It's down to Gore and Bush
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ U.S. Sen. John McCain and Bill Bradley, a former
senator, dropped out of the presidential race Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was running against Texas Gov. George W. Bush for the
Republican nomination. Bradley was running against Vice President
Al Gore for the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates compete in state primaries to win delegates to
their party conventions, held in the summer. At the conventions,
the delegates vote on who will be their party's candidate in the
presidential election in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``Super Tuesday,'' which was last Tuesday, was the biggest day
for primaries. McCain won four of the 13 Republican primaries held
Tuesday, and Bradley didn't win any primaries. Both candidates lost
in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley ``endorsed,'' or said he would support, Gore. McCain did
not endorse Bush but wished him well.
</P>
<P>
   DOGS RACE ACROSS ALASKA
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion Doug Swingley set a blistering pace down the
Yukon River over the weekend to reclaim the lead in the Iditarod
Trail Sled Dog Race in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   A record 81 dog sled teams began the 1,150-mile race across
Alaska on March 5. The icy trail goes from Anchorage to Nome. The
race was begun to commemorate the lifesaving relay of medicine to
Nome by mushers in 1925.
</P>
<P>
   The first 30 finishers will share in a $525,000 purse, the
largest ever. The winner gets $60,000 and a new pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   The race record was set in 1995 by Swingley, who finished in
nine days, two hours and 42 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   To learn more about the race, sled dogs and mushers, check out
teacher.scholastic.com/iditarod/home.htm. You also can see each leg
of the trail on an interactive map.
</P>
<P>
   GASOLINE PRICES RISING
</P>
<P>
   Drivers across America can expect to pay more to fill their gas
tanks this spring and summer.
</P>
<P>
   The countries that produce oil decided to cut down on
production, because they felt that oil prices were too low. Now
there is less oil being produced, so the price is rising. Because
gasoline is made from oil, the price of gasoline also is going up.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for gasoline in the Atlanta area range from about $1.34
to $1.40 a gallon.

   The  &UR; New York Times News Service &LR;  is planning an expanded
weather package, with a planned starting date of Monday, March 20,
to be transmitted Sunday, March 19. The package, consisting of a
weather map as a graphics file and a text file to accompany the
map, is available to graphics clients of the News Service.
</P>
<P>
   The new map grows to 4 columns in width (52 picas), from 3, and
is 6 inches deep; the old was 4\ inches deep. This new size permits
the insertion of cloud cover information, previously a separate
map, and the addition of many new cities (see list below).
</P>
<P>
   The map is available both in color and in black and white.
Because the map is much more detailed, we have devised an entirely
new palette of colors to make it easier to read the added
information.
</P>
<P>
   A sample of the new map is available at Wieck, Newscom,
Presslink and AP's GraphicsNet.
</P>
<P>
   A summary of this information is included in each day's Graphics
Budget.

GEORGE W.'S POLITICS OF CONVENIENT COMPASSION

 By JAMES E. GARCIA  
 &HT;    Early in his campaign, Republican presidential candidate George
W. Bush routinely promoted himself as a ``compassionate
conservative.'' He often still does _ even as he has grown less
compassionate by the day.
 &HT;    The truth is I never bought Bush's line about being
compassionate to anyone but those who march in lock step with his
views, and his campaign tactics over the past few months have
confirmed my initial instincts.
 &HT;    First, consider Bush's reaction to the barrage of criticism he
received after his speech at Bob Jones University. The South
Carolina school prohibits interracial dating _ unless students have
a note from their parents. The school's leaders have labeled
Catholicism a ``satanic cult.''
 &HT;    Asked why his speech did not condemn the university for its
bigoted policies, Bush insisted that that wasn't the purpose of his
appearance.
 &HT;    Three weeks later _ and only days before a primary election in
which he needed the support of Catholic voters _ Bush finally
acknowledged in a letter to New York Cardinal John O'Conner: ``On
reflection, I should have been more clear in disassociating myself
from anti-Catholic sentiments and racial prejudice.''
 &HT;    Bush says he is not anti-Catholic or racist. I believe him. But
I am disturbed by Bush's apparent willingness to offend minorities
and Catholics for the sake of winning a few extra right-wing votes.
 &HT;    To tolerate bigotry, Bush, is to encourage it.
 &HT;    Bush also has shown little compassion for another minority
group: gays and lesbians.
 &HT;    While Bush didn't think twice about delivering a speech at Bob
Jones University, he refused for months to meet with the Log Cabin
Republicans, a national organization of gays and lesbians who
support the GOP. Only now, after Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., has
dropped out of the race and Bush is virtually assured of winning
the GOP nomination, has the candidate agreed to meet with the
group's leadership.
 &HT;    Bush also refuses to say if he would knowingly appoint a gay
person to his administration.
 &HT;    If Bush is truly compassionate, he would support pending federal
legislation that bans discrimination against homosexuals. He would
also take the time to meet with the leaders of other national gay
and lesbian organizations to hear what they have to say.
 &HT;    On the subject of affirmative action, Bush minimizes the plight
of women and minorities. He opposes affirmative action. He suggests
that all Americans now have an equal opportunity when applying for
jobs or university admissions. Bush is wrong.
 &HT;    Discrimination against women and people of color may be illegal,
but it is still part of the fabric of our society. Far more action
needs to be taken to counter it. Women still get paid less than men
for the same jobs. There are still glass ceilings in hiring and
promoting Latinos, African-Americans and other minorities. And many
states, including Texas, still have laws on the books that sanction
discrimination against homosexuals.
 &HT;    It is because of affirmative action programs and
anti-discrimination laws that hundreds of millions of women and
people of color have been able to climb in the ranks of American
society.
 &HT;    No matter what Bush claims, affirmative action is not about
setting racial, ethnic or gender quotas. The courts ruled long ago
that hiring or appointing a minority just to meet a numeric quota
is discriminatory and unconstitutional.
 &HT;    Furthermore, affirmative-action that ensures that a given pool
of job seekers, university students or judicial nominees includes
qualified women and minorities is not only legal, but fair, just
and, yes, compassionate.
 &HT;    To argue that affirmative action is no longer needed is
shortsighted and ultimately harmful to the noble goal of achieving
equality for women and people of color.
 &HT;    And how can we forget the controversy surrounding the
Confederate flag in South Carolina? Bush still refuses to criticize
those who say it's all right, even honorable, to fly the flag over
that state's capitol.
 &HT;    Confederate-flag supporters say it is a symbol of states'
rights. They're correct. The flag is a symbol of the Confederacy's
claim that it had a right, among other things, to enslave human
beings.
 &HT;    Bush's silence on the matter is an affront to the millions of
African-Americans whose ancestors suffered the brutality of slavery
and still suffer as a result of its legacy. And it is an affront to
anyone who considers that era as one of the most shameful in U.S.
history.
 &HT;    Throughout his campaign, Bush has insisted that he wants more
racial and ethnic minorities to join the GOP. It is a worthy goal.
This cannot happen until his party becomes genuinely more
inclusive.
 &HT;    So far, Bush's actions have not matched his words. He has done
more to divide us than unite us, and has exhibited little true
compassion.
 &HT;    So far, the compassion he has exhibited has proven to be little
more than the politics of convenient compassion.

INCREASED FEDERAL FUNDING FOR INDIANS: A SMALL STEP IN THE RIGHT
DIRECTION

 By KAREN LINCOLN MICHEL  
 &HT;    Among the many traditions of American Indians, one that grew out
of the 18th and 19th centuries was for our leaders to gather in the
nation's capital for treaty talks aimed at protecting the welfare
of tribes amid white expansion into our territories.
 &HT;    At least that was our view of treaty talks.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, the U.S. government's position was to negotiate the
purchase of Indian land for as little as possible, with no
intention of honoring that agreement later.
 &HT;    Those broken promises translate today into billions of dollars
in aid to the country's 2.4 million Indians.
 &HT;    Just two weeks ago, the tradition of journeying to Washington,
D.C., was carried on by current tribal leaders from across the
country. This time they met with President Clinton at the White
House to hear his plan for fulfilling the nation's monetary
obligation to America's 558 recognized tribes.
 &HT;    Clinton told tribal politicians and native leaders that his
fiscal 2001 budget proposal geared toward Indian tribes calls for
increased spending by 12 percent, bringing the total to $9.4
billion for new and existing programs.
 &HT;    It is a $1.2 billion hike over this year's budget, and the
increase addresses important issues in the areas of education,
housing, health care, the environment and crime prevention.
 &HT;    While $9.4 billion is nothing to sneeze at, some native leaders
say the budget falls considerably short of helping American Indians
and Alaska natives pull themselves out of poverty.
 &HT;    Susan Masten, president of the National Congress of American
Indians and chairwoman of the Yurok Tribe of California, reportedly
said that although Clinton's proposal is a good start, it ``does
not begin to address the Third World conditions on our
reservations.''
 &HT;    At the risk of sounding ungrateful, I agree with Masten. The
increase is a step in the right direction. But it is so long
overdue that it would take more of an Olympic long jump to catapult
spending where it ought to be.
 &HT;    Native-Americans continue to rank among the highest in terms of
suicide, teen pregnancy and high school dropout rates. Clinton
himself cited some grim statistics, saying that native people are
twice as likely as other Americans to be victims of violent crime,
that unemployment on reservations sometimes reaches as high as 70
percent and that one-third of Indians live in poverty.
 &HT;    Although the budget proposal certainly will not alleviate all
these problems, it does attack some of the underlying issues.
 &HT;    For instance, six schools run by the Bureau of Indian Affairs
(BIA) will be replaced with new facilities, and $171.2 million is
proposed to complete repair and maintenance work at existing
schools. The total request for construction programs for schools is
$300.5 million, an increase of $167.3 million over the current
level.
 &HT;    As part of Clinton's nationwide initiative to hire 100,000
teachers to reduce class size to an average of 18 children in the
first three grades of elementary school, the 2001 budget calls for
$6 million for BIA-funded schools to recruit, train and hire more
teachers.
 &HT;    Tribal colleges also will see a $3 million increase to help fund
operations, bringing that total to $38 million. Some of the funds
are earmarked for information technology in an effort to help
tribes gain access to the digital age.
 &HT;    The budget also includes $46 million more for the Commerce
Department to fund public-works projects on reservations, $60
million more for building and repairing reservation homes, $103
million in new spending on Indian law enforcement and $229 million
more for health care through the Indian Health Service.
 &HT;    Of that increased amount for health care, $35 million will
provide additional services to address diabetes, cancer, heart and
infectious diseases; community violence prevention; elder, maternal
and child health; emergency medical services and injury prevention;
mental-health issues; substance-abuse prevention; and dental
health.
 &HT;    Obviously without federal funding, American Indians and Alaska
natives would be subject to greater societal risks than they are
now.
 &HT;    Some people consider the federal appropriations a handout. But I
think about the native people of generations past who sacrificed
their lives, their land and many things they held sacred in the
belief that the U.S. government would keep its word.
 &HT;    I am a descendant of one of the Ho-Chunk treaty-signers whose
name was translated to English as Rogue. I am sure he understood
the magnitude of his actions as he traveled by horseback from our
homelands in Wisconsin to present-day Washington, D.C., to try to
secure a decent future for generations to come.
 &HT;    Knowing what he gave up then, I am sure he believed he was
setting into motion the right for his descendants to build better
lives today.
 &HT;    Hopefully Clinton's proposed budget will begin to help some
native people experience that better life.

 By ELAINE H. KIM  
 &HT;    Sometimes my students ask me personal questions as they grapple
with their own life decisions. Some ask about the seeming paradox
of being deeply interested in their Korean heritage while planning
to marry a non-Korean, which they fear may cause some people in the
Korean-American community to reject them.
 &HT;    Young Korean-Americans today are indeed blessed, living in an
era when old ideas about who can be American are giving way to
possibilities for new American identities, thanks in part to many
people repeatedly challenging race and sex discrimination over the
decades.
 &HT;    What younger Korean-Americans and I have in common is the
experience of growing up as Korean-Americans in a society that is
obsessed with race, but paradoxically refuses to admit to its
obsession, pretending instead to be ``colorblind.'' We have been
faced with the non-choice of being different and inferior on the
one hand and ``just like us'' but invisible on the other.
 &HT;    But unlike the struggles of young Korean-Americans today, my
childhood and young adult experiences were poisoned and disfigured
by the kind of apartheid life that Asian-Americans on the East
Coast often had before the civil-rights movement of the 1960s.
Those were the ``good old days'' about which so many Americans wax
nostalgic, when life was simpler and people were honest, before the
idyll started being disturbed by uppity, demanding black folks and
waves of messy brown and yellow immigrants.
 &HT;    For me, though, they were very ``bad old days.'' In high school,
no one asked me out on a date, even though I was considered
exceptional ``for an Oriental.'' I was not only a student
government officer, but also a cheerleader _ no mean feat for an
Asian-American in the blonde, blue-eyed 1950s.
 &HT;    I sat at the lunch table with the other cheerleaders, but I was
only a mascot. Even then I was asked about what to order at Chinese
restaurants.
 &HT;    Looking into the mirror, I thought I was beyond ugliness. When
you are too young to know better, you start to become what people
make of you. I would have been mortified to be lumped together in
my classmates' minds with other Asians, especially Asian men. Not
having seen very many Asians besides Fu Manchu, Charlie Chan and
Mr. Moto, all played by white actors with scotch tape on their
eyelids, I thought Asian men were singularly unappealing. I only
dreamed about James Dean and other movie stars.
 &HT;    It was not until I visited Korea, and later moved to California,
that I really began to experience Asians and Asian-Americans as
human beings. It has taken me many years to ``kill'' the white man
inside my head, the standard that ruled Asians and people of color
as inferior and everything white as superior.
 &HT;    During those years, I could barely speak with white people, let
alone keep company with a white man. It was as if even contact with
them would rivet me back into the paroxysms of self-hate that
racism had created.
 &HT;    Gradually I have been able to relax my vigilance and open my
heart, but it has been difficult, and it has taken a long time. The
bright side is that I have been fortunate enough to live in a
multiracial locale where it was possible to establish strong
relations with other Korean-Americans, other Asian-Americans and
other people of color while I was struggling with the white demons
inside my head.
 &HT;    Somehow, being made aware of the diversity and complexity of
these communities has helped me question the false notion of
monolithic white homogeneity. Although we are faced with different
manifestations of social inequality, it is certainly true that
there are many more options for people of color in the United
States today. Hopefully in the future, our children won't
experience the kinds of psychic and material damage we faced.
 &HT;    Among the teen-agers and 20-somethings I encounter in my albeit
very racially diverse environment, I have noticed increasing
acceptance of multiplicity, hybridity and heterogeneity, and less
interest in congealed, mandated identities and communities of
taste.
 &HT;    Today's communities of color are rebelling against the old
colored-white binaries that have dominated American thinking about
race up till now.
 &HT;    Because I experienced those ``good old days,'' I think I
understand why some people feel so defensive about interracial
marriage. Perhaps it's not about interracial marriage at all, but
about Asian-white intermarriage, because that can imply Asian
desire for whiteness in a white supremacist society.
 &HT;    But I don't agree with the people who disapprove of
Korean-Americans marrying people of other races and ethnicities. I
oppose the tendency among some Korean-Americans to try to regulate
Korean-American identity. In the end, they can't really know what
each individual might need and want, let alone why.
 &HT;    And in fact, they don't really care. Whether the would-be
arbiters of Korean-American identity like it or not,
Korean-Americans will be marrying people from many different
backgrounds in the 21st century _ not just whites, but Latinos,
African-Americans, other Asians and people of various mixed
heritages.
 &HT;    When people with different backgrounds get together, they can
bring twice as much to a relationship. Interracial marriage can
create exciting new possibilities.

TALK 2 ME SOME MORE

 By AKILAH MONIFA  
 &HT;    Given the sky-high ratings for the recent HBO film presentation,
``If These Walls Could Talk 2: An Intimate Look at the Lesbian
Experience In America Through Three Decades,'' one wonders if
lesbians are coming back in style. Is a ``Year of the Lesbian''
lurking nearby? Or will lesbian characters in film and television
once again fade from the screen?
 &HT;    Positive change appeared to be on the horizon when, in 1997,
Ellen DeGeneres uttered the now famous words on her television
sit-com, ``Hi, I'm Ellen and I'm gay.'' It was a coming-out
triple-header _ for DeGeneres personally, her TV character and for
network prime time.
 &HT;    Many assumed it was only a matter of time before the small
screen lit up with lesbian shows and characters. At last we would
see ourselves _ albeit little blips at first _ on the cultural
radar known as television.
 &HT;    Instead, ``Ellen'' was unceremoniously dumped by ABC, and
DeGeneres' career plummeted. The ``Ellen'' backlash had begun.
Lesbian characters disappeared from prime time. DeGeneres was
marginalized: For the next two years, she appeared sporadically in
small film roles.
 &HT;    Fortunately the story has a happy ending.
 &HT;    Just when the chances of finding a major lesbian character on
television were on par with seeing a quark, DeGeneres returned with
three made-for-TV lesbian films. In addition, CBS is rumored to be
giving DeGeneres her own Carol Burnett-style comedy show.
 &HT;    DeGeneres may have personally righted career wrongs, but the
playing field remains far from even for lesbian characters and
stories in the entertainment business on the whole. According to
Scott Seomin, entertainment media director of Gay and Lesbian
Alliance Against Defamation, ``lesbians have been relegated to
small marginal roles and gay people of color are almost
nonexistent'' on the small screen.
 &HT;    GLAAD's findings report 29 lesbian, gay or transgender
characters on broadcast and cable networks for the 1999-2000
season. That represents about a 5.3 percent portrayal rate out of a
total of 540 lead or supporting characters.
 &HT;    This portrayal rate includes kisses between straight female
characters. Currently, no regular lesbian lead character appears on
television. ``Xena'' _ a cult favorite _ contains cryptic
references but innuendo hardly counts.
 &HT;    ``Talk 2'' contained three separate stories set in three years _
1961, 1972 and 2000. For me, the most compelling segment was
``1961, '' in which Vanessa Redgrave and Marian Seldes dealt with
the death of a partner after a closeted 50-year relationship. The
universal theme of the story appealed to Redgrave.
 &HT;    ``I think it's a wonderful thing when people can learn the truth
about human life. Without melodrama, without cliche, but with all
those complicated and simple human touches that life is really
about. Although it's a very particular story about these two older
women, I think the script is everybody's story,'' Redgrave said.
 &HT;    ``Talk 2'' was many things to many people. For lesbians and
gays, it was celebrated, `must-see' TV. For our families, friends,
allies and open-minded strangers it offered a chance to learn more
about our lives. It also offers a potential learning curve for
folks who are unsure or uneducated about lesbianism. Ideally in the
viewing of such a program myths are dispelled, prejudices are
lessened and tolerance is enhanced.
 &HT;    Sharon Stone, who co-starred with DeGeneres in one of the
stories, talked about the effect the show had on her parents.
 &HT;    ``They were very supportive and visited me on location. If my
parents, a mainstream, middle-class couple in the middle of
Pennsylvania, think that this is good, then this isn't going to
scare people. This is going to open people's hearts.''
 &HT;    Or take the frat boy who attended a screening of ``Talk 2''
hoping to see a ``lesbian flick.''
 &HT;    ``I thought this was a lesbian movie,'' he said, ``this is just
about love.''
 &HT;    Therein lies the aim of the filmmakers who want people to
understand on a visceral level that lesbians are people too. As
Stone says, ``I am exactly like a gay woman except that I don't
sleep with women.''
 &HT;    Hopefully we will not have to wait another two years to see
another lesbian on the small screen.

GEORGE W.'S POLITICS OF CONVENIENT COMPASSION

 By JAMES E. GARCIA  
 &HT;    Early in his campaign, Republican presidential candidate George
W. Bush routinely promoted himself as a ``compassionate
conservative.'' He often still does _ even as he has grown less
compassionate by the day.
 &HT;    The truth is I never bought Bush's line about being
compassionate to anyone but those who march in lock step with his
views, and his campaign tactics over the past few months have
confirmed my initial instincts.
 &HT;    First, consider Bush's reaction to the barrage of criticism he
received after his speech at Bob Jones University. The South
Carolina school prohibits interracial dating _ unless students have
a note from their parents. The school's leaders have labeled
Catholicism a ``satanic cult.''
 &HT;    Asked why his speech did not condemn the university for its
bigoted policies, Bush insisted that that wasn't the purpose of his
appearance.
 &HT;    Three weeks later _ and only days before a primary election in
which he needed the support of Catholic voters _ Bush finally
acknowledged in a letter to New York Cardinal John O'Conner: ``On
reflection, I should have been more clear in disassociating myself
from anti-Catholic sentiments and racial prejudice.''
 &HT;    Bush says he is not anti-Catholic or racist. I believe him. But
I am disturbed by Bush's apparent willingness to offend minorities
and Catholics for the sake of winning a few extra right-wing votes.
 &HT;    To tolerate bigotry, Bush, is to encourage it.
 &HT;    Bush also has shown little compassion for another minority
group: gays and lesbians.
 &HT;    While Bush didn't think twice about delivering a speech at Bob
Jones University, he refused for months to meet with the Log Cabin
Republicans, a national organization of gays and lesbians who
support the GOP. Only now, after Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., has
dropped out of the race and Bush is virtually assured of winning
the GOP nomination, has the candidate agreed to meet with the
group's leadership.
 &HT;    Bush also refuses to say if he would knowingly appoint a gay
person to his administration.
 &HT;    If Bush is truly compassionate, he would support pending federal
legislation that bans discrimination against homosexuals. He would
also take the time to meet with the leaders of other national gay
and lesbian organizations to hear what they have to say.
 &HT;    On the subject of affirmative action, Bush minimizes the plight
of women and minorities. He opposes affirmative action. He suggests
that all Americans now have an equal opportunity when applying for
jobs or university admissions. Bush is wrong.
 &HT;    Discrimination against women and people of color may be illegal,
but it is still part of the fabric of our society. Far more action
needs to be taken to counter it. Women still get paid less than men
for the same jobs. There are still glass ceilings in hiring and
promoting Latinos, African-Americans and other minorities. And many
states, including Texas, still have laws on the books that sanction
discrimination against homosexuals.
 &HT;    It is because of affirmative action programs and
anti-discrimination laws that hundreds of millions of women and
people of color have been able to climb in the ranks of American
society.
 &HT;    No matter what Bush claims, affirmative action is not about
setting racial, ethnic or gender quotas. The courts ruled long ago
that hiring or appointing a minority just to meet a numeric quota
is discriminatory and unconstitutional.
 &HT;    Furthermore, affirmative-action that ensures that a given pool
of job seekers, university students or judicial nominees includes
qualified women and minorities is not only legal, but fair, just
and, yes, compassionate.
 &HT;    To argue that affirmative action is no longer needed is
shortsighted and ultimately harmful to the noble goal of achieving
equality for women and people of color.
 &HT;    And how can we forget the controversy surrounding the
Confederate flag in South Carolina? Bush still refuses to criticize
those who say it's all right, even honorable, to fly the flag over
that state's capitol.
 &HT;    Confederate-flag supporters say it is a symbol of states'
rights. They're correct. The flag is a symbol of the Confederacy's
claim that it had a right, among other things, to enslave human
beings.
 &HT;    Bush's silence on the matter is an affront to the millions of
African-Americans whose ancestors suffered the brutality of slavery
and still suffer as a result of its legacy. And it is an affront to
anyone who considers that era as one of the most shameful in U.S.
history.
 &HT;    Throughout his campaign, Bush has insisted that he wants more
racial and ethnic minorities to join the GOP. It is a worthy goal.
This cannot happen until his party becomes genuinely more
inclusive.
 &HT;    So far, Bush's actions have not matched his words. He has done
more to divide us than unite us, and has exhibited little true
compassion.
 &HT;    So far, the compassion he has exhibited has proven to be little
more than the politics of convenient compassion.

INCREASED FEDERAL FUNDING FOR INDIANS: A SMALL STEP IN THE RIGHT
DIRECTION

 By KAREN LINCOLN MICHEL  
 &HT;    Among the many traditions of American Indians, one that grew out
of the 18th and 19th centuries was for our leaders to gather in the
nation's capital for treaty talks aimed at protecting the welfare
of tribes amid white expansion into our territories.
 &HT;    At least that was our view of treaty talks.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, the U.S. government's position was to negotiate the
purchase of Indian land for as little as possible, with no
intention of honoring that agreement later.
 &HT;    Those broken promises translate today into billions of dollars
in aid to the country's 2.4 million Indians.
 &HT;    Just two weeks ago, the tradition of journeying to Washington,
D.C., was carried on by current tribal leaders from across the
country. This time they met with President Clinton at the White
House to hear his plan for fulfilling the nation's monetary
obligation to America's 558 recognized tribes.
 &HT;    Clinton told tribal politicians and native leaders that his
fiscal 2001 budget proposal geared toward Indian tribes calls for
increased spending by 12 percent, bringing the total to $9.4
billion for new and existing programs.
 &HT;    It is a $1.2 billion hike over this year's budget, and the
increase addresses important issues in the areas of education,
housing, health care, the environment and crime prevention.
 &HT;    While $9.4 billion is nothing to sneeze at, some native leaders
say the budget falls considerably short of helping American Indians
and Alaska natives pull themselves out of poverty.
 &HT;    Susan Masten, president of the National Congress of American
Indians and chairwoman of the Yurok Tribe of California, reportedly
said that although Clinton's proposal is a good start, it ``does
not begin to address the Third World conditions on our
reservations.''
 &HT;    At the risk of sounding ungrateful, I agree with Masten. The
increase is a step in the right direction. But it is so long
overdue that it would take more of an Olympic long jump to catapult
spending where it ought to be.
 &HT;    Native-Americans continue to rank among the highest in terms of
suicide, teen pregnancy and high school dropout rates. Clinton
himself cited some grim statistics, saying that native people are
twice as likely as other Americans to be victims of violent crime,
that unemployment on reservations sometimes reaches as high as 70
percent and that one-third of Indians live in poverty.
 &HT;    Although the budget proposal certainly will not alleviate all
these problems, it does attack some of the underlying issues.
 &HT;    For instance, six schools run by the Bureau of Indian Affairs
(BIA) will be replaced with new facilities, and $171.2 million is
proposed to complete repair and maintenance work at existing
schools. The total request for construction programs for schools is
$300.5 million, an increase of $167.3 million over the current
level.
 &HT;    As part of Clinton's nationwide initiative to hire 100,000
teachers to reduce class size to an average of 18 children in the
first three grades of elementary school, the 2001 budget calls for
$6 million for BIA-funded schools to recruit, train and hire more
teachers.
 &HT;    Tribal colleges also will see a $3 million increase to help fund
operations, bringing that total to $38 million. Some of the funds
are earmarked for information technology in an effort to help
tribes gain access to the digital age.
 &HT;    The budget also includes $46 million more for the Commerce
Department to fund public-works projects on reservations, $60
million more for building and repairing reservation homes, $103
million in new spending on Indian law enforcement and $229 million
more for health care through the Indian Health Service.
 &HT;    Of that increased amount for health care, $35 million will
provide additional services to address diabetes, cancer, heart and
infectious diseases; community violence prevention; elder, maternal
and child health; emergency medical services and injury prevention;
mental-health issues; substance-abuse prevention; and dental
health.
 &HT;    Obviously without federal funding, American Indians and Alaska
natives would be subject to greater societal risks than they are
now.
 &HT;    Some people consider the federal appropriations a handout. But I
think about the native people of generations past who sacrificed
their lives, their land and many things they held sacred in the
belief that the U.S. government would keep its word.
 &HT;    I am a descendant of one of the Ho-Chunk treaty-signers whose
name was translated to English as Rogue. I am sure he understood
the magnitude of his actions as he traveled by horseback from our
homelands in Wisconsin to present-day Washington, D.C., to try to
secure a decent future for generations to come.
 &HT;    Knowing what he gave up then, I am sure he believed he was
setting into motion the right for his descendants to build better
lives today.
 &HT;    Hopefully Clinton's proposed budget will begin to help some
native people experience that better life.

 By ELAINE H. KIM  
 &HT;    Sometimes my students ask me personal questions as they grapple
with their own life decisions. Some ask about the seeming paradox
of being deeply interested in their Korean heritage while planning
to marry a non-Korean, which they fear may cause some people in the
Korean-American community to reject them.
 &HT;    Young Korean-Americans today are indeed blessed, living in an
era when old ideas about who can be American are giving way to
possibilities for new American identities, thanks in part to many
people repeatedly challenging race and sex discrimination over the
decades.
 &HT;    What younger Korean-Americans and I have in common is the
experience of growing up as Korean-Americans in a society that is
obsessed with race, but paradoxically refuses to admit to its
obsession, pretending instead to be ``colorblind.'' We have been
faced with the non-choice of being different and inferior on the
one hand and ``just like us'' but invisible on the other.
 &HT;    But unlike the struggles of young Korean-Americans today, my
childhood and young adult experiences were poisoned and disfigured
by the kind of apartheid life that Asian-Americans on the East
Coast often had before the civil-rights movement of the 1960s.
Those were the ``good old days'' about which so many Americans wax
nostalgic, when life was simpler and people were honest, before the
idyll started being disturbed by uppity, demanding black folks and
waves of messy brown and yellow immigrants.
 &HT;    For me, though, they were very ``bad old days.'' In high school,
no one asked me out on a date, even though I was considered
exceptional ``for an Oriental.'' I was not only a student
government officer, but also a cheerleader _ no mean feat for an
Asian-American in the blonde, blue-eyed 1950s.
 &HT;    I sat at the lunch table with the other cheerleaders, but I was
only a mascot. Even then I was asked about what to order at Chinese
restaurants.
 &HT;    Looking into the mirror, I thought I was beyond ugliness. When
you are too young to know better, you start to become what people
make of you. I would have been mortified to be lumped together in
my classmates' minds with other Asians, especially Asian men. Not
having seen very many Asians besides Fu Manchu, Charlie Chan and
Mr. Moto, all played by white actors with scotch tape on their
eyelids, I thought Asian men were singularly unappealing. I only
dreamed about James Dean and other movie stars.
 &HT;    It was not until I visited Korea, and later moved to California,
that I really began to experience Asians and Asian-Americans as
human beings. It has taken me many years to ``kill'' the white man
inside my head, the standard that ruled Asians and people of color
as inferior and everything white as superior.
 &HT;    During those years, I could barely speak with white people, let
alone keep company with a white man. It was as if even contact with
them would rivet me back into the paroxysms of self-hate that
racism had created.
 &HT;    Gradually I have been able to relax my vigilance and open my
heart, but it has been difficult, and it has taken a long time. The
bright side is that I have been fortunate enough to live in a
multiracial locale where it was possible to establish strong
relations with other Korean-Americans, other Asian-Americans and
other people of color while I was struggling with the white demons
inside my head.
 &HT;    Somehow, being made aware of the diversity and complexity of
these communities has helped me question the false notion of
monolithic white homogeneity. Although we are faced with different
manifestations of social inequality, it is certainly true that
there are many more options for people of color in the United
States today. Hopefully in the future, our children won't
experience the kinds of psychic and material damage we faced.
 &HT;    Among the teen-agers and 20-somethings I encounter in my albeit
very racially diverse environment, I have noticed increasing
acceptance of multiplicity, hybridity and heterogeneity, and less
interest in congealed, mandated identities and communities of
taste.
 &HT;    Today's communities of color are rebelling against the old
colored-white binaries that have dominated American thinking about
race up till now.
 &HT;    Because I experienced those ``good old days,'' I think I
understand why some people feel so defensive about interracial
marriage. Perhaps it's not about interracial marriage at all, but
about Asian-white intermarriage, because that can imply Asian
desire for whiteness in a white supremacist society.
 &HT;    But I don't agree with the people who disapprove of
Korean-Americans marrying people of other races and ethnicities. I
oppose the tendency among some Korean-Americans to try to regulate
Korean-American identity. In the end, they can't really know what
each individual might need and want, let alone why.
 &HT;    And in fact, they don't really care. Whether the would-be
arbiters of Korean-American identity like it or not,
Korean-Americans will be marrying people from many different
backgrounds in the 21st century _ not just whites, but Latinos,
African-Americans, other Asians and people of various mixed
heritages.
 &HT;    When people with different backgrounds get together, they can
bring twice as much to a relationship. Interracial marriage can
create exciting new possibilities.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Being tough on crime has become an excuse to brutalize children.
</P>
<P>
   Rehabilitation of juvenile offenders is no longer the goal,
punishment is. Teen-agers have been beaten, abused, raped,
impregnated and sometimes even killed by guards in state detention
centers around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Currently there are investigations of such abuses in Maryland,
Georgia, Delaware, Texas, Illinois, California, Louisiana,
Virginia, Florida, Arizona and South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Virginia's Juvenile Justice Director Gerald Glenn
instituted training in new kicking and striking techniques for
officers in the state's eight juvenile detention centers. The
officers were trained to use the ``whip kick,'' ``elbow strike,''
``shin rake,'' ``instep stomp'' and ``forearm body blow'' against
juveniles they think pose a threat. The new philosophy sanctions
the striking of children in custody.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia's Department of Juvenile Justice came under scrutiny
last year for the death of a 16-year-old retarded boy who died
while in restraints in a youth detention center in Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia is closing its paramilitary boot camps after the U.S.
Department of Justice rebuked the state, calling the camps ``not
only ineffective but harmful'' to the juveniles in custody.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's boot camps aren't the only ones investigated for
brutalizing children. South Dakota's juvenile corrections system
and its boot camps are currently under scrutiny by the Justice
Department.
</P>
<P>
   In South Dakota, even ``children in need of supervision''
(CHINS) have been placed under the control of the Department of
Corrections for such ``offenses'' as truancy, running away from
home and poor grades. These children _ some as young as 13 _ have
been placed in boot camps and mistreated.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1999, Gina Score, a 226-pound, 14-year-old girl was
forced to run 2.7 miles at the boot camp Plankinton on her first
day at the corrections facility. She collapsed and died of
hyperthermia. She had been left lying in the sun for more than
three hours before an ambulance was called to take her to a
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Investigations into this incident uncovered other abuses at the
Plankinton boot camp. Several girls were forced to run in shackles
until their ankles bled.
</P>
<P>
   A guard put a handcuff over his fist and punched a teen-age boy
in the face, breaking the child's tooth. The boy was in restraints
at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The Argus Leader, the Sioux Falls newspaper, in November
reported on a number of incidents at the State Training School at
Plankinton, which includes the boot camp: ``Teen-age girl inmates
strip-searched by male guards. Others sprayed with pepper spray
while naked. Still others handcuffed spread-eagled to beds.''
</P>
<P>
   The story failed to report that other teen-age girls had their
clothes cut off by male guards while they were spread-eagled in
handcuffs. According to one parent, her daughter was blindfolded so
she couldn't recognize the guards involved.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. William Janklow, who created the boot camps in South Dakota
after he took office in 1995, calls these incidents a problem with
``rogue guards.'' In an interview with the Argus Leader, Janklow
claimed he ``never ever had an inkling'' about the problems at
Plankinton.
</P>
<P>
   But the boot camp in Plankinton isn't the only problem in the
juvenile justice system in South Dakota. The boot camp in Custer
also has a record of abusing its teen-age wards. A counselor there
has been accused of molesting six young boys.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the governor nor his spokesman, Bob Mercer, returned
numerous telephone calls requesting an interview last week,
although both were present in the office, according to the
governor's secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Gramkow, a resident of Sioux Falls, frustrated at the
way her 14-year-old daughter had been treated in the Plankinton
facility, began the Parents Who Care Coalition for parents of
children caught up by the state's Department of Corrections.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 130 parents are now active members who are
attempting to educate state legislators about the abuses occurring
in the juvenile justice system in South Dakota. So far, their three
main proposals for legislation have been killed: a children's
rights bill, a parent's rights bill, and a bill that would separate
CHINS from juvenile offenders.
</P>
<P>
   When Gramkow visited her daughter at the Plankinton facility,
she found her daughter had multiple bruises on both arms. One, she
said, looked as if it had been the result of being struck with a
club.
</P>
<P>
   Months later, a group of teen girls in a suicidal rage broke
light bulbs and cut up their arms. The guards merely watched, said
Gramkow. She said one girl attacked her daughter and cut up her
arms and wrists. The girls didn't get medical treatment for their
lacerations for more than four hours.
</P>
<P>
   How did Gramkow's daughter enter the nightmare world of South
Dakota juvenile corrections? She was a runaway. Now she's scarred
for life _ emotionally and physically.
</P>
<P>
   Edith Barden of Spearfish has a 14-year-old granddaughter in the
juvenile corrections system. The granddaughter's crime was truancy
and poor grades in school. The granddaughter's mother, according to
Barden, is an alcoholic and the child would sometimes stay home to
care for her.
</P>
<P>
   From the child's own compassion and love for her mother, she
became a truant and subsequently her grades suffered.
</P>
<P>
   And now she is in a hospital in Yankton because she attempted
suicide after being told she wouldn't be allowed to go home until
she was 21 years old. They can do that in South Dakota _ hold a
child for an indeterminate period of time.
</P>
<P>
   Deb Phillips of Rapid City is the western coordinator for the
Parents Who Care Coalition. Her 13-year-old daughter entered the
juvenile corrections system when she became truant and a runaway.
She was sent to the boot camp in Custer.
</P>
<P>
   Pam Guettler lives in Spearfish. Her daughter was put in the
Juvenile Services Center in Rapid City because she skipped school
and missed 20 days. The Guettlers were forced to sign a paper,
which turned their daughter over to the state, under the threat of
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Guettler's daughter has a drug and alcohol problem. State
corrections officials wanted her in a boot camp, not a treatment
center. The daughter also has a severe ear infection, but the
officials at the Custer boot camp would not allow her to see a
doctor for the problem.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 24, the Youth Law Center filed a class action lawsuit in
a federal district court against the South Dakota Department of
Corrections and the superintendent of the State Training School at
Plankinton. The lawsuit alleges numerous abuses and inhumane
treatment of children while they were in state custody.
</P>
<P>
   On March 6, the international watchdog group Human Rights Watch
sent a letter to Gov. Janklow urging him to take steps to ensure
that state policy respects children's fundamental rights and end
their inhumane treatment.
</P>
<P>
   These stories illustrate the depth and breadth of the problem in
one state. This is how South Dakota treats its problem children.
The governor has been quoted as calling them ``scum.'' And, as the
governor sets the tone of his administration, the children are
treated accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   But the problem of the mistreatment of our children is much
deeper and broader than any one state. This nightmare has swept
across our nation.
</P>
<P>
   The brutalization of children in state custody is the product of
a corrupt philosophy _ a philosophy without compassion, without an
understanding of the troubles faced by children, without trust or
respect and without a faith in their potential for rehabilitation.

   EKATI DIAMOND MINE, Northwest Territories _ When the mercury
drops down to minus 40 degrees and below, steel bulldozer blades
scraping rock sometimes shatter like a champagne bottle flung
against a ship's bow. Great walrus tusks of frozen breath dangle
from the beards and nostrils of miners in the immense open pit,
where the blink of an eye can bring blindness as eyelashes freeze
instantly to the lower lid, as if spot-welded.
</P>
<P>
   At these temperatures, even the swaggering drillers working on
the Koala and Misery ``pipes'' _ ancient funnel-shaped vertical
veins packed with kimberlite, the detritus of long-dead volcanos _
will allow that there is a real nip to the winds roaring down from
the High Arctic.
</P>
<P>
   But the digging goes on around the clock and in all weather at
North America's only diamond mine, barely a year old but already
producing more than $1.3 million a day in precious gems.
</P>
<P>
   Mammoth earth-moving machines, including trucks with 218 tons of
capacity, whose drivers perch three stories above the iced tundra,
rumble beneath the eerie flare of the aurora borealis _ the
northern lights _ while the flat crack of high explosives
reverbrates across a terrain so bleak and forbidding that the
Indians call it the Barren Grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes 10,000 tons of rock to yield a ton of kimberlite
ore,'' said Serge Pelletier, a Quebec-born engineer and operations
overseer at the Ekati mine. ``And that ton of kimberlite will yield
just a single carat, on average.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a lot of rubble to sift, scrub, and scan for the saucy
wink of gemstone to grace a neck, finger, or earlobe. But diamonds
are magic as much as they are stone _ the sparkling bits of
crystalline carbon possess the power of wealth and beauty. Or
avarice and vanity. The power, in any event, to compel humans to
brave one of the planet's most brutal environments.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most diamond mines, the Ekati's bounty is almost entirely
in diamonds of gem quality, not industrial diamonds, and nearly all
will wind up adorning women in North America, Europe, and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly among the richest diamond mines in the world,''
said Graham Nicholls, spokesman for BHP Diamonds Inc., operator of
the mine. ``Perhaps the richest.''
</P>
<P>
   Most diamonds come from Africa, and for the past 100 years the
industry has been inseparable from De Beers Consolidated Mines
Ltd., which produces 50 percent of the world's diamonds from its
mines in southern Africa. The firm also controls 70 percent of the
international supply of the raw gems through its sales cartel in
Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's emergence as a major producer is shaking up the closed,
cozy world of big diamonds. By the end of the decade, some analysts
reckon, this nation may be the source of 12 percent of the world
supply.
</P>
<P>
   That's an extraordinary change, given that only a few years ago
Canada produced as many diamonds as it does coconuts _ none.
</P>
<P>
   Although a few geologists insisted the country's frigid outback
must contain deposits, De Beers and other major diamond mining
companies had for years scoured ``North of 60'' _ as inhabitants
refer to their hinterland above 60 degrees latitude _ without
hitting a glint of paydirt. The quest, always a long shot, came to
seem futile, even a little loopy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talking about finding diamonds in Canada was like talking
about going to Mars,'' said Charles E. Fipke, a
geologist-prospector from British Columbia whose obsessive pursuit
of northern diamonds mostly drew hoots of derision in the rowdy
taverns of Yellowknife, the territorial capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``People thought you were crazy, or pulling some kind of scam,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Long after the diamond heavies wrote off the north as a bad bet,
Fipke kept tracking elusive glacial trails across the barrens,
riding bush choppers and rubber rafts to the far corners of this
realm of caribou, ravenous wolves, and croaking ravens.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in November 1991, he dug up a micro-diamond near Point
Lake, Northwest Territories. The find triggered the biggest
prospecting stampede in Canada since the Klondike Gold Rush of the
1890s, as more than 72,000 square miles _ a territory the size of
New England _ were staked by mining outfits in a matter of months.
Dozens of possibly rich kimberlite pipes were located, most covered
by lakes.
</P>
<P>
   Fipke's exploratory company, Dia Met Mineral Ltd., joined with
BHP Diamonds, a subsidiary of Australian mining giant Broken Hill
Proprietary Co., to develop the Ekati site, located 120 miles south
of the Arctic Circle and 110 miles from the nearest human
habitation, the Dogrib Dene Indian hamlet of Wekweti.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Ekati is the only diamond mine up and running on this
continent. The project's huge indoor processing plant, the housing
complex for workers (flown into the site for two-week,
12-hour-a-day shifts), and machinery sheds are the largest
construction north of the Canadian treeline.
</P>
<P>
   Even more impressively, the Ekati has catapulted this country
into the major leagues of diamond mining, with more than $400
million in annual production, tying Australia as the fifth largest
producer of the glittery element by value, after Botswana, Russia,
South Africa, and Angola.
</P>
<P>
   ``From nowhere, the (territory) is already producing 6 percent
of the world's diamonds,'' said Martin Irving, director of diamond
projects for the territorial government. ``That's from a single
hole in the ground. It's a pretty exciting thing for Canada, and
for the diamond industry.''
</P>
<P>
   As BHP Diamonds scoops its fabulous bounty from the kimberlite
at a rate of more than 225,000 carats a month, competing diamond
interests are stamping impatiently in the wings. Diavik Diamond
Mines Inc. is ready to start a $1 billion excavation on an island
in Lac de Gras, just across the ice from the Ekati lode. The
discovery of the Diavik kimberlite pipes was made by Canadian
geologist Eira Thomas, one of only a handful of women to earn a big
reputation in the hairy-chested world of international mineral
prospecting.
</P>
<P>
   Construction of the Diavik mine was supposed to begin last
month. Massive gear-hauling trucks were ready to head out on the
winter-ice road leading from Yellowknife, the only overland route
to the region, a trail of frozen rivers, lakes and tundra passable
only until late March.
</P>
<P>
   But environmentalists and native groups tossed a last-minute
monkey wrench into the project, claiming the mine could interfere
with the migration of caribou and might contaminate Lac de Gras,
which feeds the Coppermine River, source of drinking water for
several native hamlets.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens when 400,000 caribou meet 250 million tons of
waste rock? What will be the effect on water of the Coppermine
River?'' asked John Crump, head of the Canadian Arctic Resources
Committee, an environmental group based in Ottawa. ``The answer is,
`Nobody knows.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the company has held 300 public meetings, committed
itself to costly ecological safeguards that won approval from
Canada's Ministry of the Environment, and pledged to recruit 40
percent of the mine workforce from the aboriginal population of the
region. Roughly half the vast territory's 40,000 people are Dene
Indian, Eskimo, or mixed-race Metis.
</P>
<P>
   Diavik hopes to be producing diamonds by 2003. ``This could be a
big and crucial business for northern Canada,'' said spokesman Tom
Hoefor.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for Yellowknife, the discovery of diamonds seemed a
godsend, coming as the territory's traditional economic mainstays,
gold and government, were on the decline. The gold mines are
shutting down and public sector jobs have been slashed by Ottawa,
which administers the territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diamonds could be the difference between boom or bust,'' said
David Lovell, mayor of Yellowknife, which is home to nearly half
the inhabitants of the territory. ``These gems are our future.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Dene language, Ekati means ``fat lake,'' and refers to
the white granite outcroppings that Indians say resemble big scoops
of caribou fat, a symbol of wealth to people surviving in a lean
land.
</P>
<P>
   Territorial leaders seem generally enthusiastic about diamond
mining, which, properly done, is far cleaner than other forms of
mining, using few chemicals and producing waste that is essentially
just water-scrubbed gravel. But they also warn that mining
companies better be prepared to invest heavily in the territory's
isolated and impoverished native communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't see clear benefits for aboriginals, the diamonds
can stay in the ground,'' said Stephen Kakfwi, provincial premier
and a Dene, stressing that he supports mining development, but also
believes in moving cautiously.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ekati mine blazed the way,'' he said, ``and we've got good
relations. BHP is a class act. But some diamond mining people come
in with a redneck attitude, expecting us to roll over. We want to
develop mining, sure, but our most important dream is to develop a
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the only jurisdiction in North America with diamonds,''
Kakfwi said. ``And our people are going to share in the wealth of
those stones.''

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    America has been reminded once again that it is woefully
ill-prepared to deal with the threat of biological terrorism. The
General Accounting Office, an investigative branch of Congress, has
charged that the government has failed to properly manage the
medical stockpiles developed to protect the public from the scourge
of potentially devastating biological weapons.
 &HT;    In a scathing report, the GAO criticized multiple government
agencies for managing the stockpiles so poorly that they might be
unavailable in the event of an attack. It found shortages of vital
drugs as well as deficiencies in the amount of emergency supplies
that were supposed to be on hand.
 &HT;    The Chemical Biological Incident Response Force, a Marine Corps
unit created in 1996 to help treat civilian victims of a biological
attack, was cited for glaring shortcomings: the GAO discovered that
more than a quarter of the Corps' stockpile was plagued by
inventory discrepancies and record-keeping errors. The Department
of Veterans Affairs was also cited for its failure to competently
manage emergency supplies.
 &HT;    This government ineptitude is no idle matter. If deadly microbes
like anthrax or smallpox were released into the general population
_ a prospect that experts say is quite plausible _ federal
stockpiles of medical supplies would be critical to saving lives.
State and local authorities could be overwhelmed by mounting
casualties, and federal intervention would be urgently needed. No
city in the country has the resources to handle a major attack on
its own.
 &HT;    Yet Washington has been dragging its heels in preparing for a
potential crisis. The recent GAO report is only the latest evidence
to emerge that the government's effort to prepare for a biological
attack is alarmingly ineffective.
 &HT;    The problem, quite simply, is that the nation has yet to take
the steps that could ultimately save thousands, or even tens of
thousands, of lives. Such steps include everything from enhancing
our disease surveillance system to ensuring an adequate supply of
lifesaving vaccines and antibiotics.
 &HT;    The government's failure to take these steps raises inevitable
questions. With the stakes so high, why isn't Washington taking
more aggressive action? If national security and health officials
agree that the threat is real, why aren't they working harder to
mitigate the threat?
 &HT;    The answer may lie in the unique challenges posed by the specter
of bioterrorism.
 &HT;    Unlike a chemical or explosive attack, a biological attack will
require the close collaboration of groups that are not accustomed
to working together: the national security and public health
establishments. It's an odd mix _ doctors and intelligence agents _
but for biological counterterrorism to work, they must join forces.
Unfortunately, the National Security Council and other federal
agencies have yet to fully integrate the medical community into
their plans.
 &HT;    In order to succeed, they will have to correct this flaw,
because the first responders to any bioweapons attack are likely to
be doctors and local public health authorities _ not firemen,
police or SWAT teams. If terrorists should ever unleash infectious
agents on a city, the first evidence of the attack will almost
certainly appear in hospital emergency rooms. At this point, a
rapid response will be critical: if diagnosis and treatment is
delayed, it could mean huge numbers of casualties. The very
survival of healthcare providers could be at stake.
 &HT;    But how well prepared are we to handle such a crisis? Few
doctors have ever seen a case of smallpox, plague or anthrax. Few,
if any, medical laboratories are equipped to diagnose such
conditions. And as the GAO just noted, our stockpiles of drugs and
supplies are far from ideal.
 &HT;    There are other problems as well. The national counterterrorism
effort, for example, has thus far focused mainly on chemical and
explosive weapons rather than on infectious agents. Perhaps this
reflects the security establishment's familiarity with such
weapons, since its efforts in this area have largely involved the
enhancement of existing hazardous material protocols. But what
about the biological threat?
 &HT;    Medical experts point out that biological weapons are far more
dangerous than either chemicals or explosives, since the
devastation from this kind of attack can persist and even get worse
over time, as new cases of disease continue to arise. In contrast,
stabilization and recovery from a chemical or explosive attack can
begin almost immediately. Yet despite this reality, preparations
for a bioweapons attack have lagged far behind efforts to prepare
for more traditional kinds of threats like explosives.
 &HT;    The problem is not just one of priorities. It's also a matter of
expertise. Our national security apparatus _ accustomed to dealing
with military (rather than medical) issues _ hasn't brought enough
health experts into the nation's emergency preparedness program. In
fact, according to the Center for Civilian Biodefense Studies at
Johns Hopkins University, the medical community has so far received
little funding or targeted attention from any preparedness program,
and few hospitals have participated in the bioterrorism response
exercises sponsored by federal authorities.
 &HT;    This is a particularly illogical strategy, since planning for a
possible ``man-made'' epidemic is best handled by the people who
are specially trained for this kind of occurrence: epidemiologists
and infectious disease specialists. Preparing for bioterrorism
without their active involvement is a bit like preparing for war
without the Department of Defense. It's time to correct this
oversight.
 &HT;    We also need to improve the communication between the medical
and law enforcement communities. National security efforts in the
biological arena simply will not work without the combined
participation of both communities. By planning ahead, we can not
only avoid unnecessary problems like drug shortages but we can also
minimize the chance that cultural differences between the national
security and health establishments will hamper the nation's
response to a terrorist attack.

ELECTION PROTEST INCITED IN RUSSIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Fed up with what they maintain is a lack of choice in
the presidential election and biased media coverage, protesters
here are calling on Russians to vote for ``none of the above'' and
boycott Russia's two main television networks.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, on a square across the street from the stately
Bolshoi Theater in downtown Moscow, one group made that point with
a crash. Two men heaved a decades-old television into a statue of
Karl Marx. The picture tube exploded with a loud pop and
Mohawk-sporting punk-rockers and self-styled ``anarchists'' in
black ski masks violently kicked and stomped the mangled TV's
remains.
</P>
<P>
   With a presidential vote two weeks away and a victory for Acting
President Vladimir V. Putin a near certainty, some Russians have
said the election looks more like a coronation. According to this
small, but vocal, minority, Russia's fledgling democracy and
hard-won freedoms have been hijacked by Putin, a former KGB spy who
became acting president when Boris Yeltsin abruptly resigned on New
Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Fawning state-run television stations, politically connected
businessmen and a brutal war against separatist rebels in Chechnya,
they said, have aided Putin's drive to power. Calling the elections
a farce and fearing that civil liberties are in danger, some people
are taking to the streets in protest.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, scores of demonstrators, carrying signs with
slogans like ``Last Days of Freedom'' and ``Vote Against Everybody
or the Kremlin Will Steal Your Vote,'' applauded the TV smashing
heartily. As a rock band blared out guitar feedback, a young man
shouted, ``Down with the state, down with the war, down with
Putin'' into a microphone.
</P>
<P>
   Stern police officers stood menacingly behind the protesters and
took notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is expected of us is not a vote but our participation in
our own execution,'' read a statement distributed by the protest's
organizers. ``The politicians are putting on a mere appearance of a
contest, knowing the results in advance. No matter how we vote they
will decide things their own way.''
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators encouraged Russians to either boycott the
elections or vote for ``none of the above'' _ an option in Russian
elections _ in the country's March 26 presidential poll. For the
election to be valid, 50 percent of eligible voters must cast
ballots. Likewise, should the number of votes for ``none of the
above'' exceed the leading candidate's total, the election would be
declared invalid and a new poll would be scheduled for four months
later.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the protesters called for boycotts of Russia's two
main state-owned television stations _ which they claimed
shamelessly promoted Putin _ and of companies that advertise on
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want people to be ashamed to participate in this farce they
are calling an election,'' said Boris Kagarlitsky, an author and
political activist who organized the protest.
</P>
<P>
   When the festivities were over, police briefly detained and
questioned Kagarlitsky.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's protest was organized by one of several groups
fighting the Putin juggernaut. The most prominent of these is the
so-called ``Nyet Campaign,'' headed by Moscow-based political
analyst Vladimir Pribylovsky and Sergei Grigoryants, head of the
Glasnost Defense Fund, a free-speech advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   Pribylovsky said he is against an election boycott, which he
claimed would make it easier for the Kremlin to tamper with unused
ballots and falsify the results. Instead, he called on voters to
choose ``none of the above,'' which would allow democrats four
months to regroup and find a strong candidate to oppose Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show Putin leading 12 presidential candidates with over 50
percent support. His closest competitor, Communist leader Gennady
Zyuganov, has about 20 percent. Liberal economist and lawmaker
Grigory Yavlinsky is running third with about seven percent.
</P>
<P>
   Most current opinion polls don't show figures for ``none of the
above.'' According to official results from past national
elections, three to five percent of the electorate have chosen that
option.
</P>
<P>
   Pribylovsky conceded that his campaign had little chance of
success, but said he nevertheless wanted to send a message to
Russia's leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to show the authorities that they don't have carte
blanche,'' said Pribylovsky.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently they have gotten the message. Last week, Russia's
Electoral Commission announced that it was investigating the
legality of openly campaigning for ``none of the above.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as most candidates used free television time to run
campaign advertisements, Putin said he would forego the privilege.
Putin _ who as acting president has enjoyed extensive and positive
news coverage _ said he disdained the idea of advertising himself.

<P>
   The rules are never neutral and the process can all but
predetermine the product.
</P>
<P>
   Those political truths are seldom demonstrated as vividly as
they were last week, when, a scant 35 days after New Hampshire put
the presidential primary season at center stage, Super Tuesday
brought the curtain crashing down.
</P>
<P>
   As voters contemplate a general-election matchup between a
Democratic candidate with a reputation for playing fast and loose
with the truth and a Republican champion whose most significant
ability, as Thomas Hart Benton quipped of a lackluster 19th-century
nominee, seems to be availability, it is worth examining what has
happened with the primary season.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially we've come full circle. The ridiculously
front-loaded modern primary schedule has effectively returned
nominating power to the very party establishments from which
primaries were meant to wrest control.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think that the process should allow an outsider to
challenge the party's choice, then this latest process is
horrible,'' says Steven Stark, a longtime political analyst. ``We
have almost gone back to the old system of the smoke-filled room _
except it is a larger room.''
</P>
<P>
   The sheer demands of a schedule that saw 13 contests in the GOP
race and 15 on the Democratic side _ all on one day _ have done
that.
</P>
<P>
   William Mayer, a professor of political science at Northeastern
University and a specialist on the nominating process, says that in
1976, only 19 percent of the convention delegates on each side had
been allocated five weeks into the primary season. This year, the
number is about 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   According to the respective parties, 37 percent of Democratic
delegates and 27 percent of Republican delegates were assigned just
last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   To those who say ``So what?'', consider the effect this schedule
has not just on the tempo but on the outcome of the races.
</P>
<P>
   ``The schedule forced the challengers to run unrealistic
bicoastal campaigns that neither could do,'' says William Galvin,
Massachusetts secretary of state and chairman of the Committee on
Presidential Primaries for the National Association of Secretaries
of State. ``That obviously added extra benefit to the candidates
who had party establishment support, financial depth, and name
recognition.''
</P>
<P>
   With those advantages, Vice President Al Gore won in a walk,
while Texas Governor George W. Bush was able to turn what had been
a competitive contest, when Arizona Senator John McCain could focus
on fewer states, into a rout.
</P>
<P>
   A capsule history of the campaign shows just how absurd things
have become. Twelve Republican candidates began the race, including
such experienced figures as Dan Quayle, the former vice president
and senator; Lamar Alexander, the former two-term Tennessee
governor and US education secretary; Elizabeth Dole, a two-time
cabinet secretary and head of the American Red Cross; and Orrin
Hatch, a three-term US senator.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates spent much of 1999 furiously raising money and
wooing GOP activists. Then, by mid-fall of 1999, before a single
vote had been cast, Alexander, Dole, and Quayle dropped out. After
a poor showing in the Iowa caucuses, Hatch joined them, leaving
only two serious candidates _ Bush and McCain _ to face off in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Five weeks later, Bush, arguably the least experienced of the
serious candidates, is now the GOP nominee in all but name.
</P>
<P>
   Things were almost as grim on the Democratic side.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, Bill Bradley, the former New Jersey senator, excited
enough interest to lead Gore in the polls through much of the fall
in New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and New York. But when Gore beat
him by a mere 4 percentage points in New Hampshire, their race fell
deep into the shadows of the Republican contest. After that,
reporters, eyeing the huge challenge Super Tuesday presented,
seemed interested less in what Bradley had to say than in when he
would drop out.
</P>
<P>
   Not convinced of the need for change? Well, consider this: Under
the current syncopated schedule, a strong argument can be made that
neither Jimmy Carter nor Ronald Reagan would ever have been
president.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, after all, started the 1976 campaign as a dark horse, a
former one-term governor of Georgia who won the Democratic
nomination by persevering over better-known rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Stark, who was issues director for Carter's primary campaign,
says the longer, more rationally spaced primary calendar of that
era let Carter parlay the momentum of each victory into the
resources needed to continue. ``It was a set of dominoes in those
days,'' recalls Stark. ``Carter couldn't have raised enough money
to contest 15 states on one day.'' The winner probably would have
been a more established Washington figure, perhaps Senator Henry
Jackson of Washington state or Senator Birch Bayh of Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Given that Carter is generally considered an ineffectual
president, some might say that depriving the nation of his
stewardship would have been a consummation devoutly to be wished.
Yet it was the same extended 1976 calendar that laid the groundwork
for the 1980 nomination of Reagan, increasingly considered one of
the century's most important presidents. But in the first month of
that 1976 primary season, Reagan was almost knocked out of the
race. After an exceedingly narrow loss (49.4 to 48 percent) to
President Ford in New Hampshire on Feb. 24, Reagan dropped four
more primaries in a row, including such important battlegrounds as
Florida and Illinois, before claiming his first victory on March
23, in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were absolutely busted the night we won North Carolina,''
remembers Jeffrey Bell, a veteran of that campaign. ``We had no
money. The campaign plane was flying west to consider withdrawing
from the race'' when the results came in.
</P>
<P>
   His North Carolina win quieted calls for Reagan to quit, but
even then, his next victory didn't come until five weeks later, on
May 1, in Texas. By that point, Reagan, so strapped for cash he
couldn't afford to charter a campaign plane, was traveling on
commercial flights.
</P>
<P>
   Only after Texas did Reagan's challenge to Ford take off; in the
last five weeks of the campaign, he won 10 more primaries.
</P>
<P>
   But had the 1976 calendar looked like that of 2000, ``Reagan
probably would have been knocked out early,'' speculates John
Morgan, a former Reagan political operative. And had his 1976
challenge ended in short, inglorious defeat, rather than the
razor-close race to the finish, Reagan might well have been
dismissed as an unelectable, aging has-been in 1980, rather than
the conservative champion.
</P>
<P>
   Other drawbacks to this truncated schedule are more insidious:
It creates a hit-and-run environment that puts a premium on
desperation tactics and devalues substantive debate.
</P>
<P>
   Does any intelligent voter seriously suspect, for example, that
Bush is anti-Catholic, as McCain has suggested?
</P>
<P>
   Does anyone believe McCain is opposed to breast-cancer research,
as Bush's campaign has claimed?
</P>
<P>
   Still, in the atmosphere of ambuscade encouraged by the
top-heavy schedule, that's precisely the kind of politics that
predominates. In his new book ``No Way to Pick A President,'' Jules
Witcover, the veteran political columnist, puts it this way:
</P>
<P>
   ``The present front-loading too often has candidates bouncing
from one state to another simply repeating what they've said in
early states . . . (W)hat escalates is not the substantive value of
the dialogue, but the intensity of the negativism.''
</P>
<P>
   A compacted schedule also warps the press coverage, making
strategy and tactics, not substance, the focus of daily reports.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Payne, a Boston media consultant and a veteran of two
presidential campaigns, says the frantic schedule creates a
mismatch between the narrative reporters tell and the information
voters need. ``Voters are trying to figure out who is McCain, who
is Bradley, but the national media is largely writing analytic
pieces telling them that they (the underdogs) are not going to get
the nomination and here's why.''
</P>
<P>
   So how do you change the system? Witcover favors a calendar that
would schedule primaries every two weeks starting in March, with no
more than five states holding a contest on each Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The smaller states would start first. In concept, that system
would allow less-known candidates to compete without being
overwhelmed by the sheer magnitude of the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with that proposal? ``The genie is out of the bottle
and we are not going to get it back in,'' Galvin says. That is,
with so many states determined to have a piece of the primary
action, it's hard to imagine the big states agreeing to that
system.
</P>
<P>
   Galvin says the only plan that might win common agreement, at
least in the near future, is the one his association has put
forward for rotating regional primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Under that scheme, Iowa would still hold its caucuses in late
January, New Hampshire its cherished primary in early February.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the first Tuesday of each of the next four months
would see a region-wide primary. The regions would change order
every presidential election year, with the region that had gone
first moving to the end of the line. Approximately one-quarter of
the delegates would be chosen on each of those election days.
</P>
<P>
   That's far from a perfect system, certainly. The demands on a
dark horse, though diminished, would still be considerable; a
better system, Mayer says, would be to have eight, rather than
four, regional primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Still, to quote Voltaire, one shouldn't make the perfect the
enemy of the good; the plan Galvin favors is clearly preferable to
today's system and perhaps a first step toward something better. It
would eliminate needless crisscrossing of the country, add regional
coherence, allow more time for issues _ and lower, at least
somewhat, the brick wall Super Tuesday now presents to insurgents.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican and Democratic parties are discussing the
regional primary idea _ and, so far, the reception has been good.
Still, Galvin believes that if the plan is to be recommended to the
states and then adopted, that will have to happen before the
November election.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as one party knows they are the incumbent, then the
planning for reelection begins,'' says Galvin. ``And then the
strategizing will overwhelm any attempt to reform the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Who, after all, wants the rules to be neutral when there's a
chance they will favor him instead?

HANDICAPPING THE EARLY FIELD OF TICKET-FILLERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ To engage in Washington's favorite political parlor
game, consider this question: Whom might George W. Bush pick as a
running mate who was a hero in the Vietnam War, who is beloved by
advocates of campaign finance overhaul, and who can attract
independents likely to determine the election?
</P>
<P>
   Hint: The object of the game is to pick someone just like
Senator John McCain _ without the McCain baggage.
</P>
<P>
   One answer has tongues wagging in Washington. He is Senator
Chuck Hagel of Nebraska. (At this point, it is acceptable outside
of Washington and Nebraska to say, ``Who?'')
</P>
<P>
   In Vietnam, Hagel, his own body on fire, saved his brother from
a burning armored personnel carrier. In Washington, Hagel was
nearly as outspoken as McCain in backing changes in the way
politicians raise their campaign finances.
</P>
<P>
   Another intriguing inquiry is underway at the campaign of Vice
President Al Gore, where the process might be called, ``It's the
Economy, Stupid, Part II.'' Who can help Gore ensure Americans that
prosperity will continue? Some Gore partisans think the answer is
the former secretary of the Treasury, Robert J. Rubin, who has
admirers on both political sides, and executive credentials from
many regions, but who has no experience running for elective
office.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that Hagel or Rubin has a real shot at the
job, or that they want it. Indeed, many observers said the leading
candidate on the Republican side is Governor Tom Ridge of
Pennsylvania, another Vietnam veteran, who has the bonus of a
20-year association with the Bush family.
</P>
<P>
   Other frequently mentioned Republicans include:
</P>
<P>
   --Elizabeth Dole, the former Red Cross president and former
presidential candidate, for her experience and her appeal to women.
</P>
<P>
   -- Senator Fred Thompson of Tennessee, partly because of his
outsider appeal and role in campaign finance investigations.
</P>
<P>
   --Former Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, whose resume might
help compensate for Bush's lack of foreign policy experience.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of other Democrats are in the mix, including Senator Evan
Bayh of Indiana, Governor Gray Davis of California, Senator Bob
Graham of Florida and Senator Dianne Feinstein of California.
</P>
<P>
   But interviews with Bush and Gore advisers, as well as others,
have found a clear trend in this early stage of the ``veepstakes.''
The informal search is focused much less than usual on geography
and ticket balancing, and more on wooing independents and voters
focused on economic issues. The big question is whether the
post-primary impulse to attract McCain voters will fade as the
process plays out.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's search for a vice presidential nominee might be summed up
in two words: ``No surprises.'' Otherwise interpreted: The Bush
campaign may not want to repeat the selection process of 1988, in
which George H.W. Bush, the father, picked Senator Dan Quayle, who
was little known outside his native Indiana and who made a poor
first impression on many voters.
</P>
<P>
   One favorite among Republican kibitzers is retired General Colin
L. Powell Jr. But a confidant who talked last week with the former
chairman of the Joint Chiefs said Powell has ruled out the vice
presidency, although not necessarily a job such as secretary of
state.
</P>
<P>
   McCain himself has said he would not accept the vice
presidential slot, as has former Senator Bill Bradley.Of course,
potential vice presidents often say they don't want the job. But
the statements by McCain and Bradley seem firm, leaving the field
of possible prospects much wider than usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``John McCain always flew single-seat fighter planes,'' said Ken
Duberstein, the McCain adviser and a Reagan White House chief of
staff. ``There is a reason why he never flew two-seat fighter
planes. He could never be the person in the back seat. That holds
for fighter planes and vice presidencies.''
</P>
<P>
   But Duberstein, who already is acting as an intermediary for the
Bush and McCain camps, said that Hagel or Ridge would be a logical
choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Chuck Hagel would be superb,'' Duberstein said. ``So
would Tom Ridge, who not only is the governor of a key industrial
state, but is a Vietnam vet, is prochoice, has Washington
experience but is a governor, and oh, by the way, he is Catholic.''
</P>
<P>
   During the primaries, Bush was assailed by McCain for speaking
at Bob Jones University, whose leaders have referred to Catholicism
as a ``cult.'' While Bush was not hurt among Catholics as much as
McCain expected during the primaries, some observers believe Bush
would be helped with a Catholic on the ticket. Ridge also has
proven crossover appeal, attracting many Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Ridge's stance in favor of abortion rights is either a problem
or an opportunity, depending on who is analyzing the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Some Bush supporters believe the best way to attract independent
voters is to pick a running mate who is moderate and backs abortion
rights. That would send a signal that Bush is reaching far beyond
the usual party lines and that he is not taking instructions from
religious conservatives who have urged him to rule out such a
candidate. Notably, Bush declined during the campaign to rule out a
running mate who favors abortion rights, which some analysts
interpreted as a clue that he might pick Ridge or Governor
Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey. But such a choice undoubtedly
would roil many in the party and might play into the hands of a
possible Reform Party candidate, Patrick Buchanan, who opposes
abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Ridge, who received a Bronze Star in Vietnam, has ties to the
Bush family dating to 1979, when he was a volunteer in the
presidential campaign of Bush's father. As a governor, he has
frequently worked with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Hagel, by contrast, has only a casual acquaintance with Bush and
campaigned against him as one of McCain's top supporters. But
Hagel's compelling biography _ a Vietnam hero who overcame a
hardscrabble Nebraska upbringing and became a leading reformer _
has begun to attract considerable attention.
</P>
<P>
   Hagel is also opposed to abortion rights. And the campaign
finance plan he advocates limits but would not ban soft money. On
both counts his positions broadly harmonize with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Mark Sanford, a South Carolina Republican who
hopes McCain will change his mind and accept a vice presidential
nomination, said that Hagel is the ideal alternative. ``Hagel has
that same straight-shooter quality that McCain has, not to mention
the Vietnam experience,'' Sanford said.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, the initial impulse in the Gore camp has
been to look for a governor who presumably would have outsider
appeal. The most obvious candidate is Davis, the California
governor. But Davis said in seemingly unequivocal terms last week
that he wouldn't accept the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   There has also been an informal search among former governors
who are now US senators, including Graham of Florida and Bayh of
Indiana. Graham is being considered partly in hopes that he could
counter the influence of Florida Governor Jeb Bush _ George W.
Bush's brother _ and bring the vital Sunshine State into the
Democratic column. Bayh is attractive as a rising star in the
party, but he is not likely to bring even Indiana, a mostly
Republican state.
</P>
<P>
   Another much-discussed Democratic prospect is Feinstein, who
presumably would help Gore among Californians and women. But
Feinstein is up for reelection in 2000. While California allows
candidates to run for both the Senate and a national office, such a
bid would make the race highly complicated. Some Democrats also
believe that Gore has to assume he will win California and
concentrate on a handful of ``battleground'' states, which has led
to some speculation about Senator Richard Durbin of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John F. Kerry of Massachusetts, like many senators, has
been mentioned, but Gore advisers note that the state is hardly
pivotal and not likely to go into the Bush column. Former Senator
George Mitchell of Maine, an architect of the Irish Good Friday
agreement, was given a boost by Wall Street Journal columnist Al
Hunt last week, but he said Thursday that such thinking is probably
not realistic.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of an obvious Democratic candidate has led to the buzz
about the unconventional choice of Rubin, who has gotten much of
the credit for the prosperity of the past eight years. Among
Rubin's boosters have been some Gore aides and White House adviser
James Carville, whose 1992 mantra for the Clinton-Gore campaign
was, ``It's the economy, stupid.'' The selection of Rubin would
remind voters that the economy has prospered and that the
prosperity could continue with a Gore-Rubin ticket, Carville said
recently. Rubin worked with Gore on many issues and campaigned by
the vice president's side in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   But Rubin, now a member of the Board of Directors at Citigroup,
has never campaigned for elective office, and his Wall Street
background might prove controversial.
</P>
<P>
   All of these names could represent spring flashes that disappear
when the serious work of consideration is done in the early summer.
Indeed, there is a political purpose behind the early floating of
names. Every time a candidate is seriously mentioned, the campaign
gets feedback on the choice _ and sometimes learns disqualifying
information.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the question of whether the selection makes any
difference. Michael S. Dukakis, the 1988 Democratic nominee, said
Friday that one of his best decisions was to pick Senator Lloyd
Bentsen of Texas as his running mate, while one of Bush's worst
decisions was to pick Quayle. In the end, Dukakis lost the
election, and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Dukakis said, the pick could be the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's your first and most important presidential decision _ if
you get to be president,'' Dukakis said.

IN POLITICS, NEW ENGLAND STANDS APART 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL CROWLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was once said that, ``as Maine goes, so goes the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   The saying was coined at the peak of the state's 19th-century
temperance movement, in an era when New England shaped national
opinion on fundamental issues from slavery to child labor to
women's suffrage.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, however, New England is often seen more as a political
curiosity than a national trendsetter. Even that old slogan has
long been a joke _ ever since Republican presidential candidate Alf
Landon carried only Maine and its western neighbor in 1936, causing
him to ruefully quip that, ``As Maine goes, so goes Vermont.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it now seems that the six New England states share far
more in common with each other than with the rest of America. As
the nation's population has shifted South and West, and its
politics have grown increasingly conservative, New England has
remained aloof from it all. Its Democrats make no apologies for
their liberalism, its Republicans are largely indifferent to the
religious right, and its independent voters reliably upset
political predictions.
</P>
<P>
   That insularity has rarely been so clear as it was last week,
when John McCain won four of five Republican primaries in New
England _ three of them by more than 20 points _ on a day when he
was routed from coast to coast by Texas Governor George W. Bush,
and forced out of the presidential race. (As it happened, Maine was
the region's one state to favor Bush, perhaps restoring some
credibility to that old slogan.)
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts argue that Tuesday's vote was a regional echo of
the Feb. 1 New Hampshire primary, which a surging McCain won by a
stunning 19 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``The New Hampshire primary became the New England primary,''
said Deborah ``Arnie'' Arnesen, a New Hampshire talk-radio host,
contributor to the Globe's New Hampshire Weekly section, and a
former Democratic nominee for governor and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, other analysts pointed out, by the time New England's
five other states voted Tuesday it was clear McCain's campaign was
faltering. Yet, New Englanders were undeterred, reaffirming the
political independence for which they are increasingly known.
</P>
<P>
   In an era when moderate ``New Democrats'' occupy the White
House, for instance, New England Democrats are still embodied by
old-fashioned liberals like Massachusetts Senator Edward M. Kennedy
and Vermont Representative Bernard Sanders, who is an Independent
but routinely votes with Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   And as the national GOP is increasingly driven by conservatives
and Southerners, most New England Republicans practice politics
that would make them Democrats in many other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The South won the war in the Republican Party,'' said US
Representative Christopher Shays of Connecticut, a Republican of a
more moderate ilk. ``The Republicans in New England are not with
the majority of the Republican leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   The party's local face is defined by the likes of former
Massachusetts governor William F. Weld, who challenged the national
GOP to liberalize on abortion and gay rights, and Shays, who had
fought doggedly for campaign finance reform to the considerable
displeasure of his party's leaders.
</P>
<P>
   In another defining moment, four of the five Republican senators
to vote against both articles of impeachment against President Bill
Clinton last year hailed from New England: Susan Collins and
Olympia Snowe of Maine, James Jeffords of Vermont, and the late
John Chafee of Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   All of which, observers say, raises the question of why it is
that New Englanders seem so unwilling to fall in line with their
fellow Americans.
</P>
<P>
   To some, there is a basic and somewhat intangible spirit of
independence that has defined the region's outlook since the Boston
Tea Party in 1773.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a kind of irreverent streak. They are different, they
like to be independent,'' said Boston College historian Thomas
O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   Putting a finer point on it, other analysts point to the average
New England voter's high level of education and affluence. Of the
six states, only Maine and Vermont are below the national average
of adults who have earned a bachelor's degree, and the region as a
whole is wealthier than the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``In today's economy, if you've got a lot of education you're
probably doing pretty well economically, and you're probably
somewhat independent . . . (because) you are a high-information
voter and like to make decisions for yourself,'' said Ralph
Whitehead, a University of Massachusetts professor who has studied
national demographics.
</P>
<P>
   But Curtis Gans, director of the Committee for the Study of the
American Electorate, said New England politics is explained less by
education than by religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no fundamentalist tradition in New England. Voters in
New England come from a different stock,'' Gans said. ``A lot of
what has happened in the Republican Party in other regions of the
country is essentially due to religious fundamentalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Gans said that much of the Republican Party's rightward shift in
the South and West has been guided by religious conservatives, many
of them evangelical Protestants, who have grown more politically
influential in recent decades.
</P>
<P>
   And as Republicans elsewhere move right, Gans added, Democrats
have drifted toward the center to compete with them.
</P>
<P>
   While a relative lack of religious fundamentalism in all New
England states, except Maine, may explain why New England
Republicans have held true to their moderate Yankee roots, some
said its rise elsewhere in the country may also be creating an
anti-Republican backlash in this highly Catholic region.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor cited the recent controversy over George W. Bush's
appearance at South Carolina's Bob Jones University, whose
president has denounced Catholics, as an example of why ``Reagan
Democrats'' in New England have not stayed with the party through
the 1990s and into the new century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have the Reagan Democrats _ who I would suggest contain a
great many Irish Democrats _ become disillusioned with the Bush
Republicans?'' O'Connor said. ``Bob Jones may be raising some
questions like, `Do we really belong with these guys?' ''
</P>
<P>
   It's not only Catholics who look askance at the influence of
religious fundamentalists within the GOP, added a University of
Massachusetts pollster, Lou DiNatale.
</P>
<P>
   DiNatale said polling showed that McCain's attack on the
religious conservative leaders, Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell,
quickly boosted his popularity in New England, even as it seemed to
alienate voters elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, some observers say New England's disconnection from
prevailing political trends is cause for alarm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are losing our influence in Washington,'' said Arnesen.
``We need to figure out how to exercise clout, and the states can't
do it alone anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   But others dispute the notion that the region's influence has
been diminished. DiNatale notes that population shifts will not
affect the region's 12 Senate seats, which give disproportionate
clout to an area that accounts for just 6 percent of the US
population.
</P>
<P>
   Also, New England's political leaders continue to find
themselves at the center, and not the margins, of some of
Washington's most important fights.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy remains widely recognized as one of the Senate's most
effective promoters of legislation and a tormentor of Congressional
conservatives. And as they were during the Clinton impeachment
trial, the region's moderate Republicans are often pivotal votes in
a Senate where the GOP holds a small majority.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's Shays argues that, while the region's moderates
may receive few favors from Republican leaders in Congress, they
are the ones more closely aligned with the general public on issues
such as abortion, gun control, and campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans in New England are pretty much in the middle of
the spectrum,'' Shays said. ``To a Republican in Alaska, we're not.
But to an average American we are.''

THE SOUTH HAS RISEN, RISES STILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. _ They were just simple political primaries, a
Democratic race and then a runoff, much like hundreds of
unremarkable contests that have been held in the South in the last
several generations.
</P>
<P>
   But the struggle between Frank Porter Graham, the liberal former
president of the University of North Carolina appointed to fill an
unexpired Senate term, and Willis Smith, a prominent Raleigh lawyer
and a former speaker of the state House, was anything but
unremarkable. The contest, conducted right at the fulcrum of the
last century, in 1950, scarred the region, shaped its character and
unleashed forces that would, in time, remake the South. The runoff
sent shock waves into Texas, Florida, Louisiana and the other
Southern states that hold presidential primaries this week,
contests transformed by the winnowing of the candidate field last
week into a first test in a region the two presumptive party
nominees, both men of the South, will hotly contest next fall.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, all the pressure points, all the tensions, all the
dreams and all the burdens of modern Southern life converged here
in primaries that would reject Graham's impulses toward integration
and modernization, embolden segregationists, enrage black
bystanders _ and, in one of the great unintended consequences of
American history, set the terms for all of Southern politics to
this day.
</P>
<P>
   Embedded in those two primaries, among the most bitter fought
anywhere at any time, were the forces that already were reshaping
the South, creating upheaval in the region most resistant to
change, leading to the forced desegregation of Southern life,
continuing the remarkable migration of blacks to the North,
foreshadowing the rebirth of the South and setting the groundwork
for the flowering of a new industrial and suburban culture for the
region that, Franklin Roosevelt, in 1938, called ``the nation's
number one economic problem.''
</P>
<P>
   For the story of the contemporary South is the movement from its
rejection of integration to its embrace of it _ not only the
integration of the races within the region, but also the
integration of the region into the economy, culture, politics and
life of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The process has been fast, thorough _ and revolutionary. The
National Emergency Council's landmark 1938 report on the economic
conditions of the South found that the region's people ``want and
need houses, radios, butter, beef, vegetables, milk, eggs, dresses,
shirts and shoes,'' adding: ``They want and could use the many
thousands of things, little and big, that men and machines make to
bring health and good living to people.'' Today the rate of job
growth in urban areas of the South outpaces the rate in urban areas
nationwide, the percentage of high school students preparing for
college is higher in the South than in the nation overall and the
biggest gap of all _ between per capita income in the South and in
the country as a whole _ has all but withered away.
</P>
<P>
   ``The theme of the South now is change, after years of no
change,'' says Ned McWherter, a former governor of Tennessee, a
state whose culture now is marked as deeply by Saturn, Nissan and
FedEx as by the Grand Ole Opry. ``We were basically an agricultural
economy. We went to nonskilled needlework and shirt and shoe
factories. Then we went to assembly and service and eventually
technology. Our region has totally changed, and the politics have
changed along with the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Today the South _ with Jim Crow laws and one-party rule things
of the past _ is more like the nation than ever before and, in some
areas, has begun to lead the nation. The 21st century began with a
Southerner in the White House, a Southerner as vice president, a
Southerner as Senate majority leader and two Southerners as
presumptive nominees of both major parties. The city of Selma,
Ala., which resisted integration with a force that stunned the rest
of the nation, has a city council with 15 blacks and four whites
and black police and fire chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took our old rural values _ a closeness to the land,
relationship to family, the appreciation of a tree and a garden _
and even as we moved to metropolitan areas we kept our patches of
green and our own pieces of land,'' says Ferrel Guillory, director
of the Program on Southern Politics, Media and Public Life at the
University of North Carolina. ``We created these big, sprawling
suburban entities that reflect our style of life _ but we're also
paying a price for this sprawl with traffic and environmental
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   As the last century began, the South's problems were of an
entirely different scale and character. Segregation _ the great
stain on American life and the legacy of slavery and Reconstruction
_ set the tone and timbre of every strain of Southern life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Segregation showed the creativity of white people in
continuing the sort of distinctions between the races that
prevailed until the Civil War,'' said John Hope Franklin, the Duke
University historian. ``But you cannot talk about the South without
talking about race. There's no South without talking about the two
races _ and, soon, about three races.''
</P>
<P>
   Segregation's great sin was the division of black and white and
the tyrannies rooted in the false creeds of the past, tyrannies
that permeated the farthest corners of the Southern landscape and
the Southern mind. At the opening of the last century, all the
Southern states were drafting new constitutions that blocked black
citizens from voting and limited the participation of poor whites.
``The fundamentalist religions of the poor of both races focused on
acceptance of their condition and the promise of a better life in
the hereafter,'' Jack Bass and Walter de Vries wrote in ``The
Transformation of Southern Politics.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the main American domestic achievement of the age _
the dispersal of hope, opportunity and new rights throughout the
nation _ was denied to a major region of the country for two-thirds
of a century. As late as 1944, Gunnar Mydral was able to observe
that ``Southerners still think of Negroes as their former slaves,''
explaining that ``in the South, the master-model of economic
discrimination _ slavery _ is still a living force as a memory and
a tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Segregation would end, just as the Democrats' one-party rule
that was itself a legacy of slavery would end, but not before
intervention from the Supreme Court, in its 1954
school-desegregation decision; from federal authorities, who at
gunpoint in Little Rock and Selma, enforced the court's rulings and
congressional voting-rights measures and defied the high priests of
segregation like Governors George C. Wallace of Alabama and Lester
Maddox of Georgia; from black protesters unwilling to tread the
path set out by Jim Crow laws and willing to boycott buses in
Montgomery, Ala., and strike elsewhere across the region; and from
the moral outrage of imaginative civil-rights leaders, from both
inside and outside the South, who produced the highest hour of
civil disobedience during sit-ins and freedom rides and in response
to the murders of Medgar Evers, the civil-rights workers in Nashoba
County, Miss., and the four girls who died in the 1963 bombing of
Sixteenth Street Baptist Church in Birmingham. (The epitaph for one
of them, 11-year-old Denise McNair read, ``She loved all, but a mad
bomber hated her kind.'')
</P>
<P>
   All this helped end the segregation of another sort that the
region itself suffered from _ the effective separation from the
rest of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   With few major cities _ Richmond, Charleston, New Orleans _ the
South at the beginning of the 20th century was dominantly rural,
and not only rural but isolated, with the region's residents,
whether in the mountains or the coastal plains or the bayous,
living far from each other and the rest of the nation. Not until
Huey Long was elected governor of Louisiana in 1928 was the notion
of a bridge across the Mississippi River even seriously
contemplated.
</P>
<P>
   The region, now so robustly industrial and technological, was
agrarian in economics, culture and spirit. Cotton and tobacco and,
to a lesser extent, rice ruled. The only organized industrial
operations were in textiles, tobacco and water power, two of the
three of them dominated by the Duke family of North Carolina. With
few elites (the big planters, a handful of bankers and merchants)
and with most of the population (black as well as white) working as
tenant farmers and low-skill wage earners, the South was a
third-world nation.

   TAKE-BOS  
 RALEIGH, N.C.: ... third-world nation.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   But time and the tides of history changed the region. Though he
feuded with the Southern barons of Capitol Hill, Roosevelt
consciously used the war mobilization to help improve the economy
of the South, planting military bases in the region, building roads
to the bases, providing jobs and the start of a modern economic
foundation that spread beyond farming and textiles.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Southerners who stepped up first to volunteer for
military service also stepped up to go to college and then took the
big step in American life, becoming white-collar workers: insurance
salesmen, middle managers, merchants. Around the wreck of the mill
economy began to grow a family-oriented, urban middle class.
</P>
<P>
   From its earliest origins, before World War II, the rush toward
industrialization troubled many Southerners, especially the
conservatives known as Agrarians _ thinkers and writers who feared
that the price of progress would be too high, would shatter the
character of the South and plunder its fields, farms and foothills,
would alter its ancient rhythms. In one of history's ironies, that
concern, expressed in the pathfinding volume called ``I'll Take My
Stand'' in 1930, would be adopted by liberals in the end of the
century.
</P>
<P>
   One little-remembered Southern visionary was Hugh White, who
took office in 1936 as governor of Mississippi having campaigned to
``Balance Agriculture With Industry.'' With an aggressive approach
and an innovative bond-subsidy program _ imitated by eight other
Southern states by 1962 _ he was the forerunner of generations of
Southern governors who decided to court business. ``No longer did
sons and daughters or their mothers and fathers have to accept the
fact that there were few promising careers for young people in
Mississippi. Young adults might now be able to stay near home, earn
a better salary, and enjoy an improved standard,'' wrote the
historian James C. Cobb in ``Selling the South: The Southern
Crusade of Industrial Development, 1936-1980.''
</P>
<P>
   The South's resistance to organized labor attracted new
industry, but it also brought new tensions to the region and new
resentments from the North, especially in New England, where
Governor Abraham Ribicoff of Connecticut and Senator John F.
Kennedy of Massachusetts decried what the Bay State lawmaker called
Southern ``raiding.'' Kennedy grew angry when the American Bosch
Co., responding to a free factory and tax preferences in
Mississippi, moved its high-volume automotive production operation
for voltage regulators, electric windshield wipers and small motors
from Springfield in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly the Southern landscape was sprouting industrial parks
and suburbs, and because northern industrialists belatedly took
note of what Henry Grady described in the 1880s as the South's
surplus of (cheap) labor, suddenly the Southern conversation was
disrupted by new disputes over union organizing and wages.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the cure for the Southern syndrome came from outside, in
the form of manufacturers' money, which transformed the economy of
the South, and federal law-enforcement authorities, who transformed
the social architecture of the region. But the prospect of the
outside money and the threat of the outside force sometimes
prompted the South to cure itself. That impulse was personified in
Ernest F. Hollings, who sided with segregationists and fought what
he called the ``power-happy federal government'' to win election as
governor of South Carolina in 1958 but who swiftly helped
desegregate Clemson University and was the first governor to
endorse Kennedy, the northern candidate for president, in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Still, primitive infrastructure, corrupt (or virtually
nonexistent) local government and the stigma of segregation, which
lingered long after the South's integration effort surpassed that
of many places in the North, provided a drag on Southern economic
growth. So did poor schools; in 1940, per-pupil expenditures in the
public schools of the South were only half of the national average.
As late as 1968, Southerners were investing only 78 cents in
education for every dollar invested in the rest of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing that changed the South was the elimination of
Jim Crow and the second was the new emphasis on education,'' says
William Winter, who served as governor of Mississippi between 1980
and 1984 and made the state the first in the nation to pass a
comprehensive education-reform program. ``In some ways they are
equally important. The change in race relations in the South
emphasized how much we had neglected education for almost all black
Southerners and many white Southerners.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came a series of other revolutionary developments: the
beginning of the space program, seeding Texas, Alabama and Florida
with the benefits of a highly educated workforce and the trappings
of technology; the development of a tourist industry in the region,
especially Florida, which brought visitors, jobs and tax revenues;
the growth of a new political class, which put on display an
attractive group of southern governors and appealing national
figures such as Senator Howard H. Baker Jr., who won plaudits for
his performance on the Senate Watergate Committee, and Jimmy
Carter, the first president elected from the Deep South.
</P>
<P>
   These new aggressive Southern politicians, at first mostly
Democrats and later often Republicans, broke the hold of rusticated
conservative Democrats on the political culture of the region _
and, owing to the seniority system that gave the South so much
power in Washington, of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   By 1971, George H. Brown, the census director, was able to
report that ``for the first time since the 1870s, the past decade
has shown that more people moved into the South than out of it.''
By 1975, seven of the top eight spots in a national ranking of
business climates were occupied by Southern states, with Texas
ranking first and, most astonishing of all, Alabama ranking second.
In the five years between 1970 and 1975, the number of black
elected officials in the region tripled.
</P>
<P>
   But the growth of black political participation is only half the
story of modern Southern politics. The other is the growth of
two-party politics after the Democrats' domination faded.
</P>
<P>
   Lyndon Johnson worried when he signed the Voting Rights Act that
might have handed the South to the Republican Party, which for a
century had been vilified in the region. Johnson helped transform
the Democratic Party into a biracial coalition, with blacks
eventually becoming perhaps the preeminent voting group in the
party in the South. But he also accelerated the white flight to the
Republican Party that was symbolized by the movement of Strom
Thurmond, who had run for president in 1948 on the Dixiecrat line
and who had switched to the GOP in 1964 to support Barry Goldwater.
</P>
<P>
   With his Southern Strategy, Richard Nixon was the first
Republican presidential nominee to court the region with brio. And
though Nixon is a formidable figure in Southern political history,
the pivotal role may in fact belong to Wallace, who ran an
independent campaign against Nixon and Vice President Hubert H.
Humphrey in 1968. Wallace, in so many ways an agent of change in
Southern politics, provided a bridge to Republican rule, allowing
voters who once considered themselves yellow-dog Democrats a
temporary resting place before they moved fully into the GOP tent.
</P>
<P>
   Now the South is new, or at least different. Its resources of
water, land and forests, which once held the region back, are
valuable assets. Its politics, once inbred and narrow, has become
visionary, and to historians the phrase ``Southern politician'' now
is just as likely to include figures such as Terry Sanford of North
Carolina, Albert Gore Sr. and Estes Kefauver of Tennessee, Lister
Hill of Alabama and the Arkansas triumvirate of Dale Bumpers, David
Pryor and Bill Clinton _ and Republicans like Winthrop Rockefeller
of Arkansas and Linwood Holton of Virginia _ as Orval Faubus of
Arkansas and Ross Barnett of Mississippi. And perhaps the
preeminent Southern moral and political leader of the 20th century
was not an elected official at all, but the Rev. Martin Luther King
Jr.
</P>
<P>
   There remain shadows in the Sun Belt, of course. Governor James
Hunt of North Carolina has created a rural prosperity task force.
Remnants of the old economic structure, especially in poultry and
catfish processing plants, textile mills and low-wage service
industries, persist and vast pockets of poverty remain.
</P>
<P>
   But the South has risen, and is rising still. Blacks, at a rate
of about 100,000 a year the past two decades, are pouring back into
the region, with Atlanta alone gaining 160,000 blacks between 1990
and 1996. Interstate 85, the primary transportation route in the
Southeast, is now regarded as the Autobahn of America, and some of
the charms dangling from its industrial necklace are BMW, Bank of
America, Saab and United Parcel Service. And the region is
remarkably competitive politically, with Republicans and Democrats
now routinely alternating control of major offices in places like
Alabama, South Carolina and Georgia. The South is new again.

<P>
   ``Hi, I'm Monica Lewinsky,'' she says, rising from a sofa to
greet me as I enter her suite in the luxurious Four Seasons Hotel
in Beverly Hills. As if any such introduction were necessary.
</P>
<P>
   She may be newly svelte _ having recently shed some 30 pounds _
but with that helmet of black hair, alabaster skin and
orthodontically perfect smile, she's still instantly recognizable
as the reluctant star of the tawdry Oval Office scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from her tete-a-tete with Barbara Walters last March and
her star turn on Kenneth Starr's witness stand, Lewinsky mostly
kept to herself in the months after the story of her affair with
Bill Clinton broke.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in late December, she announced that she'd struck a deal
to be the new spokeswoman for the weight-loss program Jenny Craig.
Though she won't reveal the financial details of her contract
(rumor has it she's getting paid $10,000 for every pound she
loses), she will be appearing in national TV commercials for the
diet company she credits with finally helping her get in shape.
</P>
<P>
   As part of this new public role, Lewinsky agreed to talk to me
about her lifelong battle with an unhealthy body image.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   In reading ``Monica's Story,'' which author (and Princess Diana
confidante) Andrew Morton wrote for her, on the flight to
California, I was struck by the extensive role Monica Lewinsky's
insecurity about her weight played in her disastrous liaison.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining why she didn't dry clean the infamous blue dress, for
example, she recalled that Linda Tripp told her she looked fat in
it, so she left the dress in her closet. (Under the burden of that
insult, how many women wouldn't have done the same?)
</P>
<P>
   Tripp's comment struck a deep nerve, one that has plagued
Lewinsky throughout her 20-odd years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andrew noted in the book how when I was going through my
pictures with him, I marked everything by my weight: `Here I was 20
pounds heavier,' `Here I was 20 pounds thinner,''' she recalls.
``It was interesting to me that one of the constructs of how I view
my life is my weight. I found it disturbing _ and, of course, he
wouldn't change it, which annoyed me.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for her, it is also how the public came to view
her. Dubbed the ``portly pepperpot'' by the New York tabloids, her
public battle to protect her privacy became an equally public
struggle with the scale. For two years, reporters have gleefully
critiqued her wardrobe and chronicled every morsel that has crossed
her lips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time it's not even true!'' she says, laughing.
``The joke among my friends is, whatever is the most fattening
thing ordered at the table is what I ate, and I probably also had
what everyone else ate, too! I saw Calista Flockhart at a
restaurant once, and I wanted to say to her, `We're the Laurel and
Hardy of the tabloids!'''
</P>
<P>
   So why, I ask, would she invite further attention by signing on
with jenny Craig?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I've found something that's helped me and might be
able to help others,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Cynics may point to the financial rewards of the deal (which
indeed will go a long way toward paying her legal bills), but
Lewinsky also has a genuine desire to connect with other women
who've struggled with their weight. On her book-signing tour, she
says, countless women came up to her saying that they identified
with her pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``For other people to feel comfortable sharing with me was very
touching, because it's still difficult for me to be open about
that.''
 &UR; HOW SHE'S HEALING &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's abundantly clear that she's been in therapy _ ``It's no
secret that I'm working on myself,'' she says. She talks repeatedly
of trying to find ``balance'' and defuse the ``compulsive control''
that food has held over her.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I've started to see is that weight for me has been a
control issue, whatever my weight has been,'' she says. ``I have
very black-and-white feelings about food _ that something's good or
something's bad, or if I eat this I'm a bad person, if I eat that
I'm a good person. I'm trying to have a more forgiving attitude and
not be as militant with myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have issues that I'm working on and I'm not there yet,
but I'm aware of a lot more.'' Those issues, she says, are ones
she's been wrestling with since as early as second grade. ``There
are things I deal with in therapy now that have nothing to do with
anything that's happening to me now or in the past few years,'' she
says, ``but are all a result of things that happened in high school
or grade school. You think, that was 10 or 15 years ago, that's
ridiculous. But those are the formative years, when you're so open
to impression.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in image-conscious L.A., she says, also had a
tremendous impact on her, as did her parents' eating habits.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom has always been conscious of her weight,'' she says,
``and I watched her being controlled by that in different ways on
different diets. But even if you don't see it with your own mom,
you see it at your girlfriend's house with her parents. You just
can't escape it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her parents' separation _ and subsequent divorce, when she was
15 _ sparked an emotional trigger for her overeating, setting a
pattern of yo-yo dieting that would last into adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my problems in the past was that I would either not get
to my goal because it was unrealistic, or I'd get there and,
because I'd struggled so hard, I'd stay there for five minutes,''
she says. ``I've probably gained and lost 20 people in my life!''
Now, she says, ``It's about keeping it off.''
</P>
<P>
   But her biggest hurdle, she says, is dismantling her
``all-or-nothing'' attitude. ``I think being able to go out and
know that it's OK to have a little bit of this or a little bit of
that stops me from saying `I blew it' and having 12 drinks or a
whole cake,'' she says. ``I'm working on managing depression, too,
so I need to be able to go out with my friends. If that means that
I have a drink, then I work that into my food budget.''
 &UR; THROUGH THICK AND THIN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Does she think the press would have treated her differently if
she had been thin?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would have changed some of it,'' she says, with a
touch of regret. ``There were a lot of cruel things that people
said to me, and my weight handed them one more thing to be cruel to
me about. Especially in the beginning, when there was a lot of
uncertainty about what the relationship really was, my weight
played a negative role, because people would look at me and say,
`She's heavy _ why would anybody be interested in her?''
</P>
<P>
   She admits her search for love has been a bit, well, misguided.
(``That hasn't been undocumented!'' she laughs.) ``I fell prey to
someone I shouldn't have gotten involved with,'' she says quietly.
``But one of the positive things that came out of that was that
because I was with somebody who thought I was beautiful and sexy no
matter what size I was, I was able to discover that sexuality comes
from within. Even when I don't like to look at myself in the
mirror, my body has always felt good to me. But there's a catch-22
for me, because the person with whom I discovered my own sexuality
and sensuality was a bad emotional influence on me, and yet he gave
me this wonderful gift.''
</P>
<P>
   As she dabs at her tears, I can feel the pain of her heartbreak.
We've all made mistakes, I tell her; we've all done foolish things
in the name of love. ``Unfortunately,'' I joke, ``my friends have
long memories.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just make sure none of them have tape recorders!'' she fires
back.
</P>
<P>
   I'm stunned at her ability to defuse the emotional moment with a
joke, especially one at her own expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seriously,'' she continues, ``I'm blessed to have some of the
most amazing friends in the world. I don't really consider Linda
(Tripp) a friend; I don't think she ever was.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if not for Tripp and her tape recorder, we might never
have known the name Monica Lewinsky. Whatever Lewinsky's admitted
lapses of judgment, she never intended to gain fame from her
entanglement with the president _ certainly not this kind of fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes people forget I made the mistake of confiding in
someone privately,'' she says, ``but I went to pretty great lengths
legally to not have those conversations come out.''
</P>
<P>
   Her desire to reveal the truth was the reason she agreed to be
interviewed by Barbara Walters. But what she had to say was instead
dwarfed by what she was wearing _ namely, the lipstick whose sales
immediately skyrocketed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I designed it or owned it, that'd be great.'' She pauses,
then adds, ``Who knows, maybe I'll do my own lipstick someday!''
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, she's brought her business sense to the fashion
world, having launched last summer a line of handbags under the
name The Real Monica Inc., with sellout success. But, she says, ``I
really just want to find the right person and get married and have
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Eligible bachelors will now find this 26-year-old living in New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the seasons and the diversity and that you just sort of
blend in,'' she explains. More than anything, it seems, she
desperately wishes that she might regain some semblance of a
normal, quiet life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made some kooky decisions and had some kooky things happen
to me, but I'm a real person,'' she says. ``What's special about me
is that people know my name, but other than that, I'm just like
everybody else. You don't have to like me _ sometimes I don't like
me _ but at least judge me on the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   So how does she think the history books will treat her?
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think I will probably be just a footnote. My name may
not even be mentioned,'' she says, perhaps more optimistic than
realistic. ``What I'm hoping is that people come to judge me not
for how the story began, but for how it ends.'' &QL;

WHAT'S THE FiRST AMENDMENT FOR? TO BOTHER PEOPLE 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PHIL RECORD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I fear that too often we take for granted the words of those
precious documents that guarantee our freedom: the Declaration of
Independence, the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
</P>
<P>
   You don't believe me? Let me tell you a sad tale.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, a reporter in Madison, Wis., asked 112 people
to sign a petition that consisted exclusively of sections from the
Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights.
</P>
<P>
   Only one person was willing to sign the petition.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty of those invited to sign asked the reporter if he was a
Communist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get the hell out of here with that Communist stuff,'' said
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see you are using the old Commie trick, putting God's name
on a radical petition,'' said another.
</P>
<P>
   About the same time, an attorney in Austin, Texas, introduced a
resolution at a precinct meeting that read:
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of
religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging
the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people
peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress
of grievance.''
</P>
<P>
   The resolution was quickly tabled as being too controversial.
</P>
<P>
   Would you have voted to table? I hope not, for those words make
up the First Amendment to the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, although I'm disappointed about such occurrences, I am
not all that surprised.
</P>
<P>
   For many years I have given talks on the press clause of the
First Amendment. Often these speeches were directed at gatherings
of journalists because many of them, I'm sad to say, did not have a
clear understanding of that clause.
</P>
<P>
   I think it appropriate to talk about these matters because next
Saturday, First Amendment devotees pause to mark the anniversary of
the birth of James Madison, the principal author of that amendment
and the rest of the Bill of Rights.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, some folks tried to make a First Amendment
case out of the punishment handed out by baseball commissioner Bert
Selig to Atlanta Braves relief pitcher John Rocker. (Selig fined
Rocker $20,000 and suspended him for spring practice and the first
30 days of the season.) The outspoken Rocker had stirred up a
ruckus because of some hateful and demeaning remarks he had made
during an interview for a magazine article.
</P>
<P>
   Some folks began to howl that Selig had violated Rocker's First
Amendment rights by trying to silence him.
</P>
<P>
   Bull.
</P>
<P>
   Selig was simply exercising his authority as baseball's head
man. (Later, an arbitrator drastically reduced the punishment to a
fine of $500 and a 14-day suspension.)
</P>
<P>
   Now, if an agent of the government had tried to silence Rocker,
that would have been a violation of the pitcher's First Amendment
rights.
</P>
<P>
   The press clause of the First Amendment is simple. It says that
the government cannot tell the owners of a newspaper or a broadcast
station what they can or cannot print or broadcast. (The Supreme
Court has established some exceptions, mainly in the area of
national defense, but such exceptions are few.)
</P>
<P>
   The press clause imposes no responsibilities on the news media.
Most of the standards and principles that the mainstream press
abide by today have been self-imposed. In approving the First
Amendment, Madison and the other Founding Fathers did not do so
with the expectation that the press would be fair, balanced or
objective.
</P>
<P>
   Their purpose was to make sure that the citizens of a new nation
would have a variety of viewpoints available to them without
government interference. The Founders knew that this was one of the
basic ingredients of freedom.
</P>
<P>
   They also knew they were providing protection for irresponsible
and objectionable publications.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some degree of abuse is inseparable from the proper use of
everything,'' Madison wrote. ``And in no instance is this more true
than that of the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has accordingly been decided by the practice of the States,
that it is better to leave a few of its noxious branches to their
luxuriant growth, than by pruning them away to injure the vigor of
those yielding the proper fruit.''
</P>
<P>
   Today we are surrounded by such ``noxious branches.'' You find
them in the form of the sensational tabloids stacked near the
checkout counters in supermarkets; you find them in the form of
sleazy publications on magazine racks; you find them on late-night
cable TV.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Madison and his colleagues probably would be stunned at the
proliferation of the ``noxious branches.'' But he undoubtedly would
not deny them the protection of the First Amendment. For the
Founders realized that once the wall of protection is breached,
freedoms can be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   As Sir Thomas More _ or St. Thomas More, if you prefer _ once
said, ``I would give the devil the full protection under the law,
because the day it is denied to him, the next day it may be denied
to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Such is the price of liberty. It is a high price to pay, but pay
we must.
</P>
<P>
   We are frequently bothered by some of those ``noxious branches''
afforded the protection of the First Amendment. That, too, is the
price of liberty.
</P>
<P>
   When U.S. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy once heard an
attorney argue that people were bothered by members of a religious
cult handing out literature in an airport, he replied:
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what the First Amendment is for, to bother people.''

 &UR; World rights &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
<P>
   Homespun favorites such as pancakes, griddle cakes, hot cakes or
flapjacks are not so humble when they're smothered in maple syrup,
but until the mid-19th century, the earthenware or tin pitchers in
which this ambrosia was dispensed hardly did it justice.
</P>
<P>
   The Victorians, with their penchant for ornamentation and their
strict code of dining room etiquette, were the first to think about
this problem. They came up with silver-plate and pressed-glass
pitchers for formal breakfast tables and ironstone for more casual
repasts.
</P>
<P>
   Now, collectors benefit. Maple-syrup pitchers provide happy
hunting for aficionados.
</P>
<P>
   Ornamented, silver-plate pitchers, which first appeared on
Victorian tables during the late 1800s, were marvelous to behold.
Manufacturers such as Meriden Silver Plate Co. and Rogers, Smith
and Co. created syrup dispensers with embossed botanical designs,
matching plates or underliners and ornate lids.
</P>
<P>
   White ironstone, produced by firms such as Meakin Brothers &AMP; Co.
and Wooliscroft, was available with both unadorned and embossed
designs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ironstone syrup pitchers with embossed flower and fruit motifs
were quite common during the 19th century,'' said William Durham,
of Home Place Antiques, in Belvidere, Ill. Today, however, these
decorative examples have become scarce.
</P>
<P>
   ``A syrup pitcher, or simply 'syrups' as some collectors call
them, with a basketweave design would truly be a rare find,''
Durham pointed out, adding that while embossed syrups were usually
fitted with pewter lids with thumb catches, it is not unusual for
plain ironstone examples to have slide-on lids made from tin.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1800s, the advent of pressed glass, milk glass,
etched glass and art glass manufactured by companies both in the
United States and abroad resulted in some striking and highly
collectible syrup pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beautiful syrup pitchers help me envision the breakfast tables
of the past,'' said collector Kathleen Krause of Wisconsin. While
she owns numerous antique milk-glass and ironstone pieces, she is
especially drawn to crystal or clear-glass examples because they
often feature a patent date.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, a changing economy caused Victorian formality to be
abandoned, creating a need for everyday dishware. By the beginning
of the 20th century, syrups were being made from enamelware.
</P>
<P>
   American manufacturers churned out upright syrups with metal
lids in mottled or marbled patterns, while European firms often
decorated their syrups with floral, checked or striped designs.
</P>
<P>
   ``An incredible variety of colors and patterns were produced
early in the 1900s,'' said David Pikul, of the Chuctanunda Antique
Co. in Amsterdam, NY.
</P>
<P>
   From the 1930s through the 1950s, companies such as Hocking and
the Hazel Atlas Co. produced inexpensive colored-glass syrups.
</P>
<P>
   While so-called Depression-glass pieces sporting the familiar
colors of the era often came fitted with glass lids or hinged metal
lids with thumb mechanisms, clear-glass examples from the same
period sometimes featured Bakelite lids or tin lids with Bakelite
handles. Depression-glass syrups could also be accompanied by
matching saucers or underliners.
</P>
<P>
   Inexpensive plain crystal or clear-glass syrups have been
produced continuously since the 1930s. In the 1950s, chrome and
plastic began to replace the tin and Bakelite that had been used
earlier to make lids and handles.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the current market for these plastic-detailed
examples, Carol Levison, of Once Upon a Table, a vintage-tableware
business based in Pittsfield, Mass., pointed out, ``Yellow or
yellow-trimmed items are eagerly sought by collectors. Red, a
common color for early plastic housewares, runs a close second.''
</P>
<P>
   Stores specializing in vintage kitchenware make the best hunting
grounds for syrups. Victorian ironstone, pressed-glass and
silver-plate pieces tend to be valued according to rarity, size and
condition.
</P>
<P>
   Depression-glass syrups are easier to find than 19th-century
examples, owing to the sheer quantity produced. Examples with
colorful plastic lids and handles from the 1950s and '60s are also
abundant at flea markets and yard sales.
</P>
<P>
   Coming across a fine maple-syrup pitcher can bring joy to the
collector twice over. Not only will it look good on the shelf _ it
can still be used.
</P>
<P>
   SIDEBAR
</P>
<P>
   PITCHER PRICES
</P>
<P>
   According to William Durham, of Home Place Antiques, embossed
ironstone syrup pitchers can usually be found in the $200 to $300
range, while a plain example sells for around $75. Collectors drawn
to Victorian glass and silver-plate syrups will find that prices
start at around $100.
</P>
<P>
   David Pikul of the Chuctanunda Antique Co. said that simple,
white enamelware pieces made in the United States fetch $40 to $60;
highly decorated syrups or ones with rare patterns can bring $350
or more.
</P>
<P>
   Common Depression-glass syrups sell in the $40 to $80 range,
while rare colors and patterns can cost more than $200. Clear-glass
syrups with chrome or colorful plastic lids can still be found for
$8 to $15.

BARING MY SOLES: AN EXPERIMENT WITH REFLOXOLOGY

<P>
   I have funny feet.
</P>
<P>
   They've amused my friends and family for many years. Even at
elegant dinner parties, I've been asked to take off my shoes for a
laugh. The laughter is always uproarious.
</P>
<P>
   What's funny are my ridiculously long second toes, ``a sign of
brilliance and creativity,'' I've been told. But that's no
consolation for the fact that I can't wear sandals without being
teased.
</P>
<P>
   So the idea of placing my feet in the hands of a total stranger
for an hour of reflexology was truly disquieting. But when a
lingering bout of the flu left me tired and aching a month after
the sniffles had passed, I was ready to try anything. A good friend
(and reflexology enthusiast) had sent me a gift certificate to
Angel Feet in New York City; she was sure that a session of
reflexology _ which holds that stimulating specific points on the
foot encourages corresponding areas in the body to heal _ would
return me to my perky old self. ``It's all the stress you're
under,'' she said. ``Your immune system can't function; reflexology
will wind you down completely so that your body can go into repair
mode.''
</P>
<P>
   The promise of deep relaxation, improved circulation and major
stress relief overpowered my self-consciousness. If the
reflexologist were a real professional, there should be no
snickering, right?
</P>
<P>
   Relaxing Step by Step
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most body treatments, reflexology doesn't require that
you disrobe. You take off your coat, shoes and socks and perhaps
roll up your pants to mid-calf. At Angel Feet, I sank into a cushy
chair as the reflexologist, Jessie Meegan, soaked my feet in warm
water, wrapped them in a heated towel and placed them on an
ottoman. Candles lit the cozy space and I listened to a tape
playing the soothing sounds of nature.
</P>
<P>
   During the first five minutes or so, the reflexologist will use
relaxation techniques to put you and your vulnerable feet at ease.
Meegan softly pressed the bottoms and then the tops of my feet; I
was floating. She cradled my heels in her palms and, supporting my
ankles, stretched my legs gently toward her. She rocked my feet
from side to side, then firmly rubbed my ankles and up and down my
calves. Next, she grasped my feet and pressed the center of the
ball of each _ the point said to correspond to the solar plexus _
with her thumbs, gently releasing the diaphragm, breathing's
command central. Then she sprayed my feet with peppermint and
rosemary essential oils.
</P>
<P>
   ``The solar plexus [located around the lower part of the
diaphragm] is referred to as the 'nerve switchboard' of the body,''
says Inge Dougans, author of ``Reflexology: A Practical
Introduction.'' ``It is the main storage area for stress. Applying
pressure to this reflex point will always bring about a feeling of
relaxation.'' Meegan applied steady pressure, and after a moment,
my whole body seemed to let out a satisfied sigh of relief
</P>
<P>
   Cradling one foot with both hands, Meegan used her thumb to
``walk'' over the entire sole. After repeating that several times,
she used her thumb to circle clockwise to the heel, then worked
back up to the toes. Like a magician wowing an audience with trick
after amazing trick, a skilled reflexologist segues smoothly from
one move to the next, twisting, stretching, rotating, wringing,
slapping and stroking the feet with feathery fingertips until
there's no resistance.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the session, Meegan asked me which areas of my
body might need attention, and during the warm-up, plotted a course
of pressure points on which to focus. During the treatment, she
watched my reactions and my breathing, pressing on the solar plexus
reflex point as I breathed out to achieve maximum tension release.
</P>
<P>
   A reflexologist can also tell if it hurts; if you wince, the
pressure may be too intense. (It's important to understand,
however, that a sore spot can be just that _ it doesn't necessarily
mean that there's tension in the corresponding area of the body.)
Meegan told me that I grimaced only once. I left Angel Feet walking
on air.
</P>
<P>
   Healing from the ground up
</P>
<P>
   Most practitioners don't make miraculous claims for reflexology,
but they do believe in its power to help in the healing process.
Kevin Kunz, a reflexologist for 25 years in New Mexico, posts a
bibliography of research studies on his Web site, the Reflexology
Research Project (www.reflexology-research.com). ``Not many MDs
understand reflexology and what it can do, but studies from China
and Denmark have demonstrated its beneficial effects,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Books such as Laura Norman and Thomas Cowan's ``Feet First: A
Guide to Foot Reflexology'' and Dwight Byers' ``Better Health with
Foot Reflexology'' allude to its ability to help in weight loss,
solve infertility problems and enhance athletic performance. Byers,
head of the International Institute of Reflexology in St.
Petersburg, Fla., tells how he found relief from asthma and hay
fever when his aunt, Eunice Ingham, practiced her theories on his
feet.
</P>
<P>
   Ingham, who died in 1974, has been called ``the mother of modern
reflexology'' because of her work in charting the feet in relation
to the zones of the body. ``But there's no instant or permanent
cure for a condition like asthma. Reflexology can't 'cure' it; it
can only alleviate the condition by building up the immune system
or helping a sufferer relax during an attack,'' says Byers.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the healing arts today, reflexology addresses more
than bodily aches and pains. ``When I work with people, it's on all
levels _ physical, mental, emotional and spiritual,'' says Laura
Norman.
</P>
<P>
   Norman starts each session in her tranquil studio in New York
City by asking people to think about a specific, concrete goal.
Affirmations put a positive spin on the healing experience. For
example, Norman suggests that you might say, ``I breathe deeply and
fully from the diaphragm'' as a positive affirmation if you have
had asthma in the past. A simple ``I want to stay healthy this
year'' set the appropriate positive tone for me when I visited her
for a session.
</P>
<P>
   As I relaxed on a soft massage table, I looked up at a ceiling
painted with blue sky, fluffy clouds and cherubic feet. Norman
started the session by rubbing citrus-scented essential oils on my
feet and then moved on to reflex points that related to areas that
we agreed needed work.
</P>
<P>
   Again, I felt immense relief and a deep sense of relaxation when
she put pressure on the solar plexus reflex point. Surprisingly, I
also experienced a feeling that I can only describe as pure joy.
``When you go into a deep state of relaxation, you're more
receptive to change,'' says Norman.
</P>
<P>
   I did feel relaxed, more balanced and energized after my
reflexology sessions, and the lingering flu symptoms were
completely gone three days after my second visit. As an unexpected
bonus, I also feel better about my freakish feet. The big toe, I
learned, corresponds with the brain. Now my feet feel absolutely
brilliant.
</P>
<P>
   SIDEBAR
</P>
<P>
   READING YOUR FEET
</P>
<P>
   Reflexology is based on the principle that feet are miniature
maps of the human form, with areas that correspond to every organ,
gland and body part. Reflexologist Laura Norman, who has written
two books on the discipline and trains others in it at her center
in New York City, identifies 10 energy zones, or meridians _ five
on each foot _ that run the length of the body from head to toe.
</P>
<P>
   Reflexologists claim that stimulating particular points on the
feet cause tension and stress in the corresponding areas of the
body to be released. ``There are over 7,200 nerve endings in each
foot that reach every part of your body,'' says reflexologist
Barbara Morrison. ``By stimulating these reflex points, you relax
tension and release toxins, improve blood circulation and balance
the whole body. And when your body is relaxed, it can heal
itself.''

ON THE MAPLE TRAIL, `MUD SEASON' PROVIDES SWEET MEMORIES

   Sugaring season is one of the finest, though most underrated,
times to visit New England. Lodging prices are discounted, and the
crowds that flock to the region during summer and fall have
thinned, making it easy to witness the first shades of spring in
peace and quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Although the weather can be unpredictable _ the six-week cycle
of alternating thaws and freezes is affectionately referred to in
these parts as ``mud season'' _ it can also prove spectacular. The
air is crisp, the snow that dusts the fields begins to melt and the
skeletal maples, elms and birches sprout tentative buds. On the
region's back roads, anonymous outbuildings become bustling,
maple-producing sugar shacks. And, if you breathe deeply you can
detect the familiar scents of wood smoke and maple in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Determining the exact day or week when the maple syrup season
will commence can be difficult, so travelers with hopes of taking
to the woods to participate in the centuries-old ritual of sugaring
should be fairly flexible and keep a constant eye out for the
telltale weather patterns (freezing temperatures at night and
relatively balmy 40 degree-days) that get the sap moving and kick
off the season.
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred by the threat of slush or mud, my family made a
three-day visit to Vermont (ground zero for maple syrup) last March
to participate in sap collection and learn more about sugaring.
Bearing in mind that we might spend a lot of our time plodding
through snow and/or mud, we each packed several jackets of varying
weight and brought along sturdy insulated boots, which, as things
turned out, we took off only to sleep.

   The Trapp Family Lodge, a 93-room hotel that has been operated
since 1950 by the Austrian family immortalized in Rodgers and
Hammerstein's ``The Sound of Music,'' served as our base camp.
Perched on a hillside in the ski town of Stowe, the 2,700-acre
resort has a traditional sugarhouse where a wood-fired evaporator
transforms hand-gathered sap into classic Vermont maple syrup.
</P>
<P>
   The wood-fired evaporator _ a machine that reduces the water in
maple sap and concentrates its sugars _ allows visitors to
experience what sugaring would have been like in the early 1900s.
</P>
<P>
   Although sap buckets hanging from maples are still a common
sight along country byways, many sugarers now transport the sap
from their trees to the sugarhouse via plastic tubing, a
time-saving invention that relies on gravity and vacuum pressure
instead of manpower. Using fuel oil instead of firewood is another
way sugarers save time and money _ and also forgo chopping the
cords of wood used to stoke the evaporator as it turns the sap to
thick, rich syrup.
</P>
<P>
   It's still possible to find independent farmers as well as inns
and hotels that continue to collect sap by hand, a time-honored
collection method that is slow in cadence and rich in history. For
kids and adults alike, these farms demonstrate how to gather sap
and make syrup, a skill most children might otherwise learn about
only in one of Laura Ingalls Wilder's memoirs. And while most
people mention Vermont or New England when they think of maple
syrup, the midwestern states Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin are among
America's top maple syrup producers.
</P>
<P>
   At the Trapp Family Lodge, sugarer Jonathan Pryor oversees a
crew of five as well as Jill and Massie, mares that pull a sleigh
specially designed for retrieving sap deep from the sugar bush
(which in Maple Country is any large stand of sugar maples).
Besides being more charming than a four-wheel-drive truck, the
workhorses leave less of a footprint on the forest floor and can
navigate between the trees with more ease than your average sport
utility vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   During sugar season, guests at the lodge (and anyone else who
might be in the area) are invited to take a horse-drawn sleigh ride
to the sugarhouse, where they can help collect sap from the 900 or
so trees that have been tapped. The maples on the property have
been tapped on and off for about 50 years. When done carefully, the
taps have little or no adverse effect on the trees.
</P>
<P>
   After collecting bucket upon bucket of the colorless sap from
the bush, we returned to the sugarhouse to start the evaporation
process. In keeping with its mission to re-create an authentic
19th-century mapling experience, the Trapp Family Lodge's
sugarhouse is not electrified, and the evaporator there is fueled
solely by firewood.
</P>
<P>
   A platform allows kids and adults to view the sap-boiling
process (maple syrup results just before the ``jelly' stage) and
observe Pryor as he tests batches of the sweet syrup for color,
density and flavor.
</P>
<P>
   If you need to refuel after a day in the field and it happens to
be Saturday, stop by the Trapp Family Lodge's sugarhouse for a
Sugar on Snow party. A throwback to the time when neighbors got
together at the end of the sugaring season to celebrate the
harvest, these parties traditionally feature sugar on snow (a
taffy-like maple candy made by pouring hot syrup over clean, fresh
snow), dill pickles and old-fashioned cake doughnuts. It may sound
odd, but the sour pickles and yeasty doughnuts complement the
intense sweetness of the maple taffy. And children can't seem to
get enough of the chewy candy.
</P>
<P>
   Only after a day spent in the sugar bush will you fully
understand the pride folks from states like Vermont, New York,
Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Connecticut take in their
maple syrup. Although sugar makers in Vermont are largely
self-regulated, they all subscribe to a grading system established
by the Vermont Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Vermont Fancy is light amber in color and delicate in flavor.
Grade A syrup comes in Medium and Dark Amber, with the darker
varieties being more robust and full-bodied. Usually harvested late
in the season, Vermont Grade B syrup is generally sold for
commercial use to bakers and candy makers and is the darkest, most
``mapley'' of all the syrups.
</P>
<P>
   As you might imagine, lugging and emptying several dozen metal
pails heavy with fresh sap helps put the premium price maple syrup
garners into perspective. Roughly 40 gallons of sap are required to
produce a single gallon of the aromatic, caramel-colored liquid,
which explains why a gallon jug of Grade A syrup typically costs 25
times more than a gallon of unleaded gas. After a weekend spent
sugaring, I now know it's worth every penny.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   MAPLE MADNESS
</P>
<P>
   Many inns and hotels have begun to recruit travelers during the
sugar season by offering them the chance to traipse through the
woods, collect sap and participate in making maple syrup. To find
out about vacation options in the top maple-producing states, call
the (1) Vermont Department of Agriculture, (802) 828-2416; (2) New
York Division of Tourism, (800) CALL-NYS; (3) Maine Office of
Tourism, (800) 533-9595. To contact the Trapp Family Lodge about
sugar-season rates, call (802) 253-8511 or (800) 826-7000.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's a pancake breakfast or a citywide maple festival,
nearly every town in New England (and parts of the South and
Midwest, too) sponsors a maple-related event during the winter
thaw. One to consider:
</P>
<P>
   The 33rd annual Vermont Maple Festival will take place April 28
to 30 in Saint Albans. Pancake breakfasts and maple demonstrations
are scheduled, as are an antiques show, a maple cooking contest, a
parade, and a variety show; (802) 524-2444.

   LIVING WITH A PEANUT ALLERGY
</P>
<P>
   Q. My 11-month-old broke out in hives after eating peanut butter
on bread. The doctor says we have to conclude he has a peanut
allergy and avoid anything with peanuts for the rest of his life.
Do you have any more advice?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes. Before you come to that conclusion, have your son
formally tested for a peanut allergy, says Dr. Scott Sicherer,
assistant professor of pediatrics at Mt. Sinai School of Medicine
in New York City and a researcher at Mt. Sinai's Jaffe Food Allergy
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Breaking out in hives is consistent with a peanut reaction,
but it's important to confirm that particular allergy through a
skin or blood test. That way, you rule out the possibility that the
hives were a reaction to another food or substance,'' he says. A
peanut allergy is worth confirming because it can be lifelong and
extremely inconvenient.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peanuts can be hidden in sauces, or peanut oil can be used for
fried foods. There are a number of unexpected sources,'' Sicherer
adds. And some foods that don't expressly contain peanuts, such as
Asian food or many cookies and candies may still have trace amounts
if they were made with the same equipment used for
peanut-containing foods. As a result, accidentally consuming
peanuts is not uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   If your child is allergic to peanuts, you may need to carry an
epinephrine injection to halt an allergic response. A mild reaction
can sometimes escalate and cause swelling of the throat or a
dangerous drop in blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   LEARNING GAMES
</P>
<P>
   Q. Now that my child can sit up, I try to play more games with
him. What are the best ones to enhance the cognitive skills of a
6-month-old?
</P>
<P>
   A. There are three games that are especially good for a baby
this age, says Alice Sterling Honig, professor emeritus of child
development at Syracuse University in Syracuse, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The first activity, called ``aah-boom,'' goes like this: While
sitting face-to-face with your baby, lean forward (saying ``aah'')
and touch your forehead gently against his, with a joyful ``boom.''
This simple exercise will key into your son's ability to anticipate
the next event in a pattern, and he'll begin to lean forward to
meet you halfway.
</P>
<P>
   The second game, called ``turn-taking talk,'' encourages your
child's developing language ability. Again, sit face-to-face with
your baby and vocalize back and forth, mimicking the sounds he
makes. When you repeat your child's side of the conversation, he
feels listened to, plus he learns both the structure and emotional
power of conversational language.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, you can play up your baby's interest in exploring his
world with the game ``What's my sound?'' Find a short picture book
of animals or create one by pasting photos onto separate pieces of
cardboard. Start with familiar animals your child has seen in the
yard or at a nearby farm. As you hold up each picture, teach your
child the sound the animal makes. Dogs, cats, birds and cows are
usually winners with babies.
</P>
<P>
   NIX THE NIGHT-LIGHT?
</P>
<P>
   Q. I heard of a study that says using a night-light is bad for a
baby's eyes. How am I supposed to change a diaper during the night?
Is a hall light OK?
</P>
<P>
   A. The research to which you're referring did find that sleeping
with a light on can hamper a child's eye development. Experts at
Children's Hospital of Philadelphia found that 35 percent of kids
who slept with a night-light on during the first two years of life,
and 55 percent of kids who slept with a lamp lit during this
period, were nearsighted in later childhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``The eyes seem to need a period of total darkness to grow
properly. Without it, the cornea may become less curved, the lens
may change shape and eye length may be affected _ factors that
determine near- or farsightedness,'' says Dr. Graham Quinn, a
pediatric ophthalmologist and one of the study's authors.
</P>
<P>
   While total darkness seems to be the optimal sleeping
environment, it's fine to turn on a light whenever it's needed.
``Don't risk bumping into furniture or dropping a child just to
keep the room dark'' says Quinn. And of course, ``a medically
fragile child who needs continuous monitoring should have his room
lit, if necessary. His current medical needs take precedence.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, try to avoid a hall light during the first two years of
life; enough light from it would enter the room to have the same
negative effect on the eyes. But for older kids who have fears of
the dark, a hall light is OK. ``There's no evidence that a hall
light is problematic after the first two years,'' says Quinn.
</P>
<P>
   GETTING KIDS TO SHARE
</P>
<P>
   Q. When, and how, should I teach my child the importance of
sharing?
</P>
<P>
   A. Don't even try until she's about 2 years old, says Burton
White, a child development specialist in Newton, Mass. ``Urging
18-month-olds to share is like trying to turn away the tide with a
spoon. It's incompatible with their nature at that point,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   To learn to share, a child first must be able to process the
idea of sharing and be capable of some rationality. While these
abilities start to emerge around age 2, your child has a better
chance of success if you wait until 25 or 26 months of age. A child
with a closely spaced sibling will be slower to share at first,
since the daily vying for toys will likely make her more
territorial, says White. Ditto for kids in group-care situations.
</P>
<P>
   When organizing a play date, set it up so kids have a better
chance of learning to play together and ultimately to share, says
White. Meet on neutral territory, such as a playground; kids have a
harder time sharing on their own turf. Once there, divide some of
the toys before setting the kids down.
</P>
<P>
   Respect that a child's favorite toy is ``sacred'' and not to be
shared unless the owner offers it. When a child grabs a toy from
another, explain that when her pal is finished playing, she'll get
a turn. Turn-taking is best because it respects the idea that a
child isn't expected to interrupt her play the instant another
child horns in.

&HT;     MAYORS OF BORDER CITIES URGE COOPERATION TO EASE GROWING
PAINS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JEANNE RUSSELL  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Explosive growth along the U.S.-Mexico border
demands a radical approach to fixing health and environmental
problems, and ignoring the international boundary might be the
first step, representatives from border cities said.
</P>
<P>
   One approach, they suggested, would be to view sister cities
like Matamoros, Mexico, and Brownsville, Texas, both among the most
rapidly growing in their respective countries, as a single
mushrooming metropolis.
</P>
<P>
   Free trade has meant fast-paced expansion along the border, and
cities on the Mexican side often balloon even more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``A factory that offers 2,000 jobs and pays taxes can translate
into an immediate need for that many homes,'' Ignacio Mendoza
Hernandez, the director of health from Matamoros, said Sunday
during the first day of the International Consortium for the
Environment's ``Border Health: Making a Difference'' conference in
San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   The frantic pace of economic activity prevents the government
from providing electricity, water and sewerage to the shantytowns,
known as colonias, that spring up around the factories, Mendoza
said. Local governments must also deal with problems such as tire
dumping, substandard housing and contagious diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The conference continues through Wednesday, with sessions on air
and water quality, funding opportunities, industrial growth,
emerging diseases and public health.
</P>
<P>
   Many participants attending the opening session agreed with
Ronald Kendall, the director of Texas Tech University's Institute
of Environmental and Human Health and the symposium's co-chairman,
who said the conference will succeed even if it only encourages new
relationships and partnerships between the participating government
and academic agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza called health problems a ``co-responsibility,'' saying
border cities can't deny the benefit of new jobs and taxes, nor
were environmental problems as serious as often painted.
</P>
<P>
   He was among many who described a region where poverty, low
academic achievement and contagious diseases coexist with economic
opportunity, biculturalism and a long life expectancy.
</P>
<P>
   One in three people works for a maquiladora _ or foreign-owned
factory _ in Ciudad Acuna, the city across from Del Rio, Texas,
Mayor Eduardo Ramon said. Steady growth means not enough houses,
hospital beds and drinking water, he added. The sewage system of
Ciudad Acuna collapsed, Ramon said, showing slides in a
matter-of-fact plea for infrastructure to keep up with a population
explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Veronica Davila of the Benedictine Resource Center in San
Antonio challenged the benign portrayal of the maquiladoras in a
set of questions, then apologized for becoming emotional.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do the maquilas operating in your cities participate in
finding solutions?'' Davila first asked. After being told some
companies helped build baseball fields or fund scholarships, she
returned to the microphone to ask specifically if they were helping
fund a $38 million water treatment plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the main reason we're here, because they pollute, they
contaminate,'' Davila said. ``They should be the major players in
the clean up because they're the ones who have been dumping.''
</P>
<P>
   Her attack prompted an angry response from Fay Mainhart,
representing Delphi Automotive Systems, a company that supplies
auto parts.
</P>
<P>
   Her company recently received an award for its environmental
record in Mexico, Mainhart said, and in Laredo maquiladoras are
monitored by the Mexican government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get very upset when I hear people slam dunk the industry,
because we are so highly regulated,'' Mainhart said.

WHAT MAKES FOR A GREAT PRESIDENT?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM WRIGHT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Presidential candidates should ponder how much people, sometimes
unreasonably, expect of a president.
</P>
<P>
   The presidency may be at once the most honored and most
criticized office on earth. It is surely the most consequential and
the most nearly impossible to do justice. To Thomas Jefferson it
was a ``splendid misery'' and to Theodore Roosevelt a ``bully
pulpit.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyndon B. Johnson said it made of everyone who occupied it,
``however small, bigger than he was, and, however big, not big
enough for its demands.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans have a tendency to nit-pick live presidents and to
venerate, even sanctify, our dead ones. Harry Truman is a prime
example.
</P>
<P>
   Truman's job ratings were abysmally low during his last couple
of years in office. Jokes abounded depicting our chief executive as
a lowbrow. Baylor University, after inviting the president to speak
at a commencement, uninvited him because he admittedly drank and
sometimes swore.
</P>
<P>
   The Korean War had grown increasingly unpopular. Truman's firing
of Gen. Douglas MacArthur brought a backlash. In 1952, many
Democratic candidates didn't want Truman's public endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Today, a half-century later, we rarely hear anything but praise
for the blunt-spoken little warrior. The nation's historians, in
fact, are rating Truman fifth among all who've occupied our highest
office.
</P>
<P>
   Judged by American historians for the enduring legacies of his
leadership, Truman ranks ahead of all except Lincoln, Washington,
Jefferson and Franklin D. Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   Modern presidents often begin pining and maneuvering about
midway in their second terms for a rung somewhere in the upper half
of history's ladder of greatness. Most know realistically that, if
they're to make it at all, recognition will come only after they
are dead.
</P>
<P>
   Historians judge presidents by the lasting effects of their
leadership on the country, and its lingering influence on how
people live and think today. By these criteria, Lincoln stands
ahead of all the rest, closely followed by Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Those two differ widely in upbringing, style and personality.
Both had convictions. Each presided over historic choices. Each is
revered today.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln led the nation through the greatest threat ever to our
national survival, the Civil War. He saved the Union. He abolished
slavery. He preached reconciliation. Lincoln's words, as those of
no other American leader, are woven into the fabric of our
language. Ordinary people identify with him as with no other.
</P>
<P>
   Washington led the troops that won our independence. He
organized our first government in patterns that we follow today.
His ``Cabinet'' included some of the best brains of his time. And
he fathered the two-term tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Embedded in our national psyche are the images of Washington
praying in the snow at Valley Forge and 'fessing up to his father
after chopping down the cherry tree. Whether these things happened
or not, they are part of our legacy. After leaving office,
Washington once said he'd rather be dead than back in the
presidency suffering attacks in the press. Hardly anyone today is
aware that he was criticized.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Jefferson and Franklin D. Roosevelt are tied for third
and fourth places in the historians' pantheon of greatness.
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt led us through the Great Depression and World War II,
the 20th century's two most cataclysmic events.
</P>
<P>
   Paralyzed by polio, he came to symbolize the nation's
indomitable spirit. He made my generation really believe that the
only thing we had to fear was fear itself. He was our only
three-term president, and he was elected to a fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson, probably our most intellectually gifted leader, was
our most uncompromising champion of individual liberty. To him,
more than any other, we owe the guarantees of free speech, press,
assembly and religion.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote the ringing affirmation of our Declaration of
Independence. His bold, unilateral decision to transact the
Louisiana Purchase doubled our national domain. He made what had
been a thin ribbon settlement along the Atlantic seaboard into a
continental power.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the three most historically consequential actions
undertaken by American presidents on their own recognizance were
Jefferson's Louisiana Purchase, Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation
and Truman's decision to drop the atom bomb. Some might add FDR's
embarking on Lend-Lease.
</P>
<P>
   Truman, like Lincoln, was of the people. He thought their
thoughts. He symbolized the honest directness of the common man. In
him there was no pretense.
</P>
<P>
   Unfazed by lack of family wealth or college education, Truman
never hesitated to make the big decisions. ``The buck stops here,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Marshall Plan, the Berlin airlift, the Greek and Turkish aid
programs, standing up to aggression in Korea _ the whole panoply of
Truman's postwar leadership decisions stopped the aggressive spread
of communism. They shaped the world in which we live today.
</P>
<P>
   These were five men of different family backgrounds,
personalities, temperaments. They lived in different times, faced
different problems. Two were blessed with personal wealth; two came
from hardscrabble; Jefferson inherited an impressive plantation but
spent his energies on the country and died impoverished.
</P>
<P>
   What united them? Of what does greatness consist? In a sense,
their lives were defined by the problems they faced _ and
conquered.
</P>
<P>
   Each had the courage of his own convictions. Each had a
passionate love for this country. Each risked boldly. Each had a
vision.
</P>
<P>
   The graceful patina of time has polished their images, and
history's sandpaper smoothed their rougher corners. It would be
unfair to measure today's candidates against these icons.
</P>
<P>
   But not unfair to bear in mind that the office itself deserves
greatness.

``however small, bigger than he was, and, however big, not big
enough for its demands.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans have a tendency to nit-pick live presidents and to
venerate, even sanctify, our dead ones. Harry Truman is a prime
example.
</P>
<P>
   Truman's job ratings were abysmally low during his last couple
of years in office. Jokes abounded depicting our chief executive as
a lowbrow. Baylor University, after inviting the president to speak
at a commencement, uninvited him because he admittedly drank and
sometimes swore.
</P>
<P>
   The Korean War had grown increasingly unpopular. Truman's firing
of Gen. Douglas MacArthur brought a backlash. In 1952, many
Democratic candidates didn't want Truman's public endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Today, a half-century later, we rarely hear anything but praise
for the blunt-spoken little warrior. The nation's historians, in
fact, are rating Truman fifth among all who've occupied our highest
office.
</P>
<P>
   Judged by American historians for the enduring legacies of his
leadership, Truman ranks ahead of all except Lincoln, Washington,
Jefferson and Franklin D. Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   Modern presidents often begin pining and maneuvering about
midway in their second terms for a rung somewhere in the upper half
of history's ladder of greatness. Most know realistically that, if
they're to make it at all, recognition will come only after they
are dead.
</P>
<P>
   Historians judge presidents by the lasting effects of their
leadership on the country, and its lingering influence on how
people live and think today. By these criteria, Lincoln stands
ahead of all the rest, closely followed by Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Those two differ widely in upbringing, style and personality.
Both had convictions. Each presided over historic choices. Each is
revered today.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln led the nation through the greatest threat ever to our
national survival, the Civil War. He saved the Union. He abolished
slavery. He preached reconciliation. Lincoln's words, as those of
no other American leader, are woven into the fabric of our
language. Ordinary people identify with him as with no other.
</P>
<P>
   Washington led the troops that won our independence. He
organized our first government in patterns that we follow today.
His ``Cabinet'' included some of the best brains of his time. And
he fathered the two-term tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Embedded in our national psyche are the images of Washington
praying in the snow at Valley Forge and 'fessing up to his father
after chopping down the cherry tree. Whether these things happened
or not, they are part of our legacy. After leaving office,
Washington once said he'd rather be dead than back in the
presidency suffering attacks in the press. Hardly anyone today is
aware that he was criticized.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Jefferson and Franklin D. Roosevelt are tied for third
and fourth places in the historians' pantheon of greatness.
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt led us through the Great Depression and World War II,
the 20th century's two most cataclysmic events.
</P>
<P>
   Paralyzed by polio, he came to symbolize the nation's
indomitable spirit. He made my generation really believe that the
only thing we had to fear was fear itself. He was our only
three-term president, and he was elected to a fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson, probably our most intellectually gifted leader, was
our most uncompromising champion of individual liberty. To him,
more than any other, we owe the guarantees of free speech, press,
assembly and religion.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote the ringing affirmation of our Declaration of
Independence. His bold, unilateral decision to transact the
Louisiana Purchase doubled our national domain. He made what had
been a thin ribbon settlement along the Atlantic seaboard into a
continental power.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the three most historically consequential actions
undertaken by American presidents on their own recognizance were
Jefferson's Louisiana Purchase, Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation
and Truman's decision to drop the atom bomb. Some might add FDR's
embarking on Lend-Lease.
</P>
<P>
   Truman, like Lincoln, was of the people. He thought their
thoughts. He symbolized the honest directness of the common man. In
him there was no pretense.
</P>
<P>
   Unfazed by lack of family wealth or college education, Truman
never hesitated to make the big decisions. ``The buck stops here,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Marshall Plan, the Berlin airlift, the Greek and Turkish aid
programs, standing up to aggression in Korea _ the whole panoply of
Truman's postwar leadership decisions stopped the aggressive spread
of communism. They shaped the world in which we live today.
</P>
<P>
   These were five men of different family backgrounds,
personalities, temperaments. They lived in different times, faced
different problems. Two were blessed with personal wealth; two came
from hardscrabble; Jefferson inherited an impressive plantation but
spent his energies on the country and died impoverished.
</P>
<P>
   What united them? Of what does greatness consist? In a sense,
their lives were defined by the problems they faced _ and
conquered.
</P>
<P>
   Each had the courage of his own convictions. Each had a
passionate love for this country. Each risked boldly. Each had a
vision.
</P>
<P>
   The graceful patina of time has polished their images, and
history's sandpaper smoothed their rougher corners. It would be
unfair to measure today's candidates against these icons.
</P>
<P>
   But not unfair to bear in mind that the office itself deserves
greatness.

TRAGEDIES JUST CAN'T BE EXPLAINED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a recent Friday, a little girl _ this one just 5 years old _
was raped and left clutching her cleats in a sporting-goods store
bathroom in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy D. Moore, the 44-year-old ex-con she identified as her
assailant, went back to work after the alleged attack, like nothing
had happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently he followed her into the bathroom, forced her into
a stall and sexually assaulted her,'' a police officer was quoted
as saying. ``This is a travesty. This is incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Those words might describe the entire week in crime, but the
shooting death three days earlier of 6-year-old Kayla Rolland near
Flint, Mich., particularly comes to mind. While her first-grade
teacher and classmates watched, a 6-year-old boy pulled a gun and
shot Kayla in the neck.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, who lived with his uncle in a crack house, then put the
gun in a desk and walked away. Kayla was rushed to the hospital,
where she died less than an hour later.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't possibly recount in one column every news story I've
read in recent months about children fatally shot or sexually
abused by an adult who should know better. But every time I read
one, I feel as though I owe the child an apology.
</P>
<P>
   I have no idea what I might say because, as often as they occur,
these tragedies are inexplicable to me.
</P>
<P>
   Just as inevitable are the questions parents raise about an
apparent lack of morals among youth.
</P>
<P>
   This makes no more sense, though, than the tragedies. I always
believed that children, for better or worse, mimic their parents.
The acorn doesn't fall far from the tree, as the saying goes.
</P>
<P>
   Having said that, raising questions is healthy. Finding the
answers, though, requires honest soul-searching and a commitment to
turn from those things that cause us harm, that negatively impact
our children.
</P>
<P>
   If you wondered how a 6-year-old boy got a gun and shot his
classmate, the answer soon followed as news reports described the
conditions in which the boy lived. Crack house. Dad in jail. Mom
God knows where.
</P>
<P>
   And what can we make of Jimmy Moore? Ex-con. Convicted of
attempted rape and attempted kidnapping. You have to wonder if
Moore has a history of being sexually abused.
</P>
<P>
   Proverbs 22:6 says, ``Train a child in the way he should go and
when he is old he will not turn from it.'' I read an interesting
twist on that proverb recently in my study Bible and it went
something like this: ``Train a child in the way he should go _ and
go there yourself once in a while.''
</P>
<P>
   If you've got questions, if you were wondering how to have a
moral and lasting effect on your children, that in essence is the
sum of God's advice to us.
</P>
<P>
   It is up to us to accept it and apply it to our lives.
</P>
<P>
   That is the wonderful thing about Scripture. While some might
see it as outdated, the answer to every problem we might face in
this life can be found there.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you remember from the book of Deuteronomy: ``O Israel,
listen: Jehovah is our God, Jehovah alone. You must love him with
all your heart, soul and might. And you must think constantly about
these commandments I am giving you today. You must teach to your
children and talk about them when you are at home or out for a
walk; at bedtime and the first thing in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to passing on our faith is not lecturing our children or
giving them good books to read or taking them to church. The key is
making ourselves the example we want them to follow.

<TEXT>
<P>
   They are a part of American culture, the Harley-Davidson of
tennis shoes, a fashion icon for eccentrics and nonconformists.
</P>
<P>
   The distinguished Chuck Taylor star has adorned the ankles of
many an American boy and girl. And it seems to be mandated
somewhere that All-Star high-tops be worn beyond the fixative
powers of duct tape, then flung, in that end-of-summer ritual, up
on a telephone wire.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the legendary basketball star Chuck Taylor, Converse
Inc. had been able to hang on in a big-money business, consistently
making the top 10 list of the nation's best-selling athletic shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, however, market bullies named Nike and Adidas have been
taking Converse to school. As a result, the North Reading, Mass.,
company that for more than 80 years has made its mark by selling
the Great American Sneaker is fading. To reverse the slide,
Converse has placed its hopes on helium.
</P>
<P>
   In September, the company launched a new line of basketball
sneakers called All Star He:01. The shoes, which sell for $100,
have helium-filled heels. The product Converse's attempt to rise
above the noise of the high-tech sneaker race.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always thought of Converse as a technical shoe
company,'' said Michelle Poole, the company's marketing director.
``We've decided to put all of our technology into one shoe, and
hopefully it would roll out from there. We're following a strategy
similar to what Nike did with their `Air' shoes years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to give the He:01 a push this month when it
releases a whole line of helium-filled shoes targeting
skateboarders. A second style for basketball players will follow.
</P>
<P>
   Converse's decline can be traced back five years. The company
has reported more than $135 million in losses over that period.
</P>
<P>
   Converse's stock value has remained so low that the manufacturer
is in danger of being taken off the New York Stock Exchange for not
meeting minimum standards.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, company officials say they are sticking to their
game plan of pushing the new technology and have little planned for
promoting Chuck Taylor All-Stars.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, Converse has pumped out different styles of the
trademark All-Star brand _ new colors, a Batman theme, camouflage _
to boost sales. Poole said she was not aware of any plans for a new
Chuck Taylor model this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Chuck Taylor All-Star shoes have become collectibles and may
become even more valuable if the company folds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the years they've become big collector's items. I suspect
they'll become even bigger,'' said Buddy Sanchez, who sells used
sneakers through his San Antonio-based Web site
(www.secondstepsneakers.com).
</P>
<P>
   Orders for used Chuck Taylor All-Stars have come from as far as
Japan, Sanchez said. About 50 percent of his business from Asia and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about sneakers that have been around forever.
What article of clothing or brand can say that?'' Sanchez said. ``I
would lump it there with apple pie and baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Sneaker industry analysts say another reason there continues to
be a market for All-Stars is consumer confusion over the abundance
of flashy, high-performance shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than anything it's a back-to-basics thing. People are
getting turned off or even scared off by all the contraptions and
designs,'' said Fred Foley, a sporting goods industry analyst with
New York-based Mazurek and Dullnig Partners. ``With Chuck Taylors
you get a basic sneaker.''
</P>
<P>
   But most consumers of Chuck Taylor shoes are adults, perhaps
feeling nostalgic for their youth. The industry as a whole,
however, has headed in a direction aimed mostly at teens.
</P>
<P>
   But as many companies have discovered, teens aren't choosing
sneakers as much as they once did. The National Sporting Goods
Association reported that basketball shoe sales in the United
States totaled $999.5 million last year, plunging to the 1995
level.
</P>
<P>
   ``You read about all these kids being out of shape and not being
active, and you have to figure they're not out there buying
shoes,'' Foley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're not buying Air Jordans, they're certainy not
buying Chuck Taylors.''
</P>

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even though Americans have been buying and wearing Chuck Taylor
All-Stars for more than 80 years (60 percent of all Americans own
or have owned at least one pair), most people don't know who Chuck
Taylor was.
</P>
<P>
   In 1908, the popularity of basketball was on the rise, and a
company called Converse Rubber Corp. opened with the objective of
manufacturing shoes for athletes, particularly basketball players.
</P>
<P>
   After some research, the first version of the All-Star
basketball shoe was produced in 1917. The rubber-soled shoes were
made of canvas and reached the ankles. Like the Model T, they came
only in black. It was the first mass-produced sneaker in North
America.
</P>
<P>
   Yet sales didn't catch on. In fact, many basketball players
didn't even like the shoes.
</P>
<P>
   All except one, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck H. Taylor was a high school basketball star in his
hometown of Columbus, Ind. After finishing high school, Taylor
played professionally, before the organization of leagues as we
know them, with teams in Fort Wayne, Ind., and Detroit. He also
barnstormed around the country with the original Celtics and played
for the Buffalo Germans and Akron Firestones.
</P>
<P>
   On the court, he wore All-Stars.
</P>
<P>
   This was long before the days of the million-dollar contract, so
while in Chicago one morning, Taylor decided to visit the Converse
sales office to apply for a job.
</P>
<P>
   Within a year after being hired, Taylor's personal input led to
a slight restyling of the All-Star, making the sneaker more
suitable for playing basketball. Two years later, in 1923, Taylor's
signature was added to the All-Star ankle patch in recognition of
his contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor later served in both the Navy and the Air Force during
World War II as a consultant on physical fitness and as the coach
of the Air Force basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Taylor made his earnings on the road, driving to
towns all over the United States to conduct clinics and sell shoes.
Soon, almost every basketball coach in America knew the traveling
salesman who did as much for the promotion of the sport of
basketball as he did for the shoes he peddled.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968 Taylor retired. He was inducted into the Basketball Hall
of Fame a year later. He died that same year at age 68.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Pity the families of the Silicon Valley,
suffering from a horrible new disease called Sudden Wealth
Syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Before you roll a crisp hundred into a green ribbon and pin it
on your lapel, rest assured that the disease is treatable.
</P>
<P>
   Much the way many alcoholics treat their alcoholism with more
alcohol, the disease of Sudden Wealth Syndrome is being treated
with its cause: overdoses of money.
</P>
<P>
   Psychologists, counselors and philanthropic investment experts
are making sudden silicon wealth their own, giving parents and kids
guidance on how they can survive the epidemic of ``affluenza.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago the Bay Area's army of counselors had to scrape for
money amid the wreckage of marriages and recovered memories of
sexual abuse. Now they can mine money at the source, from families
damaged by dot-coms, IPOs and stock options.
</P>
<P>
   Freud made his fortune and fame treating rich people, but he
couldn't just flat out say Anna O.'s problem was that she was rich.
Conversion hysteria, that was the problem, caused by unresolved
childhood sexual conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays Silicon Valley kids have unresolved investment
conflicts _ buy or sell, take the stock options or the cash?
</P>
<P>
   Their parents, afflicted with the grim liberalism typical of
Palo Alto, want their kids to grow up with social consciences at
the top of the social ladder. Thus the parents are caught between
two impulses.
</P>
<P>
   First, they lobby the schools to abolish recess so kids can
spend more time in class in order to get into Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Then they take the kids to group therapy sessions to hug and
talk about how when they were young the only start-up they ever
heard of was starting up the lawn mower to make some extra cash.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to teach the kids about the responsibilities of
being silicon Rockefellers.
</P>
<P>
   The basic symptoms of Sudden Wealth Syndrome in children are the
following:
</P>
<P>
   _ Arguments in the cafeteria about MarketWatch.com versus
TheStreet.com.
</P>
<P>
   _ Posters of Bill Gates on bedroom walls instead of Michael
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   _ Getting lost trying to find the bedroom because the parents
built the monstrous house right out to the lot lines.
</P>
<P>
   _ Playing with Ann Winblad dolls instead of Barbie dolls. (If
you don't know who Ann Winblad is, your family is in no danger from
Sudden Wealth Syndrome.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Engaging in start-up-related activities.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hiding Fortune magazines inside textbooks during class.
</P>
<P>
   _ After schoolyard fights, the cry, ``You'll hear from my
attorneys.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Teachers bribed with Apples.
</P>
<P>
   _ Vested by 7th grade, retired by 12th.
</P>
<P>
   The disease of Sudden Wealth Syndrome can be treated by the
intensive counseling mentioned above or, less effectively, by
self-esteem reduction classes in the schools.
</P>
<P>
   In the latter, a teacher explains the history of the South Sea
Bubble and the Great Depression, while telling the kids that
dot-coms are a giant Ponzi scheme that soon will come crashing down
like those avalanches they see in Gstaad.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, by the end of the class, the teacher is usually
shouting that the kids didn't earn those Lexuses in the parking
lot, and Neons get better mileage anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The kids leave class paging their venture capitalists.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow I don't think Jerry Lewis will be hosting a telethon for
Sudden Wealth Syndrome. In the Silicon Valley and the rest of the
Bay Area, you'll find more sympathy for those suffering from Sudden
Dearth Syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   That's most of us, people who once proudly called ourselves
middle class. Now we're among the 73 percent of Bay Area residents
who can't afford to buy a home at the median price of $365,000.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, we have a dearth of places to live, and a dearth of
dining experiences beyond having it Burger King's way. Our children
suffer socially in school because they're on the other side of the
Nasdaq divide.
</P>
<P>
   Perpetual Poverty Syndrome has always been with us, by
definition. It's the worst, of course. Psychologists don't even
bother treating Perpetual Poverty Syndrome because it doesn't pay
and, well, it's so perpetual.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, no one I know would think of seeing a psychologist for
the disease of having too little money. You'd end up with even less
of it.
</P>
<P>
   The main problem with Sudden Wealth Syndrome is that it isn't
communicable enough. Spreading it around would solve a lot of
people's problems.
</P>
<P>
   Do I want to cure a multimillionaire? You bet.
</P>
<P>
   Where's that dusty degree in psychology? Let me relieve you of
some of your burdens.

HEARING FROM THE `REAL' PEOPLE AT LAST 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEDONA, Ariz. _ The town hall meeting will never replace the
television commercial as the main weapon of the modern presidential
campaign, and that's too bad.
</P>
<P>
   Issues and presidential qualifications aside, John McCain made a
commendable contribution to this year's White House race if for no
other reason than he invited thousands of people _ from all walks
of life and political persuasions _ to come ask him questions.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, McCain's town hall meetings were partly campaign gimmicks.
But the questioners were not screened, and the events were a
refreshing source of candidate-voter contact in an age when that
has all but disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   The meetings also were highly effective in New Hampshire, where
the senator from Arizona held 114 of them en route to a surprise
thumping of Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   They alone weren't responsible for McCain's victory in the
first-in-the-nation primary. Thousands of independent voters and a
poor Bush campaign effort also were instrumental. But New Hampshire
was small enough for the personal contact between voter and
candidate at which McCain excelled.
</P>
<P>
   Town hall meetings were fewer and less of a factor in the larger
states, where wholesale campaigning in the form of television ads
and endorsements mostly replaced the more-intimate retail
politicking. The increasing frequency of primaries also made the
change in campaign style inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of his race, which ended last week in a string of
key Super Tuesday losses, McCain's use of the town hall meeting had
become, one aide admitted, mainly ``emblematic,'' a symbol of the
senator's anti-establishment campaign. But the day before his
surprise victory in the Michigan primary last month, a town hall
meeting that McCain hosted in Traverse City had all the markings of
the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate spent more than an hour delivering his stump
speech and answering more than two dozen questions from about 1,000
people, many of whom had traveled a number of miles to attend.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the apparent Republican nominee, also has sometimes hosted
his version of the town hall meeting. But most of what will pass
for candidate-voter ``contact'' during the remainder of the
presidential campaign will be well-scripted events.
</P>
<P>
   There will be rallies and chamber of commerce dinners with
canned stump speeches, tours of schools and high tech plants and
other photo opportunities designed to rally support by getting a
candidate shown on television, purportedly interacting with voters.
The actual interaction, however, will be minimal.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the questions posed to McCain at his town hall meetings,
admittedly, were repetitive and predictable. His views on
education, Social Security, veterans' benefits, abortion and
international affairs were repeatedly solicited, giving him
numerous opportunities to deliver well-rehearsed answers that
expanded on his basic campaign pitch.
</P>
<P>
   But, often, people asked questions about issues, such as health
care and environmental protection, that obviously are important to
many Americans but weren't getting a lot of attention in the
Republican presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also occasionally encountered protesters or hecklers,
trying to confront the senator on controversial issues, such as
Native American affairs in Arizona or the legalization of marijuana
for medicinal purposes, over which they and McCain disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   And McCain was not above turning a question on health care, say,
into a mini-filibuster on campaign finance reform _ his cornerstone
issue _ or dodging an answer entirely.
</P>
<P>
   At a town hall meeting in South Carolina, for example, he
refused to say what he thought about that state flying the
Confederate flag over its statehouse. The flag was a local issue to
be decided by South Carolinians, he said, repeating his and Bush's
standard response to that particular hot button.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this is all an exercise in nostalgia over a bygone era.
But town hall meetings can be informative, and they can be
entertaining, and there is certainly nothing wrong with either
quality in a presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps most important, they afford a candidate for the
White House an opportunity _ in an age dominated by media-image
packaging _ to hear from ``real'' people.

   Get away from it all in a plush, quiet way at Borrego Springs
</P>
<P>
   By Eric Noland
</P>
<P>
   Travel Editor
</P>
<P>
   BORREGO SPRINGS -- Urban life - even suburban life - can close
in on you sometimes. Particularly in winter. Patience wears thin in
the face of lawn mowers and car alarms, nosy neighbors and manic
drivers ... even the street lamp that seems to have been aimed
directly at your window.
</P>
<P>
   At such times, the desert can serve as a welcome antidote. But
not just any desert. A well-kept secret lies directly east of San
Diego, tucked between Mount Palomar and the Salton Sea, reaching
south nearly to the Mexican border.
</P>
<P>
   It is Anza-Borrego Desert State Park. It's a big one - at about
940 square miles, one of the largest state parks in the country.
</P>
<P>
   And it's wild. This protected desert region offers serenity that
can't be found amid the developmental sprawl of Palm Springs or the
blinding light and commotion of Las Vegas. Anza-Borrego is
otherworldly canyons, bighorn sheep, off-road trails, brilliant
night skies and wildflowers - the region is currently in the midst
of its annual bloom, although the lingering La Nina drought is
expected to mute it some.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of all this, Anza-Borrego is not the sole province of
hardy travelers, those who don't balk at brushing sand from a
frying pan or plucking cactus quills from the sidewalls of tires.
</P>
<P>
   Smack in the middle of the park is an island of private and
municipal land, on which sits the sleepy burg of Borrego Springs.
``It's truly unique,'' said Brian Cahill, spokesman for the state
park. ``With most parks, you find (support services) in a gateway
community on the edge of the park. Here it's right in the middle -
a hole in the doughnut, so to speak.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are stores and homes and what seems to be dozens of tiny
Mexican restaurants ... plus one of the most comfortable resorts
you're going to find anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   La Casa del Zorro spreads out over 38 acres on the southeastern
edge of town. The proprietors are obviously keenly aware of their
proximity to the vast, urban expanses of Los Angeles and San Diego
- and realize that city folk make the trek to this remote desert
area (about a three-hour drive from downtown Los Angeles) precisely
because they've been driven wiggy by confined quarters.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, the Copley publishing family bought the Desert Lodge,
changed the name to the current one and began making offers on the
tiny desert homes that adjoined the property, purchasing them over
a period of years as they came onto the market. But instead of
gobbling up that open land for a sprawling hotel, the homes were
renovated and the distances between each maintained.
</P>
<P>
   Now the boutique resort features 19 ``casitas'' among its 77
rooms. They are free-standing units averaging 1,300 square feet,
and most are tucked away in remote corners of the property. About a
dozen were renovated recently and have private pools or spas to
complement such welcoming touches as wood-burning fireplaces,
open-beam ceilings, glazed-tile floors and hacienda furniture.
</P>
<P>
   They are one- to four-bedroom units, and all come equipped with
peace and quiet. With your resort neighbors at a discreet distance,
the urban kinks seem to melt away over a book by a crackling fire,
a room-service breakfast on the patio or a cool drink in a deck
lounger by the pool. Windows and patios were designed to maximize
rugged views of desert and the nearby Vallecito and Santa Rosa
mountain ranges. That state-park wilderness is close, too; early
one morning, a member of our group heard the distinctive yips of
coyotes a short distance off.
</P>
<P>
   The casitas might be a bit of a splurge - on weekends during the
winter peak (through April 30), they range upward from $295 for a
one-bedroom unit, $550 for a two-bedroom - but the latter
represents an intriguing option for two couples seeking to vacation
together (and, of course, defray the cost). The two- and
three-bedroom units have a bathroom for each bedroom, so privacy is
maximal.
</P>
<P>
   The rooms in the main building may not be able to match this
degree of privacy, but they are no less comfortable. One of La Casa
del Zorro's most popular lodging categories, according to
front-desk staffers, is the deluxe room, which features a fireplace
- at the foot of the bed - plus a vaulted ceiling, sitting area and
either a balcony or patio ($275 on weekends in winter, $210 in late
spring).
</P>
<P>
   The resort is positioning itself as quite the desert oasis. It
currently has 14 bodies of water for swimming and relaxing,
including the private casita pools and spas, and has plans to add
six more casita pools this year, according to resort executive Jay
Patterson. Two of the common pools are designated for family use,
but only adults are permitted into a complex that features a
25-yard lap pool (complete with lane lines), a 2,111-square- foot
aerobics pool and a cloverleaf-shaped Jacuzzi that appeared capable
of seating 30 - if you can endure the extreme warmth; the
thermostat was set at 103.5 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   There are so many pool complexes at this resort that when our
group of four called to see if room service could deliver a bottle
of wine to the Jacuzzi (it could), the server said over the phone,
``Describe what it looks like where you are.''
</P>
<P>
   In such a setting, it would be tempting to lounge away each day
without ever getting a speck of sand on the hiking boots, but to do
so would be to deprive Anza-Borrego of its due.
</P>
<P>
   On an off-road camping trip here a few years ago, our group
explored a network of sandy roads in the Pinyon Mountains and a
region ominously named Earthquake Valley, pitching our tents in a
knife-edge canyon only to escape merciless night winds.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, you may be itching to see if the headlight brush
guards on your new four-wheel-drive beast are effective against
something more treacherous than the overgrown landscaping at
Nordstrom, but you're still haunted by images of being stuck up to
both axles in Tarantula Wash, nearly four miles from the nearest
paved road.
</P>
<P>
   An alternative is leaving the driving to another. We did on this
visit and wound up with a fascinating and sometimes harrowing
introduction to some of Anza-Borrego's more hidden charms.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Ford is a transplanted San Diegan who gained a desert-rat
fascination with this park 10 years ago. Now, under the moniker
Borrego Paul, he runs Desert Jeep Tours, introducing visitors to
some of the more intriguing, out-of-the-way features of this vast
park.
</P>
<P>
   We opted for the three-hour ``Desert Combo'' ($69 per person),
the most popular of his four tours. We knew what we were in for
within the first few minutes of the ride, when he careened through
a desert landscape and ultimately came to a stop on the edge of a
steep canyon. Boulders had been positioned along the rim - usually
an indication that vehicles are expected to stop here. Ford
squeezed between two of them ... and over we went, plunging toward
the canyon bottom on perhaps a 50-degree grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most first-timers panic and slam on the brakes right away,''
said Ford, whose foot seemed to have no intention of getting
anywhere near the brake. ``That's the worst thing you can do,
because then you lose control.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon, we were creeping up a canyon barely wide enough for his
11-year- old Jeep Cherokee (affectionately called Dusty). Then the
passage could no longer accommodate the Jeep - or, barely, us.
</P>
<P>
   It is the aptly named Slot Canyon, a narrow gash formed by storm
water racing through soft sandstone. We left the Jeep and began to
wander deep into it, at times having to turn sideways to fit our
shoulders through. Over time, mud from high above had oozed into
this dark canyon and run down its walls, creating the appearance of
candle-wax drippings. ``I love what sandstone and water do,'' Ford
said later as we drove out the mouth of the canyon. ``Mother Nature
is the best artist.''
</P>
<P>
   The tour held many other delights. We were shown an abandoned
mine shaft a head-high tunnel hacked perhaps 20 yards into the side
of a mountain, through what appeared to be solid granite. The
ground outside was littered with rose quartz, indicating the
prospect of gold nearby, but it's difficult to know if this hole
was the least bit lucrative for the laborers who carved it 100 or
more years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Later, we made our way to Military Wash, where American forces
practiced aerial strafing at the start of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Jee, a supervising ranger for the park, noted later that
the area was first scraped clean, after which stones were laid out
in circles to form targets. He said there are also rumors that a
short rail line was constructed so the pilots could fire at a
moving target. ``This was 1942, '43,'' Jee said. ``These were young
kids right off the farm, and they needed a lot of practice how to
come in at the right angle and be effective with the firing.''
</P>
<P>
   That much is evident at a ruined concrete observation post that
overlooks the wash. It is pockmarked with numerous wayward shots.
</P>
<P>
   The target area is also rich in remnants from a prehistoric era.
Crisscrossing it on foot, we spotted hundreds of spent, rusted
machine-gun slugs ... mixed in with large chunks of petrified wood.
We located bits of shrapnel ... in among globs of amber - petrified
tree sap.
</P>
<P>
   To the southeast is the Carrizo Impact Area, a section of the
park that is expressly off-limits to visitors. Pilots practiced
bombing runs here, and the ground remains laden with unexploded
ordnance. ``It was 1,000- pounders on down, plus rockets of all
sizes,'' Jee said. ``The geology of that area is soft, like a big
catcher's mitt. The bombs went into the ground 10 to 20 feet.
They're stable while they're in the ground, but rainfall washes
everything away and they start growing out of the ground. It's sort
of like having your own bomb garden.''
</P>
<P>
   Next on our tour was a ride through an area called the Borrego
Badlands, whose name undoubtedly derives from the fact that nothing
seems to grow over this expanse of parched, desolate bumps. Well,
appearances can be deceiving. We found a Borrego aster displaying a
bright blossom - in early February, probably one of the first
wildflowers of the season - and an ocotillo in bloom.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, we rode to a ridge-top overlook, Vista del Malpais,
and surveyed the Badlands as they swept off to the south, including
one area appropriately named Hills of the Moon.
</P>
<P>
   On the way back to the paved road, as we tore along Thimble
Trail, Ford seemed to take great delight in twice getting air as we
bounced over the crests of hills. ``I can make this anywhere from
an A- to an E-ticket, depending on what people can handle,'' he
said devilishly.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, we were perfectly content to undertake further
exploration at a much gentler pace - we walked. One of the most
popular hikes in Anza-Borrego is the Palm Canyon Trail, accessed
via paved road just a few miles from the Visitor Center. The
three-mile round-trip walk is popular not only for its convenience
but for its rewards.
</P>
<P>
   Within a mile, we were peering through binoculars at a
Peninsular bighorn sheep munching at the undergrowth high up on a
craggy slope. There are only about 300 of the creatures living in
this desert region today, down from the estimated 40,000 that
roamed here when settlers began traipsing through in the early
1800s. This one, which blended with its surroundings so well that
spotting it was a considerable challenge, seemed wholly unconcerned
with the stream of hikers on the canyon floor about a mile away.
Nor did it flinch when a sleek, gray fighter from nearby Lemoore
Naval Air Station suddenly roared past overhead.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the trail is a bizarre sight - a bright gash of
green, incongruous against the grays and dark reds of the desert
canyon. It is a cluster of fan palms, one of about 150 such groves
that exists in the Southwest. This is a big one, about 1,000 trees,
making it one of the largest oases in the United States. A stream
pouring out of the San Ysidro Mountains feeds it.
</P>
<P>
   After our hike, it was time to leave Anza-Borrego, but any
reluctance to depart was tempered by the spectacular views from the
steep climb up S22. Then came - imagination willing - an immersion
in history, as the road connected with S2 and Highway 79 to roughly
follow a route that served the earliest visitors to this area.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Bautista de Anza twice tramped through here in the 1770s,
one of the expeditions culminating in his exploration of San
Francisco Bay. More than 100 years later, it was the route of the
Butterfield Overland Mail, a torturous stagecoach passage that
connected St. Louis with San Francisco on a circuitous sweep
through the Southwest - 24 days, 2,812 miles one way.
</P>
<P>
   According to H.H. Bancroft's ``History of California,'' de
Anza's second expedition numbered 235 people, including soldiers,
their wives and children, most of whom intended to settle in
California. (Eight babies were born on the trek from northern
Mexico.) They wended their way north through San Gorgonio Pass and
were thrilled, according to Bancroft, to reach the Spanish toehold
of civilization that was San Gabriel.
</P>
<P>
   On the return trip from our desert retreat, as we began to
encounter such urban harbingers as green freeway signs and the
beacons of fast-food logos, we were considerably less enthused.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   GETTING THERE: Borrego Springs, which lies in the northern
center of Anza-Borrego Desert State Park, is 154 miles from
downtown Los Angeles. At least three hours should be allowed for
the drive. After taking any of several routes east (10, 60, 91),
follow I-15 south to Temecula, then work your way east and south on
Highways 79, S2 and S22 to Borrego Springs.
</P>
<P>
   ACTIVITIES: The state park offers several interpretative
programs, including naturalist's talks, guided hikes, nature walks
and campfire programs. Information can be obtained at the Visitor
Center, which is built into a desert hillside in the northwest
corner of the park (just off S22 as you approach Borrego Springs
from the west). Information: (760) 767-4205. Just outside the
Visitor Center is a desert garden, offering samples of native
plants. Throughout the state park, a $5 daily fee ($4 for seniors)
is charged to visitors who leave the paved roads or park at
trailheads, etc. Self-pay stations are located throughout the park.
Borrego Springs has four public golf courses.
</P>
<P>
   TOURS: Desert Jeep Tours offers four different guided trips into
the desert, ranging from two to three hours and starting at $59 per
person. Customized tours can also be arranged. Information and
reservations: (760) 767-0501. Web: www.desertjeeptours.com.
</P>
<P>
   LODGING: On the outskirts of Borrego Springs, La Casa del Zorro
offers resort accommodations from $295 for weekend dates during the
winter peak season (through April 30). Midweek rates start at $225.
Free-standing casitas start at $295 weekends during the winter
peak. The resort has 14 pools and spas on its property, plus six
lighted tennis courts. Information and reservations: (800) 824-1884
or (760) 767-5323. Web: www.lacasadelzorro.com. Other options
include Borrego Springs Resort Hotel, (760) 767-5700, and Palm
Canyon Resort, (760) 767-5341. The state park is one of few
nationally to allow open camping but requires a $5 nightly permit.
There are also a number of established campgrounds in the park,
some with hookups. Nightly fees range from $9 to $21 in peak
season. Reservations: (800) 444-7275.
</P>
<P>
   DINING: La Casa del Zorro offers fine dining - and requires
jacket and shirt with collar for men. There are some intriguing
items on the menu, including a salad that features roasted chevre
and spiced pecans and pistachios. Most of the main courses are in
the $25-$29 range. This close to the Pacific Ocean, there are
fresh-fish items on the menu, and servers wisely ask you how you'd
like them prepared (giving you the option of rare ahi, for
example). A horseradish-crusted salmon was excellent on a Sunday
night, disappointing more soggy than crusted - one night later.
Also on the Monday night, a medallion of beef tenderloin ordered
medium-rare arrived medium well. Service is earnest, but be alert
when ordering wine: It's not unusual to select a '94 red and have a
'96 delivered to the table. The dinner pickings are pretty slim
elsewhere in Borrego Springs, although ``Best laces: San Diego''
(Sasquatch Books, $18.95), recommends the Krazy Coyote Saloon and
Grille at the Palms at Indian Head resort (closed Monday and
Tuesday). Reservations: (760) 767-7788. For lunch, Alicia's in
Borrego Springs served up hearty Mexican items in a deli setting.
</P>
<P>
   INFORMATION: State Park headquarters in Anza-Borrego can be
reached at (760) 767-5311, the Visitor Center at (760) 767-4205.
The park Web site, www.anzaborrego.statepark.org, includes regular

   For those who don't want to spring for a casita, deluxe rooms at
La Casa del Zorro are nonetheless inviting. They feature a

<P>
   BORREGO SPRINGS -- For weeks, officials at Anza-Borrego Desert
State Park have been pessimistic about the prospects for this
year's wildflower bloom, but the recent rainstorms -- some of which
reserved a trickle for this arid region east of San Diego -- have
restored a glimmer of hope.
</P>
<P>
   Current predictions place the peak of the bloom -- whatever form
it takes -- in the late portion of this month. Park naturalists,
however, frequently update their forecast. Wildflower hotline:
(760) 767-4684. Web: www.anzaborrego.statepark.org.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got some rain last Sunday, about four-tenths of an inch,
and it certainly greened things up,'' said park spokesman Brian
Cahill. ``We're cautiously optimistic that we might have some
annuals showing after all. Of course, if we get a warm, dry wind
blowing through, then we're back to talking about just cactuses and
shrubs.''
</P>
<P>
   The wildflowers generally bloom on the desert floor first, then
work their way up the hillsides. The bloom often lasts into April.
</P>
<P>
   Anza-Borrego enjoyed a wildflower explosion in the soggy El Nino
year of 1998. This season, rainfall has been well below normal -- a
little over three inches since last July 1.

FUNDS TRY TO INDEX HIGH-TECH NASDAQ 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By SHANNON BUGGS 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The NASDAQ composite index closed above 5,000 last week,
reaching that milestone just 10 weeks after hitting the 4,000 mark
and four months after surpassing 3,000.
</P>
<P>
   The rapid ascent of the index, which tracks all the stocks
trading on the electronic Nasdaq stock market, should have devout
index investors wondering how they can get in on the action.
</P>
<P>
   And who wouldn't want to?
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, Qualcomm and Cisco Systems trade on the National
Association of Security Dealers Automatic Quotation System. These
are the big dogs of the ``new economy,'' the buzz phrase for the
faster way workers make, sell and buy products and services because
of the technology explosion that created the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Run with them and you will make money, at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the safe bet for stock investing has been buying an
index fund based on the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500.
</P>
<P>
   Index funds use computers to buy and hold shares in the same
companies, in the same proportions, as those in the benchmark
measures of the stock market's performance.
</P>
<P>
   By buying an index, you can't beat the market, but you also
can't do worse than the market, either.
</P>
<P>
   The best-known index is the Dow Jones industrial average. It's a
price-weighted average that totals the stock prices of 30 of the
country's largest companies and divides by value that adjusts for
stock splits and dividends.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
`OLD ECONOMY' A DRAG ON S&AMP;P &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Dow's obvious limitations in a universe of more than 8,000
publicly traded stocks led to the ascendancy of the S&AMP;P 500 as the
market standard.
</P>
<P>
   It tracks the most actively traded stocks on the Nasdaq, the New
York Stock Exchange and the American Stock Exchange and comprises
the stocks of 400 industrial, 40 utility, 40 financial and 20
transportation companies.
</P>
<P>
   But ``old economy'' sectors have been a drag on the index as
investors suck money out of Proctor &AMP; Gamble and other blue chips
to funnel it into just about any and every dot-com company that
goes public.
</P>
<P>
   From the first of the year, the S&AMP;P 500 is down about 4 percent,
while the Nasdaq is up more than 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The disparity grows when the indexes' returns are compared to
levels of a year ago. The S&AMP;P 500 is up nearly 10 percent since
March 1999; the Nasdaq is up 110 percent for that period.
</P>
<P>
   It's a gap so large that many of you are thinking you should
sell your Vanguard Index 500 fund right now and put the cash on the
Nasdaq. However, don't call your fund family or discount broker
just yet.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
WAYS TO GET IN THE GAME &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As of now, there isn't a no-load fund that will let you invest
in the entire Nasdaq index.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq has so many small, over-the-counter issues it would
be cumbersome for an index fund to manage the buying and holding of
all of them in their proper proportions. Plus, the tech-heavy index
can be so volatile that fund companies avoid it because most index
investors want no-frills, low-cost dependable return.
</P>
<P>
   There are, however, other ways to get in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq 100 tracks the largest 100 non-financial stocks in
the composite. Technology stocks make up about three-fourths of
this index, and about half of its total dollar value comes from the
top 10 stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Rydex OTC is the oldest Nasdaq-100 index fund and is monitored
by Morningstar, the mutual fund rating company in Chicago. Ranson
Nasdaq-100 Index Fund was started in December by Ranson &AMP;
Associates, a fund company in Wichita, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   Another route is to buy QQQ (the ticker symbol for the Nasdaq
100 Share) on the American Stock Exchange. The Amex lists about 30
of these index-linked securities.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Q'' allows investors to buy and sell the index throughout
the day, rather than take a buy-and-hold approach with an index
fund. It reached a new high price of $230 Thursday and closed the
week at $229.
</P>
<P>
   Total return on the stock for the year to date is 20.84 percent,
compared with the Nasdaq 100 index's return of 21.02 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Now that you're dreaming of getting rich, I want to caution you
to concentrate on not going broke. If technology companies don't
produce healthy earnings in the not-so-distant future and the
sector tanks, people solely invested in Nasdaq will lose big time.
</P>
<P>
   Keep some cash in lukewarm indexes. They may keep you from
getting burned.

TRACKING PORTFOLIO ONLINE CAN SIMPLIFY TAX CALCULATIONS

<P>
   After AT&AMP;T spun off Lucent and NCR a few years ago, Duncan
Routh, a former Fidelity Investments account manager, tried to
figure out what the impact would be on his taxes when he sold the
stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really struggled at the time to find out what my cost basis
for AT&AMP;T was,'' recalled Routh, referring to the original cost of
investment that people must track, through spinoffs and other
changes, to figure their taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my background, and I'm having a tough time,'' he said.
``How about all the millions of investors who own the stock?''
</P>
<P>
   That led Routh, along with his brother, brother-in-law, and
another former Fidelity manager, to start GainsKeeper.
</P>
<P>
   The Quincy, Mass. firm aims to help investors track their
portfolios online for spinoffs and other corporate actions for tax
purposes and monitor ``wash sales,'' a potential tax trap for some
people who buy and sell the same stock within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   Www.GainsKeeper.com, online since January, is the latest entry
into Internet portfolio tracking, an increasingly competitive
service offered by such sites as:
</P>
<P>
   --www.Quicken.com
</P>
<P>
   --www.MoneyCentral.msn.com
</P>
<P>
   --www.Morningstar.com
</P>
<P>
   --www.CNBC.com
</P>
<P>
   --www.ClearStation.com
</P>
<P>
   Many mutual fund families and brokerage firms have Web sites,
too.
</P>
<P>
   While many people use online services to track a virtual
portfolio of stocks they may one day be interested in owning,
others rely on them to keep close tabs on the value of their actual
investments. The latest online tracking features allow people to
better monitor a real portfolio, although they may make little
difference for those who have set up a virtual one.
</P>
<P>
   Some sites require investors to type in their stock holdings and
transactions; others allow the importation of data from their
brokerage firm or home money management software. Some
automatically adjust portfolios for stock splits, while others
feature a pop-up window or e-mail alert but require the user to
type in the split transaction.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, these services are free. Here is a summary of
some of the sites:
</P>
<P>
   --www.GainsKeeper.com
</P>
<P>
   The latest entry promises to do more than other sites by being
accurate enough to use with Schedule D, the Internal Revenue
Service form for calculating capital gains and losses, even in the
most complicated situations such as a wash sale. IRS rules don't
allow people to write off a loss on the sale of a stock if they
bought back the stock within 30 days, requiring them to add the
dollar amount of the loss to the cost basis of the stock they
bought instead.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Am I even in a wash sale?' It's a difficult scenario to
identify. It's really one of those calculations better left to a
computer. We're ecstatic to be able to provide it to active traders
of the world,'' said Routh, GainsKeeper's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   His brother Cameron is vice president of marketing, his
brother-in-law Chad Cook is president, and Greg Alves is vice
president of operations.
</P>
<P>
   The service automatically adjusts registered users' online
portfolios for stock splits, spinoffs, mergers, dividend
reinvestments, and other actions for tax purposes; keeps track of
separate lots of a stock bought at different times; and allows
people to print out a report detailing short-term and long-term
capital gains and losses that can be attached to a Schedule D.
</P>
<P>
   But the drawback is that people have to type in their holdings
and transactions from elsewhere, because there is no way to import
data.
</P>
<P>
   For people who don't trade much, who keep good tax records, or
who would rather pay an accountant to figure it all out, it may not
be worth the extra effort.
</P>
<P>
   Routh said the company is working on forming partnerships with
brokerage firms that would allow clients' trades to be
automatically passed off to GainsKeeper for record-keeping, which
would reduce the amount of data entry people have to do. He hopes
to keep the new service free and to keep adding features to the
site.
</P>
<P>
   The privately held company, which just closed a $2.5 million
round of private financing and added the ability to track mutual
funds, has more than 10,000 registered users and is beginning its
first advertising campaign Tuesday, Cameron Routh said.
</P>
<P>
   --www.ClearStation.com
</P>
<P>
   This wholly owned subsidiary of E-Trade, which bills itself as
``The Intelligent Investment Community,'' also automatically
adjusts users' portfolios for splits, mergers, spinoffs, and other
corporate actions, said Will Winkelstein, vice president of
marketing for the San Francisco company.
</P>
<P>
   While ClearStation doesn't adjust for wash sales, it does allow
users to print out a Schedule D-like report, although the report
may not be detailed enough to file with the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   The site's portfolio manager was rated in a 1999 Microsoft Press
book entitled ``Online Investing'' as ``the best on the Web that
does not require a software download.'' (That's because Microsoft's
MoneyCentral.msn.com site does require a software download.)
</P>
<P>
   --www.MoneyCentral.msn.com
</P>
<P>
   This site's portfolio tracker isn't designed for tax purposes,
but it allows users to import their investment data from certain
brokerages and financial software packages, such as Microsoft Money
or Quicken, and automatically adjusts for stock splits and dividend
reinvestments, said product manager Chris Jolley and product
planner Charles Hauck.
</P>
<P>
   ``The portfolio manager, because it's so powerful and so
customizable, really gives people the one-stop shopping they're
looking for,'' said Jolley, who cited such other features as online
graphs of individuals' portfolio data and a portfolio review tool
that analyzes asset allocation and other aspects of your
investments.
</P>
<P>
   --www.CNBC.com, www.Morningstar.com, www.Quicken.com
</P>
<P>
   None of these sites automatically adjusts online portfolios for
stock splits or other actions, or keeps track of tax consequences
of stock transactions, although each may offer a pop-up window or
e-mail alert to notify individuals of the changes they need to make
in their accounts as a result of corporate news.
</P>
<P>
   While officials representing each of the sites said automatic
stock-split adjustment and wash-sale tracking are on the list of
things to be added, they pointed to existing features found in few
other places.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Sheridan, executive producer of CNBC.com, cited the
e-mail alerts that users of the portfolio tracker can get,
notifying them a few hours in advance that the chief executive of a
company they hold in their portfolio will be on CNBC, or that a
stock they're watching has reached a certain price.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Wright, director of tools and portfolio development for
Morningstar.com, said his site's portfolio tracker has an ``X-ray''
capability that allows users to analyze all their mutual fund and
individual stock holdings to check for overlapping ownership of the
same securities and asset allocation.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Cleeve, spokeswoman for Quicken.com, which had a
record-breaking month in February with more than 262 million page
views, said the portfolio tracker allows users to personalize their
automatic alerts. about things like percentage changes in trading
volume or share prices.
</P>
<P>
   Quicken.com will be launching new features in the next month,
but Cleeve said she could not yet reveal them.

NOW, PRACTICE WHAT YOU PREACH 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The problem with asking to be forgiven for unspecified sins, as
Cardinal Bernard Law must know, is that the devil is in the
details.
</P>
<P>
   A schoolgirl comes in from recess in tears because the boys
refused to let her join their soccer game. If the teacher accepts a
reflexive apology, how will the boys learn that their sin was not
as simple as making someone cry, but as odious as excluding someone
because of gender?
</P>
<P>
   A teenager spray-paints swastikas on gravestones in a Jewish
cemetery. If police treat it as vandalism, how will the offender
learn the difference between a prank and a hate crime?
</P>
<P>
   A prince of the Catholic Church seeks forgiveness for acts of
racism, sexism, and anti-Semitism by Catholics in Boston. If he
does not cite particulars, how will victims know that a lesson
really has been learned?
</P>
<P>
   On this first weekend of the penitential season of Lent,
Cardinal Law is asking those who have been hurt by the prejudice of
Catholics to accept on faith that he hears their cry, that he
understands their pain.
</P>
<P>
   He apologizes not for the Catholic Church, which he asks us to
believe is without sin, the Crusades and the Inquisition
notwithstanding. He asks forgiveness, instead, for the sins of
individual Catholics against blacks, Jews, women, and those who
subscribe to other religious beliefs. That distinction requires
some mental gymnastics. Where, after all, did individual Catholics
learn disrespect for other religions if not from the church that
taught them they would be struck dumb, if not dead, if they set
foot inside a Protestant sanctuary? Where did they learn
anti-Semitism if not from the church that taught them that Jews
killed Christ?
</P>
<P>
   The sweeping, yet vague, nature of the cardinal's mea culpa
stands in stark contrast to the specificity of the grievances
nursed for generations by Boston's Catholics. It's a familiar
litany, the repetition of which has given shape and meaning to
Catholic history in Boston: the No Irish Need Apply signs, the
burning of the Ursuline Convent in Charlestown, the forced recital
of Protestant prayers in public schools, the long refusal of Boston
City Hospital to allow priests to visit their sick, the
Know-Nothing Legislature's Nunnery Committee and its bogus
investigation of Catholic convents.
</P>
<P>
   It is the flip side of that Catholic experience for which
Cardinal Law now seeks absolution. Catholics, history makes clear,
gave as good as they got. Like Cardinal Law, his predecessors on
Lake Street condemned anti-Semitism and racism in general, but
about the particulars they were less vocal.
</P>
<P>
   Boston, Mayor James Michael Curley once declared, was the
``strongest Coughlin city in America'' during the Great Depression.
Father Charles Coughlin was the Michigan priest who railed over the
radio every Sunday against a conspiracy of Jewish bankers that he
claimed was responsible for our economic collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal William O'Connell had no use for Coughlin's virulent
views, but he did not prohibit followers from selling his
hate-filled rag on the steps of Catholic churches after Mass.
Neither did he rein in Catholic schoolboys who, during the same
era, terrorized Jews on Blue Hill Avenue _ more popularly known in
Catholic neighborhoods as ``Jew Hill Avenue.''
</P>
<P>
   When Frances Sweeney, the crusading liberal Catholic editor of
the Boston City Reporter, chastised O'Connell for his failure to
stop the attacks on Jews, he summoned her, not to make common cause
but to try to silence her.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, Boston had a home-grown version of Coughlin in
Father Leonard Feeney, a Jesuit who took to a soapboax on Boston
Common every Sunday to warn non-Catholics that the Kingdom of
Heaven was open only to members of the One True Church. Cardinal
Richard Cushing liked Feeney no better than Cardinal O'Connell
liked Coughlin, but he, too, kept publicly silent about a fanatic.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, when Boston erupted in violence in response to
school desegregation, Cardinal Humberto Medeiros asked his flock to
obey the law and to forswear racism. Then, he watched his directive
thwarted as Catholics seeking refuge from busing enrolled in those
parochial schools willing to wink.
</P>
<P>
   Forgiveness, as the Cardinal knows, requires contrition. The
first test comes next week. Gay Catholics should expect to be
embraced at the St. Patrick's Day parade by fellow marchers,
freshly penitent for their past sins of prejudice.

DRAMATIC ALASKAN FRONTIER IS BACKDROP FOR SUSPENSEFUL TALE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE DANIEL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
TRUE NORTH 
By Kimberly Kafka 
Dutton, 273 pp., $23.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ah, springtime in Alaska _ when daylight returns, grizzlies and
mosquitoes wander in search of flesh and blood, and young men's
thoughts turn to panning for gold.
</P>
<P>
   In Kimberly Kafka's riveting first novel, ``True North,'' the
Alaskan frontier is blinding beauty and unforgiving beast. Unlike
Franz (her first cousin twice removed), this Kafka has a penchant
for straightforwardness. She reflects on human nature, Mother
Nature, and current issues such as native rights and eco-tourism
while drawing readers into the world of Ingalik Village, population
125, four hours by air from Anchorage and a third of a world away
from the other United States. In this icy frontier, float planes,
ATVs, and motorboats serve as steeds while white folks and Ingaliks
are cowboys and Indians.
</P>
<P>
   The author, who divides her time between Alaska and Wisconsin,
knows the 49th state's terrain and its people. So it's
disappointing that the characters, though not without depth,
nonetheless fall victim to cliche. However, there's enough
adventure and tension here to minimize the damage. If the setting
were a little warmer, ``True North'' would be a perfect beach book.
</P>
<P>
   There's protagonist Bailey, 35, a self-reliant Maine native who
escapes a painful past by buying a rustic camp 80 miles from
Ingalik. ``To her, people were like the proverbial albatross; if
she could control the amount of contact she had, life was
bearable.'' No one expects her to survive the first winter, but she
does.
</P>
<P>
   Kash, 48, is the US ambassador, so to speak, a
Dartmouth-educated Ingalik, ``pro-native but a realist,'' who heads
up one of the regional corporations established by Congress in the
'70s to deal with land disputes. He's also the Yukon's most
eligible bachelor.
</P>
<P>
   With the arrival of Kash's first eco-tourists in disguise
(they've really come to pan for gold), he and Bailey become
involved in helping the New Englanders set up camp while keeping at
bay the redneck locals who hate the idea of hosting foreigners in
their wild. Already there was chemistry between Bailey and Kash, so
the reader knows what's in store. Nevertheless, the passion seems
so uncontrived that the romance is a thrill.
</P>
<P>
   The real action starts when Bailey flies her red Cessna to Lake
Hood in Anchorage (``busiest float plane base in the world'') to
pick up Zach and Alpha. The hapless couple brings too much gear to
fit in the small plane, and Bailey later gets roped into delivering
the excess stuff to them at a lodge 5 miles from her cabin.
Meanwhile, human trouble brews in the village and grizzly trouble
waits in the woods.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between Zach, 25, and his mousy girlfriend is
humorous and dark in a ``Thelma &AMP; Louise'' sort of way. Zach is the
one who cooks up the get-rich-quick scheme without comprehending
the many forces (not to mention the law) that would be against
them. Alpha eventually toughens up in reaction to her cocky,
chauvinist boyfriend, and in part thanks to Bailey's literal and
figurative compass. (A subplot involving Bailey's deceased sister
and her possible relation to Alpha is unbelievable and unnecessary.
Kafka should have saved it for another novel.)
</P>
<P>
   What really drives ``True North'' and gives it substance is the
almost constant suspense, whether between man and woman, bear and
human, gold panner and river, or native and white person. Even if
the characters move in predictable directions, there's always the
background of Alaska itself _ remote, grand, and dramatic.

</P>
<P>
   The reality: You'll probably work, even with the pile.

   When Jeremy Weiner, 24, sold his first company for over $1
million last fall, he could have done anything _ traveled, partied,
tried to read Proust on the beach, or just sat. What he did was
start his second company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sat for a day and made no phone calls,'' he says of his
flirtation with leisure. Then he got busy with Schooljam, begun two
months ago in a cramped, no-frills Brighton office suite with a
fellow 1997 Babson graduate, Mike Gleeson. The company, scheduled
for launch in May, will allow consumers to stipulate that a
percentage of what they spend at participating merchants go to a
designated school.
</P>
<P>
   Weiner's first company, Cover-It, provided book covers free to
schools nationwide _ his profit came from companies advertising on
the covers. He was doing $3 million in sales when he sold the
operation to a competitor.
</P>
<P>
   One of his professors advised him to relax after the sale and
``go play pinball.''
</P>
<P>
   ``After the first five quarters,'' Weiner says, ``I called him
and said, `This is really boring.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Hoffstein took the summer off 10 years ago after selling
MicroAmerica Inc., his computer products distribution company in
Marlborough, Mass. He took 18 months off in 1996 after selling his
second successful venture, PC Compleat Inc., a mail-order personal
computer business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great,'' he says of both breaks. ``I read. I played
golf. I played basketball with my boys and spent more time with my
wife. We went to a dude ranch. We went to Steamboat Springs.''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses in his rapid-fire delivery and asks, ``But you know
what made it so great? I knew it would end.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, at age 46, not having to work ever again,
Hoffstein looked around for a start-up to run, and found it in Be
Free Inc., an Internet marketing services provider for online
merchants. The company was formed by brothers Sam and Tom Gerace in
1996. Hoffstein was hired as president and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job was to take the foundation and build the house,'' says
the entrepreneur, who had interviewed with 35 companies before
joining Be Free. He was seeking not only a challenge, but a job no
farther than five miles from his Southborough home so that he could
spend more time with his family. He wanted a start-up because he
likes the excitement of ``being on the edge.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the small team,'' he says. ``I like it when people on
the outside say, `You'll never do that.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Metcalfe _ inventor of Ethernet, the networking magic that
links computers, and founder of 3Com Corp. _ understands. But his
mantra is: Inventor reinvent thyself.
</P>
<P>
   When he left 3Com at age 44 in 1990, he set about not doing what
came naturally. He spent a year as a visiting fellow at the
University of Cambridge, England, and then went into publishing,
becoming a columnist for Info-World magazine and a director and
vice president of technology for International Data Group in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Journalism is dominated by young Luddite Marxists,'' he says.
``It needs an old right-wing engineer. At least one.''
</P>
<P>
   At 53, he is the not-so-old man on the-mountain, the often
contrarian philosopher and self-proclaimed ``technology pundit''
who is working on a book, lecturing, organizing conferences, and
inviting people to ``salons'' in his Beacon Street town house. He
is also spending more time with his two children.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what it's all about,'' says Bruce Male, 58, holding a
photo of him and his 22-year-old son seated in a racing car with
their arms around each other. Male is the founder of TravCorps
Inc., a national nursing placement service in Malden, Mass. After
selling it, he was able to indulge his passion for racing antique
cars. The family grew closer enjoying the hobby together, he said.
Their trips to races in Italy led to the founding of American
International Bakeries in Parma _ because the country didn't have
bagels. Male says being financially independent has allowed him to
put more time in on corporate and charitable boards _ ``give
back,'' he calls it. He is about to market a beauty supply product
and form an Internet company.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it doesn't work,'' Male says, smiling and relishing the
power of serendipty, ``it's OK.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The man's voice-mail message said he just wanted
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``You describe John McCain as `anti-choice.' I assume that you
mean he is against abortion, and not that he is against people
exercising their ability to make choices about any number of
issues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've researched it but can't pin down when and why
pro-abortion people started using `choice' instead of `abortion.'
Do you know?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, here's what I remember.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1973, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that abortion was
included in a woman's constitutional guarantee of privacy, I
probably identified myself as ``pro-abortion.'' Pro and anti were
the only terms used to distinguish between people of opposing
views: Those who believe that a woman should determine what does or
doesn't occur in her own uterus, and those who believe the
government must decide.
</P>
<P>
   Was being pro-abortion like being pro-democracy, pro-Hubert
Humphrey or pro-49ers? Did I consider it a wonderful thing that I
hoped would rise to dominance?
</P>
<P>
   Hardly. Abortion isn't like anything else _ not even capital
punishment or war, two things it is often likened to because, as
some folks see it, ``It's all killing.''
</P>
<P>
   People like me, who acknowledge that abortion has been around as
long as pregnancy has, believe it should be safe and legal. But we
will be happiest when it is unnecessary and therefore extinct.
</P>
<P>
   In the first years after Roe vs. Wade decriminalized women and
the doctors who performed abortions on them, there wasn't much pro
and anti talk. Women whose birth control, calendar keeping or
passion governor failed (or women who were raped by a husband or
stranger) privately went about the sad, heavy business of
terminating their unwanted pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   The first and most ardent suitor of the ultra-conservative
Christian right, President Reagan won that faction's heart by
declaring war on Roe vs. Wade. And for eight years, with every
appointment and veto he made, with every state attorney general he
persuaded to challenge some aspect of legal abortion, he waged a
savage war.
</P>
<P>
   Then he passed the torch to George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   President Bush had only four years, but he didn't waste them.
One of his most impressive moves was to deny millions of dollars to
the United Nations Population Fund because one of its 130 recipient
countries _ China _ mandated abortion for population control.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that this abortion policy hadn't kept Bush from
helping China receive most-favored-nation trading status.
</P>
<P>
   Women's reproductive systems had taken their place alongside the
Strategic Defense Initiative, illegal immigration, universal health
care and the capital gains tax as one more pawn on the big
political chessboard.
</P>
<P>
   By then, it was obvious that abortion was about much more than a
private medical procedure. It was about a powerful minority using
elected officials to enforce its view of morality on an entire
country.
</P>
<P>
   A few days after the man left his voice mail, I put his question
to Kate Michelman, the president of the National Abortion Rights
Action League.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think, throughout this struggle, that we've ever
defined ourselves as `pro-abortion,''' Michelman said. ``It is
those who oppose the right of a woman to choose who have tried to
define us that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Michelman, who has three children, said NARAL's research shows
there are legions of Americans who ``would never choose to have an
abortion, but who do not believe that any government body should
force a woman against her will to get pregnant, stay pregnant or to
have an abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   To be ``pro-choice'' means just that. It is not a
reality-denying, comfy euphemism for advocating ``baby killing,''
as many anti-abortion proponents charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a set of ethics and principles that begins with the value
of a woman's life. And it includes the value that should be but
isn't placed on child bearing in our society,'' Michelman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because we women can conceive and bear children does not
mean we should, no matter our economic, social and psychological
circumstances. Our biological ability to be mothers should not be
the only imperative. The essence of `pro-choice' is respect for all
the complexities of each woman's decision about child bearing.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the years, as Michelman has watched politics strip
away the protections of Roe vs. Wade, she has noticed a theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these restrictions are designed to intimidate and send a
message to women: `You're not capable of deciding your own
reproductive destiny. You're not responsible. We _ Congress, state
legislatures _ need to put limits on you.'
</P>
<P>
   ``In the meanwhile, they've done nothing remotely comparable to
make abortion less necessary. No one has declared war on the
conditions of unintended pregnancy. Imagine what progress we would
make if we focussed as a nation on that instead of abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   I hope this information helps the man who left the voice-mail
message. I should add, though: Yes, I did mean that John McCain,
like George W. Bush, is against abortion. But, as both men have
made clear, that also means they are against some people _ women _
exercising their ability to make a choice about on every important
issue.

SAVING FOR RETIREMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I've just paid off my mortgage, freeing up $700 a month. I'm
debt-free and would like to retire at 62, though 65 seems more
realistic. Where would you suggest I invest? Between my
contributions, the company match, and a profit-sharing plan, 25
percent of my salary goes into my 401(k) plan. Of my $169,405 total
savings, all but about $45,000 is in various tax-advantaged
accounts. I have been considering SSgAs Growth and Income, Fidelity
Blue Chip Growth, and Vanguard Balanced funds. Should I invest in
an overseas fund?
</P>
<P>
   J.P., Shelburne Falls, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, if you add the $700 a month to your savings, and if
annual returns average 8 percent, the pool of money would grow to
$483,564 over seven years and to $697,471 over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Let's suppose current living costs, excluding mortgage expense,
are about $36,000. If inflation is 3.5 percent a year on average
for the next 10 years, you would need to have $45,802 in seven
years and $50,781 in 10 years to buy what $36,000 buys today. You
can combine those figures with whatever you might expect from
Social Security to determine whether retiring at 62 or 65 is
better. My guess is that the bigger pool at age 65, combined with
the higher Social Security benefit you will get if you wait, will
make the latter alternative the most attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, it's nice _ and necessary, I think _ to have
retirement funds that will offset the effects of inflation in the
later years of your retirement.
</P>
<P>
   The stock side of your portfolio has an unusually nice balance,
though I agree an international fund would make it even better. If
you determine that retirement at 65 is more likely, though, you
might want to be a little bolder, perhaps directing less of your
401(k) money to the fixed-income side and/or giving your
supplemental investments a heavier stock/bond tilt.
</P>
<P>
   As for where to put that extra savings, now that you have paid
off your mortgage, a fund such as Fidelity Overseas would be a good
addition. Why not put 25 percent there, another 25 percent in SSgA
Growth and Income, and the rest in Vanguard Balanced Index?
</P>
<P>
   These moves will diversify your portfolio, without dramatically
increasing risk. (But if you want to keep the risk more or less at
the current level, putting all of the supplemental savings in
Vanguard Balanced Index would roughly match the current allocation
between stocks and fixed-income holdings).
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My husband and I have just begun thinking hard about
retirement. He'd like to retire at 55 or 56. By then, our home will
be paid for and we will have no major expenses.
</P>
<P>
   K.H., Orange, Calif. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Just keep plugging away, and _ thanks to that handsome
pension your husband has earned _ you should be pretty comfortable.
Most people calculate they can live satisfactorily in retirement on
about two thirds of the income they required while they were
working, for a number of reasons: the end of work-related expenses,
having time to do minor chores that might have been paid for
before, the fact that the savings period is over for most people,
and in your case, the end of mortgage payments.
</P>
<P>
   You might need about $40,000 a year in retirement. Five years
from now, your current savings of $147,000 would grow to $248,519
if you continue your current contributions and if you achieve
average market returns of 8 percent; the figure would be $286,456
if you wanted until age 56. Your fixed-income investments _ half of
the 401(k) balance, plus the CDs and money market account _ will
prove more than adequate to supply the supplemental income stream;
you could leave the balance of your savings in stock funds such as
those you now hold, to protect you against long-term inflation.
</P>
<P>
   You should be particularly comfortable because at just about the
time inflation might begin to really bite _ after you've been
retired for six or seven years _ Social Security benefits will kick
in. (If inflation averages 3.5 percent for 12 years, you would need
$60,442 to buy what $40,000 buys now.)
</P>
<P>
   All things considered, you will be in good shape whether you
decide to retire at 55, 56, or later, with the situation steadily
getting even better if retirement is deferred.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I was born in October 1928, and I want to start IRA
withdrawals this year, but not with an automatic scheduled amount.
I have IRA accounts with three companies. I would like to retain
the option to take the required withdrawal from whichever of the
three accounts I choose. I've had no luck obtaining a life
expectancy table. Can you point me in the right direction?
</P>
<P>
   W.M., South Pasadena, Calif. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It's a good thing you want to take your first IRA withdrawals
this year _ because you have to. The first withdrawal must be made
by April 1 of the year following the year in which you reach age 70
1/2, which in your case is about seven weeks from now.
</P>
<P>
   The rule for withdrawals when you have multiple IRA accounts is
that you simply add up the balances of all of the accounts,
determine the amount that must be withdrawn, and then take the
money from the account or accounts you prefer.
</P>
<P>
   Ask the IRS for its Joint and Last Survivor Life Expectancy
tables, in Publication 590 (available free) or find it in
publications such as J. K. Lasser's ``Your Income Tax 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Money Musings: When this column was written, in the middle of
last week, a lot of people were watching the stock market with
horror, calculating its effect on their portfolios. That's
understandable, particularly if you have speculative investments.
But it also the climate to which people who have established a
steady investment pattern must steel themselves. Even if you
contribute only $166 a month to an IRA, the thing to remember is
that you are basically involved in a dollar-cost-averaging program.
</P>
<P>
   Resist the temptation to hold off sending this month's IRA
contribution a little late, thinking you might buy more shares if
the market wobbles more. Resist even more strongly the temptation
to skip this one entirely and double up next month. The markets
might not wobble; you'd then have lost the opportunity to buy
relatively cheap shares during the dip.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, dollar-cost averaging is a discipline, and the trick
in markets like these is to bite your lip and write the check. It
will pay well over the long haul.
</P>

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   ``Your grandmother loved all the Guerlain perfumes _ Shalimar,
Jicky. But I could never wear Jicky _ it just didn't go with my
skin.''
</P>
<P>
   My mother is telling perfume stories over the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``One time your father and I went into the Guerlain shop in
Paris, and I tried on some Jicky. The girl had to take me back to
the employee washroom and scrub it off with strong soap. She wasn't
going to let me leave Guerlain smelling like that.''
</P>
<P>
   One perfume is much like another _ or so I used to think. Each
of the many odor receptors high in our nostrils can, in principle,
trigger thousands of different nerve-signal patterns that our brain
interprets as distinct smells.
</P>
<P>
   But we don't all make the same use of that equipment. In fact,
many of us have noses that are just face furniture _ which is a
shame, because we're living through a fragrance revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Our olfactory environment has been radically altered by
synthetic substances emerging from the labs of organic chemists.
Some of them are noxious, but the ones in perfumes are often
beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime after her set-to with Jicky, my mother settled into a
long relationship with Lanvin's Arpege. She chose the perfume with
the perfect name. A pretty scent is like a melody _ an arpeggio of
chemical notes, each one a compound of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen
atoms strung together in a ring, a chain or a combination of the
two.
</P>
<P>
   There are dozens or hundreds of ingredients in a perfume, but
they evaporate on the skin and waft into the nose in three distinct
stages, or ``notes,'' called top, middle and base, depending on how
big and volatile their molecules are.
</P>
<P>
   Top notes are flighty molecules that come off within minutes and
then vanish _ citrus-peel molecules like bergamot, for instance.
Base notes may linger for a day or more. In the old days _ before
prices skyrocketed and customers revolted against the practice _
the base was often made from animal secretions such as musk (with
which the Tibetan musk deer marks its territory) or ambergris (a
kind of sperm-whale excretion).
</P>
<P>
   In between top and base lies the heart of the perfume, which
drifts off the wearer for hours and is often a harmony of floral
scents.
</P>
<P>
   When Arpege was released in 1927, it helped consolidate a
revolution that had been launched a few years earlier by Chanel No.
5. Both perfumes contain traditional essences of jasmine and rose.
But both rely for their impact on straight-chain carbon molecules
called aldehydes that have no equivalent in nature-pure laboratory
creations.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Arpege, you have a floral bouquet,'' says Elisabeth Carre,
a chemist at L'Oreal, the French cosmetics giant that now owns
Lanvin. ``But it's thrown into a radically different light by the
massive addition of aldehydes, which make the floral notes fresher
and more brilliant.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then perfume creation has been a partnership of artist and
chemist. And the artists, who can remember a thousand smells and
compose new scents in their heads, do not resent the intrusion of
science.
</P>
<P>
   ``A century ago perfumers had 20 or 30 synthetic products to
work with,'' says Olivier Cresp, a perfumer at Firmenich, a Swiss
fragrance company. ``Today we have 3,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with so many odor molecules on their palette, companies
like Firmenich are under pressure to find new ones. But the
chemists face a fundamental problem: No one knows why things smell
the way they do. No one knows what happens when an odor molecule
meets a receptor in the nose. Thus you can't design a new odor from
first principles.
</P>
<P>
   What you can fall back on are empirical rules of thumb. If
you're looking for a new fruity note, for instance, it's a good bet
to start with an ester, an odorous compound common in fruits that
forms when an alcohol reacts with a carboxylic acid.
</P>
<P>
   What if a perfumer is looking for a molecule that will evoke,
say, jasmine and the sea, perhaps for a perfume targeted at young
women who are in touch with their femininity and nevertheless show
a self-confident, adventurous spirit?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, what you want for a jasmine smell, roughly, is a
molecule with a central carbon atom that's surrounded by three
different things: a highly polar group, a weakly polar group and a
long chain of carbon atoms,'' says Charles Sell, head of organic
chemistry at Quest International, another fragrance firm. (A polar
group has a slightly positive charge at one end of its molecular
bond and a slightly negative charge at the other.)
</P>
<P>
   Nitriles _ molecules that contain a nitrogen atom triple-bonded
to a carbon _ are compounds that sometimes smell of algae. If you
were to stick a nitrile into the polar slot of your jasmine
template, Sell says, you just might get a scent of
jasmine-by-the-sea.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, fragrance chemists can also leave the lab to seek
novelty in nature. That's the specialty of Roman Kaiser of Givaudan
Roure in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   More than 25 years ago Kaiser helped pioneer headspace
technology, in which a glass dome is placed over a flower or other
odor source to capture all the volatile molecules the chemist's
nose would capture if his head were in that space. The chemist can
then synthesize the molecules and try to reconstitute the live
scent.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser's passion is capturing scents in the wild. He has trapped
and later reconstituted the smell of carnations wafting off an
island near Brittany. A few years ago he even nosed around above a
tropical rain forest in a hot-air balloon.
</P>
<P>
   ``On one of our first flights from the camp in French Guiana,''
Kaiser recalls, ``we saw a tree that was covered in white blossoms.
When we got closer, it turned out to be a vine that was blooming,
not the tree itself. The smell reminded me right away of vanilla
ice cream with hot raspberry sauce.''
</P>
<P>
   The tasty smell of that vine, reconstituted in his lab, has
since become a component of a new line of women's shower gels and
shampoos.
</P>
<P>
   Food smells are popular these days. Cresp helped start that rage
a few years ago with Angel, a perfume that smells of chocolate and
roasted almonds. Apparently, food smells remind many perfume buyers
of their childhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I'd never felt a bond to any smell, edible or not _
until I visited the offices of L'Oreal, and Elisabeth Carre gave me
a whiff of Arpege. It was an odd and even troubling experience:
Suddenly, I felt the presence of my mother.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was the aldehydes or the fruity undecalactone. Or maybe
it was the rose notes rising from the heart. &QL;

   Restless? Hungry for adventure? Follow me on a thrilling journey
of discovery to the inner reaches of ... your mouth. There we shall
hunt the elusive taste receptor, and we'll investigate rumors that
these highly specialized nerve cells, which transmit chemical
information to the brain, show up in greater numbers and densities
in some mouths.
</P>
<P>
   For the expedition, you'll need a few friends, a flashlight, a
magnifying glass, a vial of blue food coloring and some cotton
swabs. Also, bring salt, sugar, instant coffee powder, lemon and
plenty of fresh water.
</P>
<P>
   Now, on to the experiments.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EXPERIMENT 1 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Early explorers found taste receptors more populous in some
regions of the tongue than in others. To confirm this, wet the end
of a swab, roll it in a pile of salt and probe the tip, center,
sides and the very back of the tongue, rinsing between touches.
</P>
<P>
   The intensity of taste, which is roughly proportional to the
number of receptors, will vary considerably depending on the spot.
The front of your tongue should register a far greater reaction
than the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with a new dab of salt on the swab, probe the back of your
palate and around the inside of your mouth. You should discover
taste receptors dwelling on the roof of your mouth. They're in the
esophagus too. (But don't venture there. That territory is
patrolled by the gag reflex.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EXPERIMENT 2 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sprinkle a few drops of blue food coloring onto your tongue.
Gently rub in the color with a clean swab, and inspect the results
in the mirror using the flashlight and magnifying glass. Your
should see pale, mushroomlike structures called fungiform papillae
_ home to your taste buds _ floating in a sea of blue. These little
bumps each contain hundreds of taste-receptor cells.
</P>
<P>
   Compare the numbers of papillae at the tip of your tongue with
those in the middle. Now make your friends paint their tongues blue
and compare papillae densities. About 25 percent of us qualify as
superstars because our tongues are tightly packed with taste buds.
Another 25 percent are nontasters, with fewer and more sparsely
distributed papillae. The rest of us fall in between.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EXPERIMENT 3 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the last century, explorers thought different regions of the
tongue were territories of specific flavor receptors: The tip of
the tongue, for example, should taste sweet more intensely. But
recent forays into the mouth reveal that, although individual cells
are most excited by just one of the four tastes (salt, sweet,
bitter or sour), those cells don't congregate in particular areas.
</P>
<P>
   See this for yourself: Coat a fresh, wet swab with salt, and
gently touch your tongue in different areas, recording where your
taste seems strongest. Then, gargle with water to thoroughly
cleanse your palate, use a swab coated with sugar on the same
spots, and record those results. Gargle again, and then swab with
lemon juice. After a final gargle, try coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Compare your reactions with your friends'. Your taste pattern
may reveal more than just gustatory preferences. Recent studies
suggest links between taster status and behavioral disorders. For
example, nontasters tend to have a higher incidence of alcoholism,
perhaps because liquor seems less bitter to them.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, supertasters may avoid nutritious but mildly bitter
foods such as broccoli, thus depriving themselves of a balanced
diet. With a magnifying glass in hand and a blue tongue, explore
your mouth and seek your destiny. &QL;

<P>
   ``Your grandmother loved all the Guerlain perfumes _ Shalimar,
Jicky. But I could never wear Jicky _ it just didn't go with my
skin.''
</P>
<P>
   My mother is telling perfume stories over the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``One time your father and I went into the Guerlain shop in
Paris, and I tried on some Jicky. The girl had to take me back to
the employee washroom and scrub it off with strong soap. She wasn't
going to let me leave Guerlain smelling like that.''
</P>
<P>
   One perfume is much like another _ or so I used to think. Each
of the many odor receptors high in our nostrils can, in principle,
trigger thousands of different nerve-signal patterns that our brain
interprets as distinct smells.
</P>
<P>
   But we don't all make the same use of that equipment. In fact,
many of us have noses that are just face furniture _ which is a
shame, because we're living through a fragrance revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Our olfactory environment has been radically altered by
synthetic substances emerging from the labs of organic chemists.
Some of them are noxious, but the ones in perfumes are often
beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime after her set-to with Jicky, my mother settled into a
long relationship with Lanvin's Arpege. She chose the perfume with
the perfect name. A pretty scent is like a melody _ an arpeggio of
chemical notes, each one a compound of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen
atoms strung together in a ring, a chain or a combination of the
two.
</P>
<P>
   There are dozens or hundreds of ingredients in a perfume, but
they evaporate on the skin and waft into the nose in three distinct
stages, or ``notes,'' called top, middle and base, depending on how
big and volatile their molecules are.
</P>
<P>
   Top notes are flighty molecules that come off within minutes and
then vanish _ citrus-peel molecules like bergamot, for instance.
Base notes may linger for a day or more. In the old days _ before
prices skyrocketed and customers revolted against the practice _
the base was often made from animal secretions such as musk (with
which the Tibetan musk deer marks its territory) or ambergris (a
kind of sperm-whale excretion).
</P>
<P>
   In between top and base lies the heart of the perfume, which
drifts off the wearer for hours and is often a harmony of floral
scents.
</P>
<P>
   When Arpege was released in 1927, it helped consolidate a
revolution that had been launched a few years earlier by Chanel No.
5. Both perfumes contain traditional essences of jasmine and rose.
But both rely for their impact on straight-chain carbon molecules
called aldehydes that have no equivalent in nature-pure laboratory
creations.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Arpege, you have a floral bouquet,'' says Elisabeth Carre,
a chemist at L'Oreal, the French cosmetics giant that now owns
Lanvin. ``But it's thrown into a radically different light by the
massive addition of aldehydes, which make the floral notes fresher
and more brilliant.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then perfume creation has been a partnership of artist and
chemist. And the artists, who can remember a thousand smells and
compose new scents in their heads, do not resent the intrusion of
science.
</P>
<P>
   ``A century ago perfumers had 20 or 30 synthetic products to
work with,'' says Olivier Cresp, a perfumer at Firmenich, a Swiss
fragrance company. ``Today we have 3,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with so many odor molecules on their palette, companies
like Firmenich are under pressure to find new ones. But the
chemists face a fundamental problem: No one knows why things smell
the way they do. No one knows what happens when an odor molecule
meets a receptor in the nose. Thus you can't design a new odor from
first principles.
</P>
<P>
   What you can fall back on are empirical rules of thumb. If
you're looking for a new fruity note, for instance, it's a good bet
to start with an ester, an odorous compound common in fruits that
forms when an alcohol reacts with a carboxylic acid.
</P>
<P>
   What if a perfumer is looking for a molecule that will evoke,
say, jasmine and the sea, perhaps for a perfume targeted at young
women who are in touch with their femininity and nevertheless show
a self-confident, adventurous spirit?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, what you want for a jasmine smell, roughly, is a
molecule with a central carbon atom that's surrounded by three
different things: a highly polar group, a weakly polar group and a
long chain of carbon atoms,'' says Charles Sell, head of organic
chemistry at Quest International, another fragrance firm. (A polar
group has a slightly positive charge at one end of its molecular
bond and a slightly negative charge at the other.)
</P>
<P>
   Nitriles _ molecules that contain a nitrogen atom triple-bonded
to a carbon _ are compounds that sometimes smell of algae. If you
were to stick a nitrile into the polar slot of your jasmine
template, Sell says, you just might get a scent of
jasmine-by-the-sea.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, fragrance chemists can also leave the lab to seek
novelty in nature. That's the specialty of Roman Kaiser of Givaudan
Roure in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   More than 25 years ago Kaiser helped pioneer headspace
technology, in which a glass dome is placed over a flower or other
odor source to capture all the volatile molecules the chemist's
nose would capture if his head were in that space. The chemist can
then synthesize the molecules and try to reconstitute the live
scent.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser's passion is capturing scents in the wild. He has trapped
and later reconstituted the smell of carnations wafting off an
island near Brittany. A few years ago he even nosed around above a
tropical rain forest in a hot-air balloon.
</P>
<P>
   ``On one of our first flights from the camp in French Guiana,''
Kaiser recalls, ``we saw a tree that was covered in white blossoms.
When we got closer, it turned out to be a vine that was blooming,
not the tree itself. The smell reminded me right away of vanilla
ice cream with hot raspberry sauce.''
</P>
<P>
   The tasty smell of that vine, reconstituted in his lab, has
since become a component of a new line of women's shower gels and
shampoos.
</P>
<P>
   Food smells are popular these days. Cresp helped start that rage
a few years ago with Angel, a perfume that smells of chocolate and
roasted almonds. Apparently, food smells remind many perfume buyers
of their childhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I'd never felt a bond to any smell, edible or not _
until I visited the offices of L'Oreal, and Elisabeth Carre gave me
a whiff of Arpege. It was an odd and even troubling experience:
Suddenly, I felt the presence of my mother.

it was the rose notes rising from the heart. &QL;

chemists face a fundamental problem: No one knows why things smell
the way they do. No one knows what happens when an odor molecule
meets a receptor in the nose. Thus you can't design a new odor from
first principles.
</P>
<P>
   What you can fall back on are empirical rules of thumb. If
you're looking for a new fruity note, for instance, it's a good bet
to start with an ester, an odorous compound common in fruits that
forms when an alcohol reacts with a carboxylic acid.
</P>
<P>
   What if a perfumer is looking for a molecule that will evoke,
say, jasmine and the sea, perhaps for a perfume targeted at young
women who are in touch with their femininity and nevertheless show
a self-confident, adventurous spirit?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, what you want for a jasmine smell, roughly, is a
molecule with a central carbon atom that's surrounded by three
different things: a highly polar group, a weakly polar group and a
long chain of carbon atoms,'' says Charles Sell, head of organic
chemistry at Quest International, another fragrance firm. (A polar
group has a slightly positive charge at one end of its molecular
bond and a slightly negative charge at the other.)
</P>
<P>
   Nitriles _ molecules that contain a nitrogen atom triple-bonded
to a carbon _ are compounds that sometimes smell of algae. If you
were to stick a nitrile into the polar slot of your jasmine
template, Sell says, you just might get a scent of
jasmine-by-the-sea.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, fragrance chemists can also leave the lab to seek
novelty in nature. That's the specialty of Roman Kaiser of Givaudan
Roure in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   More than 25 years ago Kaiser helped pioneer headspace
technology, in which a glass dome is placed over a flower or other
odor source to capture all the volatile molecules the chemist's
nose would capture if his head were in that space. The chemist can
then synthesize the molecules and try to reconstitute the live
scent.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser's passion is capturing scents in the wild. He has trapped
and later reconstituted the smell of carnations wafting off an
island near Brittany. A few years ago he even nosed around above a
tropical rain forest in a hot-air balloon.
</P>
<P>
   ``On one of our first flights from the camp in French Guiana,''
Kaiser recalls, ``we saw a tree that was covered in white blossoms.
When we got closer, it turned out to be a vine that was blooming,
not the tree itself. The smell reminded me right away of vanilla
ice cream with hot raspberry sauce.''
</P>
<P>
   The tasty smell of that vine, reconstituted in his lab, has
since become a component of a new line of women's shower gels and
shampoos.
</P>
<P>
   Food smells are popular these days. Cresp helped start that rage
a few years ago with Angel, a perfume that smells of chocolate and
roasted almonds. Apparently, food smells remind many perfume buyers
of their childhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I'd never felt a bond to any smell, edible or not _
until I visited the offices of L'Oreal, and Elisabeth Carre gave me
a whiff of Arpege. It was an odd and even troubling experience:
Suddenly, I felt the presence of my mother.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was the aldehydes or the fruity undecalactone. Or maybe
it was the rose notes rising from the heart. &QL;

   Restless? Hungry for adventure? Follow me on a thrilling journey
of discovery to the inner reaches of ... your mouth. There we shall
hunt the elusive taste receptor, and we'll investigate rumors that
these highly specialized nerve cells, which transmit chemical
information to the brain, show up in greater numbers and densities
in some mouths.
</P>
<P>
   For the expedition, you'll need a few friends, a flashlight, a
magnifying glass, a vial of blue food coloring and some cotton
swabs. Also, bring salt, sugar, instant coffee powder, lemon and
plenty of fresh water.
</P>
<P>
   Now, on to the experiments.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EXPERIMENT 1 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Early explorers found taste receptors more populous in some
regions of the tongue than in others. To confirm this, wet the end
of a swab, roll it in a pile of salt and probe the tip, center,
sides and the very back of the tongue, rinsing between touches.
</P>
<P>
   The intensity of taste, which is roughly proportional to the
number of receptors, will vary considerably depending on the spot.
The front of your tongue should register a far greater reaction
than the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with a new dab of salt on the swab, probe the back of your
palate and around the inside of your mouth. You should discover
taste receptors dwelling on the roof of your mouth. They're in the
esophagus too. (But don't venture there. That territory is
patrolled by the gag reflex.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EXPERIMENT 2 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sprinkle a few drops of blue food coloring onto your tongue.
Gently rub in the color with a clean swab, and inspect the results
in the mirror using the flashlight and magnifying glass. Your
should see pale, mushroomlike structures called fungiform papillae
_ home to your taste buds _ floating in a sea of blue. These little
bumps each contain hundreds of taste-receptor cells.
</P>
<P>
   Compare the numbers of papillae at the tip of your tongue with
those in the middle. Now make your friends paint their tongues blue
and compare papillae densities. About 25 percent of us qualify as
superstars because our tongues are tightly packed with taste buds.
Another 25 percent are nontasters, with fewer and more sparsely
distributed papillae. The rest of us fall in between.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EXPERIMENT 3 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the last century, explorers thought different regions of the
tongue were territories of specific flavor receptors: The tip of
the tongue, for example, should taste sweet more intensely. But
recent forays into the mouth reveal that, although individual cells
are most excited by just one of the four tastes (salt, sweet,
bitter or sour), those cells don't congregate in particular areas.
</P>
<P>
   See this for yourself: Coat a fresh, wet swab with salt, and
gently touch your tongue in different areas, recording where your
taste seems strongest. Then, gargle with water to thoroughly
cleanse your palate, use a swab coated with sugar on the same
spots, and record those results. Gargle again, and then swab with
lemon juice. After a final gargle, try coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Compare your reactions with your friends'. Your taste pattern
may reveal more than just gustatory preferences. Recent studies
suggest links between taster status and behavioral disorders. For
example, nontasters tend to have a higher incidence of alcoholism,
perhaps because liquor seems less bitter to them.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, supertasters may avoid nutritious but mildly bitter
foods such as broccoli, thus depriving themselves of a balanced
diet. With a magnifying glass in hand and a blue tongue, explore
your mouth and seek your destiny. &QL;

   NEW RELEASES: ``Outside Providence'' _ Director Michael Corrente
is doing for Providence what Barry Levinson did for Baltimore.
While this well-done film garnered the lion's share of its
publicity because Alec Baldwin gained a few pounds, it's better
than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Architecture of Doom'' (DVD) _ This is one of the best
documentaries to come along in a while. The merging of art,
politics, and murder under the Nazis is tragically and compellingly
detailed in this gripping story of how racism and intolerance were
manifest in the Hitler-ordered architecture of the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scooby-Doo Meets the Boo Brothers'' _ There are some great
cartoon characters, such as Daffy Duck and Bullwinkle J. Moose, but
I don't get Scooby-Doo. But he's very popular. I must admit I hit
the fast-forward button on this DVD, but I presume Scooby fans will
scoot right out for this one.

WHO WANTS TO BE THE NEXT KATHIE LEE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One day soon a plume of white smoke will issue forth from the
corporate production offices of ``Live! With Regis and Kathie Lee''
indicating that Kathie Lee Gifford's successor has been named.
</P>
<P>
   Who will it be? Joy Philbin? Joan Lunden? Hillary Rodham
Clinton? Susan Sontag? Miss Piggy? The late Totie Fields?
</P>
<P>
   To millions of viewers it doesn't matter who will be sitting
there nattering with Regis. If it's not Kathie Lee, who cares?
</P>
<P>
   She could change her mind. Her fans are begging her to stay.
Please don't go, Kathie Lee. What will we do without you?
</P>
<P>
   Not that we'll ever really be free of Kathie Lee. The woman is
everywhere, what with her signature clothing, home furnishings, and
skin-care lines, her CDs, her books, her TV movie with little Cody,
her singing dates on and off Broadway, her job plugging Carnival
Cruise Lines, her charities. I could go on and on, but we have
limited space.
</P>
<P>
   Kathie Lee is quitting ``Live!'' when her $6 million contract
expires in August. Cynics have suggested that she's leaving because
she's envious of Regis Philbin, now the hottest thing on the box as
host of ``Who Wants to be a Millionaire'' This is nonsense, of
course. In fact, Kathie Lee is very concerned about the toll the
game show is taking on her co-host's health. ``I worry because I
love him,'' she told People magazine. ``He's tired.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathie Lee is tired, too, not physically tired, but bored.
Kathie Lee has ennui. She confided to People that the job has
ceased to amuse her: ``About a year ago I was interviewing Lily
Tomlin for probably the 10th time and thinking, I don't want to do
this one more time.''
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear how Lily Tomlin felt about being interviewed by
Kathie Lee for the 10th time, but I'm sure it must have been just
as thrilling for her as it was on the very first occasion. After
all, Tomlin is merely a run-of-the-mill comic genius whereas Kathie
Lee is Kathie Lee. There's no comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Kathie Lee hopes quitting ``Live!'' will preserve her children's
privacy. To some, this may sound hypocritical coming from a woman
who, day after day, has shared the most intimate details of her
childrens' lives with millions of viewers. But Kathie Lee's critics
fail to understand how fiercely protective she is of her children,
even as she thrusts them into the limelight. The last straw came
when one tabloid characterized adorable little Cody as ``a
monster.'' Imagine. Kathie Lee is suing. Who can blame her?
</P>
<P>
   The media, particularly the tabloids, have made life difficult
for the Gifford family. We remember the low point, when the tabloid
Globe (not this Globe, thank you) paid a woman to lure Frank
Gifford to a hotel room. Their tryst was secretly taped and
subsequently splashed all over the tabloid's pages. It was a
scurrilous episode. Everyone involved should be ashamed of
themselves, everyone except Kathie Lee, who was blameless. She
thought she had the perfect marriage. Hadn't she said so many times
on ``Live!''?
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the Giffords were able to work through their pain
and now their marriage is better than ever, according to Kathie
Lee. ``We stayed at home, we stayed in the word of God, we stayed
in bed,'' she told People.
</P>
<P>
   Is it any wonder she's America's self-appointed sweetheart, the
idol of millions? Maybe she could host her own game show, ``Who
Wants to Be Kathie Lee?'' Because who wouldn't want to be Kathie
Lee?

BALANCNG DEATH AND BEAUTY

EVERYTHING IN THIS COUNTRY MUST 
A Novella and Two Stories 
By Colum McCann. Henry Holt. 
150 pp. $21. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Much talk has been made in recent years of an Irish renaissance
in fiction; the usual writers who emerge in such conversations are
masters of dark wit, particularly Roddy Doyle and Patrick McCabe.
But none seems to me so finely imbued with the lyrical melancholy
of the old masters _ of Joyce and Yeats and, later, William Trevor
_ as Colum McCann. As with the sensibility of his forebears, his
fiction is equal parts death and beauty, its inescapable realism
uplifted by an exquisitely soulful and visual prose. His last
novel, ``This Side of Brightness,'' rendered the story of a man
living in the subway tunnels of New York _ a sovereign, secret home
where his ``cartography of darkness'' helped him chart his bearings
in the world. The small but piercing ``Everything in This Country
Must'' possesses a similar tribute to the power of place _ as both
anchor and chain, as the homeland that defines you and as the heavy
yoke that must be shed.
</P>
<P>
   McCann lives in New York, where he learned firsthand about the
residents of the subway tunnels; authenticity is all over his
fiction, but it's seamless enough that you scarcely notice its
stamp. The two stories and novella of ``Everything in This Country
Must'' are set in his native Ireland _ in Galway, in Derry, in the
stony rural countryside where political allegiances are as quiet
and essential as breath. The impact of these three tales lies in
their sweet specificity: in a girl watching her father suffer, then
enact, the agonies of Northern Ireland; in a son trying to save his
father by betraying him; in a boy on the verge of adulthood _ he is
only 13 _ torn between rage and desire.
</P>
<P>
   And yet tragedy is general all over Ireland. The newspapers tell
the stories: A soldier shoots an old woman whose umbrella he
mistakes for a rifle; a rubber bullet strikes a little girl on her
way home with milk. A Roman Catholic farmer finds his herd of
cattle with their throats slit, their carcasses arranged to form
the word ``NO.'' These sorrows may belong to strangers, but it
doesn't matter: They indicate the relentless atmosphere of random
grief that infects these characters and the country they love and
hate in equal measure. Often the death foretold appears as a mere
shadow of suggestion, but it still feels imminent as rain. In the
title story, a girl tries to help her father rescue his favorite
horse from drowning, but her efforts are hardly aided by hope: ``I
was wearing Stevie's jacket but I was shivering and wet and cold
and scared because Stevie and the draft horse were going to die
since everything in this country must.''
</P>
<P>
   The voice of the title story has about it a Faulknerian
gloominess, much like that of Benjy's narration in ``The Sound and
the Fury'': It's the innocent perspective of children, delivered
with the unstoppable poetry of doom. In ``Wood,'' the youngest son
of a man felled by a stroke has to work at night with his mother to
hide their labors from the father: They are making flagpoles for a
Protestant march, and they need the money. Both these stories are
spare etchings of emotion and history; McCann's more elaborate
canvas is reserved for his novella, ``Hunger Strike,'' in which the
nephew of a political prisoner in Derry keeps vigil from afar while
his uncle slowly starves to death.
</P>
<P>
   Crucial to the force of McCann's fiction is the manner in which
his plots are rendered by his crystalline use of symbols: a bird
trapped in an icy river; a man dying or flourishing underground;
the loyal boy of ``Hunger Strike,'' refusing, too, to eat, shaping
his dinner bread into lumpy chess pieces and then learning how to
use his knight. Kevin has fled Derry with his widowed mother for
County Galway; they wait there for news of the imprisoned uncle,
whose weight drops a pound or two with each telephoned report. We
learn these statistics as Kevin does, and they take on the cold
rhythms of a titrated obituary _ ``It'll be today or tomorrow,''
his ma tells him; then, later, ``Today or tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin's walks on the beach are driven by a child's fury, aimless
and too young and thus ill-spent, and the imagery surrounding them
is cruel: The God who has failed him is a ``sly and complicated
bastard''; a stone wall jetty runs ``like a bad suture towards the
sea.'' But while Kevin's internal odyssey is defined by his uncle's
lethal protest, it is the larger, kinder choreography of the story
that makes ``Hunger Strike'' memorable. An old man in a kayak
caught Kevin's eye when he arrived in Galway; the boy's rage and
frustration could easily take aim at such a vulnerable target.
Instead he seeks out the man, who offers both succor and
instruction _ who has his own scars, it turns out, and his own ways
of forgetting. This careful dance is one of violence eclipsed by
grace, and its redemptive presence makes Kevin's education
bearable: ``Darkness doesn't fall,'' he thinks, ``it rises up out
of the bottom of the sea and begins to breathe around us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything in This Country Must'' has one real limitation, and
the burden for that must go to McCann's publisher as well as to
him. It's absurdly short, a work that might, had it been printed
with normal margins, constitute half a collection. It was not so
long ago that publishers restrained themselves from charging ahead
with a book until the entire book, in fact, existed; nowadays,
though, the fashion is to slam into hardback any text over 80
pages. At $20 a pop for a new hardcover, this trend seems as greedy
as it is precipitate. I would go out of my way to read Colum McCann
regardless of the packaging, but I suspect most readers would
prefer to do so without having to grumble about publishing's
miserly fare.

<P>
   !! 1/2 ``Mission to Mars'' Brian De Palma's big-budget throwback
to the innocent, campy sci-fi of the 1950s. More shipshape than
trail-blazing, its plainness helps nudge it into guilty-pleasure
territory as it tracks a rescue mission after all but one crew
member of the first mission is mysteriously wiped out. Tim Robbins,
Gary Sinise, Don Cheadle, and impressive Red Planet visuals are the
stars. (PG-13) &QL; 
 &QL; 
(FR) ! ``The Ninth Gate'' Johnny Depp seems flat and muffled as a
book-finder hired to locate a volume in which Lucifer is said to
have had a hand. Roman Polanski's ponderous, self-immolatingly
campy supernatural thriller is not super, not natural, not
thrilling. (R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!!! ``Not One Less'' Simple but enticing movie from Zhang Yimou. A
13-year-old girl pressed into service as a substitute teacher in a
remote Chinese village proves her mettle when she goes to the big
city to bring a young dropout home. Zhang had to conceal his camera
to keep his nonprofessionals loose and spontaneous. It works. (G)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
!! 1/2 ``Orphans'' Peter Mullan delivers a vigorously unruly
ensemble piece. Four adult siblings in Glasgow pass a stormy night
grieving, in their fashion, for their dead mother, whose funeral is
to be held the next morning. Some episodes take off, some spin
their wheels, but the film makes a strong debut for writer-director
Mullan. (Unrated)

   LOS ANGELES _ Mark Romanek, one of the last decade's most
prolific music video directors, is sitting in an overstuffed chair
in the lobby of the Chateau Marmont, thumbing through the images in
his new book, ``Mark Romanek: Music Video Stills.''
</P>
<P>
   As if on cue, in from the sun-streaked garden steps REM's
Michael Stipe, the flesh-and-blood embodiment of the image on page
115. The director and the pop icon hug warmly _ they're clearly
friends _ and Stipe says, ``I heard the book was great,'' as he
lands on a close-up of his shaved head.
</P>
<P>
   It's the sort of Hollywood moment with which Romanek is all too
familiar, having created a vast and elegant portrait gallery _ in
videos and now in stills _ of MTV luminaries.
</P>
<P>
   There's Madonna, shivering in blue in ``Rain'' and haloed by a
sunflower in ``Bedtime Stories''; Janet and Michael Jackson coming
unglued in ``Scream''; Lenny Kravitz in the cool and sanitized
world of ``If You Can't Say No''; and a starkly sexual Fiona Apple
in ``Criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an enviable client list: Beck, Sonic Youth, Iggy Pop, En
Vogue, David Bowie, Nine Inch Nails and k.d. lang have all turned
up in Romanek's studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very lucky because I knew when I was very young what I
wanted to do,'' Romanek explains. ``To be a film director. And I
went to a school that helped me know what that was.''
</P>
<P>
   Romanek attended a progressive high school in Winnetka, Ill.,
where many of his teachers were graduates of the School of the Art
Institute of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``And here they were, showing us Kenneth Anger films and God
knows what. I doubt the powers that were knew what was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   The edgy sensibility Romanek cultivated there still informs his
video work _ and can be felt in the stills that populate his new
book.
</P>
<P>
   Now Romanek says he's ready for the broader arena of feature
films. He's been spinning around the idea of a silent picture and
has spent several years writing a screenplay about photographer
Diane Arbus.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to know what's so fantastic about her?'' he asks.
``Do you have a full day?''
</P>
<P>
   While Romanek presses in new directions, the book documents his
contribution to the advancement of the genre he knows best. In the
last half-decade, traditional wiggle-the-butt music videos have
given way _ with the support of artists like Madonna _ to more
thoughtful and often highly inventive video making.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked Madonna to cut off her hair for the `Rain' video, and
she agreed,'' Romanek recalls. ``But that morning, she chickened
out. She said, `Mark, but that's a big deal.' And I said, `I
know.'''
</P>
<P>
   So they arrived at a compromise _ and Madonna was fitted with a
short, black wig that drove her nuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was scratching her all day, and in the last shot I told
her, `Wait, we need another take!' She just pulled the wig off and
threw it at me. I think it was her way of saying, `That's a
wrap.''' &QL;

PRIVACY ISSUE LIKELY TO BECOME HOTTER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JIM BARLOW 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mass production is dying. We're entering the era of mass
customization. No more one-size-fits-all products. Each must be
tailored to fit the needs and desires of the individual customer.
</P>
<P>
   Business must learn all about its customers for mass
customization to work. At the same time, business must respect
customers' privacy. It is being warned about gathering too much
information when building profiles of customers.
</P>
<P>
   Well, business can't do it both ways. Consumers who want
products tailored to their individual needs can't expect business
to do that without learning a lot about them.
</P>
<P>
   All of us surrender a lot of our privacy by entering the
marketplace. If you've ever bought a house, you know how much the
lender learns about you before a decision about granting a loan is
made.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the most intrusive forms I've ever seen are the ones
that must be filled out to obtain a state alcoholic beverage
license or a license to operate a radio or television station.
</P>
<P>
   However, most people would be amazed at how much information
about us is available in either public records or semiprivate ones
such as those maintained by a credit bureau.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
DOUBLECLICK BACKS OFF _ FOR NOW &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here in the United States, we're still much more open about
business use of personal data. In Europe the laws are much more
restrictive.
</P>
<P>
   We could adopt those laws and give all of us a much greater
degree of privacy. However, it would come at a price.
</P>
<P>
   Take the current poster child of those who worry about privacy _
an Internet company called DoubleClick. Critics jumped all over its
program to match consumers' names with the sites those people
visited on the Internet. DoubleClick wanted to sell that
information to marketers, who would try and sell those consumers
products based on their Web visits.
</P>
<P>
   DoubleClick has put that effort on hold, after an outcry.
However, Kevin O'Connor, the top guy at DoubleClick, says he's just
supporting free access on the Internet. Those who maintain Web
sites must get paid for their effort. That now mostly comes from
selling advertisements _ and advertisers want to know who sees
their ads. If Web sites can't make money with ads, they will charge
fees to visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Most people don't seem to mind data collection by a company if
they've been doing business with it for a while. If you regularly
stay at a particular chain of hotels, the odds are you like the
fact that it knows you might need a special pillow because of an
allergy.
</P>
<P>
   Or that Dollar Rent A Car System tracks the number of times
customers rent from them. If you rent three times, they know it and
might offer an upgrade or other incentive to keep you coming back.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
UNKNOWN HAWKERS ARE BOGEYMEN &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most of the trouble comes from prospective marketing _ that is,
a company assembling information about a non-customer to better
pitch a product to that person.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of marketing was the impetus behind a change in the
law last November that allowed banks, securities firms and
insurance companies to form one-stop financial organizations.
Instead of just selling you an insurance policy, for example, your
company also could offer you annuities, certificates of deposits,
stocks and bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Financial companies fought, and won, the right in the
legislation to allow them to share information about customers with
affiliates. So, your bank can take the information gleaned from
your checking, savings and certificate-of-deposit accounts. It can
then match your spending and saving habits with the financial
products its affiliates sell, or even design new ones, to grab more
of your business.
</P>
<P>
   What really seems to irritate people, however, are companies
buying information from various sources and pitching products to
people with whom they have absolutely no relationship. Remember the
great credit card wars of a few years ago? If you had acceptable
credit, or sometimes even if you didn't, every week there were two
or three mailed pitches urging you to accept a new credit card.
That was followed in a few days by someone making a ``courtesy
call'' to make sure you had received the mailing.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the privacy debate is below the radar for most
Americans. Expect it to become more visible.

MCCAIN, BRADLEY WON SPOTLIGHT, BUSH, GORE THE NATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT JORDAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before the New Hampshire primary, most national polls had Vice
President Al Gore and Texas Governor George W. Bush as their
parties' eventual presidential nominees.
</P>
<P>
   As the New Hampshire primary approached, and the media trumpeted
the ability of Democrat Bill Bradley and Republican Senator John
McCain to knock off the two front-runners, the national polls held
steady for Bush and Gore.
</P>
<P>
   They held steady even as McCain stomped Bush in the Granite
State, and Bradley came within four points of upsetting Gore _ and
as McCain upset Bush in the Michigan primary.
</P>
<P>
   But all along, the media ignored the national polls and
continued to call it a horserace _ until last week.
</P>
<P>
   After the Super Tuesday voting, the national polls could no
longer be doubted.
</P>
<P>
   Gore swept Bradley in all the March 7 state primaries, and Bush
trounced McCain in all but four states, all in New England. Bradley
dropped out and endorsed Gore, and McCain ``suspended'' his
campaign but did not endorse Bush.
</P>
<P>
   One reason McCain won Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Vermont, and
Connecticut may be their proximity to New Hampshire and the media
outlets that chronicled McCain's victorious Granite State campaign.
</P>
<P>
   McCain lost Maine not simply because the extended Bush family
has a well-established vacation home there, but perhaps because the
expansive state is not so connected to the Boston and
Manchester-area media. Perhaps for the same reason, McCain barely
beat Bush in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   In the rest of the country, McCain simply did not catch on with
the electorate. His upset win in Michigan can be attributed largely
to a very intense effort by Democratic and indepenent critics of
Michigan Governor John M. Engler, a Republican who endorsed and
actively campaigned for Bush. Those critics pushed McCain as a way
to get back at Engler.
</P>
<P>
   But then things began to sour for McCain. He departed from his
fiery message of campaign reform to respond to Bush's charges in
such a negative way that it hurt the feisty image that won him New
Hampshire. When he lost both the popular and the delegate vote in
California, New York, and in the South last week, it was clear
McCain had lost his momentum.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Super Tuesday reminded us that national polls best
reflects the voice of the whole electorate _ and that being
distracted by polls or tallies from individual states can be
misleading.
</P>
<P>
   Now most national polls are showing that a Gore-Bush matchup is
a dead heat, far different from the polls of two months earlier
that had Bush easily defeating Gore.
</P>
<P>
   And no longer do those polls show that McCain _ presuming he
stayed in the race _ would easily beat Gore in November. That
scenario changed after Super Tuesday's results. Some polls now show
that if McCain were still in, he would face a close race against
Gore in November.
</P>
<P>
   With the nominating conventions not until summer, and the
November election even further off, there is likely to be much
attention paid to independent voters, who could decide the
election. Early polls last week show that both Gore and Bush would
split the independent vote almost evenly. Some registered Democrats
have indicated in polls that they will vote for Gore in November.
</P>
<P>
   However, a crucial issue for Bush is whether McCain will endorse
and actively support him as the GOP nominee.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's chilly congratulations to Bush last week shows there is
still bad blood between the two. No doubt McCain's reluctance to
endorse Bush is designed to gain leverage on other matters _
perhaps a pledge from Bush that he will support campaign reform in
exchange for the endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Without McCain's endorsement, Bush may be unable to win enough
of McCain's Democratic and independent backers to put him over the
top in November. And if Bush loses, McCain could be viewed as a
sore loser who cost his party the election.
</P>
<P>
   Many pundits believe that if former Senator Eugene McCarthy, the
antiwar candidate, had actively supported Hubert Humphrey's
presidential bid in 1968, Humphrey, not Richard Nixon, would have
won the election.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's candidacy has forced Bush to move further to the right
than he wanted to be, and it will be difficult for him to move
toward the center again without McCain's help. Gore, on the other
hand, is already closer to the center, forced there by the more
liberal Bradley during the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's gracious exit from the campaign and his endorsement of
Gore will leave voters with a positive image of himself as well as
help keep the Democrats united as they move toward November.
</P>
<P>
   McCain could help his own image with Republicans and
Independents if he and Bush work out an agreement. If not, the
polls may well show that Gore has pulled ahead of Bush while McCain
was pulling Bush down.

Tess, the giant robot, teaches visitors about homeostasis _
complete with flowing blood and pounding heart _ at the California
Science Center. Charlotte Schmid-Maybach/Daily News 
 
 
By PHIL DAVIS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tess is a million-dollar woman with brains. A pulsating brain.
</P>
<P>
   Tess, a 50-foot-long human-body simulator, is the centerpiece of
the California Science Center's World of Life exhibit. She is
anatomically correct in an androgynous way _ a massive version of
the old ``visible woman'' models. But Tess is a dazzler with
strobes, chaser lights and pulsating organs to drive her point
home.
</P>
<P>
   Her mission: teach homeostasis, the body's remarkable, but often
taken-for-granted ability to maintain a stable internal environment
despite the wildly fluctuating conditions we expose it to, from
soccer games to mountain climbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is very few science centers even talk about it,''
said David Combs, physiologist and curator of the museum's World of
Life. ``What's amazing about it is probably the central tenet of
physiology. People tend to think it's very complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not that complicated when Tess and her animated sidekick
Walt explain it in a 15-minute show. Tess is stretched out in a
colorful lab of gadgets. Walt provides comic relief on a screen
behind her head. After laying out some body basics, Tess shows
firsthand how the internal organs work together to keep a body in
balance under pressure _ in this case, a girl's soccer game.
</P>
<P>
   Her heart thumps loudly, lungs pulsate (and almost seem real) as
strobes and chaser lights illuminate the movement of blood and
nerve impulses through her body. As she runs through the virtual
soccer game, gauges show fuel, temperature and oxygen levels
dropping. For a moment, with alarms sounding and lights flashing,
it seems Tess may crash and burn. But she's only making a point.
</P>
<P>
   Her body _ as a human body does _ makes up for the shortfall. As
the heart and lungs pick up the pace, Tess moves oxygen, fuel and
other essentials to the crucial systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like we're sitting there on a shelf percolating
along; we're keeping more than 20 things constant at all times,''
Combs said. ``We go through unbelievable, extreme scenarios, and
yet the whole time, basically, all these things stay constant. It's
staggering.''
</P>
<P>
   Children, Tess' primary audience, think she's cool, although one
boy walked out when it became clear no one was going to perform
surgery on her pulsating brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``People learn in there,'' Combs said. ``Are they physiologists
when they come out? No, but they understand the basic idea, their
vocabulary is increased, and their likelihood of talking about
homeostasis goes way up.''
</P>
<P>
   True. Dottie Krause, an English teacher from Los Angeles,
admitted she had forgotten the concept of homeostasis until
watching the Tess show recently. But she wondered if spending $1.7
million in grant money to teach such a basic concept was prudent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an awful lot of effort to get a point across,'' Krause
said. ``This must have cost plenty. I'm wondering if it's worth it,
frankly.''
</P>
<P>
   Combs said Tess' hefty price tag is worth it _ especially
considering how may people aren't aware of such a basic biological
concept.
</P>
<P>
   Homeostasis is what separates higher animals from pond scum.
</P>
<P>
   Pity the poor paramecium. Like a human brain cell, it needs
oxygen, nutrients and a way to get rid of waste. But the paramecium
lives in an environment that is subject to sudden changes in
temperature, affecting the supply of food and oxygen. Meanwhile,
human brain cells bask in a warm, food- and oxygen-rich
environment, courtesy of the hard work of the rest of the organs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially, they have this great environment,'' Combs said.
``That's why we evolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Tess' show runs every 30 minutes. Other World of Life exhibits
offer interactive activities ranging from the life of a single cell
to the interaction of the human body's 100 trillion cells. It's
education _ buffet style.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is learning by free choice,'' Combs said. ``You can pick
and choose what you spend time with. I hope people walk away from
here with a sense of respect for the human body.'' &QL; 
____ &QL; 
What: California Science Center. &QL; 
Attractions: Interactive science exhibits (including a 50-foot
woman and spacewalk simulator) for all ages and a 3-D IMAX movie
theater. &QL; 
Where: 700 State Drive, Los Angeles, in Exposition Park. Parking
entrance is on West 39th street (39th and Figueroa streets). &QL; 
When: 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. &QL; 
Cost: Admission is free, parking costs $5, and IMAX movie prices
range from $3.75 for children to $7.50 for adults. &QL;

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Daryl Hannah is doing it. So are Julia Roberts, Hilary Swank,
Julianne Moore and Cameron Diaz. Even Monica Lewinsky. And just
what thing are these celebs doing _ skydiving, exotic exercise
techniques, oriental mud baths?
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly. Let Hannah, the star of ``Splash,'' ``Roxanne'' and
the upcoming ``Hearts and Bones,'' explain her new enthusiasm:
``There's something very meditative about the repetitive quality of
knitting.''
</P>
<P>
   You read that right. Knitting, once considered the nerdiest,
most old ladyish of crafts, is the butt of jokes once again. Only
now the quips are being printed in Time magazine and Entertainment
Weekly, and they're about how many people _ young and old, male and
female, famous and infamous _ can't get their fill of this ``knit
one, purl two'' stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very soothing, like rocking,'' adds Hannah.
</P>
<P>
   Hannah isn't rocking, but she does look calm as she sits in the
cramped, yarn-saturated work area of La Knitterie Parisienne, the
Studio City yarn boutique run by knitting-instructor-to-the-stars
Edith Eig. Between her hands and dangling from two giant knitting
needles is a filmy mass of blue and green yarn and ribbon, which
will eventually be a seaweed-inspired scarf, a gift for her mother,
who loves the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Like Hannah, so many others _ both men and women _ are turning
to this centuries-old craft for its soothing effect and much more.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on who you ask, knitting can be a tactile workout for
surgeons, a stress-reducing worry-beads substitute for the
high-strung and, for those who excel at it, a way to earn some
extra money. More portable than a painter's canvas, less
focus-demanding than a laptop, your half-completed set of booties
can be brought into a conference room, an airplane, or a movie
theater (provided you use those no-click bamboo needles).
</P>
<P>
   Or even in your trailer before the first take of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm working on a movie, I can't really read a book while
I'm sitting in a makeup chair or getting my hair done,'' says
Hannah,.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another reason why knitters hang out at La
Knitterie Parisienne and L'Atelier in Santa Monica, stores where
the craft is king and the day job of the people practicing it is
secondary. They are places where a 29-year-old Beverly Hills nurse
can sit next to an 80-year-old grandmother from Valley Village and
compare projects and techniques. The two women may have nothing
else in common, or they could turn out to be distant relatives.
Stranger things could happen when knitters gather.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of harkens back to a different era,'' says Hannah,
``in that it's a social activity, even though you can do it by
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Folks who knit together say there is no better bonding
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``People talk about anything and everything,'' says Eig. ``I
could blackmail people.''
</P>
<P>
   There is even a play, ``Loose Knit'' by Theresa Rebeck,
currently playing at the Jewel Box Theatre, that uses that premise,
with five actresses interacting with each other while knitting on
stage. (Each cast member took knitting lessons with Eig as part of
the rehearsal process.)
</P>
<P>
   Of course, people aren't knitting entirely for social reasons.
Once you've completed a project, you possess an item that may have
cost hundreds of dollars more at a craft boutique or major
department store.
</P>
<P>
   Want to know why the Knitting Guild of America has seen its
membership skyrocket? Look to the pages of fashion magazines, or
even in your local Gap or Banana Republic. The hand-knit look is
in, and colors and textures are as varied as ever. People are
looking at the product _ and at the hefty price tags _ and saying,
``I can make that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started knitting 20 years ago, you didn't have all the
colors and all the fibers,'' says Eig, who operated a store in New
Jersey before coming to the West Coast. ``You have all the silk and
the fiber, and it has become more affordable to people.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, making something by hand is the ultimate in cool and
personal satisfaction, especially when you can present that
sweater/baby blanket/afghan as a gift.
</P>
<P>
   Knitters will talk about the sense of accomplishment that comes
with completing a project, of knowing that every fiber of yarn that
went into that article of clothing first went through your fingers.
There's a special link, they say, forged with the recipient of a
hand-knitted item.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, Hannah is at La Knitterie Parisienne with her best
friend, Hilary Shepard-Turner, who introduced her to the store. The
actress, who hasn't learned the more complicated maneuver of
purling (an inversion of stitches to produce a ribbed effect), says
she dreams of one day knitting herself a sweater that can perfectly
accommodate her long arms. Eig assures her it can be done.
</P>
<P>
   Knitting enthusiasts say they are thrilled at the craft's
renaissance and the widespread cultural interest.
</P>
<P>
   At private Waldorf Schools throughout the country _ including
one in Altadena _ instructors teach the craft to enthusiastic
first-graders as part of the curriculum. Knitting, school
administrators say, teaches mathematics and concentration as well
as dexterity.
</P>
<P>
   And the more people who spend an hour poring over patterns at a
trendy yarn store, or culling tips from the Craft Yarn
Association's Web site, the less likely a centuries-old art _ born
of family tradition and socialization _ will die out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knitting is fabulous,'' says Carol Porter, a former counselor
with the Los Angeles Unified School District. ``We live in a
complicated world. I don't ever go a day without knitting, and if I
didn't do it, I couldn't be responsible for my personality.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Technology is rapidly changing the way Americans consume
entertainment. Some day in the not-so-distant future, all forms of
recorded entertainment will be available, on demand or via
subscription services, over the Internet. Programming will become
more interactive, especially when it comes to e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The implications of these changes are enormous, and they're
already shaking up the entertainment industry. The music business,
in particular, is facing a complete realignment; controversial
outsiders such as MP3.com and Napster.com have already launched
services that make digital distribution of music (and, by
extension, music piracy) easy for anyone with a basic working
knowledge of the Internet. So far, the recording industry has
mounted a two-pronged defense: It is suing Internet start-ups over
licensing fees and piracy issues, and it is also struggling to
develop a standard to secure digital music. To date, both efforts
have been fruitless.
</P>
<P>
   But lawsuits and resistance aren't going to stop the technology
revolution, which has the potential to open up opportunities for
new artists and to provide consumers more entertainment options at
a lower cost. Admittedly, the technology is still in its infancy:
Quality is unreliable, and content is limited. But that isn't
holding back the early adapters. On college campuses and in church
halls, ordinary folks are already changing their viewing,
listening, and reading habits. Here's a look at people who are
doing what we'll all be doing within a few years. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Internet radio &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Jasmine Francis had to scour the radio dial to
find programs that played reggae; she was limited to one or two
weekly programs on local stations. But now she listens to
radiojamaica.com on the Internet, and she can can have all reggae,
all day, at both work and play. ``It's a cultural thing,'' Francis,
33, explains.
</P>
<P>
   Francis, a computer technician in the Cambridge public schools,
moved here from Jamaica with her mother and brothers in 1974.
Internet radio keeps her connected with her native culture. Her
friends in Jamaica listen to some of the same radio programs;
sometimes, she sends in song requests via e-mail and asks the DJ to
send out a hello to her cousin at home.
</P>
<P>
   Radio, in fact, has made the transition to the Internet faster
than any other medium has. There are thousands of online radio
stations offering every possible genre, from Christian to classical
to cutting-edge music. Most traditional stations now simulcast
their programming online, while such startup operations as
www.gogaga.com and www.live365.com offer Internet-only programs.
Many Net-only stations post their playlists online and provide
links for listeners to purchase CDs from such e-commerce outfits as
amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Mainstream folks tune in for any number of reasons. Pamela
Fallon listens regularly to a radio station in Moscow; a publicist
for rock promoter Don Law, Fallon once did publicity for Mikhail
Gorbachev and is studying Russian. ``It helps me with my language
skills,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Another user, Northeastern University graduate student Mary
Churchill, tunes in to a station in New Orleans, where she spent
her honeymoon. ``It brings back memories,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Memories waft out of the computer at the Francis household,
where the machine is plugged into the Internet via a cable modem.
Francis has a passion for the Irie beat, even though her daughters,
Myasha, 10, and Nicqueta, 12, have a taste for American teen pop
and hip-hop. ``The Internet lets me introduce them to Jamaican
culture,'' Francis says. That's not to say the technology is
perfectly seamless; when Internet use is extremely high, audio
programs can stutter and spurt. But fine-tuning the machinery is a
family affair for the Francis clan. ``My 10-year-old daughter gets
around the problems by changing all the settings,'' Francis notes.
``She knows all the little tricks.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Music &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Forget MTV. Today's youth are saying, ``I want my MP3.''
</P>
<P>
   Take Jacob Bouvrie, a 21-year-old electrical engineering student
at MIT. A music aficionado and a musician himself, he owns several
hundred CDs. Like most students, he moves frequently, and he is
tired of lugging around all that plastic. The solution? He
converted his CD collection to a digital file format called MP3, a
relatively simple process. He now stores his music on his computer.
``Every time I change dorm rooms, I just carry my hard drive with
me,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The MP3 format, which allows high-quality music to be stored on
a computer and distributed over the Internet, is wildly popular on
college campuses, and it's spreading to the workplace as well. But
it is anathema to the music industry, since it makes piracy as
simple as clicking a mouse. The Recording Industry Association of
America is currently suing MP3.com and Napster.com, which
distribute digital music in controversial ways. And Napster uses a
program that eats up bandwidth, and as such, it has been banned on
many college campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Like thousands of other students, Bouvrie is aware of the
establishment's wrath, but he still regularly downloads MP3 files.
He posts music recorded by his own band, called B Field, on the
MP3.com site; he doesn't expect to land a big contract, but he
appreciates the free exposure. And Napster allows him _ and other
remote users _ to share music files online. ``Legally speaking,
it's piracy,'' he says, ``but I don't have any qualms about it. My
musical tastes are obscure, and more often than not, MP3s have
prompted me to go out and buy the entire album.''
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, digital distribution is still in its infancy.
Portable MP3 players only store an hour's worth of songs; legal
content is still limited and the technology is feasible only for
users with high-speed Internet access such as broadband or DSL
(digital subscriber lines). But attitudes about the very concept of
music itself are changing. Todd Hiers, an MIT senior, has a new
definition for the MP3 generation. ``I tend to think of music as
information,'' he says. ``As data. Not as a physical object at
all.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Electronic books &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Billy Strayhorn isn't one of those ministers who
pontificates from the pulpit, looking down on his congregation. No,
the leader of the First United Methodist Church in Joshua, Texas,
gets down with the parishioners, moving among the people, pumping
flesh and patting backs as he quotes scripture from a handheld
text. But he's not lugging around the Bible; instead, he carries a
Rocket eBook, a $200 electronic reader that can store thousands of
pages of printed material. Strayhorn stores his sermons and prayer
list on the device, which he uses for daily devotionals, Sunday
services, even weddings and funerals.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one wedding rehearsal, a bunch of folks were interested in
computers, and I got more questions about the Rocket than about the
ceremony,'' Strayhorn, 48, recalls.
</P>
<P>
   A self-described technogeek, Strayhorn bought his electronic
reader in April. The consumer device, which is about the size of a
paperback, hit the market in late 1998; users can download texts
free from a number of Web sites (including www.rocket-library.com
or http://promo.net/pg) or purchase trade books and textbooks from
such commercial vendors as Barnes &AMP; Noble. The electronic library
is limited to thousands of titles, ranging from esoteric technical
books to classic and contemporary fiction. But so far, Strayhorn
has been able to satisfy his eclectic taste, which runs from the
Bible to science fiction, murder mysteries, and ``good, ol' spy
thrillers'' by authors such as Stephen King. But he hasn't been
able to find an electronic copy of his favorite novel, ``To Kill a
Mockingbird'' nor any of the Harry Potter books. He did acquire an
electronic version of a popular book called ``Experiencing God.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife calls me Rocket Boy,'' confesses Strayhorn, a jolly
sort with a healthy laugh and a Texas twang.
</P>
<P>
   The Rocket isn't the only way to read books electronically; some
avid readers are devouring novels on the tiny screen of the Palm
Pilot electronic organizer. Janice Karin of Malden, for instance,
reads about a dozen books a week on her portable organizer. The
27-year-old technical writer is legally blind, and the electronic
device allows her to adjust the size of the type to make reading
possible. ``It's certainly saved me from being bored out of my
skull on many occasions,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   As for Strayhorn, he's not one to bore easily, but he carries
his reader with him all the time, just in case. And his newfangled
device has come in handy in one old-fashioned way: ``Sometimes some
of the men in the church think the preacher is way up there,
unapproachable,'' he says. ``But when they find out I'm into
computers, the quiet guys suddenly want to have a conversation.
It's an icebreaker, a point of contact.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Movies &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It all started with a movie series about a young man in a galaxy
far, far away.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the trailer for the prequel ``Star Wars: Episode I _
The Phantom Menace'' spread like a virus over the Internet, with
copies available for download on the official studio Web site as
well as on fan and bootleg sites. Steve Head, a 34-year-old
uberfan, watched the trailer online and in theaters. These days, he
and his friends watch trailers on the Internet all the time.
``We're all pretty fanatic about it,'' says Head, a computer
programmer from Weymouth.
</P>
<P>
   Head just launched a movie news site called filmforce.net, which
posts links to movie trailers online. The hottest trailer
circulating right now is the preview for ``The X-Men,'' a
futuristic comic-book thriller with the slogan ``Join the
Evolution.'' ``More people have seen the images from this trailer
via an online connection than have actually seen it in a theater,''
says Head. ``I know I have.''
</P>
<P>
   The trailer aired two weeks ago on ``Entertainment Tonight'' and
was posted on the Internet almost immediately. ``People get it on
tape and digitize it,'' explains Head. In fact, the sport of
watching trailers has become an entertainment form unto itself. So
why are people so nutty about short videos that are essentially
advertisements? ``There is a vicarious thrill of one-upmanship and
curiosity,'' says Scott Deering, a New Jersey computer consultant
who runs www.movie-trailers.com.
</P>
<P>
   Streaming video is still extremely limited because of bandwidth
and quality issues; even with a high-speed connection, the viewing
experience can be frustrating. But today's trailer addicts are
tomorrow's online entertainment audience. Some companies, like
www.den.net and www.atomfilms.com, are already producing shows made
for niche markets on the Internet, targeting Christian teens, dog
lovers, and break dancers alike. Many of these shows have a
built-in e-commerce mechanism; with the click of a mouse, viewers
can buy the items they see or the music they hear in any particular
program.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, early adapters such as Head are content with
the novelty of watching trailers. ``The downloading takes forever,
and the image is very small, but I have the opportunity to see it
online, any time I want,'' says Head. ``And that, I think, is
pretty cool.''

BAD OMENS FOR GOP IN CALIF. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLENDALE, Calif. _ In California terms _ the biggest terms of
all in a presidential election year _ the steep hill George W. Bush
has to climb can be seen in some numbers that shocked Republicans
around here long after the rest of the country had gone to bed on
Super Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In this chunk of the 27th Congressional District _ largely
suburban territory northeast of Los Angeles _ the incumbent GOP
congressman, Jim Rogan, finished an embarrassing second in the open
primary.
</P>
<P>
   The supporters of Rogan, who was one the House managers of
President Clinton's impeachment trial, were stunned by more than
the fact that Rogan ended up nearly 3,000 votes behind his toughest
challenger yet, Democratic state Senator Adam Schiff.
</P>
<P>
   What made the primary results sting was the fact that Schiff
outpolled Rogan on a day that brought out an unusually conservative
electorate. Many more conservatives than usual came out, as they
had elsewhere in the country, to vote against John McCain. They
were also mobilized by several referendum questions, especially a
vicious campaign to keep gay couples' marriages from legal
recognition.
</P>
<P>
   But for Rogan as well as for Bush, the prospects are for a
considerably less conservative electorate when the numbers swell
eight months hence. And each has already finished behind his
Democratic opponent.
</P>
<P>
   The locals were also stunned because federal records show that
through the primary, Rogan had already raised and spent an obscene
$2.8 million on his campaign, while Schiff's spending total was a
mere $50,000. That is far more egregious than the Bush-Gore spread,
but the analogy is apt.
</P>
<P>
   With those results on a day with as conservative a hue as a
Republican could hope for, Rogan's campaign could only wonder what
lies in store this November, when a more typical electorate,
including much more of the district's growing nonwhite population,
shows up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on our own in the fall, as every congressional race is,
ultimately,'' said one GOP official, ``but inevitably we're tied
into the presidential situation because that will be the biggest
motivator in November. And I can't see how the mix then can do
anything but make Rogan's, and Bush's, job tougher.''
</P>
<P>
   For national Republicans trying to elect Bush and avoid losing
the six House seats that would return control to the Democrats,
Rogan's performance would have been disturbing enough had it been
unique. But it wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   In Silicon Valley to the north, San Jose's GOP congressman Tom
Campbell is leaving his seat for a long-shot run at Senator Dianne
Feinstein. In his place, Republicans recruited an attractive
candidate from the state Assembly, James Cunneen, but Democrats
went to the state Senate to get Mike Honda to run, and he ended up
with fully 9,000 votes more than Cunneen in the traditionally
moderate district.
</P>
<P>
   To the south of Los Angeles along the ocean, Democrat Jane
Harmon came within 2,000 votes of freshman Republican Steve
Kuykendall, who was fighting off an intraparty challenge from a
self-financed right-winger.
</P>
<P>
   And in another tough district, in San Diego, perennially
challenged Republican Brian Bilbray finished just 6,000 votes ahead
of his latest Democratic nemesis, state Assemblyman Susan Davis.
That is four Republican House seats that will be in serious play
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Some absentee ballot are still being tabulated, but the total
turnout in California appears certain to go a few points above 50
percent of eligible adults. But heavily Democratic areas like Los
Angeles County and San Francisco (43 and 40 percent respectively)
lagged well behind more conservative areas, reflecting the foregone
conclusion of the Al Gore-Bill Bradley contest. By contrast, the
turnout in heavily Republican Orange County was the highest in 20
years.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Gore surprised state pols not only by finishing
ahead of Bush in the beauty contest part of the primary (open to
all, regardless of registration) but by beating him 35 to 28
percent. Just with Bradley's 9 percent overall and a fair chunk of
John McCain's 23 percent (exit polls here showed Gore getting more
than a third of his support against Bush), the day belonged to the
vice president.
</P>
<P>
   And this electorate skewed conservative. Los Angeles Times exit
polling showed self-identified evangelical Christians up 7 points,
at 25 percent of the total from 1996, and whites also up 7 points,
to 81 percent. By contrast, Latino turnout dipped 5 points to 12
percent. The GOP turnout was up 10 point, while the Democratic
showing was flat.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is vowing to go all out here, planning a full week's stay
this spring. But local Republicans were fooled in '92 by his father
and in '96 by Bob Dole, who esentially gave up by October to save
money for more competitive states, depressing the local Republican
turnout.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's top tactician here, state Senator Jim Brulte, is warning
the campaign against breaking its pledge to spend the money here
that it raises here. At stake is more than just Bush's campaign.
The future of the party establishment that rushed to embrace Bush
is also on the line, starting with Jim Rogan.

<P>
   There is no putting a shine on the news about the Big Dig's
latest cost overrun. The most expensive public works project in
America will come in, it is now estimated, at $12.2 billion, maybe
more.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone always knew it would cost a king's ransom to build an
eight-lane underground highway through the middle of downtown
Boston. But the price tag is now 13 percent higher than the $10.8
billion budget state officials going back to 1997 had sworn was
chiseled in granite.
</P>
<P>
   It is 17 percent higher than the $10.4 billion budget they were
swearing to in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   And 58 percent higher than the $7.7 billion budget they were
swearing to in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   And 91 percent higher than the $6.4 billion budget they were
sure of in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   And 110 percent higher than the $5.8 billion budget they were
comfortable with in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   And 144 percent higher than the $5 billion budget that was in
place when the Weld-Cellucci administration came to office in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   No, you can't put a shine on a project whose bottom line has
skyrocketed 144 percent in nine years. But you can put it in
context.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, the Massachusetts state budget hit a new milestone:
Beacon Hill spent more than $10 billion. This year it will pass $21
billion. That makes an increase of 110 percent in 13 years _ far
steeper than the Big Dig. After all, James Kerasiotes, the state's
transportation czar, does not spend his entire budget every 12
months.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, never in all that time has Beacon Hill managed to stay
within its budget for even a single year. And only once has it
managed to actually trim spending from one year to the next. If the
Big Dig has a problem with budgeting, it is far from alone.
</P>
<P>
   When news of the price spike broke, Senate President Tom
Birmingham witheringly urged Governor Cellucci to ``demonstrate
some leadership.'' He also suggested that he didn't trust the
governor's judgment. ``We're putting the administration on a short
leash,'' he said. Last week, he and House Speaker Tom Finneran
ordered up a hearing on the Central Artery project's finances. In
the course of the hours-long session, Kerasiotes and the project
managers were repeatedly flayed for their fiscal failings.
</P>
<P>
   Again, some context:
</P>
<P>
   It was just five months ago that Birmingham and Finneran were
starring in a comic opera of budgetary incompetence. For days,
weeks, months, the two of them tried and failed to finalize the
state budget for fiscal 2000. Cellucci had submitted his budget
proposals to the Legislature in January, but the speaker and the
Senate president couldn't manage to get a final spending document
back to him until Nov. 11. By that point, fiscal 2000 was more than
one-third over.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is happy about the latest jump in the Big Dig's grand
total, and the intense public scrutiny the new numbers are
receiving is to the good. But it is also good to point out that
covering the increase is not going to put Massachusetts in danger
of a budget meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   That is because the commonwealth has more funds than it knows
how to spend. A late-December headline on an Associated Press story
summed up the situation nicely: ``Bay State awash in $$ for a rainy
day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With tax dollars gushing in to state coffers because of the
booming economy,'' the AP's Martin Finucane wrote, ``the state has
now piled up mountains of money in trust funds.'' The official
``rainy day'' account is bursting with $1.4 billion, but that is
only for starters. Among the other pots of cash the state has
buried here and there are $1.8 billion in the unemployment
insurance account, $131 million in surplus welfare money, and $125
million in a rarely touched medical security trust fund. All told,
there is a pool of more than $3.5 billion, and state officials, as
the Globe reported last month, ``expect . . . to push that number
over the $4 billion mark by June 30.''
</P>
<P>
   As if all that wasn't enough, the cities and towns of
Massachusetts are sitting on stashes of their own. Since 1992,
local reserve funds have ballooned from $166 million to nearly $1
billion.
</P>
<P>
   And there are still more funds on the way _ the state's $8
billion share of the tobacco settlement. No wonder Administration
and Finance Secretary Andrew Natsios says, ``We're swimming in
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Even that understates the case. The Revenue Department announced
the other day that tax collections are once again going to set a
new record, just as they have done every year since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   With so many billions in unemcumbered cash available, there is
no need to resort to new debt to meet the Big Dig overrun. Nor is
there any need to reimpose a fee on driver's license renewals or to
scrap plans to roll back the state income tax to its traditional
rate, 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   These economic good times won't last forever, of course. That is
why the worst way to use these billions is to spend them on new
budget items that would have to be funded anew each year. Far
better to tap these surpluses to finish the Central Artery and to
give Bay Staters the tax relief they have been waiting for ever
since the income tax was ``temporarily'' raised 11 years ago. That
will still leave billions in place with which to meet the next
recession. Or the next Big Dig surprise.

MAINE INITIATIVES MET WITH GLEE, FEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN BARRY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For John Michael, a man none too pleased with the professional
lawmakers in Augusta, the certification this month of Maine's
highest-ever number of citizen ballot initiatives was the occasion
for some populist muscle-flexing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We forced their hand!'' said Michael, whose initiative for the
repeal of a state tax on snack foods could well face a vote early
in the Legislature, circumventing the popular vote. ``We got the
signatures. Because if you shine a little light on cockroaches,
they start scurrying.''
</P>
<P>
   The glee within the Don't Tax Food Coalition _ or a more
restrained form of it _ is shared by backers of the other
initiatives that will appear on Maine's November ballot: measures
to legalize assisted suicide, restrict clear-cutting of forests,
and legalize video lottery machines at harness-racing tracks.
</P>
<P>
   What unites them is despair that elected officials would ever
satisfy their demands, and faith in Maine's 92-year tradition _
shared on the East Coast only by Massachusetts and Florida _ of
allowing citizens to make laws or amend the state Constitution by
ballot.
</P>
<P>
   But during the last decade, as a nationwide citizen initiative
movement began to set broader public policy at the ballot box, some
critics have charged that the process allows deep-pocketed lobbying
groups to hijack the democratic process.
</P>
<P>
   Maine is no different. With the backing of Secretary of State
Dan Gwadosky, legislators have made a series of attempts to
restrain the signature-gatherers, warning that Maine is seeing the
beginnings of an initiative industry like the multimillion-dollar
one that has come to dominate California politics.
</P>
<P>
   This year's large crop of initiatives has fueled Gwadosky's
fears that Maine will begin to attract national lobbies looking to
rack up victories.
</P>
<P>
   Gwadosky's prime example of the professionalization of the
process is the snack-tax crusader himself. Michael, who served six
terms as a Democratic legislator in Augusta before returning to
Auburn, Maine, in disgust, is the first person in the state to
parlay signature-gathering into a career. He pays his employees 50
cents to $1 for each signature. And, said Gwadosky, the snack tax
repeal is only one of a dozen ballot questions that Michael
``shopped around'' in advance of the November election, looking for
interest groups willing to back the effort. ``You started to have
individuals who really went into the business of gathering
signatures for profit,'' said Gwadosky.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the Legislature voted to prevent petitioners from
paying signature-gatherers by the signature _ a law that was struck
down by a federal judge last December.
</P>
<P>
   Other changes pushed unsuccessfully in the Legislature include
prohibiting signature-gathering within 250 feet of a ballot box and
establishing a minimum of 50,000 signatures.
</P>
<P>
   But Gwadosky and the legislators who sponsored the bills are
encroaching on a tradition close to the populist hearts of Mainers.
The processes of initiative and referendum, which allow voters to
repeal legislative acts, are primarily a phenomenon of the Western
states, born during the first decades of the last century out of
disillusionment over legislatures controlled by monied interests.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the institution of a citizen's vote has been used by
those same interests _ the business community defeated Maine's
nine-hour-workday law by referendum in 1915, according to labor
historian Charles Scontras _ it's cherished in Maine as a tool of
direct democracy.
</P>
<P>
   And no one better embodies that tradition than the earnest
volunteer striding into the secretary of state's office with a
sheaf of signatures.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Adams of Garland said she will never forget that moment in
1997 when her ``love affair'' with the initiative began. A
35-year-old mother of two with no background in politics, she was
so protective of the 50,000 signatures she had gathered in support
of a push to repeal Maine's property tax that she slept with them
in her bedroom at night.
</P>
<P>
   But she didn't feel the ``awesome'' power that she had as a
citizen until she dropped off the signatures at the secretary of
state's office, said Adams, who runs her own online political
newsletter, The Adams Report. That moment, she said, sent shivers
down her spine.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an old movie I saw as a kid, called `Thirteen Lead
Soldiers,' and when they found the 13th lead soldier and put it in
the right place after several death-defying acts, the door opened
up in the side of the mountain and all the debris and dirt fell
down, and there was the treasure that no one had seen for hundreds
of years,'' she said. ``That's just the way I felt when I saw that
thing work. I felt as if we had found the 13th lead soldier.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's also true that in Maine, as in the other 23 states that
use the process, citizens' initiatives have been put to
dramatically different use in recent years. Between 1908, when the
provision was passed, and 1998, only 38 citizen-initiated petitions
made it onto Maine's ballot. The surge dates back to Proposition
13, which California voters approved in 1978. The tax-cutting
initiative, financed with $2 million by two businessmen, limited
increases in assessments on homes until they were resold, and built
in brakes to raising property taxes. It also sparked what
Washington political columnist David Broder, in his book
``Democracy Derailed: Initiative Campaigns and the Power of
Money,'' describes as a snowballing voter rebellion against state
legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   But in Maine, where only 13 citizen initiatives have become law
in 92 years, those fears seem exaggerated, said Dane Waters,
president of the Initiative and Referendum Institute, which
advocates for freer use of the process nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   That point is not argued by state Senator Richard ``Spike''
Carey, a Democrat who sponsored the bill to set the higher
signature threshold. The way he sees it, some policy decisions just
don't belong in the hands of amateurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, the campaigns are usually not very truthful on
either side,'' said Carey, offering, by way of example, the
clear-cutting initiative set to face voters in November. ``A person
who lives in the city who knows nothing about forestry is swayed
one way or the other by whoever talked to them last.''

TECH BOOM GIVES MIT NEW CACHET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Acceptance letters for admission to both Harvard and MIT threw
Jonathan Sheffi into a whirl of indecision last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard? MIT? Harvard? MIT?
</P>
<P>
   Sheffi was facing the biggest decision in his 18 years, and a
combined 1,580 SAT score was not helping. He paced. He roused his
parents at 2 a.m. to talk. He studied college rankings on the
Internet. Finally, he accepted at MIT, then withdrew. He accepted
Harvard's invitation and withdrew that, too.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard's allure, he said, is its prestige. MIT is ``where the
real stuff is happening,'' Sheffi, now a freshman, said on a balmy
March afternoon in his laundry-strewn dorm room at MIT. ``I'm so
glad I resisted Harvard.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard University has always out-graced and overshadowed the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a clunky compound where
whiz-kid engineers hunch over arcane gadgetry.
</P>
<P>
   But the ascendancy of ``geek chic'' throughout society has given
technology-based research universities, such as MIT, a cachet once
reserved for Ivy League schools supported by blue-blooded
benefactors. During the 1990s, undergraduate applications to MIT
shot up 66 percent, more than Harvard's, which rose 53 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the middle of a technical revolution,'' and MIT is
among ``the schools that are benefiting right now,'' said Arthur
Levine, president of the Teachers College at Columbia University.
``This is their moment, this is their time, this is their
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   From its perch on the Charles River, Harvard may not admit to
being engaged in a spirited, always polite, rivalry with MIT. But,
things are happening so fast at MIT that, surely, some heads must
be turning at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard's $14.4 billion endowment is the largest for a
university in the country. But, MIT has suddenly become a magnet
for the money gushing from the white-hot centers of high-tech,
biotechnology, and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   A former MIT student and computer-publishing magnate, Patrick J.
McGovern Jr., and his entrepreneur wife, Lore Harp McGovern,
recently presented MIT with a $350 million gift. The donation _
trumpeted by newspapers, including the Harvard Crimson, as the
biggest in US academic history _ occurred mere months after an MIT
student-turned-entrepreneur, Kenan E. Sahin, dropped $100 million
on his alma mater.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard will always be Harvard, clinging to traditions such as
the Harvard-Yale football game. And its celebrity scholars, in
fields ranging from physics and the classics to medicine and
African-American studies, are unmatched. Thirty-seven Nobel Prizes
have been awarded to Harvard faculty since 1914.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about MIT's momentum, Harvard's spokesman, Joe Wrinn,
hewed to tradition. ``You're really comparing apples and oranges,''
he said. ``We're bigger and older, but it's not a competition.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, MIT's apples seem to shine just as brightly as
Harvard's oranges.
</P>
<P>
   In annual college rankings by U.S. News &AMP; World Report, Harvard
has, year after year, placed first among ``national universities,''
those offering a range of undergraduate and graduate degrees.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine discourages comparing rankings, due to changes in
its methodology each year. But, the academic community took note
when MIT, in the newest ranking, elbowed into the top tier, placing
third among 228 national universities and nipping at the heels of
No. 2 Harvard. The California Institute of Technology ranked first.
</P>
<P>
   MIT's cachet runs deeper than geek chic, but there's that, too.
Take the institute's role in the 1997 movie ``Good Will Hunting,''
about a genius MIT janitor, played by Matt Damon, who solves a math
problem thought to be unsolvable. But there was the 1970 movie
``Love Story,'' starring Ali McGraw and Ryan O'Neal, two sorry
lovebirds on the Harvard-Radcliffe campus.
</P>
<P>
   What about the universities' choices of commencement speakers?
Harvard hosted Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve Board chairman,
in June. MIT's graduation speakers last year: ``Car Talk'' radio
show hosts Tom and Ray Magliozzi.
</P>
<P>
   And, while Harvard grabbed headlines for a recent flap over
reclaiming its proud name from a health maintenance organization in
receivership, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, MIT basks in the success
of math professor Tom Leighton. Wall Street has watched in wonder
as the value of Leighton's Internet company, Akamai Technologies,
soared above $27 billion in four months since going public.
</P>
<P>
   MIT's selection of architect Frank Gehry to design the Stata
computer center seemed an expression of its newfound hipness. Gehry
is the award-winning designer of the free-form Guggenheim Museum in
Bilboa, Spain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course MIT is cooler than Harvard,'' exclaimed Nancy
Kanwisher, who came to MIT from Harvard 2 1/2 years ago as an
associate professor in the brain and cognitive science department.
</P>
<P>
   Kanwisher's work on visual activity in the cortex and colleague
Susumu Tonegawa's work on memory are the kinds of research going on
at MIT that persuaded the McGoverns to designate that their
donation be used to establish the Institute for Brain Research.
</P>
<P>
   MIT, founded in 1861 as a school of arts and industrial science,
has historically excelled in the sciences. A 1995 survey by the
National Research Council placed MIT at the top _ for the quality
of its faculty and effectiveness of its doctoral programs _ in
engineering, cell biology, computer science, and materials science,
among other fields. MIT is among a handful of research
organizations worldwide on the verge of cracking the code for the
human genome.
</P>
<P>
   But, MIT also rated high for linguistics _ Noam Chomsky is on
the faculty _ and for its star-studded economics faculty. The
humanities program overall is also considered top drawer: History
professor John Dower won a 1999 National Book Award for ``Embracing
Defeat: Japan in the Wake of World War II.'' MIT boasts only one
Pulitzer; composer John Harbison won in 1987. But its faculty,
since 1964, have won 19 Nobel prizes. (Add to that 16 Nobels won by
MIT alumni.)
</P>
<P>
   Edmund P. Russell III, a professor of technology and culture at
the University of Virginia, explained that the growing importance
of technology in society has given the public a greater
appreciation of what goes on at MIT.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, he said, has sped up the process by demonstrating
``the importance of the so-called geeks to our national well
being.''
</P>
<P>
   And MIT, long stereotyped as a haven for white men with pocket
protectors, has diversified. Nearly half of the entering freshmen
last fall were women, up from 30 percent a decade ago. Minorities
rose from 7 percent to 18 percent of the student population.
</P>
<P>
   Emilie Croisier, a freshman math and neuroscience major, said
she prefers MIT life. ``I'm sure I could visit more museums at
Harvard, but the people here are just so, so dynamic.''
</P>
<P>
   In technology, Harvard is behind in a race led by MIT. Harvard
is forging more links with private industry and teaching
undergraduates how to be entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   It has become cliche, in business circles, to note that William
H. Gates dropped out of Harvard to devote himself to Microsoft
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Would Gates have dropped out if he had gone to MIT instead?

MORE WOMEN ARE EMBRACING JEWISH EDUCATION AND WORSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mention the study of the Torah or Talmud, and one almost
inevitably pictures a group of bearded men huddled over the ancient
Jewish texts.
</P>
<P>
   But that picture increasingly is inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   A new study of American Jews, done at Brandeis University, finds
that among involved but non-Orthodox Jews, women are more likely
than men to be studying their faith.
</P>
<P>
   The findings are being hailed by scholars of gender and Judaism,
who say they mark a reversal of two millenia in which serious
Jewish scholarship was almost exclusively the province of men.
</P>
<P>
   The scholars say that the American Jewish community has come to
resemble the Christian community in the increasing importance of
women at worship and in religious classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the extraordinary results of Jewish feminism is that
there has been a real sea change in attitudes toward girls and
women studying traditional texts, so that for the first time in
2,000 years of Jewish history girls and women now have access to
the basic tools for (Jewish) cultural literacy,'' said Sylvia
Barack Fishman, co-director of the Hadassah International Research
Institute on Jewish Women, which is releasing the study. ``This
brings Jews more in line with the patterns we see in other American
religions, where the typical pattern is male clergy but a vast
majority of worshipers . . . are women.''
</P>
<P>
   Judaism has historically emphasized the study of the Torah and
rabbinic texts, such as the Talmud, as a virtue for men, and texts
such as the Talmud feature almost entirely male voices. With some
prominent exceptions, women have been exempted from, and in some
cases prohibited from, participating in the study of such texts.
</P>
<P>
   The new research, conducted by sociologist Steven M. Cohen of
the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, defined Jewish study broadly to
include a variety of learning experiences, including text study,
lecture attendance, and Internet research.
</P>
<P>
   The study, a survey of 1,302 American Jews, found that among all
Jews, the rate of adult Jewish learning is equal among men and
women, but that if the Orthodox and the unaffiliated are excepted,
women are ahead of men. The study found that men continue to have a
slight lead in the study of traditional texts _ a complex pursuit
that generally requires an ability to read Hebrew and Aramaic _ but
that women are ahead in many other types of Jewish learning.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is significant in that it points to the central role of
women in Jewish life,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   He also cited the influence of the broader Christian society,
saying that ``throughout the West, women are more involved in
churches and religious life.''
</P>
<P>
   The increasing involvement of women in Jewish study is also an
inevitable byproduct of the women's movement, scholars say.
</P>
<P>
   ``As women became more educated secularly, you had rabbis
understanding that if you didn't educate women Jewishly, they were
going to leave the fold,'' said Erica Brown, of the Combined Jewish
Philanthropies of Greater Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The trend can be seen in numerous ways. About 60 percent of the
participants in Me'ah, an intensive adult learning program for Jews
in the Boston area, are women, said David M. Gordis, president of
Hebrew College in Brookline.
</P>
<P>
   One leader in the study of rabbinic texts by women is Deborah
Kram of Brookline, who at age 40 left her career as a literary
agent to launch Ma'ayan, a Jewish learning program for women in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have women who are CEOs and doctors and lawyers, in
addition to homemakers, where their general education is
outstanding but they want to catch up on their cultural and
religious heritage,'' she said. ``It has definitely increased my
sense of belonging to the Jewish community to be in touch with
these Jewish texts.''

PUSH FOR PATRON SAINT AIMS FOR A WEB HEAVENLY LINK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDITH GAINES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Pasta eaters have their own patron saint. So
do tax collectors, beggars, seekers of lost articles, supporters of
lost causes, students, people with sore throats or troubled
marriages.
</P>
<P>
   St. Giles guides the disabled, St. Expedito aids the
procrastinator, St. Raphael will get a friendship back on track.
But cyberspace, so far, is saintless.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as more people spend more time surfing the captivating but
sometimes soulless ocean of information on the World Wide Web,
there's a movement underway urging the Vatican to name a patron
saint of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is a gift of God, an asset to the human
condition. Why shouldn't the Catholic Church endorse it in this
way?'' asked Thomas Groome, professor of theology at Boston
College.
</P>
<P>
   But Groome and others acknowledge that the campaign is
questioned, given that the Internet offers browsers plenty of
pornographic and other unholy sites.
</P>
<P>
   The effort began in Europe and is being pushed through petitions
and other communiques to the Vatican. So far, two candidates have
been suggested.
</P>
<P>
   The one who apparently has the most support is Saint Isidore of
Seville (560-636 A.D.), a Spanish theologian who spoke several
languages and was widely considered the most learned man of his
time.
</P>
<P>
   In an age of growing barbarism and contempt for learning, he
created the ``Etymologiae,'' a 20-volume encyclopedia of everything
from grammar to birds, beasts, medicine, road-making, clothing, and
furniture, as well as meditations on the divine.
</P>
<P>
   ``His works became a storehouse of knowledge freely utilized by
innumerable Medieval authors,'' said Internet Observation Services,
an Italian group that nominated Isidore.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, he was a one-man Web.
</P>
<P>
   The other candidate is San Pedro Regalado (1390-1456 A.D.), a
Spanish priest known for his ability to appear at more than one
place at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that not precisely what we do on the Internet?'' said Luis
Angel Largo, who heads the Asociacion Amigos del Pisuerga, a
religious group in Valladolid, Spain. The organization is urging
the pope to pick Regalado _ who, as it happened, lived in
Valladolid.
</P>
<P>
   There is no official word from the Vatican, where the Pontifical
Council for Social Communication and the Congregation for Divine
Worship and Services sometimes designate patron saints. But the
Papacy does not have to give its seal of approval to such a
selection.
</P>
<P>
   More often, patron saints _ who already have been canonized _
are picked through popular devotion or custom. They become viewed
as a protector of a place, occupation, or activity. St. Francis,
for instance, was a nature lover who became the patron of
ecologists.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, saints are credited with an ability to aid
people with a particular malady, such as St. Giles, a disabled
priest said to have special sympathy for those who are similarly
afflicted.
</P>
<P>
   St. Clare of Assisi is the patron saint of television because
one Christmas, too ill to leave her bed, she allegedly saw and
heard a Christmas Mass miles away.
</P>
<P>
   The question of whether the Internet needs a saint is generating
hot debate in the plugged-in crowd, Catholics and non-Catholic
alike.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1369 Coffeehouse in Cambridge, where several customers
had set up their laptops to work while sipping their java, some
thought the Net could benefit from divine oversight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could use a saint to get rid of all my spam mail,'' quipped
Teanna Babcock, 43, a teacher of boxing and martial arts in
Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps an Internet saint could help her upload more quickly, or
have less down time, Babcock mused. In any case, Isidore sounded
like a good choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope he's a secure server,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But others balked at the prospect of an ultimate webmaster.
</P>
<P>
   A few tables away, Anna Kazanjian, 35, a graduate student at
Bunker Hill Community College, was working on a physics assignment.
She thought a patron saint sounded too much like an exclusively
Catholic idea, and non-Catholics wouldn't take to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The essence of the Internet is that it's open to anybody,
regardless of their religious beliefs,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Others said many Internet users don't feel spiritually bereft.
And some wondered if the current nominees might be too old to guide
the ever-changing and unruly Web.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 30 billion screen-sized pages of all descriptions
available worldwide, the Internet is still the wild, wild West,
said Don Orifice, 46, executive director of the North Shore
Computer Society.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't sure Net surfers would want a saint, but, if they do,
he thought a better choice might be St. Anthony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't he the one you appeal to if you're lost, or trying to
find something?'' he said, adding that this is often the plight of
Web users.
</P>
<P>
   At Boston University, Mark Girolami, 27, a law student
specializing in classical and medieval studies, said an Internet
saint should be a more modern soul than Regalado or Isidore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Gates is the one who comes to mind,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Saint Bill?
</P>
<P>
   Even Groome thought someone such as Mohandas K. Gandhi, the
Indian nationalist revered for his message of nonviolence, would be
more appropriate. Or Dorothy Day, the founder of the ``Catholic
Worker,'' known for her deep commitment to peace, justice, and the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If ever there was a time to break open the Catholic
imagination, if ever there was a time to canonize a non-Catholic,
surely the time is now,'' he said. ``And what better subject than
the Internet, which crosses so many lines of class and culture?''

<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a sunny Monday outside Maine's Portland Harbor, World War
II was all but over and the seas were calm when Johnny Breeze, a
machinist aboard the USS Eagle, started working on a crossword
puzzle, and literally got blown out of his shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Breeze and 12 shipmates survived the explosion, but the
remaining 49 crew members went down with the ship on April 23,
1945, just days before the war in Europe ended. The force of the
blast lifted the 200-foot long ship three feet in the air and
snapped it in half.
</P>
<P>
   The blast continues to reverberate 55 years later as relatives
of some victims continue to suspect a Navy coverup.
</P>
<P>
   The US Navy insists that a boiler explosion was to blame. But
Paul Lawton, a diver, wreck researcher and lawyer from Brockton,
Mass. who has spent almost three years sleuthing through records
and interviewing people who remember the blast, is convinced the
ship was hit by a torpedo from a German submarine.
</P>
<P>
   Lawton is trying to raise money for a diving expedition this
summer to inspect the wreck, which lies five miles off Cape
Elizabeth, in about 200 feet of water. He said he hopes to inspect
the boiler, rule it out, and even find shards of the torpedo.
</P>
<P>
   But the Navy, Lawton said, has not made his investigation easy.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago he started writing naval archives for copies of
the Navy's 1945 investigation into the sinking. Each request
brought the same response: Files lost. Then last fall, copies of
all the files he was searching for arrived in an unmarked envelope.
Someone, Lawton concluded, did not want to own up to the Eagle
story.
</P>
<P>
   To some, the question may seem academic; accident or act of war,
it's history. But to the one living survivor and a host of
relatives of those killed, proving the Eagle was torpedoed would
mean that the sailors were victims of enemy action, and entitled to
the Purple Heart.
</P>
<P>
   Lawton's interest in the case was ignited by his friend Robert
Westerlund, a retired Brockton firefighter whose father, Ivar, died
aboard the Eagle.
</P>
<P>
   ``People may not realize, despite all the years, how such
emotions can fester,'' Westerlund said. ``I have always lived with
shame that a mistake left Ma on her own to bring up four children.
Now there's hope that Dad did not die in vain.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieutenant Matt O'Neal, a Navy spokesman unfamiliar with the
ship, said that while it is difficult to reconstruct events from
more than 50 years ago, the record will be corrected if there is
proof that the Navy has it wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that could obviously include the awarding of Purple
Hearts, an honor we take seriously,'' O'Neal said.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagle was a submarine chaser living out the end of the war
pulling decoy targets for student pilots armed with harmless water
bombs. On April 23, 1945, the Soviets were in Berlin and Adolf
Hitler had disappeared. His U-boat _ or submarine _ fleet was no
longer considered a viable threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one had any doubt that the war in Europe was days from
ending,'' recalls Elaine Mitchell of Cherry Hill, N.J. In 1945 she
was 16 years old, her brother, Harold Rodman, was 21 _ ``a
wavy-haired hero,'' she said. Harold had survived invasions of
North Africa, Italy, and France. Just home from Europe, he told his
little sister: ``What could be safer than Portland Harbor?''
</P>
<P>
   Moments before he died, Harold Rodman was aboard a ship idling
between maneuvers. Breeze was in the aft crews quarters with his
puzzle. About the moment Breeze put a match to the Sir Walter
Raleigh tobacco in his pipe, the world blew up. When Breezecame
down from the ceiling, he was shoeless. Scenes come back to him
like images in a film loop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eight lunging steps to the ladder . . . 12 steps up . . . a
crew member shouting, `I'm gonna die' . . . no life jackets . . .
crawling up stern.''
</P>
<P>
   With him were four or five mates including Oscar Davis, a friend
and survivor who died a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look,'' Breeze recalls Davis saying to the group as they
paused on the upright stern, ``there's the sub.''
</P>
<P>
   Black and fully surfaced so that the length of its deck was
visible, the U-boat was several hundred yards to the east,
according to Breeze. Then the men jumped into the 38-degree water.
</P>
<P>
   Breeze recalls little after his jump except trying to swim away
before suction pulled him under. He grabbed onto a piece of wood.
About 20 minutes later, the destroyer USS Selfridge, which had been
conducting exercises in the area, arrived and picked up survivors.
Then the Selfridge got one strong ``ping'' on its sonar indicating
a target below. But after several depth charge attacks produced
nothing, the ship returned to Portland. Within an hour of Eagle's
sinking, almost a dozen Navy vessels were sweeping the area, but to
no avail.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve days later, a German U-boat sunk a coal freighter off
Newport _ and then got pounced upon and sunk by American
subchasers. (The hulk of the U-853 lies 12 miles off the coast.) By
this time, Breeze was home in Seattle on a leave; he never had to
return because, on May 8, the war in Europe was over _ painfully so
for one Phyllis Westerlund.
</P>
<P>
   ``I deeply regret to inform you,'' the Navy telegram to the wife
of Ivar Westerlund began shortly after the sinking, ``as a result
of an explosion . . . there is no hope for (your husband's)
survival.''
</P>
<P>
   Today she is remarried with a new name and a residence in
Wilksborough, N.C. But she said the memory of the sinking still
affects her deeply.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't recall precisely when the Navy officially attributed
the death to a boiler explosion, but it did, and I lived with it,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   And as sometimes happens, had it not been for two buddies on bar
stools gabbing away, the matter would have rested there.
</P>
<P>
   On a summer evening in 1997, Robert Westerlund, Ivar's son, and
Paul Lawton, a recreational diver, were drinking beer at Doyle's
Gourmet Deli and Pub in Brockton when Westerlund mentioned what he
considered the ``darnedest curiosity.'' He had grown up thinking an
accident killed his father. But while he was in Rhode Island, he
came across a small history book claiming the U-853 probably sank
the Eagle.
</P>
<P>
   Lawton returned home to check his submarine archives. His German
records concurred. Something, indeed, did not add up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mind you, I'm not one of these conspiracy nuts,'' the
36-year-old bachelor explained the other day, sitting on a
living-room rug cluttered with so many nautical charts and plotting
instruments it resembled a ship's navigation room. ``I'm a Yankee,
skeptical until I'm clubbed with facts.''
</P>
<P>
   He put a small classified ad in the Globe 18 months ago asking
for help locating Eagle survivors. A relative in the Boston area
contacted Breeze on the West Coast, who called Lawton and
eventually shared his tale of survival. Breeze's descriptions
matched those of other witnesses; the ferocity of the explosion
simply could not have come from boiler failure, they say. From 1945
until Breeze spoke with Lawton last spring, Breeze had assumed the
Navy attributed the sinking to a torpedo.
</P>
<P>
   When Lawton finally received the Navy's record of the
investigation, he _ a civil litigation lawyer _ immediately spotted
indications that investigators had steered witnesses toward a
mechanical mishap and away from submarines. The telltale kicker was
this: The Navy did not issue any advisories on how a similar
accident could be avoided on other ships.
</P>
<P>
   Lawton's theory?
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably total embarrassment by an American commander led to a
coverup,'' Lawton answered. ``Here was a U-boat that had penetrated
defenses at the end of the war, practically docked in Portland,
inflicted casualtites, then scooted away.''
</P>
<P>
   On a wall of Robert Westerlund's living room hangs a framed poem
that concludes:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So goodnight my love, and my children, too
</P>
<P>
   . . . I hope and pray that there will come a day
</P>
<P>
   that I'll be home safely to you.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was written by Robert's father and mailed with the last
letter home. A Purple Heart, says Robert, would mean closure. At
least a part of his Dad would be safely home.

 (PLEASE NOTE: This article has been transmitted twice _ into the
``t'' travel news and ``l'' lifestyle news files.)  
 &HT;    
 By EVERETT POTTER  
 &HT;    There are hundreds of Web sites that claim to make travel
better, cheaper and faster. But no one needs to visit all of them
to plan a trip. The fact is that many of these sites duplicate each
other, others are blatantly commercial and many are just not very
good.
 &HT;    To keep life simple on the Internet, here are eight travel sites
worth bookmarking. They each do one thing very well. But
paradoxically, in doing so, they're the veritable Pandora's box
that a good Web site should also be.
 TRAVELOCITY.COM AND EXPEDIA.COM  
 &HT;    The first thing everyone needs in their travel tool kit is a
proactive site, so start with an online travel agency.
 &HT;    Travelocity.com and Expedia.com are the best of the bunch. Both
of them are easy to use, with relatively uncluttered home pages and
clear graphics. They have information that a user can access at a
glance, without spending a lot of time trying to figure out the
site. At this stage of research, travelers need less to read, not
more.
 &HT;    Both Travelocity.com and Expedia.com have a rare and welcome
professionalism. Their fare-finders, the meat and potatoes of such
sites, allows users to plan round-trip flights, as well as
itineraries with multicity stops.
 &HT;    They give users the power to quickly change the time, date and
airport, and they come loaded with the fares of all the major
carriers, which saves travelers the considerable trouble of
visiting half a dozen airline-owned Web sites in the hunt for the
lowest fare.
 &HT;    Travelocity's ``Been There,'' a section written by Travelocity
employees, is like getting a postcard from a friend reporting on
their trip and brings a welcome narrative voice. Their ``Mountain
Resort Guide'' gives instant fares and snow depths from a home city
to ski destinations.
 &HT;    Users can quickly read the different airline's baggage
restrictions at a glance and learn how to grab the seat of their
choice when they book a flight.
 &HT;    Expedia's Fare Calendar allows users to look months ahead to
find the cheapest fares between two airports. The site's Airport
Survival Guide is an airport-by-airport guide that shows
restaurants, gate locations and airport hotels.
 &HT;    Expedia.com also offers a fare-finder to a vast range of hotels,
thanks to the company's recent acquisition of travelscape.com. They
now have access to thousands of hotels at so-called ``preferred
rates'' of 20 to 70 percent off the published rate.
 &HT;    Their new Golf Travel section, done in conjunction with
TheGolfer.com, means that golfers can book travel and tee time to
more than 11,000 courses around the country.
 SMARTERLIVING.COM  
 &HT;    Most active travelers are already receiving free e-mail
notifications from airlines such as American, Continental,
Northwest, TWA and U.S. Airways.
 &HT;    Every week, these airlines offer many international and domestic
sale fares, mostly last-minute deals for quick getaways. But as
convenient as that may seem, it's still necessary to scroll through
dozens of fares, regulations and restrictions in order to reach
those that apply to a traveler's home airport. That's why every
busy traveler should sign up for free e-mails from
Smarterliving.com (smarterliving.com).
 &HT;    This site culls and collates e-fares from most major carriers
and only sends out those that depart from a single airport or from
multiple airports near the traveler's home.
 &HT;    It also sends out deals from carriers such as Icelandair,
airlines that may not have weekend-only fares but offer
longer-lived specials with fewer restrictions.
 DIGITAL CITY  
 &HT;    Digital City (www.digitalcities.com) is easily the best city
guide on the Web. The site hones in on the dining, shopping and
movie listings for more than 60 cities nationwide, with links to
local papers and local reviewers. It's a great site for travelers
who want to feel like a local.
 &HT;    If someone wants to know what's playing off-Broadway, or when
the Cleveland Indians are in their hometown or where to find the
best Mexican food in Phoenix, this is the place to go.
 QUIKBOOK  
 &HT;    For a city weekend getaway, check out the discount hotel broker
Quikbook (www.quikbook.com). Figure on discounts from 15 to 40
percent off published rates in major U.S. city hotels in 15 cities
(based on availability, of course).
 &HT;    New York, Orlando, San Francisco and Seattle are among the towns
in which they operate. They have competition, of course, like Hotel
Reservations Network (http://www.180096hotel.com), but Quikbook
seems better informed, with a Web site that cuts to the chase.
 CULTUREFINDER.COM  
 &HT;    CultureFinder.com (www.culturefinder.com) can tell travelers
who's starring in the Indiana Repertory Theatre, what the Alhambra
Dinner Theatre in Jacksonville is performing or how to find New
York City Opera tickets, with more than 350,000 events listed.
 FAMILY.COM  
 &HT;    For family travel, Family.com (www.family.com) is Disney's site
and has vacation advice of all kinds, helping parents plan trips by
location and by type. It's smart and savvy, for those traveling
with teens or tots.
 YAHOO.COM  
 &HT;    Finally, for travelers who need to find the British Tourist
Authority, a fly-fishing guide in Montana or a ferry schedule for
Monhegan Island, Maine, there's Yahoo (www.yahoo.com).
 &HT;    Yes, there are loads of other search engines, from Lycos
(www.lycos.com) and Dogpile (www.dogpile.com) to Infoseek
(www.inforseek.com), Ask Jeeves (www.askjeeves,com) and Alta Vista
(www.altavista.com). But Yahoo is a powerful timesaver _ and saving
time is really what it's all about.

8 WEB SITES MAKE TRAVEL PLANNING SIMPLE  
 &HT;

 &HT;    
 (PLEASE NOTE: This article has been transmitted twice _ into the
``t'' travel news and ``l'' lifestyle news files.)  
 &HT;    
 By EVERETT POTTER  
 &HT;    There are hundreds of Web sites that claim to make travel
better, cheaper and faster. But no one needs to visit all of them
to plan a trip. The fact is that many of these sites duplicate each
other, others are blatantly commercial and many are just not very
good.
 &HT;    To keep life simple on the Internet, here are eight travel sites
worth bookmarking. They each do one thing very well. But
paradoxically, in doing so, they're the veritable Pandora's box
that a good Web site should also be.
 TRAVELOCITY.COM AND EXPEDIA.COM  
 &HT;    The first thing everyone needs in their travel tool kit is a
proactive site, so start with an online travel agency.
 &HT;    Travelocity.com and Expedia.com are the best of the bunch. Both
of them are easy to use, with relatively uncluttered home pages and
clear graphics. They have information that a user can access at a
glance, without spending a lot of time trying to figure out the
site. At this stage of research, travelers need less to read, not
more.
 &HT;    Both Travelocity.com and Expedia.com have a rare and welcome
professionalism. Their fare-finders, the meat and potatoes of such
sites, allows users to plan round-trip flights, as well as
itineraries with multicity stops.
 &HT;    They give users the power to quickly change the time, date and
airport, and they come loaded with the fares of all the major
carriers, which saves travelers the considerable trouble of
visiting half a dozen airline-owned Web sites in the hunt for the
lowest fare.
 &HT;    Travelocity's ``Been There,'' a section written by Travelocity
employees, is like getting a postcard from a friend reporting on
their trip and brings a welcome narrative voice. Their ``Mountain
Resort Guide'' gives instant fares and snow depths from a home city
to ski destinations.
 &HT;    Users can quickly read the different airline's baggage
restrictions at a glance and learn how to grab the seat of their
choice when they book a flight.
 &HT;    Expedia's Fare Calendar allows users to look months ahead to
find the cheapest fares between two airports. The site's Airport
Survival Guide is an airport-by-airport guide that shows
restaurants, gate locations and airport hotels.
 &HT;    Expedia.com also offers a fare-finder to a vast range of hotels,
thanks to the company's recent acquisition of travelscape.com. They
now have access to thousands of hotels at so-called ``preferred
rates'' of 20 to 70 percent off the published rate.
 &HT;    Their new Golf Travel section, done in conjunction with
TheGolfer.com, means that golfers can book travel and tee time to
more than 11,000 courses around the country.
 SMARTERLIVING.COM  
 &HT;    Most active travelers are already receiving free e-mail
notifications from airlines such as American, Continental,
Northwest, TWA and U.S. Airways.
 &HT;    Every week, these airlines offer many international and domestic
sale fares, mostly last-minute deals for quick getaways. But as
convenient as that may seem, it's still necessary to scroll through
dozens of fares, regulations and restrictions in order to reach
those that apply to a traveler's home airport. That's why every
busy traveler should sign up for free e-mails from
Smarterliving.com (smarterliving.com).
 &HT;    This site culls and collates e-fares from most major carriers
and only sends out those that depart from a single airport or from
multiple airports near the traveler's home.
 &HT;    It also sends out deals from carriers such as Icelandair,
airlines that may not have weekend-only fares but offer
longer-lived specials with fewer restrictions.
 DIGITAL CITY  
 &HT;    Digital City (www.digitalcities.com) is easily the best city
guide on the Web. The site hones in on the dining, shopping and
movie listings for more than 60 cities nationwide, with links to
local papers and local reviewers. It's a great site for travelers
who want to feel like a local.
 &HT;    If someone wants to know what's playing off-Broadway, or when
the Cleveland Indians are in their hometown or where to find the
best Mexican food in Phoenix, this is the place to go.
 QUIKBOOK  
 &HT;    For a city weekend getaway, check out the discount hotel broker
Quikbook (www.quikbook.com). Figure on discounts from 15 to 40
percent off published rates in major U.S. city hotels in 15 cities
(based on availability, of course).
 &HT;    New York, Orlando, San Francisco and Seattle are among the towns
in which they operate. They have competition, of course, like Hotel
Reservations Network (http://www.180096hotel.com), but Quikbook
seems better informed, with a Web site that cuts to the chase.
 CULTUREFINDER.COM  
 &HT;    CultureFinder.com (www.culturefinder.com) can tell travelers
who's starring in the Indiana Repertory Theatre, what the Alhambra
Dinner Theatre in Jacksonville is performing or how to find New
York City Opera tickets, with more than 350,000 events listed.
 FAMILY.COM  
 &HT;    For family travel, Family.com (www.family.com) is Disney's site
and has vacation advice of all kinds, helping parents plan trips by
location and by type. It's smart and savvy, for those traveling
with teens or tots.
 YAHOO.COM  
 &HT;    Finally, for travelers who need to find the British Tourist
Authority, a fly-fishing guide in Montana or a ferry schedule for
Monhegan Island, Maine, there's Yahoo (www.yahoo.com).
 &HT;    Yes, there are loads of other search engines, from Lycos
(www.lycos.com) and Dogpile (www.dogpile.com) to Infoseek
(www.inforseek.com), Ask Jeeves (www.askjeeves,com) and Alta Vista
(www.altavista.com). But Yahoo is a powerful timesaver _ and saving
time is really what it's all about.

THE MATURE TRAVELER: WALKING MAKES TRAVEL A PERSONAL EXPERIENCE

 &HT;    
 By ADELE MALOTT 
 Condensed from The Mature Traveler Newsletter 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    It was a wrong turn, but one that led to an unforgettable
adventure. Instead of heading toward the museum, the couple came
upon a charming Parisian neighborhood filled with houses of
distinctive local architecture and quaint shops, like the bakery
with its aroma of baking bread that teased both the nose and taste
buds.
 &HT;    They couldn't help themselves, so they entered the shop to buy a
baguette. Before the bread was bagged they were engrossed in
conversation with the owner, who provided directions to a creative
jeweler down the street.
 &HT;    It was a morning of discovery for the couple from Nevada, who
found themselves taking an impromptu walking tour of a Parisian
suburb. And they still enjoy relating the experience to friends.
They remember every detail _ the baker's attire, the taste of the
bread, the bracelet displayed so proudly at the jewelry store, even
the dampness of the freshly washed sidewalks.
 &HT;    A walking tour is a popular way for mature travelers to explore
a vacation destination because it enables them to immerse
themselves in local culture, try local foods, stay in
bed-and-breakfasts or inns and talk with the people who actually
live and work in the region. It is an intimate form of travel that
stresses camaraderie of small groups and gives those who
participate the feeling of personal accomplishment.
 &HT;    A number of travel companies offer walking journeys. Some
specialize in trips just for those ages 50 and over, or just for
women, while others concentrate on particular regions, such as the
English Lake District, or areas of special interest, such as
gardens, wines or architecture.
 &HT;    Some companies, such as Abercrombie &AMP; Kent, are large; others
are operated by a one-person group leader who has an in-depth
knowledge of a country or a hobby. And the company names are
wonderful: Walking the World, Back Roads, Walk Your Way Into the
Heart of England, Country Walkers, Look Again Tours, English
Ramblers, The Wayfarers.
 TOURS FOR THE SENIOR SET  
 &HT;    Ask your travel agent to help you find the right walking tour
for your interests and abilities. The following companies offer
tours created especially for mature travelers:
 &HT;     _ Walking the World  has hiking trips just for seniors with
destinations that include Utah's parklands, Hawaii's volcanos, New
Zealand's Milford Track and Provence, France, among others. For
more information: (800) 340-9255; www.walkingtheworld.com.
 &HT;     _ Walk Your Way into the Heart of England.  Rosemary Quick, who
grew up in England, leads a few low-key hikes through places such
as the Cotswolds, Dorset Villages and the Lake District. Most trips
are easy _ more like strolls than walks _ and many are described as
``circular walks,'' which means they begin and end in the same
village and average five miles. Quick's walking tours for 2000
start with a trip on the Isle of Wight from May 11 to 22. For more
information: (970) 881-2709; Rosemary Davenport Quick, P.O. Box
231, Red Feather Lakes, Colo. 80545.
 &HT;     _ ElderTreks'  series of worldwide trips, which are limited to
active seniors, often includes backpacking and camping out in
places such as the Australian Outback, Borneo and the Galapagos
Islands. The 2000/2001 brochure showcases 36 trips, each rated by
the level of activity. For more information: (800) 741-7956;
www.eldertreks.com.
 &HT;     _ Mount Robson Adventure Holidays' ``Fifty Plus Adventures'' 
include short scenic walks in the shadow of Canada's highest peak,
plus birdwatching, canoeing and rafting. While tour dates haven't
been finalized for 2000, tours are likely to take place toward the
end of June. Each 14-day trip, priced at $719, double occupancy,
includes a canoe trip, a rafting float trip and guided hikes. For
more information: (250) 566-4386.
 &HT;     _ Nifty Over-Fifty Tours , led by Jan Coyle, bring participants
to New Zealand. This year, Coyle is expanding her company's
offerings with a ``Springtime in Australia'' tour from Oct. 13 to
27. For more information: (650) 595-2090; www.pacificpathways.com.
 &HT;     _ Look Again Tours of Sacramento  offers annual walking trips
to the British Isles for those ages 50 and older. For more
information: (916) 448-7202; e-mail lookagain(AT)midtown.net.
 &HT;     _ Going Places  develops walking trips for women ages 50 to 55.
A dozen walking trips are planned this year, from Scotland on June
2 to Vermont (to see the turning of the leaves) in late September.
 &HT;    The easiest trips offered by Going Places require less than
eight miles of walking per day on flat or rolling terrain. For more
information: (707) 935-0595; www.goingplacestours.com.
 YOUR STAMINA  
 &HT;    Each travel company works hard at educating prospective
tour-goers about the amount of walking that is required for each
trip and the geography to be covered. Many evaluate the difficulty
of their own tours. For example, a typical scale from one of these
companies might rate a trip ``easy'' if it covers four to six miles
per day on gentle terrain, such as the Coast of Maine or the
Galapagos Islands.
 &HT;    A ``moderate'' walking trip might require five to 10 miles of
walking per day over rolling to hilly terrain, with some ascents to
1,200 feet.
 &HT;    A ``challenging'' tour might include six to 12 miles each day
over hilly, rugged terrain that can hit altitudes beyond 1,200
feet. The pace is calculated at about 2.5 miles an hour.
 &HT;    A leader of a well-run tour will match the day's walk to the
group's abilities, weather and the terrain to be found underfoot.
 &HT;    One enthusiast described the lodges where he stayed each night
as ``real hotels'' _ inns or bed-and-breakfast establishments with
an owner on site who knew the area.
 &HT;    Support vans and wagons carry tour-goers' luggage, with one van
often designated as the ``sag wagon'' to transport those who find
the day's activities too rigorous.
 &HT;    Some walking trips are combined with other aspects of travel.
For example, walking tours on the Galapagos Islands are often
combined with island cruises. A walk in the French countryside
might include a barge trip on a river through wine country. Many
walking tours give travelers a day off during the week so that they
can take a tour, ride a boat or rent a car for some personal
explorations.
 &HT;    With nearly 30 million pairs of walking shoes sold in the United
States, and with nearly 15 million Americans claiming to be fitness
walkers, walking tours may very well be the future of leisure
travel.
 &HT;    -----
 SIDEBAR: TRAINING AND GEAR  
 &HT;    _ Before booking any walking tour, consult your doctor about
your physical fitness and the difficulty of your tour of choice.
 &HT;    _ Three to four weeks before the trip, take walking tours of
your own neighborhood in some measured fashion. Use your car's
speedometer to determine the actual length of your walks. These
local strolls will help build your endurance _ and break in your
walking boots.
 &HT;    _ Think about what you'll need to purchase before taking your
tour. Items to consider: a backpack or fanny pack, rain gear, a
camera and binoculars.

your own neighborhood in some measured fashion. Use your car's
speedometer to determine the actual length of your walks. These
local strolls will help build your endurance _ and break in your
walking boots.
 &HT;    _ Think about what you'll need to purchase before taking your
tour. Items to consider: a backpack or fanny pack, rain gear, a
camera and binoculars.

&HT;     COMMUNITY SHOWS LITTLE SYMPATHY FOR CONVICTED RAPIST, KILLER 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JIM HERRON ZAMORA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COTTONWOOD, Calif. _ There is a short stretch of Interstate 5 in
Northern California that brings back the pain for Sharon and David
Tidwell.
</P>
<P>
   It is a nondescript freeway bridge over a steep ravine just
south of Mount Shasta where 22 years ago the Tidwells' daughter,
Annette Selix, was thrown to her death at age 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't drive by with getting hurt by the memories,'' David
Tidwell said. ``It's just too much for us. I can't bear to go by
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Darrell Keith Rich, 45, the man convicted of raping Selix and
then tossing her off the bridge 100 feet to her death, is scheduled
to be executed early Wednesday. He will be the eighth person to die
in California since capital punishment resumed in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Rich grew up about mile from the Tidwells' home in Cottonwood, a
community south of Redding. Plenty of people knew Rich, but no one
knows how he turned out so bad.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1978, he killed Selix and three women and raped
five others.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a reign of terror,'' said Shasta County Sheriff's Lt.
Bradd McDannold, who also grew up in Cottonwood and knew both the
Rich and Tidwell families. ``Women were being attacked that summer
at random. He terrorized everyone in this community. People were
panic-stricken. We never had much crime here, and then all the
sudden women are disappearing.''
</P>
<P>
   Many residents of Redding, Cottonwood and other small towns in
Shasta County recall the case.
</P>
<P>
   Rich was adopted and grew up in Cottonwood, an unincorporated
ranching community about 220 miles northeast of San Francisco and
18 miles south of Redding.
</P>
<P>
   McDannold said that Rich's father ran a welding shop and
repaired farm equipment for just about every family in the area.
After high school, Rich worked for his dad and did other odd jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all knew him,'' McDannold said. ``He did some of the rowdy
things kids do at that age, but there wasn't anything real violent
in his background.''
</P>
<P>
   But the 23-year-old Rich erupted with sexual violence during the
summer of 1978. He started by raping a woman on June 13. Then he
sexually attacked two others in the next two weeks. On July 4, he
committed his fourth rape. Later that day he struck again, this
time killing his victim. He raped Annette Edwards, 19, then bashed
in her skull.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, he grabbed a 15-year-old girl who was riding
her bike in Red Bluff. He raped and beat her, but she survived.
</P>
<P>
   That August, he sexually assaulted and killed two women,
Patricia ``Pam'' Moore, 17, in Redding and Linda Slavik, 27, whom
he met in a bar in Chico. He killed her after showing her Moore's
body.
</P>
<P>
   Slavik's parents, Waldo and Twyla Yates, said they had
nightmares about her death.
</P>
<P>
   Her son, Chris Slavik, declined to be interviewed. But he wrote
a letter to the Board of Prison Terms stating his opposition to
Rich's plea for clemency. He was 9 at the time of his mother's
death and spent years in therapy. He said the killing had caused
him to lose both parents because his grief-stricken father had
drifted into a life of alcohol and drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Annette Selix was Rich's final victim.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the one crime that offended people here the most,''
McDannold said. ``How could he kill that little girl?''
</P>
<P>
   McDannold and his colleague Rusty Brewer caught Rich after the
killer reported to the police that he had innocently stumbled onto
the bodies of Slavik and Moore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't believe him,'' McDannold said. ``We were suspicious
right away.''
</P>
<P>
   They got a detailed confession from Rich 10 days after Selix
died.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he never told me why,'' McDannold said.
</P>
<P>
   There is little sympathy for Rich in Cottonwood.
</P>
<P>
   The Tidwells, the Yateses and many others testified in favor of
executing Rich in a hearing last week in Sacramento before the
Board of Prison Terms, which then made a confidential
recommendation to Gov. Gray Davis on whether to approve Rich's plea
for clemency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult for me to envision a more worthy candidate for
the death penalty than Mr. Rich,'' said Shasta County District
Attorney McGregor Scott.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, a Democrat, denied the clemency request Friday, making it
nearly certain that Rich will die on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is absolutely nothing about Mr. Rich's brutal behavior
that warrants clemency,'' Davis said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   No governor has accepted such a plea in the eight years since
executions have returned to California.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1980, when the jury convicted Rich and ruled that he
should die, Rich has had little success in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``To even the most hardened eye, the crimes were almost
unimaginably brutal _ savage attacks on defenseless young women,
all sexually ravaged,'' a federal appeals judge, Michael Daly
Hawkins, wrote in a March 1999 ruling upholding Rich's death
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The last Californian to be executed was Manuel Babbitt, killed
by injection last May for killing a 78-year-old Sacramento woman
during a robbery and attempted rape in 1980.

   MEANS-COLUMN (Washington) _ Vice President Gore has challenged
Gov. George W. Bush to twice-weekly debates from now until Election
Day, surely too much of a good thing. There's a catch, of course.
Gore's offer was conditioned on Bush's agreement to abandon those
30-and 60-second attack ads. Bush isn't biting; he loves those ads
and he is not keen on debating Gore, a master of the form. Pushing
the idea can make Gore look aggressive and Bush defensive, but
keeping it up until November might drive us all nuts. By MARIANNE
MEANS.

from five regional primaries to a series of five primaries based on
the sizes of the states, from the smallest 10 (which would allow
New Hampshire to go first) to the largest 10, a primary that would
ultimately decide the party choices. (Crowley, Palm Beach Post).

   LEWIS-BEHAVIOR _ Nothing is more predictable in a case like the
one involving football star Ray Lewis than this: Eyewitness
accounts will vary. ``That's the problem with a chaotic, dimly lit
scene,'' said defense attorney Jack Martin. ``It would be more
suspicious if everyone had the same story.'' And the stories do
vary widely in the case of the street melee that occurred in the
early morning hours after the Super Bowl near a Buckhead nightclub,
leaving two men, Jacinth Baker and Richard Lollar, stabbed to
death. (Torpy, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED

<P>
   And then there were two. ``Super Tuesday'' has left America,
predictably, with a choice between Al Gore and George W. Bush. They
won by showing that they are regular party animals. And that, for
the United States, is where the problem lies. The country is
undergoing its greatest social and demographic changes in a
century. Neither political party has come to terms with these
changes. Curiously, the oldest man running for president, John
McCain, was the one who most clearly understood the future. But now
he is gone, and it's back to ``politics as usual.'' &QL;

   Since the death of General Franco in 1975, Spain has been a
stirring success story and it will surely continue to be so,
whoever wins the general election on March 12. Spain under Jose
Maria Aznar is generally riding high. Politically stable,
economically prosperous, it is gaining respect in the world. Odd,
then, that Aznar is not assured another term. History, it seems,
determines that Spain's heart still beats on the left. &QL;

   ``Super Tuesday'' saw more than just the triumph of the two
establishment candidates. It saw the triumph of the ultimate
establishment: dynasticism. Political dynasties are in retreat in
most of the rest of the world. The Nehrus no longer rule India.
Britain is retiring its hereditary peers. Indonesia has kissed the
Suhartos goodbye. But in the country that was born of a revolution
against George III, the next presidential election will be fought
between two crown princes, George II and Albert II. &QL;

   In local mythology, the vast woods of northern Minnesota were
once patrolled by a huge lumberjack named Paul Bunyan. Legend had
it he was ten times taller than the tallest trees. Now, for more

Paul Bunyan is slowly dying out in Minnsota. &QL;

Capitol in Tallahassee denounced his One Florida initiative, a plan
to end affirmative action in Florida's colleges. &QL;

when it did, in getting away with fraud. Things are changing
though, and Mexico's media are well on the road to freedom; the
road to quality may prove to be much longer. &QL;

seems premature, but that has not stopped several Venezuelans from
musing aloud about the ironic possibility. &QL;

   Art boosters in Texas have long boasted that their state was a
``third coast'' of contemporary art in America. Yet they were never
really able to convince New York or California to take them
seriously _ until now. On March 23, the 2000 Biennial Exhibition
opens at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York. The show
will feature nine artists from the Lone Star State, the largest
number of Texas artists ever in a Biennial, and the largest from
any one state outside of New York and California. &QL;

   Anyone who thinks this year's American election campaign is
particularly dirty should read a new book, ``American Dreamer: A
Life of Henry A. Wallace,'' and think again. When Henry Wallace,
Franklin D. Roosevelt's third-term vice president, had the temerity
to break away from the Democratic Party and run on the Progressive
ticket in 1948, he was ruthlessly demonized as a wild-eyed fanatic
bent on destroying the American way of life. &QL;

   Nobody doubts it anymore. The marriage of the mobile telephone

America and Europe without an announcement of a new alliance
between dot.coms, telecoms firms and computer companies, all
jostling for advantage in the brave new world around the corner.
Yet, despite the buzz, the embarrassing truth is that while the
Americans and Europeans have been talking, NTT DoCoMo, Japan's
dominant mobile operator, has been doing: turning the wireless
Internet into reality. &QL;

   For now, there is only one serious candidate left in the running
for the leadership of Germany's Christian Democratic Union (CDU).
After the withdrawal on March 5 of Volker Ruhe, Angela Merkel, the
party's general secretary, has become the hot favorite among the
rank and file. But in the eyes of the CDU leadership and of its
conservative Bavarian sister party, Mrs. Merkel suffers from two
grave drawbacks: she comes from the former communist east, and _
god forbid _ she is a woman. &QL;

<P>
   And then there were two. ``Super Tuesday'' has left America with
a choice between Al Gore and George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Gore won the Democratic nomination easily, seeing
off Bill Bradley, a well-funded but slightly worthy former senator.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Bush, who only a few months ago was coasting
towards the Republican nomination, has been put through the wringer
by John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican battle ended in bitterness, recrimination and a
good deal of electoral slime, most of it thrown by Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is the more bloodied and muddied of the two. But neither he
nor Gore, each of whom started the race as a moderate with some
reputation for personal decency, has emerged with dignity.
</P>
<P>
   Gore twisted Bradley's record on health care just as maliciously
as Bush twisted McCain's on breast-cancer research. Both men also
veered to the extremes. Gore's pandering to unions on ``fair
trade'' was less offensive than Bush's decision to speak at an
anti-Catholic university, but may be harder to recant.
</P>
<P>
   Some claim that such posturing is a necessary evil; once in
office, either man would be more pragmatic. That leap of faith may
turn out to be justified (though Gore's extraordinary book on the
environment represents a huge and troubling question mark).
</P>
<P>
   On the basis of the nominees' conduct so far on the campaign
trail, only two things can clearly be advanced in their favor. The
first is that both men _ each a scion of a political dynasty _ have
shown that they really want to be president. The second is that
they are good representatives of their respective parties.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's loyalty has been unswerving. If there is any point of
Democratic orthodoxy that the vice president has sought to
overturn, his protest has been inaudible to the human ear.
</P>
<P>
   Bush once seemed a reformer. A self-proclaimed ``compassionate
conservative,'' he trumpeted education reform, reached out to
minorities and scolded the Republicans in Congress for trying to
balance the budget on the backs of the poor. The primary campaign
has seen him scamper back to the hinterland of his party.
</P>
<P>
   Like Gore, Bush has won the nomination by showing that he is a
regular party animal. And that, for the United States, is where the
problem lies.
</P>
<P>
   This has always been a restless place _ a ``permanently
unfinished country.'' But right now the changes seem particularly
great. Put aside the argument about how much technology and
globalization are changing economics; they are certainly changing
business, and beginning to change society.
</P>
<P>
   Who would have guessed even a year ago that America Online, a
company only 15 years old, would be able to take over the country's
biggest entertainment empire, Time Warner?
</P>
<P>
   The country is also undergoing its greatest demographic change
for a century. In 50 years' time, one in three Americans will be a
Latino or an Asian. In an age when human capital is paramount,
these ``new Americans'' represent the country's future.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Democrats nor the Republicans have come to terms
with these changes. Indeed, there is a worrying correlation between
the places where the New America is being forged (be it Silicon
Valley or the barrios of Los Angeles) and a high level of apathy
about conventional party politics.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties are beholden to special interests, from the
fundamentalist Christian right to the public-sector unions, that
seem to come from prehistory.
</P>
<P>
   In Silicon Valley, people are already talking about party
politics going the same way as the dinosaurs: Jefferson's yeoman
farmer will be reborn, this time with a laptop, ready to vote in
instant electronic plebiscites.
</P>
<P>
   That seems a little far off. Politics tends to lag behind
commerce. Still, parties need to adapt _ just as they did, somewhat
belatedly, to the industrial revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The gains from adapting first could be enormous. The Republican
coalition put together by William McKinley in 1896, anchored on
what was then the new economy, helped keep the party in power for
most of the next 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, Palm Pilot on belt, now brags about the Internet, the
Spanish-speaking Bush about his record with Latinos. But both are
hamstrung by their parties and by their financiers.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's talk of education reform is severely limited by the
Democrats' huge reliance on the Neanderthal teachers' unions.
Bush's chances of depicting the Republicans as a more inclusive
party are mocked by the IOUs in his back pocket to ``the agents of
intolerance'' on the religious right.
</P>
<P>
   The new ideas in the campaign have come from the outsiders,
Bradley and especially McCain. Across the country, McCain
galvanized people into politics; in California, Republican Party
registration climbed for the first time in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   It is still unclear why the oldest man running for president was
the one who most clearly understood the future. But one hint is
surely the priority he gave to reforming America's corrupt
campaign-finance system, the epicenter of ``same old politics.''
</P>
<P>
   This is an issue that neither Gore nor Bush can approach with a
clear conscience.
</P>
<P>
   It is the McCain voters _ independents, Democrats who have no
truck with big government, Republicans who abhor their party's
moral posturing _ who are now crucial to the result of the
election.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever best manages to close the gulf between his party and
this new America will win. &QL;

PINOCHET AND CHILE'S UNFINISHED JUSTICE

<P>
   It was not quite the most miraculous recovery since Lazarus. But
when General Augusto Pinochet arose from his wheelchair to greet
his army friends at Santiago's airport on March 3, he was sprightly
enough to embarrass two governments.
</P>
<P>
   The episode seemed to cast a momentary doubt over Britain's
decision to release him from almost 17 months' detention, on the
ground that the elderly general was too ill for extradition or
trial.
</P>
<P>
   But the bigger irritation was to Ricardo Lagos, the moderate
socialist who is due to take over as Chile's president on March 11.
</P>
<P>
   The full-dress welcome organized by the army for a man who owed
his freedom not to a finding of innocence but to an act of mercy (a
quality rare in his own regime) was defiant.
</P>
<P>
   The message was clear: now that they have him back, Chile's
armed forces do not intend to allow the man who was their commander
until 1998 to face any further indignities, such as a trial for
torture, kidnapping or murder.
</P>
<P>
   Will he? A judge has asked Chile's Appeals Court to lift the
immunity he enjoys as a senator-for-life, to allow him to face
trial over the disappearance of 19 political prisoners after the
1973 coup against the Allende government. He faces 70 other legal
actions.
</P>
<P>
   But the general is also protected by an amnesty of 1978. Whether
that covers disappearances is unclear. The judge says it does not:
until the army reveals how the missing prisoners were killed (and
where they are buried), they are victims of the continuing crime of
kidnap, he argues.
</P>
<P>
   The outgoing government claimed loudly that General Pinochet
could be tried in Chile. Opinion polls suggest that a majority of
Chileans want that, but doubt it will happen.
</P>
<P>
   Lagos says the matter is one for the courts, not the government.
A tacit deal is likely: if the general stays quietly at home, and
does not try to reclaim his Senate seat, the government will not
press the courts to lift his immunity.
</P>
<P>
   Such pragmatism stems from the way the dictatorship ended in
1988-89. General Pinochet ceded power after losing a plebiscite. He
bequeathed a booming economy, and he retained the support of a
powerful minority of Chileans, who believed he had saved the
country from chaos and communism.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he could impose a restricted democracy, in which
the armed forces retain much political power and unelected senators
help the conservative opposition to block constitutional change.
</P>
<P>
   Even should he wish to, Lagos could not dismiss the army
commanders who organized the general's welcome-home party.
</P>
<P>
   This constitutional settlement is outdated. But Lagos must move
carefully. He won election by only a narrow margin against a
conservative rival. The economy is only just emerging from
recession; for many voters jobs and wages are the main issues.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a prosperous, self-confident Chile also needs justice,
democracy and the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   Like his predecessors, Lagos has said he will try to persuade
the opposition to agree to change the constitution's undemocratic
clauses. If he fails, he says he will put them to a plebiscite.
</P>
<P>
   He would be right to do so: the constitution itself stems from
three plebiscites organized by the dictatorship. But should he also
do more to ensure that General Pinochet faces trial?
</P>
<P>
   Many Chileans argue that the deal struck in 1988-89 should not
be overturned. Many others disagree. That deal was made with the
dictatorship still in command, and the democrats acting under
duress.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lagos and his fellow socialists have long since
recanted the extremism of the Allende period, the armed forces have
never admitted, let alone apologized for, the reign of terror they
inflicted on unarmed opponents in the aftermath of the coup.
</P>
<P>
   As long as they fail to do so, and to reveal the fate of the
disappeared, Chile will remain unreconciled. Until this changes,
the case for trying General Pinochet is strong, even if this means
putting the amnesty issue to a referendum too. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   If in doubt, join up. That seems to be the prevailing philosophy
in the marbled halls of Europe's banks.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank's planned takeover of its Frankfurt rival,
Dresdner Bank, to form the biggest bank in Europe, is only the
latest in a string of huge recent deals that have certainly made
investment-banking advisers happy.
</P>
<P>
   In France, Banque Nationale de Paris has acquired Paribas. In
Britain, Royal Bank of Scotland is taking over National Westminster
Bank.
</P>
<P>
   In Scandinavia, MeritaNordbanken, itself a Finnish-Swedish
creation, this week announced plans to buy Denmark's Unidanmark.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two years there have been similar marriages of
giants in Switzerland, Spain, the Benelux countries and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the linkups have been proclaimed with similar promises:
costs are to be cut, economies of scale reaped, European champions
created to take on the Americans. But the truth is that the deals
have usually been defensive, done out of fear not ambition.
</P>
<P>
   Europe's commercial banks have been making too little money in
retail banking, seeing too much corporate business migrate to rival
securities houses, and losing too many investment-banking battles
with American firms.
</P>
<P>
   Yet although several mergers, including Deutsche's with
Dresdner, may be sensible in their own terms, they will not solve
these underlying problems.
</P>
<P>
   The reason that Deutsche Bank has found retail banking at home
unrewarding is not that it is too small. It is that the market is
dominated by state-owned savings banks and subsidized Landesbanks.
</P>
<P>
   Now a new threat is emerging in the form of Internet banking
which, by dispensing with costly branches and staff, promises to
offer customers even cheaper financial services.
</P>
<P>
   Nor will promised cost-cutting be easy to deliver: Germany's
rigid labor laws and strong trade unions make it too hard and too
expensive to shed surplus workers.
</P>
<P>
   Greater size may be more helpful in corporate and investment
banking. But it will not stop companies taking advantage of the
huge expansion in European securities markets that the single
currency is fostering.
</P>
<P>
   Nor will putting together two European investment-banking
businesses make it easier for Deutsche to break into the ``bulge
bracket'' of Wall Street's biggest firms.
</P>
<P>
   It may have to look for yet another New York acquisition to put
alongside its earlier purchase of Bankers Trust _ although any
plausible target could prove both expensive and difficult to
digest.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the German government is disposed, just as other
European governments have been, to welcome their new national
banking champion.
</P>
<P>
   Europe's governments are certainly right to believe that banking
needs consolidation _ there are, for instance, twice as many bank
branches per head in Europe as in America. But if newly created
European champions are to thrive, the politicians will also have to
stop obstructing three other reforms.
</P>
<P>
   One is to level the retail banks' playing field by eliminating
both explicit and implicit subsidies to state-owned competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Yet far from doing this, the German government has for years
been bitterly fighting against the European Commission's attempt to
scrap state subsidies to the Landesbanks.
</P>
<P>
   The government, like most others in Europe, is also resisting
pressures to relax rigid labor-market laws that are hobbling not
just would-be banking champions but most of European industry,
which is in the throes of a long-overdue restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   The third big necessary change is to accept more cross-border
mergers.
</P>
<P>
   It is an open secret that, before turning to the domestic
courtship of Dresdner, Deutsche Bank tried to buy in France and
Italy, only to be rebuffed by nationalistically minded governments.
</P>
<P>
   So far only Scandinavia and the Benelux countries have seen
significant cross-border bank mergers. Yet even as the single
currency leads inexorably to a genuine single capital market in
Europe, the logic of having continent-wide banks to match is coming
to seem irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   The example of the United States, whose big banks are spreading
across the country, points the same way.
</P>
<P>
   So does the economics of the euro. One problem with a single
currency is that an external shock can hit some countries or
regions harder than others.
</P>
<P>
   If banks are concentrated regionally or nationally too, such a
shock is far more dangerous, because they are at much greater risk
of going under _ as experience in Texas and New England has shown.
</P>
<P>
   Spreading bank assets continent-wide is thus desirable not only
for would-be banking champions but also for the euro. Even the
proudest of European governments should welcome that. &QL;

   Since the death of dour General Franco in 1975, Spain has been a
stirring success story and it will surely continue to be so,
whoever wins the general election on March 12.
</P>
<P>
   One aspect of the success is that, perhaps for the first time,
few Spaniards truly tremble at the prospect of a victory by their
political opponents.
</P>
<P>
   It is a safe bet that neither Jose Maria Aznar's ruling
center-right People's Party nor decent Joaquin Almunia's Socialists
on the center-left would squander the gains of the past 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Socialists under Felipe Gonzalez who really got Spain
going in the 1980s, before their 14-year reign eventually dissolved
in a morass of corruption (involving, among other things,
government-linked death squads).
</P>
<P>
   It was Gonzalez who took Spain into NATO and the European Union,
and who set about freeing the economy and selling off the state. He
spruced up his party, dragged it to the middle ground and did much
to heal the wounds of history.
</P>
<P>
   Aznar has done just as well. He too has been sensitive to
history. He has continued to liberalize, while maintaining a
remarkable degree of social peace.
</P>
<P>
   He has piloted his country into Europe's single currency. And he
has reduced Spain's awful unemployment rate from 23 percent when he
took office to (a still painful) 15 percent: as many jobs have been
created in Spain under Aznar as in the rest of the EU.
</P>
<P>
   The average Spaniard is still appreciably poorer than the
average European, but the gap is closing steadily.
</P>
<P>
   Aznar, who was a provincial taxman before he entered politics,
lacks the fizz and personality of Gonzalez, and he can be ruthless.
But he is pretty straight. And he sets about the job with a
seriousness and single-mindedness that have suited the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, when Aznar was bidding for power, the left
sought to paint his lot as crypto-Francoists who would slash
welfare, hurt pensioners, puff up the rich, strengthen the hand of
the Castilian center at the expense of Spain's twitchy regions,
kill off failing state businesses wholesale, and provoke
confrontation with trade unionists on the barricades.
</P>
<P>
   None of this has happened.
</P>
<P>
   Heading only a minority government, Aznar has cooperated warily
with moderate Catalan nationalists to keep his party in power. He
has gone to great lengths to build a consensus for his reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if anything, he has been too cautious over such issues
as welfare, labor law and the tax system. If he wins again, he
should be more daring.
</P>
<P>
   Aznar's main failure has been his inability to solve the Basque
problem. Admittedly, this is not easy. Over the years, the Basques,
Catalans and others on Spain's rim have been given a large measure
of autonomy; there is not much more to give.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some Basques are still not satisfied; indeed, a minority are
prepared to pursue the goal of outright independence, against the
wishes of the majority, by murder.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult for any democrat to deal with such people.
Still, Aznar may have been too inflexible during a cease-fire by
the terrorists. He has refused to grant a referendum on what Basque
nationalists call self-determination, which they would lose if it
meant full independence.
</P>
<P>
   The constitution, he says, decrees that the Spanish state must
remain unitary _ and that is that.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Aznar has let the moderate Basque nationalists, who
are essential partners in any settlement, move closer to the
terrorists, to whom he refuses to talk unless they first disavow
violence completely.
</P>
<P>
   If he wins, he should quietly acknowledge that the terrorists
do, unfortunately, stand for a sizeable minority of Basques
(perhaps between a sixth and a seventh of the total, though their
boycott of this weekend's election means it will be impossible to
assess their true electoral strength); that they cannot be dealt
with purely by military means; and that the moderate nationalists
must again be solicited as crucial interlocutors.
</P>
<P>
   But in most other respects, Spain under Aznar is riding high. It
is a confident, modern-minded country that fights its corner in the
European Union with vigor and effectiveness. Politically stable,
economically prosperous, it is gaining respect in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Odd, then, that Aznar is not assured of another term. History,
it seems, determines that Spain's heart still beats on the left.
</P>
<P>
   An electoral pact between the Socialists and the Communists,
mortal enemies in Gonzalez's time, may help to broaden the appeal
of the left. The left may even win, though most opinion polls doubt
it. That would be a pity, though not a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Aznar deserves another term. &QL;

GEORGE II VS. ALBERT II: THE DANGER OF DYNASTIC POLITICS

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ ``Super Tuesday'' saw more than just the triumph of
the two establishment candidates. It saw the triumph of the
ultimate establishment principle: dynasticism.
</P>
<P>
   Dynasties are in retreat in most of the rest of the world. The
Nehrus no longer rule India. Britain is retiring its hereditary
peers. Indonesia has kissed the Suhartos goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   But in the country that was born of a revolution against George
III, the next presidential election will be fought between George
II and Albert II.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore's father was a long-serving senator who bullied his
local paper, the Tennessean, into splashing the news of his son's
birth on the front page.
</P>
<P>
   The crown prince then spent his childhood in Washington,
shuttling between his family's suite at the Fairfax Hotel and his
prep school, St. Alban's, passing his current official residence on
the way.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush is even grander, the son of a president, the
grandson of a senator and the relative, one way or another, of 15
presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Dynastic politics is hardly a new development in America, of
course. The sixth president, John Quincy Adams, was the son of the
second, John Adams; the 23rd president, Benjamin Harrison, was the
grandson of the ninth, William.
</P>
<P>
   The Roosevelts and Kennedys are only the most successful of a
flotilla of political dynasties that include the Rockefellers,
Tafts, Longs and Browns.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the dynastic principle sweeping all before it. The two
most important political figures of the past two decades, Ronald
Reagan and Bill Clinton, are both self-made men.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the dynastic principle looks as healthy today as it
ever has, perhaps healthier.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 contest will be the first all-dynastic race in American
history and the first all-Ivy-League race since 1912, says Stephen
Hess of the Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   Bush could be the first presidential son to end up in the White
House since 1824 (and the first one ever to do so as a member of
the same party as his dad).
</P>
<P>
   Newcomers are trying to start dynasties of their own. Hillary
Rodham Clinton seeks to trade on her husband's good name (if that
is the word for it) to become a senator for New York. Elizabeth
Dole could make a bid to be Bush's vice president.
</P>
<P>
   This is only the tip of the dynastic iceberg. Senior political
offices that have passed, albeit with interruptions, from father to
son include a Senate seat for Indiana and the mayoralty of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Frelinghuysen, a New Jersey congressman, is the sixth
generation of his family to serve in Congress. Members of the Udall
family hold House seats in both Colorado and New Mexico. (``Vote
for the Udall nearest you,'' jokes one of them.)
</P>
<P>
   The rising stars of the Democratic Party include Kathleen
Kennedy Townsend, Patrick Kennedy and Andrew Cuomo, the son of a
former governor of New York and the husband of a Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   The dynastic principle is proving itself more than a match for
the new politics of race and gender. Jesse Jackson junior is the
congressman for some of the grittiest bits of his father's old
stomping ground, Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the most prominent Latino members of the House, Charles
Gonzalez and Lucille Roybal-Allard, are the offspring of former
congressmen.
</P>
<P>
   It is so common for wives to inherit political perches from
their husbands when they die _ as Mary Bono did when Sonny died in
1998 _ that there is an academic study of the phenomenon entitled
``Over My Dead Body.'' &QL;

<P>
   Politics has simply discovered what detergent-powder
manufacturers have known for years: the value of a brand. People
who have earned fame in their own right _ such as J.C. Watts and
Bill Bradley in sports and Bob Kerrey and John McCain in combat _
are now much sought after.
</P>
<P>
   But a family name carries much the same ring. And Washington
princelings, no less than their Windsor equivalents, can also draw
on early training and powerful connections.
</P>
<P>
   As a child, Gore chatted with his father about monetary policy
rather than baseball, attended hearings of the transport bill that
created the interstate highway system and, on one occasion, sat on
Vice President Richard Nixon's lap while he presided over the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush learned how to fight dirty from one of his father's less
respectable friends, Lee Atwater; he also inherited much of his
father's political machine, including his chief strategist, Karl
Rove. &QL;

   It is hardly unusual for children to follow their parents into
the family business. And it is a little churlish to complain that
rich kids are going into politics rather than frittering away their
family fortunes, particularly given the dearth of talent in the
public sector.
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that the dauphins have to prove themselves
in hand-to-hand combat. Dynasties that lack the stomach for the
fight quickly disappear from the political stage. (One of America's
great autobiographies, ``The Education of Henry Adams,'' is a
meditation on this loss of appetite and influence.)
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore was thoroughly humiliated when he ran for his party's
nomination in 1988, and has suffered plenty more humiliations in
his eight years as Bill Clinton's understudy.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been bloodied by John McCain, just as his father was
bloodied by Bob Dole in 1988. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,100) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many a great feudal name was founded on a great crime and
maintained from generation to generation only by exquisite acts of
treachery and sycophancy. Bush and Gore have preserved that
tradition by proving that they are willing to do whatever it takes,
however despicable or duplicitous, to win office.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is hard not to worry about the continuing power of
America's dynasties.
</P>
<P>
   Neither George II nor Albert II is a natural politician, in the
way that Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton clearly were. Neither has,
as yet, found a compelling political vision, beyond furthering the
interests of the party machine and pleasing their fathers.
</P>
<P>
   And both can be a little smug. Jim Hightower's quip about George
senior _ ``he was born on third base and thinks he hit a triple'' _
is even truer of his son and his opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are worryingly detached from the political process,
voting in much lower numbers, proportionately, than people in most
other democracies. They may become more detached still if the
highest offices are monopolized by a charmed circle of families.
</P>
<P>
   And voters could become not just detached but disgusted if those
families succeed in preserving their position because they are
willing to descend further into the mud than anyone else. &QL;

AFFIRMATIVE ACTION IN FLORIDA: LOOK UNDER THE OTHER BUSH

<P>
   AUSTIN, TEXAS AND TALLAHASSEE, FLA. _ Inside Florida's
legislature, he was praised as a visionary reformer. Outside, he
was called a ``crucifier'' and a ``bigot.''
</P>
<P>
   As Governor Jeb Bush delivered Florida's annual
State-of-the-State address on March 7, 11,000 angry protesters on
the steps of the Capitol in Tallahassee denounced his One Florida
Initiative, a plan to end affirmative action _ racial preference
for non-Asian minorities _ in admitting students to the state's
public universities.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Jackson and Kweisi Mfume of the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) were among those who
spoke to a crowd holding signs reading ``End Racism Now'' and
``Pharaoh Bush: Let My People Go.''
</P>
<P>
   Their protests are unlikely to change things, since One Florida
has already been approved by the state's Board of Regents. In place
of racial preference, the top 20 percent of each high-school
graduating class in Florida will automatically be admitted to a
state university.
</P>
<P>
   The plan's proponents say this will set a more equitable
standard for admission and at the same time increase racial
diversity in the universities.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have attacked One Florida as a ``Jeb Crow'' law,
claiming that without affirmative action the proportion of
non-whites will plummet.
</P>
<P>
   If the critics look to the other state run by a Bush, Jeb's
brother George W., they will see that the evidence suggests
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, after a federal court had outlawed race-based selection
for its public universities, Texas introduced a scheme guaranteeing
university places to the top 10 percent of every high-school class.
</P>
<P>
   Although this was criticized by both the right and the left, it
has returned the rate of non-white enrollment to what it had been
before the court's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   At Texas's best state universities, the number of black freshmen
is now 23 percent higher than the figure in 1996, and the
proportion of blacks in all state universities, a tenth, is almost
the same as the proportion of blacks in Texas as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 percent rule has brought in recruits from high schools in
rural and other poor areas where the percentage of those going to
university has always been very low. But getting into university is
one thing, graduating from it is another.
</P>
<P>
   The critics of the 10 percent plan say it will dumb down the
university system. Since the ``Talented 10'' are admitted without
any standardized tests being taken into consideration, it is
argued, entrants from less rigorous high schools will not be able
to keep up with those from better ones.
</P>
<P>
   There are so far no reliable dropout data; but, ominously, the
University of Texas is spending millions of dollars on remedial
programs to help students at the greatest risk of dropping out.
</P>
<P>
   Although some opponents of affirmative action criticize the
Texas and Florida projects as mere half-measures, others are
delighted that a step has been taken in what they consider the
right direction.
</P>
<P>
   Abigail Thernstrom, a fellow at the Manhattan Institute and a
critic of racial preference, says that the two states have started
to tackle the central problem: how to end unpopular racial quotas
while preserving racial diversity at America's universities.
</P>
<P>
   She is still worried, though, that Florida's 20 percent from
each high school, compared with Texas's 10 percent, may be going
too far: by guaranteeing university admission to a fifth of every
high-school class, you could end up damaging academic standards.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Texas (and California, which recently put into place a 4
percent law), Florida is not taking this action because either the
courts or the voters have required it to.
</P>
<P>
   But a ballot initiative on the subject is being considered, and
Bush may have wanted to offer his One Florida plan as a preemptive
strike. This, he says, is a ``third way'' in the affirmative-action
row.
</P>
<P>
   His idea won cautious praise from leaders of Florida's
minorities when it was introduced last November. But Bush bungled
the public-relations campaign by refusing to meet prominent black
officials to discuss the plan.
</P>
<P>
   This led to sit-ins and student protests, and then the angry
rally in Tallahassee on March 7. Many of those at the rally said
they were there because they thought Bush was being imperiously
insensitive to the concerns of Florida's minorities.
</P>
<P>
   But the protesters know that affirmative action is under fire on
both the legal and the political fronts, and they have little power
to halt the attack. &QL;

LUMBERJACKS, GREENS AT LOGGERHEADS IN NORTHERN MINNESOTA  
 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   COOK, MINN. _ In local mythology, the vast woods of northern
Minnesota were once patrolled by a huge lumberjack named Paul
Bunyan. He was ten times taller than the tallest trees.
</P>
<P>
   He left lakes in his footprints. He commanded a crew of giant
loggers, all named Elmer, who sharpened their axes by holding them
against large stones rolling down hills. He had a huge pet blue ox
called Babe, and could cut down an acre of trees with a single
swing of his axe.
</P>
<P>
   Now, for more prosaic reasons, the lumberjack lifestyle that
created the myth of Paul Bunyan is slowly dying out.
</P>
<P>
   Blame, in part, the environmentalists, who have spent the past
several years trying to save forests from the careless hand of man.
Because they can do little to stop logging on private property,
they have focused their attention on public lands.
</P>
<P>
   Members of one such group, the Forest Guardians based in Santa
Fe, N.M., say they want to preserve wilderness and water quality
for future generations.
</P>
<P>
   They also argue that timber logged on public lands is too cheap,
and that this in turn discourages consumers from using recycled
alternatives to freshly harvested wood. Eventually, they want the
price of timber to rise to reflect the cost of extracting it from
the wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   For these and other reasons, the Guardians and similar groups
have appealed against hundreds of timber sales made across the
country by the United States Forest Service. Two years ago,
independent loggers began to see the effect of those appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1986, the Forest Service approved an annual harvest from
the Superior National Forest, along the Canadian border, of 97
million board-feet. But then the environmental groups began to step
up their protests.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Forest Service had neither the staff nor the resources
to cope with the growing number of appeals while also overseeing
the sale of timber on public land, it put the sales on hold until
the appeals could be heard.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, loggers in the Superior National Forest harvested a
mere 57.2 million board-feet.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota's lumberjacks have done better on private land.
Logging has increased by 60 percent in the state since the 1980s,
when the timber industry moved its operations over from the Pacific
Northwest in order to avoid continual warfare over old-growth
forests and spotted owls.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota's most-harvested wood, aspen, has long cells and
strong fibers, ideal for high-grade paper of the sort used for
magazines and copy machines.
</P>
<P>
   Timber is now northern Minnesota's lifeblood, an industry worth
$7 billion a year. Demand for wood is high, and, despite the
``paperless'' Internet, demand for paper products continues to
grow.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, independent loggers have seen their margins plummet
in recent years. Timber mills are using shorter-term contracts for
timber sales.
</P>
<P>
   Most loggers harvest when the land is frozen, but a run of mild
winters has melted the logging roads and made it impossible to
harvest the wood without scarring the land _ which, in turn, gives
environmentalists more cause for complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Loggers are also taking on a great deal of debt to buy more
efficient equipment. To pay off the debt, they need a consistent
cash flow. But there's the rub: they have to wait for the Forest
Service to sort out the appeals against public sales of timber.
Waiting costs them money.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some timber mills are importing cheaper wood, with
some of the qualities of aspen, from Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The timbermen's frustration reached boiling point last October,
when members of the Associated Contract Loggers took the advice of
a Twin Cities lawyer, Stephen Young, and filed suit against
environmentalists and the Forest Service.
</P>
<P>
   They claimed that the Forest Service was too busy considering
environmentalists' appeals to push through sales of timber, and
that the delay cost them money.
</P>
<P>
   They sought compensation for up to $600,000 in lost income, and
asked the Forest Service to ignore future appeals from
environmentalists unless their pleas reflected a compelling
national interest.
</P>
<P>
   They then went further. Young complained that the Forest Service
had begun to manage its lands according to the tenets of a movement
called Deep Ecology, which espouses a set of beliefs drawn from
various philosophies and eastern religions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep Ecology,'' wrote Young, ``wants people to have a
come-to-nature experience instead of a come-to-Jesus, -Allah or
-Buddha experience as the core of their faith in this life.''
</P>
<P>
   Lest that sound too attractive, he said he wanted to unmask Deep
Ecologists for what he says they are: remnants of the communist
left bent on creating a police state.
</P>
<P>
   Judge James Rosenbaum, unmoved, dismissed the case, calling it
``unseemly and baseless.''
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted, the contract loggers voted to press on, despite being
smirked at as backwoods dupes led astray by a slick big-city
lawyer, and despite the foolishness of presenting all environmental
protests against logging practices as part of a New Age
conspiracy. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 850, OR CONTINUE TO 950) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Their persistence, as well as the spuriousness of the lawsuit,
reflects the desperation that loggers feel. Over coffee in a little
cafe in the town of Cook, Minn., Larry Jones, the executive
director of the Associated Contract Loggers, is philosophical.
</P>
<P>
   Jones says loggers don't mind following whatever guidelines they
have to. They may indeed need to find other ways to work in the
woods. But, until then, they want the government to proceed as it
once agreed to do: allow the cut at the stipulated level, and stop
stalling every time the environmentalists ask it to. &QL;

10-GALLON CLOUT: TEXAS ART LOSES ITS DRAWL, STANDS TALL

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, TEXAS _ Art boosters in Texas have long boasted that
their state was a ``third coast'' of contemporary art in America.
Yet they were never really able to convince New York or California
to take them seriously, until now.
</P>
<P>
   The Texan claim to be a center of cutting-edge work will be
greatly advanced on March 23, when the 2000 Biennial Exhibition
opens at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York.
</P>
<P>
   No Whitney Biennial is ever quite like its predecessor. And the
novelty this year is that the show's six curators have chosen to
take the Biennial's original brief to provide an American
cross-section with refreshing literalness.
</P>
<P>
   The forthcoming show has artists from a much wider regional
range than before, with Texas as the clearest beneficiary. There
are nine artists from the Lone Star State, the largest number of
Texan artists ever, and the largest from any one state outside New
York and California.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Auping, curator of the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth
and a Whitney selector, is naturally thrilled. But he is keen to
explain why without sounding like the local chamber of commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Texan artists have made a breakthrough, he thinks, as a
recognized part of the contemporary mainstream, not because the
Whitney has suddenly embraced Texan lore and cowboy pictures.
</P>
<P>
   The triumph of art from Texas, in other words, is that it is no
longer Texan art.
</P>
<P>
   Among Texan artists the big change, in Auping's view, is that
they have dropped the wildcatter mentality of a generation ago and
abandoned any last trace of regional folksiness.
</P>
<P>
   The renegade mind-set, historically so much a part of Lone Star
culture, once led Texas artists to avoid the influence of New York
and Los Angeles (while longing for the exposure) and draw largely
on local tradition.
</P>
<P>
   A new generation of artists, he believes, now has the
self-confidence to look to New York and abroad to inform their
work. ``They don't want to be known as `Texas' artists; they want
to be known as good artists.''
</P>
<P>
   The work of the Texans at the Whitney Biennial includes
paintings, bronze sculptures and video productions. Of the nine
Texans, the best known are Vernon Fisher, Joseph Havel and James
Drake, veteran artists whose work has gone in new directions in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The Biennial is supposed to showcase less well-known work that
has yet to make a splash in galleries and museums. So relative
unknowns such as Leandro Erlich, Trenton Doyle Hancock and Brian
Fridge are also among the Texas representatives.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing noticeably regional in their form or style.
Fridge uses a video camera to shoot the ice crystals growing in his
freezer. Hancock does autobiographical, ``stream-of-consciousness''
drawings about racial issues.
</P>
<P>
   That Texas art has become more cosmopolitan is not surprising,
given the demographic shift the state has experienced over the past
decade. The cities of Texas are among the fastest growing in
America, as people have moved in from both coasts to take jobs in
the booming high-tech sector.
</P>
<P>
   This growth has revitalized the downtown areas of Houston and
Dallas, where galleries put on local work. Both cities now have
thriving communities of artists, as newcomers drawn to an
``artist-friendly'' environment join the native Texans.
</P>
<P>
   In the words of Valerie Cassel of the School of the Art
Institute of Chicago (and another member of the Biennial selection
committee), ``Texas has turned into very fertile ground for the
contemporary art world.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Auping, Cassel believes that art in Texas has mostly lost
its regional drawl. But she does not think this is peculiar to
Texas. Regionalism, she finds, is in decline across the country.
</P>
<P>
   If you can speak of any aesthetic divide in America nowadays, it
is more between rural art and city art. As artists train, paint and
sell in more and more different cities, the preeminence of New York
and Los Angeles is bound to decline.
</P>
<P>
   The end of a bipolar American art world is what the 2000 Whitney
Biennial at least glimpses. ``There is a level of confidence in art
communities outside of New York and Los Angeles that is both
cheering and deserved,'' Maxwell Anderson, the Whitney Museum's
director, says. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (50-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 725) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His recent tenure as director has not been without its upheavals
and controversies. But in this show, the ``Max factor'' seems to
have worked.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to break the hold of ``the two coasts'' and, after
initially agreeing on almost nothing, his six curators have
successfully obliged. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 50-WORD TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 900) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the Biennial selection was farmed out to
curators from outside the Whitney, none of whom live in New York or
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Auping and Cassel, four other curators travelled to
studios and galleries around the country before choosing the 97
participants.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, once the selections were announced, the sniping
began. The Whitney Biennial, known affectionately as ``the
exhibition everyone loves to hate,'' draws criticism every time for
whom the panel includes and excludes. The 2000 Biennial is no
exception.
</P>
<P>
   Some New York critics have turned up their noses at the
gate-crashers and the unwashed. Yet members of the panel stand by
their work, dismissing the complaints as a predictable occupational
risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there weren't criticism, I would be disappointed,'' says
Cassel. ``It wouldn't be the Biennial.'' &QL;

MOBILE INTERNET: A MATCH MADE IN HEAVEN _ AND JAPAN  
 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDITORS: Note 2 trims, totaling 600 words; 1,350 uncut)   (ATTN. EDITORS: The following material from The New York Times

<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Nobody doubts it anymore. The marriage of the mobile
telephone and the Internet is a match made in heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly a day passes in America and Europe without the
announcement, to a suitable fanfare, of a new alliance or
``strategic partnership'' between dot.coms, telecoms firms and
computer companies, all jostling for advantage in the brave new
world around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite the buzz, the embarrassing truth is that the
American wireless industry is about 18 months behind Europe's; and,
when it comes to the wireless Internet, Europe's is itself 18
months behind Japan's.
</P>
<P>
   For while the Europeans and Americans have been talking, NTT
DoCoMo, Japan's dominant mobile operator, has been turning the
wireless Internet into reality.
</P>
<P>
   Launched quietly just over a year ago, DoCoMo's i-mode service
has succeeded beyond the wildest dreams of its inventors. After
taking six months to reach 1 million subscribers, i-mode is gaining
new customers at the rate of more than 25,000 a day and should pass
the 5 million mark this month.
</P>
<P>
   Little i-mode handsets in ``honey platinum'' and ``lime gold''
have become a fashion accessory for Japanese teenagers, often worn
around the neck like a piece of jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular (and expensive) have a clamshell design,
opening to reveal a screen several times larger than the display of
a normal mobile phone. The latest have full-color displays,
recognize spoken commands, and have plug-in keyboards for writing
longer e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   At present, data-transfer speeds are quite slow, making the
service suitable only for text and simple graphics. But, by this
time next year, DoCoMo expects to have introduced a
``third-generation'' (3G) network based on the latest W-CDMA
technology, which will speed data rates 40 times and allow
high-quality streamed video and audio.
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, DoCoMo has achieved this almost single-handedly,
learning as it went along.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the industry in Europe and America spent ages
negotiating a standard before coming up with the wireless
application protocol (WAP) for text-based Internet services.
</P>
<P>
   Still 67 percent-owned by NTT, Japan's former monopoly
fixed-line operator, DoCoMo has no right to behave like a
fleet-footed innovator. Yet not only has it shown a clean pair of
heels to the rest of the world; it has also delivered a better
service, and one that is truer to the spirit of the Internet than
those of highly rated overseas rivals. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 550 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 400) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although WAP uses the technology of the Internet, it does not
let users roam freely around the World Wide Web. A subscriber gets
only a restricted set of proprietary text-based services, such as
news and weather, that have been bundled together by the mobile
operator.
</P>
<P>
   It is also slow. Every time you want to gain access to
information, you must dial in and wait. Each new page takes more
waiting while you look at a blank screen.
</P>
<P>
   It is a useful addition to the mobile phone, but it is not like
the Internet as people know it from their PCs.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage for the wireless service provider is that it keeps
control of who provides which service and has an influence over who
gets any revenues.
</P>
<P>
   DoCoMo wanted something more adventurous. With PC penetration
low in Japan and less than 12 percent of the population having
access to the Internet, DoCoMo thought i-mode might become the main
way on to the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Keichi Enoki, a long-serving NTT engineer who was given the job
of launching i-mode, decided that his service must use existing Web
content. To that end, DoCoMo has built a proper Internet-style
packet-switched network alongside its existing digital
circuit-switched network and equipped its handsets with a browser
that understands HTML, the language of the Web.
</P>
<P>
   As long as an i-mode telephone is receiving a signal, it is
connected to a full array of Web-based services, including e-mail,
games, news and online banking.
</P>
<P>
   Users pay Yen300 ($2.80) a month, plus a charge that depends on
the amount of data they send or receive _ about Yen4 for sending a
500-letter e-mail or Yen20 for downloading a weather report.
</P>
<P>
   Web site owners must adapt their sites for the i-mode, but that
is quick and easy, because the system uses the HTML language. As a
result i-mode can get to nearly 6,000 Web sites; and more are being
added, at a rate of about 20 a day.
</P>
<P>
   All can be reached by keying in the right address or by using
one of ten competing i-mode search engines. In addition 327 partner
sites are accessible through the i-mode portal and the menu on the
handset.
</P>
<P>
   Enoki describes the growing number of subscribers and the
dazzling variety of independent applications as a classic
``positive-feedback loop.''
</P>
<P>
   DoCoMo expects great things from its portal site, from which it
earns a 9 percent commission on transactions such as ordering
cinema and airline tickets; but most sites pay it nothing.
</P>
<P>
   That does not worry Enoki, who says that, as long as Web sites
augment the value of i-mode, he is happy. He gives as an example a
service provided by Bandai, the firm that gave the world Tamagotchi
pets.
</P>
<P>
   For a monthly subscription of only Yen100, Bandai sends a new
cartoon to your i-mode screen each day. DoCoMo would never have
thought of that, but it already has 700,000 ecstatic subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, revenues from i-mode are modest. Enoki reckons
that it adds about a quarter to the monthly bill of the average
user. With 5 million customers, that should mean it contributes
about $1.5 billion to the firm's total sales. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Keiji Tachikawa, DoCoMo's president, is cautious when looking
further ahead. Although he expects data and voice traffic to be
equally split within five years, it may not be until 2010 that data
is responsible for more than half the firm's revenues.
</P>
<P>
   For Tachikawa, low pricing is the key to building demand for the
service, mainly because i-mode has so far been a consumer product.
Not until next year, with the new 3G network, will DoCoMo promote
it for corporate intranets.
</P>
<P>
   Does this mean that DoCoMo's stratospheric valuation might be a
trifle exaggerated? Its market value has tripled since the middle
of last year to $370 billion, making it the most valuable telecoms
company in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Tachikawa dismisses claims of overvaluation. After 3G,
i-mode will become the mainstay of the business, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas the volume of voice traffic is limited by how much
people talk, data has almost infinite potential. This is the future
that investors are buying.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, Tachikawa is so happy with prospects in Japan and
the rest of Asia that he is uninterested in Europe or America. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 50 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,150) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite the acquisition firepower his share price gives him, he
plans to create only a Web of pan-Asian alliances based on
technology transfer and minority stakes, such as the 19 percent of
Hong Kong's Hutchison he recently bought.
</P>
<P>
   He dismisses rumors that DoCoMo may bid for Britain's Orange. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,350) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What are the lessons of i-mode for the Europeans and Americans?
</P>
<P>
   First, because they lack a DoCoMo-style advanced packet-switched
network, they must get on with the commercial launch of their own
3G networks. WAP is no substitute for the full riches of the Web,
and may even turn customers off.
</P>
<P>
   Second, they should abandon the idea of being a gatekeeper for
wireless Internet services. The network should be open, because
that is the best way to create the services that give the system
its value.
</P>
<P>
   Third, for the same reason, providers should price and position
services to maximize consumer take-up _ for consumers, not
businesses, have caused the exponential growth of the Web.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the wireless Internet will not be so different from
the Internet we already know. Operators who seek to own and control
it take note. &QL;

GOOD NEWS: MEXICAN MEDIA ARE GETTING BOLDER, BETTER

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The methods of control were more subtle, but
Mexico's media long bore more than a passing resemblance to those
of Soviet Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The television covered only the good news, the newspapers were
full of eight-column screeds reporting inconsequential remarks by
minor officials, and the radio was saturated with government
jingles.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder that for the past seven decades the Institutional
Revolutionary Party (PRI) rarely had trouble winning elections or,
when it did, in getting away with fraud.
</P>
<P>
   But Mexico claims to be a real democracy now, and the opposition
has a genuine, if slim, chance of winning the presidential election
on July 2.
</P>
<P>
   The media's election coverage will be scrutinized as never
before. At first sight, the media, too, are much changed: they are
more pluralist, free and independent than ever before. Yet vestiges
of the old ways remain.
</P>
<P>
   The secret of the PRI's control over the media is that it has
preferred co-option to repression. Yet that makes the control far
harder to shake off.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers enjoyed subsidized paper, kindly tax treatment and
floods of well-paid government advertising; Televisa, a private
media conglomerate, was granted a lucrative near-monopoly over
television in return for political loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists, poorly paid by their employers, depended on large
bribes from the government departments they covered.
Self-censorship was the norm. When it failed, the regime resorted
to dirtier methods: advertising could be withdrawn, auditors could
swoop unexpectedly, and officials stirred up disputes within
newspapers to force out inconvenient editors.
</P>
<P>
   On rare occasions, journalists were harassed, and even murdered,
at official instigation.
</P>
<P>
   Since the mid-1980s, officialdom's grip has gradually weakened,
and the media have become bolder.
</P>
<P>
   Papers such as El Financiero, a Mexico City business daily, and
El Norte, a Monterrey paper (and later its metropolitan sister,
Reforma), succeeded in attracting enough private-sector advertising
to win editorial independence.
</P>
<P>
   But Mexico's newspaper market is still marked by its history:
with many small papers, none has much influence among the mass of
voters. The biggest daily, El Universal, claims a circulation of
just 153,000 in a country of 100 million people. Many papers depend
on articles paid for by the government.
</P>
<P>
   Television remains far less diverse than the press. TV Azteca, a
state firm privatized in 1993, has just over a quarter of the
audience, but the field is still dominated by Televisa.
</P>
<P>
   Between them, these two control most of the local television
stations, which would be forbidden under American antitrust rules,
and which prevents any serious competitor arising.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1994 presidential election, says Sergio Aguayo, a
political scientist who monitors media coverage, ``it was a scandal
how biased (the television stations) were in favor of the PRI.''
</P>
<P>
   That is changing. After analyzing television and radio coverage
in January and February, the independent election authority found
that broadcasters were much fairer than in the past, though they
still gave more, and more favorable, coverage to the PRI candidate
than to his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Televisa this week announced that it would give all the
presidential candidates free air time.
</P>
<P>
   Archaic laws still restrict media freedom: TV Azteca was fined
for calling for the resignation of government officials, after one
of its performers was murdered last year. And media owners and
editors still get telephone calls from officials. But they take
less and less notice.
</P>
<P>
   What little government control remains is exercised more ``by
inertia'' than by direct pressure, says Raymundo Riva Palacio,
editor of Milenio Diario, a newspaper launched at the start of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Mexico's libel law is very weak. This rightly
encourages media freedom, but in Mexico freedom too often
deteriorates into irresponsibility. That, however, is not Mexican
journalism's only fault.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers, especially, still suffer from ``declarationitis,''
or the notion that news is whatever somebody important says, even
if he has said nothing new.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, for instance, El Financiero's main headline often tells
its readers that Mexico's banks are weak, the peso is strong, or an
economic crisis is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   There is an obsession with official data too: read or listen to
a report on the arrest of a criminal and you will probably learn
the license number of the police car that picked him up, the names
and badge numbers of the arresting officers, and the exact time
that he was taken into custody.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, since the press has spent decades reprinting such data
unquestioningly, cross-checking facts and figures is a relatively
new practice: one bank robbery was recently reported in five
different papers with five different figures for the amount stolen.
</P>
<P>
   Codes of ethics have only recently been adopted, and whether
they are being followed is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's media are well on the road to freedom; the road to
quality may prove to be much longer. &QL;

<P>
   CARACAS _ Hugo Chavez, Venezuela's elected president, first
grabbed the attention of his countrymen in 1992, when as a
paratroop lieutenant-colonel he tried to stage a coup against a
democratic government.
</P>
<P>
   Could Chavez himself be ousted by a coup?
</P>
<P>
   Such talk seems both wildly premature _ the president is hugely
popular _ and anachronistic. But that has not stopped several
Venezuelans from musing out loud about the possibility.
</P>
<P>
   The latest to do so was Francisco Visconti, a retired air-force
general, who took part in a second attempted coup in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   He is part of a group of former officers who are now
disillusioned with Chavez. They accuse him of betraying their
``revolution'' against Venezuela's traditional political parties,
and want him to ditch his allegedly corrupt civilian allies.
</P>
<P>
   Lamenting the ``costs'' of democracy, General Visconti this
month said he favored ``accelerating'' the revolution by force of
arms. But General Visconti and his friends lack the command of
troops.
</P>
<P>
   More worrying for Chavez are warnings from a different group of
former officers, who opposed the 1992 coups.
</P>
<P>
   This month a squad of retired generals, colonel and admirals set
up an outfit called the Institutional Military Front (FIM). Their
leaders include General Fernando Ochoa, who was defense minister
when Chavez's coup was quashed.
</P>
<P>
   They claim, perhaps rightly, to represent a silent majority of
active service officers who cannot legally speak out. And they have
presented a litany of complaints against Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   Their main beef is that by politicizing the armed forces, the
president is endangering their unity. Chavez, they point out, makes
political speeches at military ceremonies and wears combat fatigues
at political rallies.
</P>
<P>
   He persists in wearing his uniform, ``forgetting,'' they say,
that his supremacy over senior officers comes from his election to
the presidency, not from his army rank.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, they grumble that Chavez has turned the armed
forces into a permanent branch of the social services. The FIM also
objects to Chavez's order to reinstate the rebel officers expelled
as traitors in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez has given the soldiers a far bigger role in government
than they enjoyed even during the military dictatorship of General
Marcos Perez Jimenez in the 1950s. The naming last month of retired
officers as deputy ministers of information and infrastructure
added to an already large number of military men in senior
government jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's new constitution fuses the armed services into a single
force under a unified command. It also calls for their ``active
participation in national development,'' instead of their previous
``apolitical, obedient and nondeliberative'' role.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers will now be able to vote _ and perhaps be voted for.
Chavez, who recently declared that the difference between soldiers
and civilians was no more significant than that between doctors and
lawyers, says he wants to have serving officers among his
candidates in the general election due in May.
</P>
<P>
   All of this shows how much more at home Chavez still feels with
the hierarchical certainties of the army than with the messy
compromises of democratic politics.
</P>
<P>
   Civilians who conspired with him before the 1992 attempt say
that he distrusted them, and is intolerant of dissent. According to
Douglas Bravo, a former guerrilla leader, Chavez once told him:
``Civilians get in the way. When we're in power, we'll call you.''
</P>
<P>
   Such dismissive attitudes are causing cracks in Chavez's
civilian coalition. Chavez may well feel that his popularity and
rapport with Venezuelans at large render him invulnerable. But this
degree of support will not last forever.
</P>
<P>
   Sooner or later, he will find himself beholden to an army with
some scores to settle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The armed force is not the property of the president but the
patrimony of the people,'' General Ismael Hurtado, the new,
``institutionalist'' defense minister, noted recently. Chavez has
been warned. &QL;

GERMAN GENDER-BENDERS: BREAKING THE POLITICAL GLASS CEILING

<P>
   BERLIN _ For now, there is only one serious candidate left in
the running for the leadership of Germany's Christian Democratic
Union (CDU). After the withdrawal on March 5 of Volker Ruhe, a
former defense minister, Angela Merkel, the party's general
secretary, has become the hot favorite among the rank and file to
take over next month.
</P>
<P>
   But in the eyes of the Christian Democratic leadership and of
its conservative Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union
(CSU), Mrs. Merkel suffers from a grave drawback: not only does she
come from the former communist east, but she is also a woman.
</P>
<P>
   Women occupy an ambiguous position in Germany. On the one hand,
Germany has one of the highest proportions (31 percent) of women in
parliament anywhere outside Scandinavia.
</P>
<P>
   The lower house, the Bundestag, has had two female speakers. And
over a third of today's cabinet ministers, and nearly half the
junior ministers, are women.
</P>
<P>
   Outside politics, the world's first female bishop was a German.
A woman heads Germany's Constitutional Court. One third of new
German firms are being set up by women.
</P>
<P>
   Tough women like Rosa Luxemburg, co-founder of the German
Communist Party, or even Ulrike Meinhof, a leader of the terrorist
Baader-Meinhof gang, stride through German history.
</P>
<P>
   Asked recently which sex they expect to dominate in the 21st
century, a quarter thought women would, and only 19 percent of
Germans said they thought that men would continue to be top dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, at the same time, women represent a mere 6 percent of
higher management in German business, 6 percent of top university
professors, and less than 10 percent of senior civil-service jobs.
</P>
<P>
   No woman has ever served as federal chancellor, nor headed a
mainstream postwar party. Only one of Germany's 16 Lander (states),
and just a handful of big towns, are today governed by a woman.
</P>
<P>
   More German girls than boys are now entering university, but few
go on to take higher degrees. Women account for only a third of
doctoral students.
</P>
<P>
   What explains this contradictory picture? In other areas,
Germany has pioneered progressive movements: the Greens, for
instance, flourished more vigorously there than elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   As early as 1967, the (male) head of Germany's Constitutional
Court stirred matters up by declaring that women and men should
share the burden of defending the country because ``they also share
political responsibility at the polls'' _ though the proposition
was rejected out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   A strident German feminist movement, echoing the American one,
grew in the 1970s. Yet this itself provoked a conservative backlash
in the 1980s and 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Helmut Kohl's 16-year reign, a woman's proper sphere
of interest was once again often considered to be Kinder, Kuche
and, to a much lesser extent, Kirche (children, kitchen and
church).
</P>
<P>
   Despite Germany's falling birth rate _ now one of the lowest in
Europe _ the proportion of women with a paid job rose only slowly,
from 47 percent at the end of the 1960s to 56 percent in western
Germany today.
</P>
<P>
   That compares with 74 percent in Denmark and Sweden and 67
percent in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   One familiar explanation is that young women push hard at first
to forge a career, but then bump up against a glass ceiling kept in
place by a combination of antique male attitudes and the
complication of organizing child care.
</P>
<P>
   Western Germany has never come close to matching the
state-financed all-day provision that was available for children
from birth in the former communist East Germany _ and where almost
all women had jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Maternity provision in the united Germany is relatively
generous: it can last up to three years. Children aged between
three and six are guaranteed a place in a kindergarten. But these
usually operate for only half the day, just as most schools are
open in the mornings only.
</P>
<P>
   Many women find it too difficult to try to combine careers and
family. Indeed, the female employment rate in eastern Germany has
dropped from 80 percent in 1990 to 73 percent today.
</P>
<P>
   Most parties have tried to secure a more equal sexual balance by
introducing quotas for party posts and electoral candidates. As a
result, women's representation in the federal parliament has jumped
over the past decade; women now occupy a third or more of the
ministerial jobs in six state governments.
</P>
<P>
   But the CDU and the CSU remain true to their conservative
philosophy. Only 18 percent of both parties' federal deputies are
female, compared with 35 percent of the governing Social Democrats'
and 57 percent of the Greens'.
</P>
<P>
   Times, and attitudes, are changing, however. Since the election
18 months ago, many emblems of German identity have been challenged
_ not least the upstanding reputation of the CDU's former leader,
Helmut Kohl.
</P>
<P>
   The Bundestag now sits in Berlin in a building with a glass
dome. Mrs. Merkel may yet break through another, rather different,
political glass ceiling. &QL;

<P>
   PARIS _ In a scruffy cybercafe nestling between the Parisian
landmarks of Les Halles and the Pompidou Center, and reverberating
with North African rap music, French youngsters are surfing their
way around the world.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the pages flashing up on their screens are not
written in French. This is, after all, a cyberworld dominated by
English, in which French is used by only 1.2 percent of the world's
Web sites and even fewer of all international online forums.
</P>
<P>
   More than any other medium of recent years, the Internet is
challenging France's attempts to control and protect its culture.
</P>
<P>
   Its pride in its culture is fierce. No other country _ save
Spain _ has a body quite like the Academie Francaise, dedicating
itself for the past 365 years to the defense of the national
language.
</P>
<P>
   No other country has quite the same belief in linguistic
solidarity: witness its ministerial department of la francophonie
which spreads the word in over 50 countries (some of them not
French-speaking) from Canada to Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   No other country makes quite the same fuss in world-trade talks
over culture, demanding the right to keep minimum quotas of
French-language pop music or films.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet tests this instinct in two ways. The first is the
weight of the English language on the Web. In some ways, the French
have not helped themselves. They were slow to ``get'' the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   A government decision in the early 1980s to leapfrog France
along the information superhighway landed the country with France
Telecom's Minitel system _ wonderful for looking up telephone
numbers or booking train tickets, but incapable of matching the
Internet's flexibility and range.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of Minitel, however, stunted the growth of the
personal computer. By 1998, only a fifth of French households had a
computer, compared with two-fifths in America; and only 2 percent
of households were connected to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Those figures are now surging. The French Association of
Internet Service Providers calculates that, in January 1998, only
540,000 French residents were connected to the Net, and for a
collective total of 4 million hours.
</P>
<P>
   By January this year, the connections had swollen to just over 3
million. Surfers spent a total of 25.3 million hours online.
</P>
<P>
   But will these internauts, as the culturally correct call them,
surf la toile in French, or the Web in English? The answer, despite
the proliferation of French-language Web sites, will probably be
both.
</P>
<P>
   For all the Academie's efforts to promote French translations of
the new Internet vocabulary _ la messagerie electronique for
e-mail, for instance _ most French surfers think it cool to
sprinkle American geek-talk into their conversation.
</P>
<P>
   The second challenge is the defiantly anarchic nature of the
Net, which, unlike Minitel, does not lend itself to the sort of
cultural policing that the French have used in the past to fend off
the American cultural invasion.
</P>
<P>
   The official idea now is to promote the spread of French sites
on the Net in order to advance the cause of ``cultural diversity
and democracy.'' But keeping control will be hard
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, when French judges banned a book about
President Francois Mitterrand's last illness, an enterprising
cybercafe in the eastern town of Besancon simply put it on the
Net. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Throwing hundreds of millions of dollars at the
planet Mars without any certainty of a return on the investment is
something that America's space agency, NASA, has been doing for
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Now Hollywood is getting in on the act as well. On March 10,
``Mission to Mars,'' the first of a clutch of forthcoming Martian
movies, opened in cinemas across America.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the year it will be followed by ``Red Planet.'' And in
2001 two more Mars projects _ a mini-series and an Imax 3-D movie _
are due from James Cameron, the director of ``Titanic.'' In short,
Mars is coming soon to a screen near you.
</P>
<P>
   For the ``Mars advocacy'' movement, which wants to send people
to the place, these movies are more than just entertainment. They
are also a valuable opportunity to capitalize on public interest in
all things Martian to raise support _ and cash _ for exploration of
the planet itself.
</P>
<P>
   Mars is currently the focus of an unprecedented intersection of
scientific, promotional and popular interest. In a speech last year
Cameron told the Mars Society (a large advocacy group that includes
many leading scientists) that he hoped to infect the public with
``Mars fever.''
</P>
<P>
   All of the Mars movies are based to a large extent on NASA's
actual (though tentative) plan for a manned expedition to the
planet.
</P>
<P>
   This involves sending an unmanned lander into orbit around Mars,
along with a robot craft that travels to the surface and starts
making fuel for the return journey, using constituents of the
Martian atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Once these craft are in place, a crew can then fly to Mars in a
third vehicle, transfer to the orbiting lander, and touch down.
After 500 days on the surface, the crew would return to orbit
around Mars using the manufactured fuel, transfer back to the
original spacecraft, and return to earth.
</P>
<P>
   There is, in other words, plenty of scope for drama, and it does
not give too much away to say that both ``Mission to Mars'' and
``Red Planet'' start with Mars missions that go wrong.
</P>
<P>
   But as well as borrowing real-life mission plans, the filmmakers
have also been borrowing some real, live scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Several researchers, including Matt Golombek, chief scientist on
the 1997 robotic Pathfinder mission, were involved in the
production of ``Mission to Mars.'' Brian De Palma, the film's
director, set out to depict the spacecraft as realistically as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Allen, a former astronaut who advised on some spacewalking
scenes, has said that the film scores nine out of ten for accuracy.
(That said, the dramatic sandstorm shown in the movie would not be
possible in Mars's thin, feeble atmosphere; and it may be less
believable still, given that the film is set only 20 years into the
future, that it includes a completed version of the much-delayed
International Space Station.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Red Planet,'' set in 2050, also bases its approach on NASA's
mission plan, though director Anthony Hoffman says he lost the
agency's approval because of a scene in which one astronaut kills
another.
</P>
<P>
   But what the film lacks in official sanction, it is expected to
make up for in visual appeal: the costume designer and the
production designer both previously worked on the stylish thriller
``The Matrix.''
</P>
<P>
   Cameron's twin projects, set in 2016, will be the most
realistic, particularly when it comes to the depiction of Martian
life-forms. These will be bacteria visible only under a microscope,
rather than the humanoid super-beings and man-eating worms that
appear in the other two films.
</P>
<P>
   Sets and props will be shared between his two productions, and
Cameron, who is renowned for his attention to technical detail,
says he is aiming for documentary realism.
</P>
<P>
   His intention, he says, is ``to make humans to Mars real in the
minds of the viewing public'' and to emphasize that a voyage to
Mars, unlike the technology depicted in most science-fiction
movies, is technically feasible.
</P>
<P>
   This is music to the ears of Mars Society members _ including
Cameron himself. For the big hope is that all of this on-screen
action will translate into greater public interest in the actual
exploration of Mars. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 200 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 700) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It could also lead to more tangible benefits for researchers.
The Mars Society is setting up a privately financed research
station in the dry, Mars-like terrain of the Canadian Arctic.
</P>
<P>
   This laboratory just happens to be based on the reference design
for a manned Mars lander that is now on the drawing board at NASA.
The lab will be made available to researchers, including those at
NASA's nearby Haughton Mars Research Station.
</P>
<P>
   Those researchers will thus end up with extra equipment, and,
when using it, they will also be able to evaluate the design of the
lander.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron has mooted the possibility that, once his two films are
complete, he will donate his props and equipment for use at the
Canadian base. Since they will be modelled as closely as possible
on NASA's designs, this will allow further feasibility testing.
</P>
<P>
   Pascal Lee of NASA's Ames Research Center, who is setting up the
station, says this would constitute ``an interesting synergy
between the entertainment industry, the advocacy groups and the
scientists.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mars movies could also help scientists to attract commercial
sponsorship for their research. In January the Mars Society
announced a sponsorship deal for its research station with
Flashline.com, an online software vendor. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An outbreak of Mars fever could encourage other firms to do
similar deals in return for Martian kudos. In Britain, M&AMP;C Saatchi
Sponsorship has just been appointed to raise money for the European
Space Agency's robotic Beagle 2 mission to Mars.
</P>
<P>
   According to Matthew Patten, the company's chief executive, the
aim is to raise Pounds10 million ($16 million, or 40 percent of the
total mission cost) over the next four years in sponsorship and
merchandising.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors will be able to place their logos on the spacecraft.
And, since nobody will actually be able to see Beagle 2 as it
whizzes through space, the logos will also be applied to an
earth-based replica and to computer animations of the spacecraft
that will appear on television.
</P>
<P>
   Promotional space will also be sold on the craft's parachutes
and airbags: Beagle 2's touchdown in 2003 will, literally, be
cushioned by private money. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 1,075, OR CONTINUE TO 1,200) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Many Mars advocates believe that the first manned mission will
also be privately financed. Tellingly, the astronauts in ``Red
Planet'' have space suits festooned with logos.
</P>
<P>
   A private mission might have a number of advantages over a
public one. Analysis of 91 historical expeditions to a previous
frontier, the Arctic, by Jonathon Karpoff of the University of
Washington, found that private expeditions were better organized,
more adaptable, suffered fewer fatalities, and made better use of
the latest technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps in 2020 or so, it will be a young software or biotech
mogul, inspired by the rash of Mars movies from his youth, who will
write the $30 billion check required. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Anyone who thinks this year's American election
campaign is especially dirty should read a new book, ``American
Dreamer: A Life of Henry A. Wallace,'' and think again.
</P>
<P>
   As his sympathetic biographers recall, when Henry Wallace, the
vice president in Franklin Roosevelt's third term, had the temerity
to break with the Democratic Party and run on the Progressive
ticket for the presidency in 1948, he was demonized as a wild-eyed
fanatic bent on destroying the American way of life.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, an agricultural scientist in Iowa before he went into
politics, described himself in that campaign as a ``progressive
capitalist,'' and he had the record to back the claim.
</P>
<P>
   Before he reformed American farm policy as the country's
secretary of agriculture during the Depression, he founded a
company called Pioneer Hi-Bred to promote hybrid maize.
</P>
<P>
   The business not only grew into a multinational that made
Wallace a rich man. It helped quadruple corn yields on American
farmland and, through a poultry subsidiary, accounted for
three-quarters of the egg-laying chickens sold commercially
worldwide before it was acquired by Du Pont.
</P>
<P>
   Yet by election day in 1948 his reputation was in tatters. He
had been transformed in the public mind into a frightening figure,
and he got a mere 1.2 million votes, fewer even than the Dixiecrat
candidate, Strom Thurmond.
</P>
<P>
   As his biographers, John Culver and John Hyde, put it: ``The
thoughtful scientist had become the impractical mystic.''
</P>
<P>
   The defender of the Second World War was transformed into an
appeaser and the ``deeply religious grandson of a Presbyterian
minister had become an apostle of godless totalitarianism.''
</P>
<P>
   How did it happen? Culver and Hyde point mainly to the smear
tactics of the successful candidate, Harry Truman.
</P>
<P>
   He represented Wallace as, at best, a fellow-traveller when, for
instance, he infamously urged him ``to go to the country he loves
so well (the Soviet Union) and help them out against his own
country if that's the way he feels.''
</P>
<P>
   But they also point to Wallace himself. He left himself
vulnerable to the red-baiters, they argue, by naively refusing to
distance himself from, still less disown, such Communist supporters
as Paul Robeson, an American singer and actor who went on to win
the Stalin Peace Prize.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, there was something magnificent about the
Progressive Party's disastrous campaign. ``You can call us black,
or you can call us Red, but you can't call us yellow,'' said one of
Wallace's top aides, and he was right.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate refused to give in to mobs that pelted him with
vegetables and screamed racist abuse. In Southern states, he slept
in the homes of black supporters and ate from picnic baskets to
avoid segregated hotels and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Many of his followers were as brave. When the Pittsburgh Press
in a crude effort at intimidation published the names, addresses
and places of employment of 1,000 Wallacites in western
Pennsylvania, only ten of them recanted.
</P>
<P>
   The Wallace story did not end there. Much of the Progressive
Party manifesto that seemed extreme to most Americans then is now
mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   It called for desegregated schools and armed services, votes for
18-year-olds, equal rights for women, public day-care facilities
and home rule for the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the loser of 1948 was, eventually, the winner. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The New York Times plans 1{ pages of stories, photos and

</P>
<P>
   TRIBUNE-TIMESMIRROR (Undated) _ The Tribune Co., owner of The
Chicago Tribune, will acquire The Times Mirror Co., owner of The
Los Angeles Times, for $6.4 billion, before the assumption of about
$1.4 billion in debt. The Tribune's offer is for about $95 a share
in stock and cash, double the Tribune's closing price on Friday.
The first half of the offer will be in cash, and the rest offers
2.5 shares of Tribune for each share of Times MIrror. The
acquisition will end the confrontational reign of Mark Willes at
Times Mirror. It will create a company with daily newspapers in the
three biggest United States markets and some overlaps in newspaper
and television markets. By Felicity Barringer and Laura M. Holson.
</P>
<P>
   With graphics and map.

<P>
   TRIBUNE-HISTORY (Los Angeles) _ The Tribune-Times Mirror deal
joins two venerable newspaper companies: Times Mirror, owned for a

   &UR; OTHER FINANCIAL &LR;  (``f'' code)
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-RECESSION (Tokyo) _ Japan slipped back into a recession in
the fourth quarter of last year, falling 1.4 percent in real terms
as consumers clamped their wallets closed and public works projects
stalled. The drop came in spite of astonishingly robust capital
spending by businesses. It was the biggest fall since the economy
sank 2 percent in the spring of 1997 and the third largest
contraction since World War II. By Stephanie Strom.
</P>
<P>
   IMF-EUROPE (Frankfurt, Germany) _ European leaders are expected
to endorse Germany's new candidate, Horst Kohlers, for president of
the International Monetary Fund. This is no surprise, but there are
questions about how solidly are they behind Kohlers and about
whether the United States will go along this time. By Edmund L.
Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   CDNOW (Undated) _ CDnow, Time Warner and Sony have called off
their plan to merge Columbia House with CDnow to create a publicly
traded company. CDnow said it planned to cut costs by a third and
would explore its strategic options.

<P>
   FIAT-GM (Turin, Italy ) _ Fiat is expected to announce that it

Tagliabue.
</P>
<P>
   MARKETPLACE (Undated) _ The daily marketplace column.
</P>
<P>
   MARKET (New York) _ The Dow Jones industrial average was up 27
points at noon, while the Nasdaq index was down 70, about 1.4
percent. The 30-year Treasury bond was up 18/32, yielding 6.14
percent.

investment has been inadequate. By Patrick McGeehan.

Aspect Development for $9.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-TRADE (Shanghai) _ China says it will seek to enter the
World Trade Organization with or without support from the U.S.
Congress, a move that is sure to put pressure on United States
legislators to approve permanent normal trade relations and weakens
Washington's ability to influence China on such sensitive subjects
as reunification with Taiwan. By Craig S. Smith.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-BANKS (Tokyo) _ Bankers say Sanwa Bank is in the final
stages of negotiations on joining forces with Asahi Bank and Tokai
Bank, which previously announced their intention to merge. If the
amalgamation takes place, it would create the second-largest bank
in terms of assets after the Mizuho Financial Group, which will
come to life this fall when Fuji Bank, the Industrial Bank of Japan
and Dai-Ichi Kangyo merge. It would mean that in less than one
year, the ranks of large Japanese ``city'' banks has started
shrinking to five from nine. By Stephanie Strom.

   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (``i'' code)
</P>

   RUSSIA-CHECHNYA (Moscow) _ Acting President Vladimir Putin
announces the capture of Salman Raduyev, a notorious Chechen
warlord. The Announcement comes after string of setbacks for
Russian forces in Chechnya. By Michael R. Gordon.
</P>

suffers its biggest one-day point drop ever on fears that governing
Nationalists will lose the presidential election on Saturday. By
Mark Landler.
</P>
<P>
   IRAN-ATTACK (Dateline to kum) _ Half a dozen mortar round
slammed into a Tehran residential building next to a Revolutionary
Guards base on Monday and Iraq-based rebels claimed responsibility.
The attack was the second violent incident in the Iranian capital

was baptized, Pope John Paul II will visit what Israel says is the
site as well as the place Jordan says is the site. By Joel
Greenberg.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POLITICS &LR;  (``p'' code)
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-REFORM (Austin, Texas) _ For Gov. George W. Bush, reform
has been a matter of legislative proposals rather than an
overriding political philosophy, which might explain why few people
in Texas would have picked the word reformer when asked to describe
the governor. ``He's an incremental change specialist,'' said Bruce
Buchanan, a political scientist at the University of Texas,
``sometimes in a partisan way, like tort reform, which is a big
business issue, sometimes in a bipartisan way, such as small
changes in education.'' For Bush, success has come when changes
have been modest or when he has not had to buck political interests
or popular will. When he has been boldest, he has fallen short of
his goals. By Jim Yardley and Richard A. Oppel Jr.

<P>
   &UR; SCIENCE &LR;  (``a'' code)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-EVOLUTIONARY-PSYCHOLOGY (Undated) _ When two scientists
proposed in a recent book that rape was best viewed as a sexual act
with its roots in evolution, it set off a squall of protest from
feminists and social scientists, won the researchers appearances on
shows like NBC's ``Dateline,'' and became the talk of the cocktail
party circuit. Even last week the controversy continued, with the
book's authors conducting a rancorous exchange over a scathing
review in the scientific journal Nature. But the case put forward
was not, as some assumed, a fringe theory developed by a pair of
renegade researchers. Rather, the arguments fit into a larger
theoretical framework, the work of a group of scientists who have
ushered Darwin into new and provocative areas, including sexual
attraction between men and women, parenting, jealousy and violence,
as well as less touchy regions like the learning of language and
the organization of perception. By Erica Goode. (3500 words)

<P>
   DANVILLE, Calif. _ A new century, a glowing economy and
ever-expanding technological innovation are giving many Americans
not only a sense of optimism but the conviction we live in a
brand-new era.
</P>
<P>
   In some areas _ information technology, biotech _ this is
certainly true. But a look at the social problems that continue to
plague us should temper this optimism and this conception of
``newness.'' Technology can change human life _ but not human
nature.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why so many ``new era'' problems (the World Trade
Organization demonstrations, the ``digital divide,'' Internet
pornography, violent and alienated youth, convictions reversed
after DNA testing, school vouchers) are really just different
versions of the same concerns (labor rights, crime and punishment,
freedom of speech, separation of church and state, racism) that
have troubled this country for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Monday was the anniversary of the death of Clarence Darrow,
regarded by many as America's greatest lawyer and a man whose cases
and crusades remind us how intractable our ``new era'' problems
really are.
</P>
<P>
   Clarence Seward Darrow (1857-1938) was born in Kinsman, Ohio.
Named after abolitionist William Seward, he grew up in a home that
became a stop on the Underground Railway for which fugitive slaves
escaped the South. After one year of law school, he passed the Bar
and moved to Chicago, where he remained for the rest of his life,
becoming _ like all good people _ a passionate Cubs fan.
</P>
<P>
   Darrow's conversion from a well-paid corporate lawyer to a
defender (often unpaid) of labor rights took place at the time of
America's first large-scale labor unrest (the Pullman strike,
1894).
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by the soaring rhetoric of strike leader Eugene V.
Debs, he switched sides, defending Debs against a trumped-up
contempt charge. It was his first big case and, although Debs got
six months in jail, Darrow emerged as the lawyer for workers. The
rights he championed back then echo the demands for ``international
labor standards'' heard last year during world trade protests in
the streets of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Darrow's greatest cases all took place in the 1920s. The first,
Leopold and Loeb, is eerily familiar: two young men (17 and 18
years old) _ rich, brilliant and ``alienated'' _ confessed to
brutally killing a 14-year-old boy ``for the sake of a thrill.''
</P>
<P>
   The question was not the boys' guilt, but their punishment _ the
death penalty or life imprisonment. Darrow, who opposed the death
penalty no matter how onerous the crime, took the case.
</P>
<P>
   Today, psychiatric testimony is a given; in 1924, when Darrow
introduced it, it was exotic _ hypnotic, too, as many people heard
for the first time of Freud, and terms like ``split personality''
and ``the unconscious'' became what ``DNA evidence'' is for us
today.
</P>
<P>
   Darrow, arguing that interior forces beyond the murderers'
control had driven them to kill, succeeded in saving them from
hanging.
</P>
<P>
   The 1925 ``Monkey Trial'' was Darrow's most famous case. Again
the issue is familiar: teaching evolution in public schools.
Opposing Darrow was William Jennings Bryan, three-time presidential
candidate and one of the great orators of his day.
</P>
<P>
   Darrow did not argue whether teacher John Scopes had taught
evolution _ everyone knew he had _ but whether the state, in
forbidding him to do so, had violated the idea of separation of
church and state.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to present any expert witnesses on evolution, Darrow
eventually put Bryan himself on the stand _ ``the most amazing
court scene in Anglo-Saxon history,'' wrote the New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   But Bryan's testimony was stricken from the record (a fact
seldom remembered), and the jury, at Darrow's request, found Scopes
guilty (another fact not remembered). This meant the
constitutionality of the law could be appealed. The case was
eventually dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   One year later, Darrow embarked on what he considered his most
important trial _ the Sweet murder trial. Here, as with Rodney
King, Amadou Diallo (or even O.J. Simpson), the issue was race.
</P>
<P>
   Ossian Sweet was a black dentist who bought a house in a white
Detroit neighborhood. The first night, an unfriendly white crowd
gathered out front; anticipating this, Sweet had armed himself. The
second night, a larger crowd showed up, and when rocks began
flying, shots were fired from Sweet's house and a white man was
killed.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone in Sweet's house was arrested and charged with
first-degree murder. The NAACP asked Darrow to head the defense.
</P>
<P>
   His defense was straightforward. This case, he said, was a case
of racial hatred, pure and simple; had the defendants been white,
and shot a black man, ``they would have been given medals.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, having bravely faced down a mob, they were now facing
prison. A first jury deadlocked; a second jury found the first
defendant not guilty, and the other 10 were never tried.
</P>
<P>
   Darrow's trials demonstrate that, in terms of social problems,
not only do we most certainly not live in a ``new era,'' but that
our social problems, new era or old, will not be easily solved.
There is however, an optimistic spin to all this. Clarence Darrow's
long life is a tribute to what we can do if we dedicate ourselves
to the slow, good fight.

THE BEACH, ACCORDING TO HOWARD STERN
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below; show time is PST, check times in your area.) 
Our rating: 2 1/2 stars 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Son of the Beach,'' a parody of ``Baywatch,'' is fairly
redundant: ``Baywatch'' itself really couldn't have been any
funnier. But for fans of amply endowed eye candy and
anatomy-centered gags of the PG-13 variety, it's Nirvana.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Stack, who proved his predilection for endless genitalia
puns on his talk-show parody ``Nightstand With Dick Dietrick,''
created this comedy about a ``Malibu-adjacent'' beach, and stars as
``Notch'' Johnson, the scrawny leader of the lifeguard team, who
happens to be the only guy oblivious to the rampant pulchritude
surrounding him. Notch likes to say things like, ``My unit may not
be the biggest, but it's certainly the best'' _ this, apparently,
is such a good joke it gets repeated a time or two in the premiere
episode.
</P>
<P>
   Stack's character is an inveterate do-gooder and, like all good
lifeguards, lists crime-busting as part of his job description.
Unfortunately, he's introduced via a weak piece of physical comedy,
stumbling across the beach, running into people and things and
ultimately taking a pratfall on top of an obese woman. Not an
auspicious beginning, for Notch or the series.
</P>
<P>
   Since the show is executive-produced by Howard Stern, Notch is
surrounded, of course, by buxom babes (Jaime Bergman, Leila Arcieri
and Kim Oja), not to mention a Teutonic hunk (Roland Kickinger),
all with double-entendre or, in some cases, triple-entendre names.
The humor is hit-and-miss and mostly centered on the fact that
humans have sex organs and enjoy using them but are frequently
prevented from doing so by the individuals with whom they would
like to put them to use.
</P>
<P>
   There are legitimately clever touches _ the flourishes
reminiscent of an old Quinn Martin production, the idea that a
beach would have an exchange program both with Austria and the
inner-city and a conniving mayor, named after a feminine-hygiene
product, who considers discrediting a lifeguard her sole ticket to
further political success.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, particularly clever moments are usually followed
by a thuddingly obvious joke aimed at the target audience of
14-year-old boys.
</P>
<P>
   But it's harmless enough and occasionally aspires to the kind of
smart-dumb comedy ``There's Something About Mary'' perfected. In
the first episode, Notch cracks open an Asian prostitution ring and
hosts a day at the beach for a bunch of sick kids, making for
fertile ground for all manner of politically incorrect jokes.
</P>
<P>
   One of the attractive young actresses is trussed up wearing
nothing but her bra and panties (THAT scene will end up on her
audition reel!). Notch races on a personal jet-ski against a
pointedly obvious backdrop. So it won't win any Emmys or even a
Peabody Award; it's not a sign of impending apocalypse, either.
What it does, however, is have a keen understanding of its
audience. &QL;

   OK, so her latest movie tanked. So everything in Annette
Bening's existence isn't picture perfect. You'd still trade lives
with her in a nanosecond.
</P>
<P>
   With her fourth child due within a month, a best-actress Oscar
nomination and a Screen Actors Guild Award for a film she made
purely for love, and her marriage to Warren Beatty as solid as
ever, Bening could hardly ask for more.
</P>
<P>
   Understandably, the statuesque star _ who, with her chic black
maternity ensemble and attractively short haircut, is a model of
third-trimester glamour _ exudes gratitude and graciousness with
practically everything she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's, maybe, even sweeter this time,'' the 41-year-old Bening
says of her ``American Beauty'' nomination (she competed for the
supporting-actress Academy Award in 1990 for her work in ``The
Grifters''). ``Back then, I felt like I was still sort of a stage
actress pretending to be a movie actress. Now, having done a few
movies, I know how rare it is for something to really come
together. Despite all the best intentions of everybody involved,
it's very, very difficult to make a good movie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty'' has definitely been the ongoing movie
surprise of the last six months. Written and directed by
feature-film first-timers, the scathingly satiric critique of
contemporary suburban values seemed, in many ways, too bold, too
smart and too exuberantly nasty for popular success _ and for the
academy's generally delicate, middlebrow tastes.
</P>
<P>
   But the picture became an unexpected commercial hit and, after
rising and falling through the early heats of awards season, it has
emerged as the Oscar front-runner with a leading eight nominations.
The movie, which won the bellwether best dramatic film Golden
Globe, has also done better at the box office in its Oscar season
re-release than Bening's brand-new film, the science-fiction sex
farce ``What Planet Are You From?'' ``Beauty'' is now closing in on
a benchmark $100 million gross, an unparalleled achievement for
what is, in many ways, an unapologetic art film.
</P>
<P>
   ``This picture was made for love,'' she says. ``It was really
made without having to make one compromise. I've been involved in a
lot of movies that feel responsible to find an audience because
they've spent so much money making it. In this case, DreamWorks
gave us a relatively tiny amount of money and then said, `Do what
you want.' So no decision on the movie was made for any other
reason than that it seemed right for the film in terms of casting
and story and everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, the fact that it came together so beautifully and turned
into a movie that was touching to people was, in itself, great. And
then, for it to be something that people wanted to see, and then be
something that the academy recognized, is really a thrill, and very
affirming for all of us who loved it.''
</P>
<P>
   Though a British theatrical phenomenon before making his movie
debut, ``Beauty'' director Sam Mendes was less familiar with
Bening's extensive stage credentials (graduate of San Francisco's
prestigious American Conservatory Theatre, Tony nominee and
Clarence Derwent Award winner in New York, an Ovation Award nominee
for her recent star turn in Ibsen's ``Hedda Gabler'' at Westwood's
Geffen Playhouse) than with her diverse movie work in such films as
``The American President,'' ``Mars Attacks!'' and ``Bugsy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always loved Annette,'' Mendes says. ``She's a wonderful
actress (who) can be absolutely hilarious and have virtually no
vanity in her performances. I thought it was time she did something
that really stretched her, and she threw herself into this totally,
in such a good way.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Bening was rewarded with a a SAG award for best
actress. She faces the same field of competitors on Oscar night.
But no matter what happens on March 26, you get the impression
she'll be genuinely pleased with the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen most of the other performances, and it feels really
good to be among that group,'' she says. ``This year, the academy
is recognizing a lot of work that came from the heart. There have
been years when the academy went more toward what's popular and
commercial, so I'm very proud to be part of a year that's less
skewed that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, claiming a statuette could well be a second priority
on the big night. Though not scheduled to arrive until April, the
baby could come anytime before that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know for sure about (winning) the Oscar, but with a
pregnancy, at least, you know what you'll be getting at the end,''
she says with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Talk of having a helicopter parked behind the Dorothy Chandler
Pavilion should Bening or Beatty need to make a quick hospital run
is, at this point, premature (pardon the pun). But nothing short of
labor is going to keep the actress away from the ceremonies. Though
not necessarily for the reason you'd expect.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband is getting the Thalberg Award that night,'' she
says, and the prestigious, honorary prize for movie producing is
clearly a big deal to Beatty. ``When I saw the look on his face
when he first told me they were going to give it to him ... I'll
never forget it, he was so excited. It means more to him, I think,
than anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, almost anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really looking forward to that _ there'll be a wonderful
presentation at the Oscars,'' she says of Beatty's honor. ``If he
can be there. If I'm not there, he won't be either.''
</P>
<P>
   And happily so. The late-in-life domestication of Warren Beatty
is still something of a marvel to veteran Hollywood-watchers. For
decades the town's most notorious ladies man and then, as now, a
maddeningly tough guy to get to commit to anything, Beatty has
embraced family life with Bening with all the formidable ardor he
once reserved for his personal film projects.
</P>
<P>
   And the feelings are obviously reciprocated, even though Bening
has made a great effort to define herself apart from the marriage
professionally. She invariably refers to her spouse as ``my
husband'' rather than by his famous name during interviews. And
although she likes to joke about a lot of things, she sidesteps the
obvious gags about doing ``Planet'' love scenes with one of
Beatty's closest friends, Garry Shandling.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, she seems more than willing to face the
demands of being a presidential candidate's wife _ as long as it's
in some future election cycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would've been a lot this year,'' notes an eye-rolling
Bening, whose husband flirted with running for the Democratic
Party's nomination a few months back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have been up there like a lot of the wives are,
standing next to them all the time. I would've been sitting
somewhere on the sidelines with my feet up. ``But especially right
now, given how the campaign is, I wish there was someone on the
left,'' says Bening, ``someone talking about so many things that
are just completely ignored in the dialogue. I think that, if
(Beatty) decides to do that one day, it would be great. I like his
politics, I agree with him. But I also think that, once you get
into public life, it's hard to get out. It's such a personal
decision; whatever he decided to do, I would say `good.'''
</P>
<P>
   As for the ever-growing Beatty bloc of future voters, Bening
pats her substantial tummy and laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have now reached the end of the line. I think I've made my
contribution in that department,'' she giggles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh boy, it gets more complicated every time. They (her other
children _ ages 8, 5 and 2) are everywhere now! Every time you turn
around, there's one standing there.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's the great thing about pregnancy. Because it's
horrid, even the healthy pregnancies, knock on wood, that I've had.
It's still a big journey to go through, physically. But knowing
that at the end you get this wonderful prize is pretty sweet. There
is nothing like it.'' &QL;

   The New York Times News Service is planning an expanded weather
package, with a planned starting date of Monday, March 20, which
will be transmitted on Sunday, March 19. The package, consisting of
a weather map as a graphics file and a text file to accompany the
map, is available to graphics clients of the News Service. The new
map grows to 4 columns in width (52 picas), from 3, and is 6 inches
deep; the old was 4 inches deep. This new size permits the
insertion of cloud cover information and the addition of many new
cities.
</P>
<P>
   The map is available both in color and in black and white.
Because the map is much more detailed, we have devised an entirely
new palette of colors to make it easier to read the added
information. A sample of the new map is available at Wieck,
Newscom, Presslink and AP's GraphicsNet.

   &UR; FOR TUESDAY AMs &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Here are today's top news stories from The New York Times News
Service for AMs of Tuesday, March 14:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TRIBUNE-TIMES MIRROR &LR;  (``f'' code)
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times plans 1{ pages of stories, photos and
graphics on the purchase by The Tribune Co. of the Times Mirror Co.
</P>
<P>
   TRIBUNE-TIMESMIRROR (Undated) _ The Tribune Co., owner of The
Chicago Tribune, will acquire The Times Mirror Co., owner of The
Los Angeles Times, for $6.4 billion, before the assumption of about
$1.4 billion in debt. The Tribune's offer is for about $95 a share
in stock and cash, double the Tribune's closing price on Friday.
The first half of the offer will be in cash, and the rest offers
2.5 shares of Tribune for each share of Times MIrror. The
acquisition will end the confrontational reign of Mark Willes at
Times Mirror. It will create a company with daily newspapers in the
three biggest United States markets and some overlaps in newspaper
and television markets. By Felicity Barringer and Laura M. Holson.
</P>
<P>
   With graphics and map.
</P>
<P>
   TRIBUNE-HISTORY (Los Angeles) _ The Tribune-Times Mirror deal
joins two venerable newspaper companies: Times Mirror, owned for a
century by the Otis and Chandler families, and Tribune, shaped for
much of this century by Col. Robert R. McCormick. The companies
have followed parallel paths for much of their existence. By Todd
S. Purdum.
</P>
<P>
   TRIBUNE-MADIGAN (Chicago) _ A look at Jack Madigan, the chief
executive of Tribune, who with this deal becomes a much more
visible figure in the media world, and what he plans to do with the
combined operations. By David Barboza.
</P>
<P>
   TRIBUNE-IMPACT (Undated) _ A look at how the deal is likely to
affect other major players in the newspaper industry.
</P>
<P>

offer for Times Mirror. By Floyd Nottis.
</P>
<P>
   TRIBUNE-AD-COLUMN (Undated) _ The advertising industry looks at
the Times Mirror-Tribune merger. By Stuart Elliott.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OTHER FINANCIAL &LR;  (``f'' code)
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-RECESSION (Tokyo) _ Japan slipped back into a recession in
the fourth quarter of last year, falling 1.4 percent in real terms
as consumers clamped their wallets closed and public works projects
stalled. The drop came in spite of astonishingly robust capital
spending by businesses. It was the biggest fall since the economy
sank 2 percent in the spring of 1997 and the third largest
contraction since World War II. By Stephanie Strom.
</P>
<P>
   IMF-EUROPE (Frankfurt, Germany) _ European leaders are expected
to endorse Germany's new candidate, Horst Kohlers, for president of
the International Monetary Fund. This is no surprise, but there are
questions about how solidly are they behind Kohlers and about
whether the United States will go along this time. By Edmund L.
Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   CDNOW (Undated) _ CDnow, Time Warner and Sony have called off
their plan to merge Columbia House with CDnow to create a publicly
traded company. CDnow said it planned to cut costs by a third and
would explore its strategic options.
</P>
<P>
   FIAT-GM (Turin, Italy ) _ Fiat is expected to announce that it
has agreed to establish ties with General Motors. By John
Tagliabue.
</P>
<P>
   MARKETPLACE (Undated) _ The daily marketplace column.
</P>
<P>
   MARKET (New York) _ The Dow Jones industrial average was up 27
points at noon, while the Nasdaq index was down 70, about 1.4
percent. The 30-year Treasury bond was up 18/32, yielding 6.14
percent.
</P>
<P>
   NASDAQ-IPO (Undated) _ The NASD announces a vote on the plan to
sell shares in the Nasdaq stock market. By Alex Berenson.
</P>
<P>
   SCHWAB-USTRUST (New York) _ The acquisition of U.S. Trust by
Charles Schwab, which would create the first of a new breed of
financial holding companies, is being opposed by a New York
activist group on the grounds that U.S. Trust's community
investment has been inadequate. By Patrick McGeehan.
</P>
<P>
   AETNA (Undated) _ Developments in the wake of Aetna's decision
to split its operations instead of being acquired. By Jonathan
Fuerbringer.
</P>
<P>
   I2-ASPECT (Undated) _ I2, whose software links manufacturers to
suppliers, has agreed to buy the Internet-commerce software maker
Aspect Development for $9.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-TRADE (Shanghai) _ China says it will seek to enter the
World Trade Organization with or without support from the U.S.
Congress, a move that is sure to put pressure on United States
legislators to approve permanent normal trade relations and weakens
Washington's ability to influence China on such sensitive subjects
as reunification with Taiwan. By Craig S. Smith.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-BANKS (Tokyo) _ Bankers say Sanwa Bank is in the final
stages of negotiations on joining forces with Asahi Bank and Tokai
Bank, which previously announced their intention to merge. If the
amalgamation takes place, it would create the second-largest bank
in terms of assets after the Mizuho Financial Group, which will
come to life this fall when Fuji Bank, the Industrial Bank of Japan
and Dai-Ichi Kangyo merge. It would mean that in less than one
year, the ranks of large Japanese ``city'' banks has started
shrinking to five from nine. By Stephanie Strom.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (``i'' code)
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-CHECHNYA (Moscow) _ Acting President Vladimir Putin
announces the capture of Salman Raduyev, a notorious Chechen
warlord. The Announcement comes after string of setbacks for
Russian forces in Chechnya. By Michael R. Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   BOSNIA-TRIBUNAL (The Hague) _ The war crimes tribunal takes up
its first Srebrenica case with the beginning of a trial of a former
Bosnian Serb general accused of genocide. By David Rohde.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-U.S. (Dateline to kum) _ James P. Rubin, the U.S. State
Department spokesman, continues his 3-day mission to Kosovo to urge
Albanian leaders to do more to stem ethnic violence. By Carlotta
Gall.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   CHINA-TAIWAN (Beijing) _ China and Taiwan near agreement for
China to accept nuclear waste (not bomb material) from Taiwan and
for Taiwan to aid China's nuclear power program. By Erik Eckholm.
</P>
<P>
   TAIWAN-MARKET (Hong Kong) _ Taiwan's stock market in Taipei
suffers its biggest one-day point drop ever on fears that governing
Nationalists will lose the presidential election on Saturday. By
Mark Landler.
</P>
<P>
   IRAN-ATTACK (Dateline to kum) _ Half a dozen mortar round
slammed into a Tehran residential building next to a Revolutionary
Guards base on Monday and Iraq-based rebels claimed responsibility.
The attack was the second violent incident in the Iranian capital
in two days, following the attempted assassination on Sunday of a
leading reformer and close ally of President Mohammad Khatami. By
John F. Burns.
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-POLITICS (Jerusalem) _ Prime Minister Ehud Barak faces
three no-confidence votes in Parliament, two from the right and one
from the left. By Deborah Sontag.
</P>
<P>
   POPE-ISRAEL (Jerusalem) _ Caught in a dispute over where Jesus
was baptized, Pope John Paul II will visit what Israel says is the
site as well as the place Jordan says is the site. By Joel
Greenberg.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POLITICS &LR;  (``p'' code)
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-REFORM (Austin, Texas) _ For Gov. George W. Bush, reform
has been a matter of legislative proposals rather than an
overriding political philosophy, which might explain why few people
in Texas would have picked the word reformer when asked to describe
the governor. ``He's an incremental change specialist,'' said Bruce
Buchanan, a political scientist at the University of Texas,
``sometimes in a partisan way, like tort reform, which is a big
business issue, sometimes in a bipartisan way, such as small
changes in education.'' For Bush, success has come when changes
have been modest or when he has not had to buck political interests
or popular will. When he has been boldest, he has fallen short of
his goals. By Jim Yardley and Richard A. Oppel Jr.
</P>
<P>
   GORE (Dateline to kum) _ Vice President Al Gore's campaign day.
By Katharine Q. Seeye.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH (Undated) _ A reporter's notebook on the Bush campaign. By
Clifford J. Levy.

<P>
   &UR; WASHINGTON &LR;  (``w'' code)

<P>
   CLINTON-MEDICARE (Cleveland) _ President Clinton presents new
data to support his proposal for Medicare coverage of prescription
drugs; criticizes alternatives proposed by Republicans. By Robert
Pear. (950 words)
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-EMAIL (Washington) _ Congressional investigators clash
with the White House over thousands of mishandled e-mails. By Marc
Lacey. (900 words)
</P>
<P>
   INTEL-AWARDS (Washington) _ High School winners of the Intel
Awards, formerly known as Westinghouse Science awards. By Irvin
Molotsky. (600 words)
</P>
<P>
   (Eds, announcement is tonight.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SCIENCE &LR;  (``a'' code)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-EVOLUTIONARY-PSYCHOLOGY (Undated) _ When two scientists
proposed in a recent book that rape was best viewed as a sexual act
with its roots in evolution, it set off a squall of protest from
feminists and social scientists, won the researchers appearances on
shows like NBC's ``Dateline,'' and became the talk of the cocktail
party circuit. Even last week the controversy continued, with the
book's authors conducting a rancorous exchange over a scathing
review in the scientific journal Nature. But the case put forward
was not, as some assumed, a fringe theory developed by a pair of
renegade researchers. Rather, the arguments fit into a larger
theoretical framework, the work of a group of scientists who have
ushered Darwin into new and provocative areas, including sexual
attraction between men and women, parenting, jealousy and violence,
as well as less touchy regions like the learning of language and
the organization of perception. By Erica Goode. (3500 words)

   The New York Times News Service plans the following  &UR; Science
Times &LR;  stories for papers of Tuesday, March 14:
</P>
<P>
   SCI-EVOLUTIONARY-PSYCHOLOGY (Undated) _ When two scientists
proposed in a recent book that rape was best viewed as a sexual act
with its roots in evolution, it set off a squall of protest from
feminists and social scientists, won the researchers appearances on
shows like NBC's ``Dateline,'' and became the talk of the cocktail
party circuit. Even last week the controversy continued, with the
book's authors conducting a rancorous exchange over a scathing
review in the scientific journal Nature. But the case put forward
was not, as some assumed, a fringe theory developed by a pair of
renegade researchers. Rather, the arguments fit into a larger
theoretical framework, the work of a group of scientists who have
ushered Darwin into new and provocative areas, including sexual
attraction between men and women, parenting, jealousy and violence,
as well as less touchy regions like the learning of language and
the organization of perception. By Erica Goode. (3500 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MARS-NASA (Undated) _ NASA on Monday issued its findings on
the Mars orbiter that was lost and on its ``faster, cheaper,
better'' strategy that has come under some criticism. By Warren E.
Leary. (800 words) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MARS-GEOLOGY (Undated) _ The Mars Global Surveyor, which
keeps orbiting the planet 12 times a day, is giving scientists a
clearer and more intriguing view of the planet's geology. By John
Noble Wilford. (725 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photos, NYT1,2
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MOON-METEORITES (Undated) _ Fresh analysis of moon dirt, or
regolith, has raised speculation that an upsurge of meteorite
bombardment could have contributed to the emergence of complex
lifeforms with diverse anatomical designs. By dating glass beads in
the lunar soil provided striking evidence that meteors had been
creating craters at a higher rate over the last 400 million years.
By John Noble Wilford. (1225 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-EXTINCTION-HOTSPOTS (Undated) _ Once ecosystems lose key
species, they are not likely to recover their full function and
biotic variety in less than about 10 million years, according to a
new analysis. But other scientists say that there may be a
practical way to stem the tide of extinction markedly: by
concentrating conservation efforts and funds on a relatively small
number of highly vulnerable ``hotspots'' around the world that each
contain a large concentration of species found nowhere else. By
William K. Stevens. (640 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WOLVES-RESURGENT (Undated) _ On the brink of extinction just
a few years ago, wolves are thriving in many areas around the
world, often to the delight of city dwelling conservations but to
the chagrin of farmers. By David Binder. (1250 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-POLLUTION-CLIMATE (Undated) _ New findings on aerosols,
microscopic particles of atmospheric dust, sea salt and smoke,
confirm scientists' suspicions: The flood of aerosols loosed by
urban and industrial pollution suppresses rainfall and snowfall
downwind of the pollution source. In the process, clouds become
brighter, reflecting more sunlight. They may also stay around
longer, and the combined effect is to exert extra cooling on
localities and regions underneath those particular clouds.. By
William K. Stevens. (900 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-DISCOVERY-HYPE (Undated) _ Too often, scientific discoveries
are forced into hype to grasp the public interest. In truth, most
developments are incremental. An essay by Lawrence M. Krauss. (1060
words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WATCH (Undated) _ News and notes on science: Items on a
microbe that thrives on acid, how decor affects pollution in a home
and how solar flares can interfere with spacecraft and radio
transmissions. By Henry Fountain. (675 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRAIN-LOCATIONS (Undated) _ A scientific technique called
functional magnetic resonance imaging, or FMRI, is finding precise
brain locations related to all sorts of human traits and
activities. Among them are hyperactivity centers in children, cells
that specialize in the naming of fruits and a even spot in the
brain that lights up when a man is sexually aroused. By Sandra
Blakeslee. (1530 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-COLON-CANCER (Undated) _ Cases column. A simple but invasive
procedure can help doctors catch colon cancer early (or even in
preliminary stages), but many people, especially men, are put off
by the process. By Richard M. Cohen. (1250 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-INFECTIONS-HOME (Undated) _ As health care moves
increasingly from the hospital to the living room, infection, the
bane of the medical institution, is moving with it. By Eric
Nagourney. (750 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MIGRAINE (Undated) _ Many Americans fail to take advantage
of current treatments available for migraine headaches, new
literature shows. By Keith Mulvihill. (1050 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ Personal Health column: Despite the
extensive reorganization of medical care that this country has
witnessed in recent years, the health maintenance organization
remains penny wise and pound foolish. And the consumer are paying
the price, with health and pocketbook. By Jane E. Brody. (1230
words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ News and notes on health and
fitness:
</P>
<P>
   _ When a heart-attack victim is rushed to the emergency room,
chances are that among the array of treatments doctors administer
will be one of the drugs known as clot-busters. But in many of
those cases, because doctors have to make crucial dosage decisions
on the fly, the drugs may be doing more harm than good, a new study
has found. 315 words.
</P>
<P>
   _ A common heart condition, irregular heartbeat, which under
normal condition poses little problem, may have more serious
consequences if a heart attack strikes. 155 words.
</P>
<P>
   _ Neurologists are reporting several cases where a small,
tumorlike mass can cause people to feel like they have to laugh.
The patients, whose conditions were described in a recent issue of
the journal Neurology, said that the sensation was not unpleasant,
but that it could be unnerving. 205 words.
</P>
<P>
   _ It is no secret that serious credit card debt is bad for one's
financial health, but it could also be bad for physical health.
Sociologists writing in the journal Social Science &AMP; Medicine say
they have found evidence that people who owe money on their credit
cards tend to be in poorer health. 290 words.
</P>
<P>
   _ On paper, the instructions for someone facing a barium enema
exam are not very complicated: follow the diet guidelines and take
the medicine to help empty the lower intestine. The procedure is
straightforward. But for many patients, doctors say, the first
hurdle is not the enema itself but the instructions, which many
people cannot fully understand them. 225 words.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ A science question answered: Why don't the
eyes freeze up? By C. Claiborne Ray. (300 words)

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Nearly half of the ice covering the Arctic has
melted, warns an authoritative report to be published in May.
</P>
<P>
   An alarming disappearance of ice is occurring at both poles and
from glaciers worldwide as global warming proceeds, and in decades
there could be none left at all on the Arctic ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The report, from the Worldwatch Institute, in Washington,
describes how entire ice shelves have already disintegrated in the
Antarctic and how a fifth of the glaciers in the eastern Himalayas
have vanished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earth's ice cover is melting at an astonishing rate,'' it
says. The melting had ``accelerated rapidly'' over the past decade
as more and more polluting ``greenhouse gases'' contaminated the
atmosphere, increasing global warming and preparing the way for
raised sea levels and more flooding.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Government announced a radical program to cut
Britain's emissions of the gases to a level that goes beyond what
is legally required, in an attempt to breathe new life into
faltering international negotiations over combating climate change.
</P>
<P>
   John Prescott, Britain's deputy prime minister, warned of more
disasters, like the recent floods in Mozambique, as global warming
increases.
</P>
<P>
   The Worldwatch report says that every two years an area the size
of Denmark vanishes from the ice sheet that covers the Arctic Ocean
around the North Pole. Meanwhile, the remaining ice has lost nearly
half its thickness.
</P>
<P>
   The overall volume of the ice has shrunk by 40 percent over the
past 30 years, and it could all be gone ``in a matter of decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Three Antarctic ice sheets have ``fully disintegrated'' and two
more are ``expected to break up soon.''
</P>
<P>
   The World Glacier Monitoring Service has also reported
``extreme'' losses of ice from the world's mountains over the past
few years. &QL;

 c.2000 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Bill Hanlon and Warren Ward were out hunting on a
glacier in the far north of Canada last summer when they stumbled
on a human hip protruding from the ice.
</P>
<P>
   They looked down to see the perfectly preserved body of a
prehistoric man, wearing a cloak made of arctic squirrel skins.
Scattered around him were a walking stick, a wooden spear, a bone
knife, a leather pouch with half-eaten food, and a broad-rimmed
straw hat, just as he had dropped them when he fell into a crevasse
12,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the beginning of the 1990s a different glacier _ this
one just a few yards inside Italy in the Alps _ disgorged another
prehistoric hunter, his shoes stuffed with straw to keep out the
cold.
</P>
<P>
   The icemen have come back to humanity, after thousands of years,
because the glaciers that entombed them are melting all over the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Lester Brown, president of the authoritative Worldwatch
Institute, says: ``Our ancestors are emerging from the ice with a
message for us: Earth is getting warmer.'' This spring his
institute will publish a striking catalogue of the world's
shrinking ice cover.
</P>
<P>
   Glaciers now are smaller than at any time in the past 5,000
years while the ice covers at both poles are melting.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwatch reports that the Arctic ice cap is shrinking by
24,000 sq. km every year. Worse, it is now on average five-foot
thick compared with nine feet just 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall,'' the report says, ``the Arctic sea ice has lost some
40 percent of its volume in less than 30 years. If the melting
continues at this pace, experts predict the ice pack could be gone
in a matter of decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the map of Antarctica has been changed forever over
the past decade as three great ice-sheets _ the Wordie, the Larsen
A and the Prince Gustav shelves _ have disappeared entirely.
</P>
<P>
   Two more _ the Larsen B and the Wilkins shelves _ have lost a
seventh of their combined area in the past 18 months and, the
report says, ``are expected to break up soon.''
</P>
<P>
   The melting of this floating ice, at both poles, will not raise
sea levels since it already displaces the equivalent amount of
water. But there are some signs that land-based ice is disappearing
too.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of the southern and eastern edges of the Greenland Ice
Sheet, which contains eight percent of the world's ice, have been
thinning by more than three feet a year for the past six years.
</P>
<P>
   The Antarctic ice cap has so far remained stable. But the Pine
Island Glacier, thought by some scientists to be the key to the
future of the smaller, West Antarctic Ice Sheet, has retreated by
1.2 km a year over the past four years and is thinning by more than
10 feet annually.
</P>
<P>
   If the West Antarctic Ice Sheet were to melt, sea levels around
the world would rise by nearly 20 feet, submerging vast areas of
the land.
</P>
<P>
   One third of the present sea level rise _ between 10 cm and 25
cm over the past century _ has been caused by melting glaciers; the
rest comes from the way the oceans expand as they warm up. They are
increasingly thinning and retreating up the mountainsides.
</P>
<P>
   Glaciers both in the Alps and the Caucasus have lost half their
ice over the past 100 to 150 years. Half of Spain's glaciers have
disappeared, along with two-thirds of those in the Glacier National
Park in Montana in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   And the melting is accelerating. The Gangotri Glacier in the
Himalayas is receding twice as fast as 25 years ago, the Speka
Glacier in Uganda by three times as much. And the Quelccaya Glacier
in the Peruvian Andes is now retreating 10 times as fast as just a
decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   The report estimates that the world could lose up to a quarter
of all its glacier ice by 2050 and half by 2100, leaving the only
large remaining patches in Alaska, Patagonia and the Himalayas.
</P>
<P>
   Already some effects are being felt. The retreat of the
Quelccaya Glacier threatens water supplies for Lima's 10 million
people, while the melting of Himalayan glaciers is leading to
spring floods followed by water scarcity in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   As ice disappears it ceases to reflect heat back into space,
causing global warming to speed up. And scientists increasingly
believe that as more and more fresh water gets into the Atlantic,
the Gulf Stream may be directed southwards, paradoxically making
Britain and northwest Europe very much colder as the rest of the
world heats up.
</P>
<P>
   The melting of the world's ice is only the latest of a host of
signs that global warming is already under way. Eight of the 10
hottest years on record have occurred in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   Violent weather, long predicted to accompany the climate change,
is increasing: the amount of damage done by storms in 1998 alone
exceeded the total for the whole of the 1980s and, as the
Independent on Sunday reported last summer, two Pacific islands
have disappeared beneath the waves.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the world dithers. Governments have yet to put the final
touches to the Kyoto Agreement of two years ago, designed to be the
first small step towards cutting back the pollution that causes
global warming.
</P>
<P>
   It is far from certain that they will agree to them at a crucial
meeting in November: the U.S., with 4 percent of the world's people
while producing 20 percent of its carbon dioxide, still shows
little sign of accepting the agreement. &QL;

   For once Britain is in the lead. Last week ministers unveiled
plans to cut Britain's emissions of greenhouse gases by 21.5
percent by the year 2020, almost twice as much as they agreed to
under the Kyoto Agreement, making it the only country in the world
to go further than obliged to do.

</P>
<P>
   But still the world is moving at a glacial pace. Perhaps,
environmentalists hope, the news of the speed at which the world is
melting might just break the diplomatic ice. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Bill Hanlon and Warren Ward were out hunting on a
glacier in the far north of Canada last summer when they stumbled
on a human hip protruding from the ice.
</P>
<P>
   They looked down to see the perfectly preserved body of a
prehistoric man, wearing a cloak made of arctic squirrel skins.
Scattered around him were a walking stick, a wooden spear, a bone
knife, a leather pouch with half-eaten food, and a broad-rimmed
straw hat, just as he had dropped them when he fell into a crevasse
12,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the beginning of the 1990s a different glacier _ this
one just a few yards inside Italy in the Alps _ disgorged another
prehistoric hunter, his shoes stuffed with straw to keep out the
cold.
</P>
<P>
   The icemen have come back to humanity, after thousands of years,
because the glaciers that entombed them are melting all over the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Lester Brown, president of the authoritative Worldwatch
Institute, says: ``Our ancestors are emerging from the ice with a
message for us: Earth is getting warmer.'' This spring his
institute will publish a striking catalogue of the world's
shrinking ice cover.
</P>
<P>
   Glaciers now are smaller than at any time in the past 5,000
years while the ice covers at both poles are melting.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwatch reports that the Arctic ice cap is shrinking by
24,000 sq. km every year. Worse, it is now on average five-foot
thick compared with nine feet just 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall,'' the report says, ``the Arctic sea ice has lost some
40 percent of its volume in less than 30 years. If the melting
continues at this pace, experts predict the ice pack could be gone
in a matter of decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the map of Antarctica has been changed forever over
the past decade as three great ice-sheets _ the Wordie, the Larsen
A and the Prince Gustav shelves _ have disappeared entirely.
</P>
<P>
   Two more _ the Larsen B and the Wilkins shelves _ have lost a
seventh of their combined area in the past 18 months and, the
report says, ``are expected to break up soon.''
</P>
<P>
   The melting of this floating ice, at both poles, will not raise
sea levels since it already displaces the equivalent amount of
water. But there are some signs that land-based ice is disappearing
too.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of the southern and eastern edges of the Greenland Ice
Sheet, which contains eight percent of the world's ice, have been
thinning by more than three feet a year for the past six years.
</P>
<P>
   The Antarctic ice cap has so far remained stable. But the Pine
Island Glacier, thought by some scientists to be the key to the
future of the smaller, West Antarctic Ice Sheet, has retreated by
1.2 km a year over the past four years and is thinning by more than
10 feet annually.
</P>
<P>
   If the West Antarctic Ice Sheet were to melt, sea levels around
the world would rise by nearly 20 feet, submerging vast areas of
the land.
</P>
<P>
   One third of the present sea level rise _ between 10 cm and 25
cm over the past century _ has been caused by melting glaciers; the
rest comes from the way the oceans expand as they warm up. They are
increasingly thinning and retreating up the mountainsides.
</P>
<P>
   Glaciers both in the Alps and the Caucasus have lost half their
ice over the past 100 to 150 years. Half of Spain's glaciers have
disappeared, along with two-thirds of those in the Glacier National
Park in Montana in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   And the melting is accelerating. The Gangotri Glacier in the
Himalayas is receding twice as fast as 25 years ago, the Speka
Glacier in Uganda by three times as much. And the Quelccaya Glacier
in the Peruvian Andes is now retreating 10 times as fast as just a
decade ago.

   SCI-EVOLUTIONARY-PSYCHOLOGY (Undated) _ When two scientists
proposed in a recent book that rape was best viewed as a sexual act
with its roots in evolution, it set off a squall of protest from
feminists and social scientists, won the researchers appearances on
shows like NBC's ``Dateline,'' and became the talk of the cocktail
party circuit. Even last week the controversy continued, with the
book's authors conducting a rancorous exchange over a scathing
review in the scientific journal Nature. But the case put forward
was not, as some assumed, a fringe theory developed by a pair of
renegade researchers. Rather, the arguments fit into a larger
theoretical framework, the work of a group of scientists who have
ushered Darwin into new and provocative areas, including sexual
attraction between men and women, parenting, jealousy and violence,
as well as less touchy regions like the learning of language and
the organization of perception. By Erica Goode. (3500 words)

creating craters at a higher rate over the last 400 million years.

<P>
   SCI-EXTINCTION-HOTSPOTS (Undated) _ Once ecosystems lose key
species, they are not likely to recover their full function and
biotic variety in less than about 10 million years, according to a
new analysis. But other scientists say that there may be a
practical way to stem the tide of extinction markedly: by
concentrating conservation efforts and funds on a relatively small
number of highly vulnerable ``hotspots'' around the world that each
contain a large concentration of species found nowhere else. By

   SCI-POLLUTION-CLIMATE (Undated) _ New findings on aerosols,
microscopic particles of atmospheric dust, sea salt and smoke,
confirm scientists' suspicions: The flood of aerosols loosed by
urban and industrial pollution suppresses rainfall and snowfall
downwind of the pollution source. In the process, clouds become
brighter, reflecting more sunlight. They may also stay around

TAIWAN STOCK MARKET IS SHAKEN BY ELECTION FEARS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK LANDLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Fears that Taiwan's governing Nationalist Party may
lose next Saturday's closely fought presidential election surged
through the Taipei stock market Monday, causing its largest
single-day point loss in its history and the largest percentage
decline in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Taipei's main stock index plummeted 617 points, or 6.6 percent,
to 8,811.95 in a panicky session described as driven almost
entirely by politics. Analysts said investors were worried that a
victory by the Democratic Progressive Party candidate, Chen
Shui-bian, would inflame relations between Taiwan and China.
</P>
<P>
   China has sharply criticized Chen for advocating independence
for Taiwan, which it views as a renegade province. Chen's party
formally favors an independent Taiwan, though he has pledged not to
declare independence if elected.
</P>
<P>
   The three main candidates to succeed President Lee Teng-hui _
Chen, Vice President Lien Chan of the Nationalist Party, and James
Soong, an independent _ are running neck and neck in the most
competitive presidential race ever seen here. But Chen seems to be
gaining momentum at the expense of Lien.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's law bans the publication of opinion polls in the final
two weeks of the campaign, though, which means that statistical
predictions have been replaced by anecdotal evidence, hunches, and
pure speculation.
</P>
<P>
   Chen received endorsements over the weekend from three
influential corporate leaders and one of Taiwan's most eminent
academics, Lee Yuan-tseh. Lee, a Nobel-Prize-winning chemist,
offered to resign as president of a top research institute to serve
as an adviser to Chen.
</P>
<P>
   Chen also drew an estimated 400,000 people to a rally in
Kao-hsiung, a southern port city that is a stronghold of the
Democratic Progressive Party. The rally, the largest and most
raucous of the campaign so far, impressed political oddsmakers with
its organization and fervor.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Chen Shui-bian wins the election, there is likely to be a
period of volatility because of the uncertainty about Taiwan's
policies toward China,'' said Dong Tao, a regional analyst at
Credit Suisse First Boston. ``There would also be uncertainty about
how to deal with the Nationalist Party.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in Taipei last week, Chen contended that the
Nationalist Party was playing the ``China terror card'' _ warning
that a Chen victory would wreak havoc on the stock market and the
economy. Monday, Chen and several market analysts said they believe
that the Nationalists ordered government-related funds to sell
their shares to deepen the market decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is heartbreaking and regrettable to see the Nationalists
ignoring the interests of civilians and stock investors,'' Chen
said at a rally near Taipei.
</P>
<P>
   The Nationalists denied that they orchestrated the selloff. And
they contended that legislators from the Democratic Progressive
Party had held up the approval of a $16.3 billion ``stabilization
fund,'' which the government could have used to protect the market
from just this kind of politically driven panic.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of a gyrating stock market on the vote is
unpredictable, though analysts believe that instability generally
helps the Nationalist Party, since it represents the status-quo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The party is taking a risk here,'' said one market analyst.
``Instead of pushing up the market to please voters, they're
saying, `If you don't vote for us, this is the danger.'''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Whatever Chen's concrete support, there is no question that his
campaign is generating more attention in the closing days than
those of either of his rivals. The endorsements from Lee Yuan-tseh
and the business executives are important because they lend weight
to a candidate whose support is seen as coming mostly from younger
voters and from native Taiwanese, like Chen himself, instead of the
mainlanders who fled to Taiwan after the Communists gained control
of the mainland in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   The three executives _ Stan Shih of Acer Computer, Chang
Rong-far of Evergreen Group, and Hsu Wen-lung of Chi Mei Industry _
are also native Taiwanese. But collectively, they represent the
industrial elite.
</P>
<P>
   They also have close ties to Lee Teng-hui, whom analysts say has
tepid feelings for his vice president, Lien. Though Lee insists he
supports Lien and campaigned for him over the weekend, rumors swept
the market today that the president was about to abandon his deputy
for Chen.
</P>
<P>
   The Nationalist Party has not only lost supporters to Chen.
Several senior party officials have defected to Soong, who was
himself a party heavyweight. One of those officials, Chen Pi, said
in an interview that he could not support Lien because ``his style
is to do little or nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People in Taiwan long for reform,'' said Chen, a former
provincial police chief of Taiwan. ``But Mr. Lien hasn't satisfied
people's expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts said there would be more twists and turns
before March 18. And they cautioned that despite the mood Monday,
the Nationalist Party would have an unrivaled ability to mobilize
voters on election day.

IT'S INVASIVE, IT'S UNPLEASANT AND IT CAN SAVE YOUR LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Md., N.Y.)   (Science Times)  
 (af)  
 Richard M. Cohen is a veteran television producer and writer.  
 By RICHARD M. COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It's time. You're over 50,'' my internist said casually during
my routine physical in November. ``I'm sure you don't want to hear
this, but you really should have a colonoscopy. Is there colon
cancer in your family?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, there was,'' I answered. ``My maternal grandmother
had it late in life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then this is no longer elective,'' he added decisively. ``You
have to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Great. Another invasive procedure. I already had multiple
sclerosis, with my share of ordeals by procedure, steroid
injections under my eyes and catheters snaked through arteries from
my groin to my brain. I didn't particularly want to participate in
this next adventure. I just wanted to be indemnified against
another disease.
</P>
<P>
   So now it would be the tush test. A television camera inserted
into my rectum. The closer I came to the appointed hour with the
gastroenterologist, the more I realized my utter horror was
increasing and was out of proportion. What's wrong with this
picture?
</P>
<P>
   Colonoscopies save lives. They can detect colorectal cancer
early. Most malignancies in the colon begin as benign polyps. Only
one in four people will have a polyp, which can be removed
painlessly during the procedure before it ever becomes malignant.
</P>
<P>
   The only colonoscopy with an uncertain outcome is the first.
There is no way to know in that situation what is growing and how
long it has festered before being discovered.
</P>
<P>
   My story, precisely. A polyp was removed and no one thought much
of it. Over 90 percent are benign. It was biopsied, and I learned I
had a malignancy. It took four hours of surgery and a resected
colon, but soon enough the cancer was gone.
</P>
<P>
   I was left with a sore lower back from the incision and a
powerful sense of how lucky I was. The cancer was found early. The
colonoscopy had saved my life. I realized, though, how close I had
come to postponing, if not altogether ignoring my internist's
advice.
</P>
<P>
   During the pre-op work-up, I had asked my 69-year-old internist
with the unequivocal advice when he had last subjected himself to
the dreaded procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had one,'' he muttered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why?'' I asked, not even trying to mask my incredulity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stupidity. Denial,'' he admitted. ``I want to be a doctor, not
a patient.'' Then, he added, ``I'm going to get one next month.''
</P>
<P>
   Right.
</P>
<P>
   Never has a single procedure, a test that can save lives been
greeted by more resistance, indeed repulsion. Colon cancer is the
second leading cancer killer in America. Contrary to popular
belief, it hits both genders as an equal opportunity killer.
Undergoing a colonoscopy every five years, three, if there is a
family history, is practically a fail-safe guarantee against the
disease. Yet many people don't want any part of the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame. People don't know what colonoscopies are about
today,'' said Dr. Blair Lewis, a gastroenterologist at Mount Sinai.
``They've changed. It's not like the old sigmoidoscopies, which
were blunt instruments examining the lower colon. People don't
understand that today the instrument is flexible and the whole
thing is painless.''
</P>
<P>
   It is painless. I know that now. A cocktail of sedatives takes
the edge off the discomfort, which is more in our heads than in our
rumps anyway. There are no pain receptors in the colon, and you can
watch the event progress on a television monitor at no extra
charge.
</P>
<P>
   The pictures seemed almost impressionist, very color intensive
to me. Maybe it was the drugs. Only slight abdominal pressure
registered, but the truth is, our phobias are all about the instant
of entry, the long anticipated, awful anal invasion that makes
grown men cringe.
</P>
<P>
   Face it. Guys are wimps. Women are used to routine medical
invasion. Alas, it is their lot in life. By the time a woman hits
50 and heads for the doctor, earlier if there is a family history,
she has been probed and prodded in every orifice. Women who have
borne children should laugh at such male distress. When Colonoscopy
Claus comes down the chimney, women may not jingle bells, but they
seem to sigh and embrace him.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I just did it.'' says Neen Hunt, executive director of the
Lasker Foundation, which supports medical research. ``My mother
died of colon cancer, and I had my first colonoscopy when I was 40.
I'm now 57, and I've had a few more. It's too important to my
family not to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   My mother, Terry Cohen, a retired registered nurse and staff
instructor, has had three colonoscopies and a few sigmoidoscopies
before that. ``I didn't have any particular anxieties about them. I
wasn't happy, but I just did it. As a woman, I've been through
worse than that. I was just concerned about the outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Her outcome was just fine, but that doesn't seem to be what is
on the minds of men. Jim Hightower, former agriculture commissioner
of Texas and author of ``If the Gods Had Meant Us To Vote, They
Would Have Given Us Candidates'' (HarperCollins), stopped by for
lunch recently. I talk about this stuff with everyone these days.
</P>
<P>
   Jim is 57 and has yet to undergo the procedure. ``My father died
of colon cancer,'' he said, shaking his head. ``I know I should
have one.''
</P>
<P>
   With colon cancer in the family, any person's risk of acquiring
the disease doubles by age 40. For those people, resisting colon
cancer screening is playing Russian roulette. Jim claims he watches
his diet and eats fiber regularly and, yes, is going to get a
colonoscopy. ``I'm going to do it. I just haven't gotten there
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Right.
</P>
<P>
   The most common method of colon cancer screening is flexible
sigmoidoscopy because it is now covered by Medicare. It is not
adequate in more than 50 percent of the applications, though,
because it does not reach the upper colon. So, colonoscopy remains
the probe of choice. The modern, flexible sigmoidoscopy is less
intrusive, but still there is resistance.
</P>
<P>
   The American College of Gastroenterologists runs a never-ending
advertising campaign with the warning, ``People will die of
embarrassment.'' Beyond embarrassment, the mere thought of these
procedures touches on a common fear of invasion with many men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fear of the procedures and the failure of doctors to
adequately explain them are the problem,'' explains Dr. Philip
Schoenfeld, director of gastroenterology research at the National
Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Md. Personally, I think it is the
failure of Americans to just grow up. While there are no firm
numbers, researchers estimate that only about 15 percent of people
over 50 get colonoscopies.
</P>
<P>
   Look. These tush tests stink. You have to drink hemlock and pour
your guts out in preparation for the blessed event. It is sort of
like the morning after going to a bad ethnic restaurant. But clean
intestines are happy intestines.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance hassles never end, if you are lucky enough to be
insured at all. Carriers go out of their way to cut costs, of
course, and they can make screening colonoscopies almost impossible
to obtain. Usually, the procedure is covered only when there is
cause. But the bottom line, so-to-speak, is that these procedures
are just not fun.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever said that fighting cancer should be fun?

COLD EYES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Science Times)  
 (Eds: Question may be italicized)

 By C. CLAIBORNE RAY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Why don't your eyes freeze when you are skiing or walking the
dog in subzero temperatures? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The eyes have a very efficient radiator as well as a surface
deicing system, at least in theory, said Dr. Amilia Schrier, an
ophthalmologist on the faculty of the Columbia Presbyterian Medical
Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``The eye has a tremendous vascular coating, a system of blood
vessels, that provides a constant irrigation of warm blood through
and around the eyeball to keep it warm,'' she said. This makes
freezing very unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   As for the surface of the eye, tears have a high salt
concentration, which keep them from freezing at 32 degrees, as
plain water would, she said, and the eye is constantly coated with
tears.
</P>
<P>
   It is not impossible to freeze the eye, but it requires very low
temperatures, Schrier said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a freezing procedure called retinal cryotherapy,
using a probe with liquid nitrogen, has been used to destroy
certain parts of the retina, and the same procedure is also used to
kill the cells of certain cancerous growths.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the eye is frozen for several seconds, and a visible ice
ball forms, but the eye immediately defrosts when the probe is
removed, she said. &QL;

her star turn on Kenneth Starr's witness stand, Lewinsky mostly
kept to herself in the months after her affair with Bill Clinton
became public. Then, in late December, she announced her new role
as spokeswoman for the Jenny Craig weight-loss program. In this

Christian Democratic Union. After the withdrawal on March 5 of
Volker Ruhe, Angela Merkel, the party's general secretary, has
become the hot favorite among the rank and file. But in the eyes of

   SONDHEIM ON THE MUSICAL THEATER HE HAS OUTLIVED &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SONDHEIM-CENTERPIECE-NYTSF _ Stephen Sondheim, who turns 70 on
March 22, was so obscure in 1957 that he wasn't even mentioned in
The New York Times review of ``West Side Story.'' He is now the
greatest and perhaps best-known artist in the American musical
theater. But that is a somewhat empty distinction. Sondheim may be
the last major creator of Broadway musicals. He may have even
outlived the genre, which was long ago exiled by rock music from
center stage to niche status in American culture and is now barely
a going concern. By Frank Rich. (From The New York Times magazine.)

   GORE-BUSH-DEBATE-SLATE _ Why does Al Gore want debates? Because
he's good at them, while Bush, standing at a podium alongside his
rivals, is stiff and awkward. But does the important work of the
presidency resemble an hour of jousting in 45-second sound bites?
Or does it resemble the collaborative synthesis and private,
individual negotiation at which Bush excels? The good news for Bush
is that there's a case to be made for the latter theory. The bad
news is that this case will have to be made in formal settings
under hostile fire and that he's the one who will have to make it.

Bill Bradley journeyed to his Harlem headquarters to kiss his ring,
and Al Gore met with him privately. The Rev. Soundbite organized

Spain has been a stirring success story and it will surely continue

   JEB-BUSH-RACISM-ECONOMIST _ Inside Florida's Legislature, he was

   PRESS-MEXICO-ECONOMIST _ The methods of control were more

the past seven decades the Institutional Revolutionary Party, known

2000 Biennial Exhibition opens at the Whitney Museum of American

book, ``American Dreamer: A Life of Henry A. Wallace,'' and think
again. When Henry Wallace, Franklin D. Roosevelt's third-term vice
president, had the temerity to break away from the Democratic Party

Hardly a day passes in America and Europe without an announcement

   OFFICE-OLD-NEW-NYTSF _ In the old days, offices operated on the
feudal system. There was the boss, or liege lord, who occasionally
dispensed favors _ raises, that is _ but more often withheld them.
For his gaze to fall upon you was supposed to be reward enough.
There were the knights, and beneath them the courtiers _ the
toadies and rumormongers and ladies-in-waiting. Everyone knew his
or her place. But the office is now a family, a home away from

   JOBS-EMPLOYEES-MARKET-NYTSF _ Everybody has a job in Madison,

from job to job, taking advantage of this ``employee's market,''
demanding more perks and lures, boosting their income to the max.
But people aren't behaving that way. The job-turnover rate has been
dropping even as the unemployment rate has plunged. By David

HEALTH CARE GOES HOME, AND SO DO INFECTIONS

<P>
   Tim Carter always knows when the problem is coming back. Carter,
a 48-year-old quadriplegic who uses a catheter to empty his
bladder, begins to feel fatigued. His urine changes in appearance.
And his muscles start going into spasms.
</P>
<P>
   Then he knows it is time to call the doctor for another round of
antibiotics to combat yet another infection.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who lives outside of Kansas City, Mo., receives most of
his medical care at home, including regular changes of the
catheter, which causes the infections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happens to me many times at home,'' Carter said. ``You can
get those same hospital bugs at home just as easily as you can
anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, federal health officials issued a warning: as health
care moves increasingly from the hospital to the living room,
infection, the bane of the medical institution, is moving with it.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
speaking at a conference in Atlanta on health-care-related
infections, said that in a single month last year, about 16 percent
of 5,148 patients who received home care in Missouri had
infections, a rate that would mean that at least 800,000 such
patients a year get infections.
</P>
<P>
   And as managed care forces patients out of the hospitals
earlier, infections will occur increasingly not in hospitals, where
they can be more quickly treated, but in homes where patients may
be seen only occasionally by health professionals, the federal
health officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're expecting family members to serve as home health aides,
without training,'' said Dr. Julie Gerberding, director of the
agency's Hospital Infection Program.
</P>
<P>
   Often, health care workers say, patients are discharged from
hospitals even though their homes might be unsuitable, and the
patients and their families might lack the basic skills needed to
prevent or recognize infection.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have so many other issues: sanitation, pets, rodents,
insects,'' said Carolyn Crumley, a clinical nurse specialist in
Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   From 1992 to 1996, the last year for which figures are
available, the number of patients discharged from home health care
grew by 150 percent, while the number of agencies providing the
services grew by more than half, to about 11,400, a trend likely to
continue.
</P>
<P>
   About 8 million Americans received care in their homes in 1996.
Some, like Carter, who hurt himself in 1980 while diving, have
spinal injuries. Many receive chemotherapy, others are recovering
from heart attacks or have diseases like multiple sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   Most agree that home treatment is good for patients who are not
in acute need, since people are usually happier and heal better
with their families. Mary St. Pierre, vice president of the
National Association for Home Care, defended the safety of her
profession. But she agreed that for home care to work, patients and
the families should be properly educated.
</P>
<P>
   Infection-control specialists said about 10 percent of home care
patients have invasive medical devices, including catheters,
feeding tubes and respirators that can be ideal gateways for
infection. Other patients are sent home with open wounds.
</P>
<P>
   One study presented at last week's conference found that
although catheterized patients were at higher risk for infection,
they received about the same number of medical visits to their
homes as patients without such devices.
</P>
<P>
   The infections can range from relatively minor localized
inflammations to life-threatening blood infections.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Maddox, a registered nurse in Missouri said that if nurses
followed good practices, especially aggressive sterilization,
patients were less likely to develop infections at home.
</P>
<P>
   But it can be a challenge, she said. Because of managed care,
nurses see ``people coming home much sicker, and much sooner.''

LOVE AND ELEGANCE: JENNIFER LOVE HEWITT TACKLES `AUDREY HEPBURN' 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to StarBeat, a weekly
package of five intriguing features with color art.) 
 (Includes a color slide of Jennifer Love Hewitt in a scene from
``Audrey Hepburn.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Jennifer Love Hewitt is having a diva moment. So far today she's
slapped a co-star and screamed at her director, and when a teen-age
girl shoves an autograph book at her, Hewitt curses, turns and ...
not!
 &HT;    No way. Couldn't be. Not our Love.
 &HT;    And indeed it isn't, because the actress who prefers to be
addressed as ``Love'' is generally agreed to suit the name
perfectly. In an industry rife with back-stabbing and rampant egos,
Hewitt has a reputation as a genuinely nice young woman, and she
likes it that way.
 &HT;    ``The greatest honor, better than any award you could be given,
is people thinking you're genuinely nice,'' says the star of
television's ``Time of Your Life'' and the ``I Know What You Did
Last Summer'' slasher flicks.
 &HT;    ``I try hard to be nice,'' she adds. ``I like people, and I
guess that comes out. People say the nicest things to me. I don't
know if I deserve it, but I completely appreciate it, and it sticks
in my heart for days when I'm having a tough time. Those comments
keep me going.''
 &HT;    Besides, she says by telephone from the Los Angeles set of
``Time of Your Life,'' she hasn't got much to get upset about.
 &HT;    ``If you look at my life,'' she says, ``it's pretty amazing.
I've gotten opportunities that most people never get in their life,
and I'm only 21.
 &HT;    ``I work with great people,'' Hewitt says. ``I have the most
wonderful family and friends around me _ for me to pull a diva
stunt would be completely out of the ordinary.''
 &HT;    And then the actress giggles.
 &HT;    ``That's not to say it won't happen one day,'' she confides,
``or to say I don't get in bad moods or don't get snippy or crabby
at times. But the extreme diva-ness you hear about is not me, and I
sure hope it never becomes me.
 &HT;    ``If it does,'' she adds, ``I know I have a lot of people around
me who will line up to slap me right across the face and say, `Get
out of it!'''
 &HT;    Playing a bitch, however, is another story.
 &HT;    ``I would love that,'' she says enthusiastically. ``I would love
that. I'm getting ready to play not the sweetest person in the
world.''
 &HT;    That would be in the upcoming comedy ``The Breakers,'' in which
Sigourney Weaver and Hewitt co-star as mother-and-daughter con
artists.
 &HT;    ``I play this really sexy con artist with a huge attitude and a
big chip on her shoulder,'' Hewitt says. ``It's going to be fun to
have a little bit of attitude.
 &HT;    ``I'll just use PMS 24 hours a day.''
 &HT;    For her most current project, however, Hewitt put on her angel
face and an executive producer's hat: She plays the title character
in ABC's ``The Audrey Hepburn Story,'' a three-hour-long biography
of the Hollywood legend that will air March 27.
 &HT;    ``It was a huge challenge, a huge decision and a huge
responsibility,'' Hewitt says, ``but I knew it was an opportunity
that would only come around once. It had always been my dream to
get to play Audrey one day in her life story, because she was my
favorite as an actor and a woman. She inspired me to act and to try
to be the adult I'm hopefully becoming.
 &HT;    ``It was a huge deal,'' the actress says. ``I'm incredibly
scared about people seeing it, but I'm also excited. I gave all of
myself, every single day, to every word that came out of my
mouth.''
 &HT;    The film follows Hepburn from her painful childhood in
Nazi-occupied Holland to her early success in Tinseltown. Along the
way, Hewitt recreates the Broadway production of Colette's ``Gigi''
(1951) and the classic film ``Breakfast at Tiffany's'' (1961). She
croons ``Moon River,'' and slips into Hepburn's glamorous dresses
and hairstyles.
 &HT;    ``If I've done my job, nobody will know it's me after the first
15 minutes,'' Hewitt says. ``They'll just know it's her story.
 &HT;    ``I hope people go away from it wanting to rent every single one
of her movies at the video store the following weekend,'' she adds
exuberantly. ``For the people my age who don't know who Audrey
Hepburn is _ and you'd be surprised how many there are _ I hope
they'll want to know more about her, that they'll also go and rent
her movies.
 &HT;    ``She was a truly amazing person who handled her entire life
with elegance and grace,'' Hewitt says. ``She always accepted life
as what it was and dealt with each situation at hand, and she also
gave back as much as she got.''
 &HT;    Not long after ``Audrey Hepburn'' airs, the ``Summer of Love''
will kick off. That's the tag Fox has given to its concerted effort
to save ``Time of Your Life,'' the struggling ``Party of Five''
spinoff in which Hewitt continues as Sarah Reeves, now far from
home in the wilds of New York City.
 &HT;    The show, despite debuting to surprisingly positive reviews,
quickly went south in the ratings. Hewitt and her co-stars are
still shooting episodes, however, and Fox will relaunch the series
when the weather warms up.
 &HT;    ``What's going right is that we're working really hard to make
good episodes and we're having a good time,'' Hewitt says. ``What's
going wrong ... ''
 &HT;    Hewitt giggles nervously.
 &HT;    `` ... is getting people to watch,'' she admits after a pause.
``It's a spinoff, with a character people are used to suddenly in a
different place, with new people and doing different things.
 &HT;    ``Fox is behind us,'' she says. ``They're willing to move us to
a new time slot, to take us off the air so our episodes aren't
wasted now. We're hopeful we'll get picked up for another season,
but if we don't everyone will go on and do other things.
 &HT;    ``There's nothing we can do about it,'' she concludes. ``We've
got a positive attitude and hope things turn out the way they're
supposed to.''
 &HT;    Between films, television movies and the series, Hewitt is so
busy these days that she hardly has time for a personal life. She
and MTV host Carson Daly broke up several months ago, but Hewitt
did manage to make time for a family trip to Las Vegas to toast her
21st birthday.
 &HT;    ``It balances out,'' she says. ``I find time for a personal life
when I need one.''
 &HT;    Right now, though, Hewitt is needed back on the set of her show.
 &HT;    ``I think I'm in a good place,'' she says in conclusion.
``Truly, the only thing I've ever wanted was to continue to work
and to be happy. I want to work on things I believe in, that I can
be proud of. So far I've been able to do that.
 &HT;    ``I do think I'm in a transitional place, though,'' Hewitt says.
``I'm at that fine line between teen actress and adult actress. I'm
trying to glide into adult actress gracefully, so that I have a
long, sustaining place in this business.''

JOHN CUSACK: A DIFFERENT SLANT ON STARDOM 
</HEADLINE>

entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

 (Includes a color slide of John Cusack with Iben Hjejle in a scene
from ``High Fidelity.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    He doesn't have a paycheck like Jim Carrey's. He doesn't have
clout like Harrison Ford's. He doesn't draw the paparazzi like Brad
Pitt.
 &HT;    And that's fine with John Cusack, who says the last thing he
wants is to be a superstar.
 &HT;    ``Celebrity can be sinister,'' the 33-year-old actor says.
``Celebrity is death. Celebrity is actually the worst thing that
can happen to an actor.''
 &HT;    After 17 years in the business, Cusack admits that he's still
uncomfortable with the hoopla.
 &HT;    ``Everyday people think their sorrows and joys aren't as
important as George Clooney's sorrows or mine,'' he says. ``People
think the laws of gravity don't really apply to actors. It's like
we breathe this rarefied air.''
 &HT;    His limited experience with fame is more than enough, the
Chicago-based actor insists.
 &HT;    ``I've been the guy on the cover of those magazines,'' he says,
``and I've slept with some of the girls on the covers of those
magazines. It's all designed to create envy, because no one really
exists in that form. I don't walk around perfectly lit and
airbrushed _ no one says just the right thing at just the right
times.
 &HT;    ``Life is complicated and messy.
 &HT;    ``I've also read those magazines when I'm on the cover,'' he
adds. ``I've said, `Oh, God, I seem so interesting _ I must really
be an amazing guy. Maybe I should hang out with myself a little
more.'
 &HT;    ``Or at least I'd like to meet that guy, because what they've
portrayed isn't the real me.''
 &HT;    The real Cusack is brash, bold, outspoken and offbeat, arriving
for an interview at New York's Regency Hotel wearing his trademark
``gangster'' look _ dark jeans, heavily tinted glasses and a long,
black trench coat that he won't take off for the next 45 minutes.
 &HT;    More than a few critics have called him the best actor of his
generation, but Cusack doesn't want to play that part.
 &HT;    ``I would rather have someone say, `the only actor of his
generation who hasn't sold out,''' he says. ``By selling out, I
mean crashing cars, pulling out guns, killing people _ stupid,
mindless scripts. That's what I never want to do.''
 &HT;    What he's doing these days is a low-budget comedy called ``High
Fidelity,'' opening March 31. The movie, which he calls ``a
romantic film about unromantic things,'' reunites him with director
Stephen Frears, with whom he worked on ``The Grifters'' (1990), and
the ``Grosse Point Blank'' (1997) writing team of D.V. DeVincentis
and Steve Pink.
 &HT;    Based on the best-selling novel by Nick Hornby, the movie casts
Cusack as the owner of a small, all-vinyl record store in Chicago.
 &HT;    ``I play someone who considers himself the ultimate connoisseur
of all music,'' the actor says, ``He's a guy who is a totally
obsessive music geek.
 &HT;    ``He's at this weird point where a guy realizes that he's not a
kid anymore,'' Cusack says, ``and he must re-evaluate his entire
life to this point, including what music and women have meant to
him.''
 &HT;    As the film's co-producer, he could also call upon his friends _
including Tim Robbins, Jack Black, Beverly D'Angelo, Harold Ramis
and Catherine Zeta-Jones _ to take supporting parts. His sister
Joan also shows up, as does Bruce Springsteen in his first-ever
film cameo.
 &HT;    It's a typically offbeat role for an actor who has made a habit
of turning down commercially promising films, including ``Apollo
13'' (1995), ``Sleeping With the Enemy'' (1991) and ``Indecent
Proposal'' (1993).
 &HT;    ``I look at acting like some sort of weird marathon,'' he says.
``You have to pace yourself to keep going for a long time.''
 &HT;    Going the commercial route, he believes, would endanger his
hopes for a long, productive career.
 &HT;    ``I'm pretty good at seeing the cycles of this stuff,'' Cusack
says. ``Every two years you're the flavor of the month again.
Everyone sings your praises and you're the next greatest thing _
again. Then next month there's someone else.
 &HT;    ``I don't even remember who was flavor of the year last year,''
he says. ``It doesn't matter. I want to build a body of work. I
don't think talent is enough _ you also must have integrity in this
business. You need a special sensibility to do this work, which is
a certain unwillingness to compromise.''
 &HT;    After growing up in a large, Irish-Catholic family in Evanston,
Ill., Cusack discovered acting when his older sister Joan began
studying at the Piven Theater Workshop, an acting school that
trained Aidan Quinn and all the Cusack kids, including John and his
sisters Susan and Ann.
 &HT;    ``We had to create a class around John,'' founder Byrne Piven
recalls in a separate interview. ``He was the youngest kid who ever
wanted to study. But we couldn't turn him away _ he refused to
leave the building!''
 &HT;    By the time he turned 12, Cusack was already logging time in
local commercials and industrial films. At 16, he got his first
movie role, acting opposite Jacqueline Bisset in ``Class'' (1983).
That led to a string of movies that has included such hits as
``Sixteen Candles'' (1984), ``The Sure Thing'' (1985), ``Say
Anything'' (1989), ``Bullets Over Broadway'' (1994), ``Pushing
Tin'' (1998) and the recent ``Being John Malkovich'' (1999).
 &HT;    But Cusack resists stardom tooth and nail. He lives in Chicago
instead of the movie-centered world of Hollywood, and in his spare
time continues to work with his Chicago-based theater group The New
Criminals. Its movie arm, run by Cusack, Pink and DeVincentis, is
dedicated to writing and producing the kind of films that Hollywood
doesn't want to make but Cusack loves to see.
 &HT;    ``I like movies that are both commercial and subversive,''
Cusack says.
 &HT;    The first New Crime Productions film, ``Grosse Pointe Blank,''
certainly qualifies _ in that surprisingly successful black comedy,
Cusack played an international assassin who stumbles into a midlife
crisis while attending his high-school reunion and preparing for
his next hit.
 &HT;    A sequel is in the works, and will probably feature Joan _ who
had one of her better roles in the original film _ and several
other Cusacks.
 &HT;    ``We don't have sibling rivalry,'' he says. ``We're supportive
of each other. There's a competitive spirit at times, but we're not
a mean-spirited family. We do this work for the joy of it.''
 &HT;    That's been the case, he says, ever since he first stepped onto
a film set.
 &HT;    ``I remember waking up and knowing that, instead of going to
school that day, I would be going to a movie set to hang out with
Jacqueline Bisset,'' he recalls. ``And I also remember thinking,
`I'm winning. The kids at school will think I'm winning.'
 &HT;    ``That's the joy of this work,'' he concludes. ``On most days, I
do feel like a winner.''

HIGH INTENSITY: MACY GRAY TAKES HIP-HOP BY STORM 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.)

 (Includes a color slide of singer Macy Gray.) 
 By GARY GRAFF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    When she was a child growing up in Canton, Ohio, the teasing she
got from other children made Macy Gray so self-conscious about her
unusual voice that she barely spoke, let along sang.
 &HT;    Guess who's laughing now?
 &HT;    That voice _ a high-pitched, youthful piping that sounds like
Melanie Griffith crossed with Betty Boop _ has made Gray one of the
new toasts of the pop-music world. Her debut album, ``On How Life
Is,'' has been certified gold and has been propelled into
Billboard's Top 20 by the single, ``I Try.''
 &HT;    She was nominated for two Grammy Awards, including Best New
Artist, and while Gray didn't win either one she wound up receiving
copious public praise from Grammy Legend Award recipient Elton
John, which may prove to have more lasting value.
 &HT;    Not bad for someone who says she still cringes at the sound of
her own voice.
 &HT;    ``I always really loved music, but I didn't start singing til I
was in college,'' says the 30-year-old Gray, whose real name is
Natalie McIntyre. ``When I was young, I always just felt like a
misfit. But I guess it kind of grew on me.''
 &HT;    The daughter of a math teacher and a steelworker, Gray grew up
surrounded by music. She soaked up her parent's favorites,
including Sly Stone, Aretha Franklin, James Brown, Marvin Gaye,
Patti LaBelle and especially Stevie Wonder, before taking an
interest in hip-hop when she was in junior-high school.
 &HT;    She also took seven years of classical piano lessons, and earned
extra money working at Canton's main tourist attraction, the
Football Hall of Fame.
 &HT;    ``I was a tour guide,'' she recalls. ``I love football. I don't
remember all the stuff, though _ we had to learn all this old
history stuff to do that job, and I don't remember it. I was a
football fan.''
 &HT;    Her first career goal was to be a filmmaker, and after
graduating from high school she enrolled at the USC Film School, in
Los Angeles, to study screenwriting and directing.
 &HT;    ``I wanted to be a hot shot,'' says Gray, whose first 8-mm.
project was about a straitjacketed insane-asylum inmate tormented
by a fly in his padded cell. ``I wanted to produce movies, sit
behind the desk and call the shots. I just wanted to be cool.''
 &HT;    Her detour into music began when a composer friend asked Gray to
write lyrics for some of his tunes. Gray began teaching her songs
to his band. One night when the singer didn't show up for a
recording session, she filled in on lead vocals.
 &HT;    She figured the tape would be erased later on, she says, but it
didn't work out that way.
 &HT;    ``They left it the way it was,'' Gray says. ``And people started
hearing it.''
 &HT;    One who heard it was the leader of a jazz band that played a
regular Sunday-brunch gig at a Los Angeles hotel. He promptly hired
Gray to perform with his ensemble _ a welcome diversion for a young
would-be filmmaker who was still struggling to get a foot in the
door, working internships and low-level jobs for production
companies and MTV.
 &HT;    The encouragement she received for her performing and
songwriting slowly persuaded her that her real talents might lie
there.
 &HT;    ``At the start I considered it a hobby,'' says Gray, who took
her professional name from a Canton friend of her father's. ``But
the whole time, it just kind of grew on me. I don't know how to
explain it _ I got more and more attached to it, then I fell in
love with it.''
 &HT;    Before long other songwriters were hiring her to sing on their
demo tapes, and she began hosting an after-hours jam session called
the We Ours at a Hollywood coffee shop. Record-company executives
began dropping in on the shows, and Gray found herself the object
of a bidding war, eventually signing with Epic Records.
 &HT;    When it came time to enter the studio with producer/manager Andy
Slater, who has also handled The Wallflowers and Fiona Apple, Gray
had plenty of material to draw from _ which was good, because she
was in the midst of a messy divorce at the time.
 &HT;    ``It was a crazy time in my life,'' she says. ``I think a lot of
the album is kind of about freedom, freeing yourself from all the
crazy things in life, all the crazy things that go on inside of
you.''
 &HT;    That gives ``On How Life Is'' an edge, particularly on songs
such as ``Still,'' which was prompted by a fight with her
ex-husband, and ``The Letter,'' inspired by the death of an uncle.
 &HT;    But it doesn't dampen the album's upbeat, celebratory vibe, a
series of sinewy grooves that slip and slide around Gray's
distinctive vocals.
 &HT;    ``It wasn't really anything I set out to do,'' she says. ``I
didn't go in and say `I want this big party record' or whatever. I
think what was going on in the studio kind of came out on the
record, just being in a studio with this big kind of motley crew of
different musicians, most of them buddies of mine.
 &HT;    ``It's what came out,'' she says with a shrug. ``We recorded 18
songs. It all happened naturally and organically, which is good.''
 &HT;    So the little girl who didn't want to open her mouth is now a
woman making a lot of noise _ and is likely to make even more, now
that she's touring in support of the album. Her two daughters and a
son, ages 4, 3 and 2, stay either in Canton with her mother or in
Los Angeles with her sister when Gray is on tour.
 &HT;    Being a single mother is no picnic, but Gray says that these are
nonetheless the best days of her life.
 &HT;    ``I'm actually enjoying getting older,'' she says cheerfully.
``My 20s were really tough. I put myself through a lot of s--t. I
was a dummy.
 &HT;    ``But now I'm growing up and figuring out things a little bit.''

 (Includes a color slide of Joshua Jackson in a scene from ``The
Skulls.'') 
 By SIMON HOUPT  
 c.2000 TV Guide Canada  
 Not to be released in Canada until after 2 April 2000. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over there, on a sleek red banquette on the other side of this
martini lounge in New York's Greenwich Village, Liam Neeson and
Aidan Quinn are sipping drinks and laughing loudly.
</P>
<P>
   A few feet away, Samuel L. Jackson nurses a beer and smiles as
people approach to say hi.
</P>
<P>
   James Gandolfini of ``The Sopranos'' is standing by the bar,
contentedly puffing away on a fat cigar.
</P>
<P>
   After a long day on the set of ``Law &AMP; Order,'' Angie Harmon's
dark beauty flashes through the pulsing, smoky din of the club.
</P>
<P>
   And right in the middle, practically jittery with glee, Joshua
Jackson feels the music pound through his body. He soaks up the
scene and thinks to himself: ``This is cool. This is very cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran actors are usually blase about such moments, but while
he has been in the business for more than a decade, that
late-February party was one of Jackson's first Hollywood-style
blowouts.
</P>
<P>
   This is a season of many firsts for the 21-year-old actor. A
couple of weeks after that party, Jackson took the stage of NBC's
famed Studio 8-H to host ``Saturday Night Live,'' a program he had
grown up watching in Canada. Also for the first time in his life,
he finds himself being taken seriously as a magazine cover boy,
gracing the premiere issue of Teen Movieline.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the biggest ``first'' of all: On March 31 he'll
open in theaters nationwide as the star of the thriller ``The
Skulls,'' marking his first experience as a Hollywood leading man.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a long road for the charismatic actor, whose first
major role came at age 11 in ``Crooked Hearts,'' a film drama about
a dysfunctional family. For awhile it looked as if his biggest
accomplishment would be playing the cocky hockey star Charlie
Conway in the ``Mighty Ducks'' film trilogy.
</P>
<P>
   But then, two years ago, ``Dawson's Creek'' exploded into the
popular consciousness and made instant stars of Jackson and his
co-stars James Van Der Beek, Michelle Williams and Katie Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   The other three have already headlined films, but Jackson wanted
to take some time to figure out exactly which project was best for
him. He chose ``The Skulls,'' he says, precisely because it offered
a role distinctly different from the wisecracking, emotionally
guarded Pacey Witter, whom he plays on ``Dawson's Creek.''
</P>
<P>
   Those used to the hunched stance and squeaky voice of
16-year-old Pacey may be surprised to see Jackson as a confident,
muscled college senior. They may also be surprised to see him
steaming up the screen with his pretty co-star, Leslie Bibb of
television's ``Popular.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Skulls,'' Jackson plays Luke McNamara, an Ivy League
student chosen as a member of a secret society known as the Skulls
_ closely modeled on a real Yale institution known as Skull and
Bones.
</P>
<P>
   Luke finds himself in an unfamiliar but seductively pleasant
world, but one that he gradually realizes has its own dark side.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can wax poetic here for a second,'' Jackson says, sipping
coffee at a New York restaurant, ``in a perfect world `Skulls'
would work on two levels. It would be a very fast-paced, engaging
thriller that keeps you interested from the first frame to the
last. It would also operate as a morality tale.
</P>
<P>
   ``This question posed to Luke is basically, `Do you believe in
yourself enough to adhere to what is right, or are you going to
sell your soul to achieve your goals?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll make no bones about it,'' says Jackson, a smart,
talkative and charming guy who seems to lack any trace of
movie-star ego. ``I've done work simply for the paycheck and simply
because I needed to pay my rent _ I didn't believe in it from the
beginning, but it's just something I had to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Having experienced that kind of Faustian deal made ``The
Skulls'' all the more enticing, the actor says.
</P>
<P>
   ``In high school, or in any social situation, you're constantly
being forced to check what you believe, swallow your words and
accept the status quo,'' he says. ``I have certainly been guilty of
not speaking up when I should have.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he adds with a smile, ``in life you fail much more than
you do in movies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Skulls'' couldn't have arrived at a more timely moment.
Among its members, the real-life Skull and Bones society, which was
founded at Yale in 1833, counts presidential candidate George W.
Bush and his father, former President George Bush. The Central
Intelligence Agency is said to have been conceived within the
society's walls.

<P>
   In such a power-permeated world, says producer Neal Moritz _ who
also cast Jackson in supporting roles in ``Urban Legend'' (1998)
and ``Cruel Intentions'' (1999) _ Jackson adds a crucial element of
humanity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has that really likable quality that young men and young
women can relate to and admire,'' Moritz says in a separate
interview. ``He's really grounded.''
</P>
<P>
   His co-stars on ``Dawson's Creek'' agree, even though Jackson
has been known to get a little stir-crazy on the show's remote
location in Wilmington, N.C. A native of Vancouver, British
Columbia, and a passionate hockey fan, Jackson admits that he hates
being unable to follow his hometown team, the Canucks, and misses
the rest of the Canadian world in which he grew up.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the strange thing about being in America,'' he says.
``It looks the same, sounds the same, smells the same. But it's
just not the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if ``The Skulls'' does as well as many are predicting
it will, a big-screen career may open new options for Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   After all, one of Hollywood's favorite locations for shooting
blockbuster films is Vancouver.

 (Includes a color slide of Jennifer Love Hewitt in a scene from
``Audrey Hepburn.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Jennifer Love Hewitt is having a diva moment. So far today she's
slapped a co-star and screamed at her director, and when a teen-age
girl shoves an autograph book at her, Hewitt curses, turns and ...
not!
 &HT;    No way. Couldn't be. Not our Love.
 &HT;    And indeed it isn't, because the actress who prefers to be
addressed as ``Love'' is generally agreed to suit the name
perfectly. In an industry rife with back-stabbing and rampant egos,
Hewitt has a reputation as a genuinely nice young woman, and she
likes it that way.
 &HT;    ``The greatest honor, better than any award you could be given,
is people thinking you're genuinely nice,'' says the star of
television's ``Time of Your Life'' and the ``I Know What You Did
Last Summer'' slasher flicks.
 &HT;    ``I try hard to be nice,'' she adds. ``I like people, and I
guess that comes out. People say the nicest things to me. I don't
know if I deserve it, but I completely appreciate it, and it sticks
in my heart for days when I'm having a tough time. Those comments
keep me going.''
 &HT;    Besides, she says by telephone from the Los Angeles set of
``Time of Your Life,'' she hasn't got much to get upset about.
 &HT;    ``If you look at my life,'' she says, ``it's pretty amazing.
I've gotten opportunities that most people never get in their life,
and I'm only 21.
 &HT;    ``I work with great people,'' Hewitt says. ``I have the most
wonderful family and friends around me _ for me to pull a diva
stunt would be completely out of the ordinary.''
 &HT;    And then the actress giggles.
 &HT;    ``That's not to say it won't happen one day,'' she confides,
``or to say I don't get in bad moods or don't get snippy or crabby
at times. But the extreme diva-ness you hear about is not me, and I
sure hope it never becomes me.
 &HT;    ``If it does,'' she adds, ``I know I have a lot of people around
me who will line up to slap me right across the face and say, `Get
out of it!'''
 &HT;    Playing a bitch, however, is another story.
 &HT;    ``I would love that,'' she says enthusiastically. ``I would love
that. I'm getting ready to play not the sweetest person in the
world.''
 &HT;    That would be in the upcoming comedy ``The Breakers,'' in which
Sigourney Weaver and Hewitt co-star as mother-and-daughter con
artists.
 &HT;    ``I play this really sexy con artist with a huge attitude and a
big chip on her shoulder,'' Hewitt says. ``It's going to be fun to
have a little bit of attitude.
 &HT;    ``I'll just use PMS 24 hours a day.''
 &HT;    For her most current project, however, Hewitt put on her angel
face and an executive producer's hat: She plays the title character
in ABC's ``The Audrey Hepburn Story,'' a three-hour-long biography
of the Hollywood legend that will air March 27.
 &HT;    ``It was a huge challenge, a huge decision and a huge
responsibility,'' Hewitt says, ``but I knew it was an opportunity
that would only come around once. It had always been my dream to
get to play Audrey one day in her life story, because she was my
favorite as an actor and a woman. She inspired me to act and to try
to be the adult I'm hopefully becoming.
 &HT;    ``It was a huge deal,'' the actress says. ``I'm incredibly
scared about people seeing it, but I'm also excited. I gave all of
myself, every single day, to every word that came out of my
mouth.''
 &HT;    The film follows Hepburn from her painful childhood in
Nazi-occupied Holland to her early success in Tinseltown. Along the
way, Hewitt recreates the Broadway production of Colette's ``Gigi''
(1951) and the classic film ``Breakfast at Tiffany's'' (1961). She
croons ``Moon River,'' and slips into Hepburn's glamorous dresses
and hairstyles.
 &HT;    ``If I've done my job, nobody will know it's me after the first
15 minutes,'' Hewitt says. ``They'll just know it's her story.
 &HT;    ``I hope people go away from it wanting to rent every single one
of her movies at the video store the following weekend,'' she adds
exuberantly. ``For the people my age who don't know who Audrey
Hepburn is _ and you'd be surprised how many there are _ I hope
they'll want to know more about her, that they'll also go and rent
her movies.
 &HT;    ``She was a truly amazing person who handled her entire life
with elegance and grace,'' Hewitt says. ``She always accepted life
as what it was and dealt with each situation at hand, and she also
gave back as much as she got.''
 &HT;    Not long after ``Audrey Hepburn'' airs, the ``Summer of Love''
will kick off. That's the tag Fox has given to its concerted effort
to save ``Time of Your Life,'' the struggling ``Party of Five''
spinoff in which Hewitt continues as Sarah Reeves, now far from
home in the wilds of New York City.
 &HT;    The show, despite debuting to surprisingly positive reviews,
quickly went south in the ratings. Hewitt and her co-stars are
still shooting episodes, however, and Fox will relaunch the series
when the weather warms up.
 &HT;    ``What's going right is that we're working really hard to make
good episodes and we're having a good time,'' Hewitt says. ``What's
going wrong ... ''
 &HT;    Hewitt giggles nervously.
 &HT;    `` ... is getting people to watch,'' she admits after a pause.
``It's a spinoff, with a character people are used to suddenly in a
different place, with new people and doing different things.
 &HT;    ``Fox is behind us,'' she says. ``They're willing to move us to
a new time slot, to take us off the air so our episodes aren't
wasted now. We're hopeful we'll get picked up for another season,
but if we don't everyone will go on and do other things.
 &HT;    ``There's nothing we can do about it,'' she concludes. ``We've
got a positive attitude and hope things turn out the way they're
supposed to.''
 &HT;    Between films, television movies and the series, Hewitt is so
busy these days that she hardly has time for a personal life. She
and MTV host Carson Daly broke up several months ago, but Hewitt
did manage to make time for a family trip to Las Vegas to toast her
21st birthday.
 &HT;    ``It balances out,'' she says. ``I find time for a personal life
when I need one.''
 &HT;    Right now, though, Hewitt is needed back on the set of her show.
 &HT;    ``I think I'm in a good place,'' she says in conclusion.
``Truly, the only thing I've ever wanted was to continue to work
and to be happy. I want to work on things I believe in, that I can
be proud of. So far I've been able to do that.
 &HT;    ``I do think I'm in a transitional place, though,'' Hewitt says.
``I'm at that fine line between teen actress and adult actress. I'm
trying to glide into adult actress gracefully, so that I have a
long, sustaining place in this business.''

JOHN CUSACK: A DIFFERENT SLANT ON STARDOM 
</HEADLINE>

entertainment package.)

 (Includes a color slide of John Cusack with Iben Hjejle in a scene
from ``High Fidelity.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    He doesn't have a paycheck like Jim Carrey's. He doesn't have
clout like Harrison Ford's. He doesn't draw the paparazzi like Brad
Pitt.
 &HT;    And that's fine with John Cusack, who says the last thing he
wants is to be a superstar.
 &HT;    ``Celebrity can be sinister,'' the 33-year-old actor says.
``Celebrity is death. Celebrity is actually the worst thing that
can happen to an actor.''
 &HT;    After 17 years in the business, Cusack admits that he's still
uncomfortable with the hoopla.
 &HT;    ``Everyday people think their sorrows and joys aren't as
important as George Clooney's sorrows or mine,'' he says. ``People
think the laws of gravity don't really apply to actors. It's like
we breathe this rarefied air.''
 &HT;    His limited experience with fame is more than enough, the
Chicago-based actor insists.
 &HT;    ``I've been the guy on the cover of those magazines,'' he says,
``and I've slept with some of the girls on the covers of those
magazines. It's all designed to create envy, because no one really
exists in that form. I don't walk around perfectly lit and
airbrushed _ no one says just the right thing at just the right
times.
 &HT;    ``Life is complicated and messy.
 &HT;    ``I've also read those magazines when I'm on the cover,'' he
adds. ``I've said, `Oh, God, I seem so interesting _ I must really
be an amazing guy. Maybe I should hang out with myself a little
more.'
 &HT;    ``Or at least I'd like to meet that guy, because what they've
portrayed isn't the real me.''
 &HT;    The real Cusack is brash, bold, outspoken and offbeat, arriving
for an interview at New York's Regency Hotel wearing his trademark
``gangster'' look _ dark jeans, heavily tinted glasses and a long,
black trench coat that he won't take off for the next 45 minutes.
 &HT;    More than a few critics have called him the best actor of his
generation, but Cusack doesn't want to play that part.
 &HT;    ``I would rather have someone say, `the only actor of his
generation who hasn't sold out,''' he says. ``By selling out, I
mean crashing cars, pulling out guns, killing people _ stupid,
mindless scripts. That's what I never want to do.''
 &HT;    What he's doing these days is a low-budget comedy called ``High
Fidelity,'' opening March 31. The movie, which he calls ``a
romantic film about unromantic things,'' reunites him with director
Stephen Frears, with whom he worked on ``The Grifters'' (1990), and
the ``Grosse Point Blank'' (1997) writing team of D.V. DeVincentis
and Steve Pink.
 &HT;    Based on the best-selling novel by Nick Hornby, the movie casts
Cusack as the owner of a small, all-vinyl record store in Chicago.
 &HT;    ``I play someone who considers himself the ultimate connoisseur
of all music,'' the actor says, ``He's a guy who is a totally
obsessive music geek.
 &HT;    ``He's at this weird point where a guy realizes that he's not a
kid anymore,'' Cusack says, ``and he must re-evaluate his entire
life to this point, including what music and women have meant to
him.''
 &HT;    As the film's co-producer, he could also call upon his friends _
including Tim Robbins, Jack Black, Beverly D'Angelo, Harold Ramis
and Catherine Zeta-Jones _ to take supporting parts. His sister
Joan also shows up, as does Bruce Springsteen in his first-ever
film cameo.
 &HT;    It's a typically offbeat role for an actor who has made a habit
of turning down commercially promising films, including ``Apollo
13'' (1995), ``Sleeping With the Enemy'' (1991) and ``Indecent
Proposal'' (1993).
 &HT;    ``I look at acting like some sort of weird marathon,'' he says.
``You have to pace yourself to keep going for a long time.''
 &HT;    Going the commercial route, he believes, would endanger his
hopes for a long, productive career.
 &HT;    ``I'm pretty good at seeing the cycles of this stuff,'' Cusack
says. ``Every two years you're the flavor of the month again.
Everyone sings your praises and you're the next greatest thing _
again. Then next month there's someone else.
 &HT;    ``I don't even remember who was flavor of the year last year,''
he says. ``It doesn't matter. I want to build a body of work. I
don't think talent is enough _ you also must have integrity in this
business. You need a special sensibility to do this work, which is
a certain unwillingness to compromise.''
 &HT;    After growing up in a large, Irish-Catholic family in Evanston,
Ill., Cusack discovered acting when his older sister Joan began
studying at the Piven Theater Workshop, an acting school that
trained Aidan Quinn and all the Cusack kids, including John and his
sisters Susan and Ann.
 &HT;    ``We had to create a class around John,'' founder Byrne Piven
recalls in a separate interview. ``He was the youngest kid who ever
wanted to study. But we couldn't turn him away _ he refused to
leave the building!''
 &HT;    By the time he turned 12, Cusack was already logging time in
local commercials and industrial films. At 16, he got his first
movie role, acting opposite Jacqueline Bisset in ``Class'' (1983).
That led to a string of movies that has included such hits as
``Sixteen Candles'' (1984), ``The Sure Thing'' (1985), ``Say
Anything'' (1989), ``Bullets Over Broadway'' (1994), ``Pushing
Tin'' (1998) and the recent ``Being John Malkovich'' (1999).
 &HT;    But Cusack resists stardom tooth and nail. He lives in Chicago
instead of the movie-centered world of Hollywood, and in his spare
time continues to work with his Chicago-based theater group The New
Criminals. Its movie arm, run by Cusack, Pink and DeVincentis, is
dedicated to writing and producing the kind of films that Hollywood
doesn't want to make but Cusack loves to see.
 &HT;    ``I like movies that are both commercial and subversive,''
Cusack says.
 &HT;    The first New Crime Productions film, ``Grosse Pointe Blank,''
certainly qualifies _ in that surprisingly successful black comedy,
Cusack played an international assassin who stumbles into a midlife
crisis while attending his high-school reunion and preparing for
his next hit.
 &HT;    A sequel is in the works, and will probably feature Joan _ who
had one of her better roles in the original film _ and several
other Cusacks.
 &HT;    ``We don't have sibling rivalry,'' he says. ``We're supportive
of each other. There's a competitive spirit at times, but we're not
a mean-spirited family. We do this work for the joy of it.''
 &HT;    That's been the case, he says, ever since he first stepped onto
a film set.
 &HT;    ``I remember waking up and knowing that, instead of going to
school that day, I would be going to a movie set to hang out with
Jacqueline Bisset,'' he recalls. ``And I also remember thinking,
`I'm winning. The kids at school will think I'm winning.'
 &HT;    ``That's the joy of this work,'' he concludes. ``On most days, I
do feel like a winner.''

HIGH INTENSITY: MACY GRAY TAKES HIP-HOP BY STORM 
</HEADLINE>

entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to StarBeat, a weekly
package of five intriguing features with color art.) 
 (Includes a color slide of singer Macy Gray.) 
 By GARY GRAFF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    When she was a child growing up in Canton, Ohio, the teasing she
got from other children made Macy Gray so self-conscious about her
unusual voice that she barely spoke, let along sang.
 &HT;    Guess who's laughing now?
 &HT;    That voice _ a high-pitched, youthful piping that sounds like
Melanie Griffith crossed with Betty Boop _ has made Gray one of the
new toasts of the pop-music world. Her debut album, ``On How Life
Is,'' has been certified gold and has been propelled into
Billboard's Top 20 by the single, ``I Try.''
 &HT;    She was nominated for two Grammy Awards, including Best New
Artist, and while Gray didn't win either one she wound up receiving
copious public praise from Grammy Legend Award recipient Elton
John, which may prove to have more lasting value.
 &HT;    Not bad for someone who says she still cringes at the sound of
her own voice.
 &HT;    ``I always really loved music, but I didn't start singing til I
was in college,'' says the 30-year-old Gray, whose real name is
Natalie McIntyre. ``When I was young, I always just felt like a
misfit. But I guess it kind of grew on me.''
 &HT;    The daughter of a math teacher and a steelworker, Gray grew up
surrounded by music. She soaked up her parent's favorites,
including Sly Stone, Aretha Franklin, James Brown, Marvin Gaye,
Patti LaBelle and especially Stevie Wonder, before taking an
interest in hip-hop when she was in junior-high school.
 &HT;    She also took seven years of classical piano lessons, and earned
extra money working at Canton's main tourist attraction, the
Football Hall of Fame.
 &HT;    ``I was a tour guide,'' she recalls. ``I love football. I don't
remember all the stuff, though _ we had to learn all this old
history stuff to do that job, and I don't remember it. I was a
football fan.''
 &HT;    Her first career goal was to be a filmmaker, and after
graduating from high school she enrolled at the USC Film School, in
Los Angeles, to study screenwriting and directing.
 &HT;    ``I wanted to be a hot shot,'' says Gray, whose first 8-mm.
project was about a straitjacketed insane-asylum inmate tormented
by a fly in his padded cell. ``I wanted to produce movies, sit
behind the desk and call the shots. I just wanted to be cool.''
 &HT;    Her detour into music began when a composer friend asked Gray to
write lyrics for some of his tunes. Gray began teaching her songs
to his band. One night when the singer didn't show up for a
recording session, she filled in on lead vocals.
 &HT;    She figured the tape would be erased later on, she says, but it
didn't work out that way.
 &HT;    ``They left it the way it was,'' Gray says. ``And people started
hearing it.''
 &HT;    One who heard it was the leader of a jazz band that played a
regular Sunday-brunch gig at a Los Angeles hotel. He promptly hired
Gray to perform with his ensemble _ a welcome diversion for a young
would-be filmmaker who was still struggling to get a foot in the
door, working internships and low-level jobs for production
companies and MTV.
 &HT;    The encouragement she received for her performing and
songwriting slowly persuaded her that her real talents might lie
there.
 &HT;    ``At the start I considered it a hobby,'' says Gray, who took
her professional name from a Canton friend of her father's. ``But
the whole time, it just kind of grew on me. I don't know how to
explain it _ I got more and more attached to it, then I fell in
love with it.''
 &HT;    Before long other songwriters were hiring her to sing on their
demo tapes, and she began hosting an after-hours jam session called
the We Ours at a Hollywood coffee shop. Record-company executives
began dropping in on the shows, and Gray found herself the object
of a bidding war, eventually signing with Epic Records.
 &HT;    When it came time to enter the studio with producer/manager Andy
Slater, who has also handled The Wallflowers and Fiona Apple, Gray
had plenty of material to draw from _ which was good, because she
was in the midst of a messy divorce at the time.
 &HT;    ``It was a crazy time in my life,'' she says. ``I think a lot of
the album is kind of about freedom, freeing yourself from all the
crazy things in life, all the crazy things that go on inside of
you.''
 &HT;    That gives ``On How Life Is'' an edge, particularly on songs
such as ``Still,'' which was prompted by a fight with her
ex-husband, and ``The Letter,'' inspired by the death of an uncle.
 &HT;    But it doesn't dampen the album's upbeat, celebratory vibe, a
series of sinewy grooves that slip and slide around Gray's
distinctive vocals.
 &HT;    ``It wasn't really anything I set out to do,'' she says. ``I
didn't go in and say `I want this big party record' or whatever. I
think what was going on in the studio kind of came out on the
record, just being in a studio with this big kind of motley crew of
different musicians, most of them buddies of mine.
 &HT;    ``It's what came out,'' she says with a shrug. ``We recorded 18
songs. It all happened naturally and organically, which is good.''
 &HT;    So the little girl who didn't want to open her mouth is now a
woman making a lot of noise _ and is likely to make even more, now
that she's touring in support of the album. Her two daughters and a
son, ages 4, 3 and 2, stay either in Canton with her mother or in
Los Angeles with her sister when Gray is on tour.
 &HT;    Being a single mother is no picnic, but Gray says that these are
nonetheless the best days of her life.
 &HT;    ``I'm actually enjoying getting older,'' she says cheerfully.
``My 20s were really tough. I put myself through a lot of s--t. I
was a dummy.
 &HT;    ``But now I'm growing up and figuring out things a little bit.''

<P>
   Over there, on a sleek red banquette on the other side of this
martini lounge in New York's Greenwich Village, Liam Neeson and
Aidan Quinn are sipping drinks and laughing loudly.
</P>
<P>
   A few feet away, Samuel L. Jackson nurses a beer and smiles as
people approach to say hi.
</P>
<P>
   James Gandolfini of ``The Sopranos'' is standing by the bar,
contentedly puffing away on a fat cigar.
</P>
<P>
   After a long day on the set of ``Law &AMP; Order,'' Angie Harmon's
dark beauty flashes through the pulsing, smoky din of the club.
</P>
<P>
   And right in the middle, practically jittery with glee, Joshua
Jackson feels the music pound through his body. He soaks up the
scene and thinks to himself: ``This is cool. This is very cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran actors are usually blase about such moments, but while
he has been in the business for more than a decade, that
late-February party was one of Jackson's first Hollywood-style
blowouts.
</P>
<P>
   This is a season of many firsts for the 21-year-old actor. A
couple of weeks after that party, Jackson took the stage of NBC's
famed Studio 8-H to host ``Saturday Night Live,'' a program he had
grown up watching in Canada. Also for the first time in his life,
he finds himself being taken seriously as a magazine cover boy,
gracing the premiere issue of Teen Movieline.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the biggest ``first'' of all: On March 31 he'll
open in theaters nationwide as the star of the thriller ``The
Skulls,'' marking his first experience as a Hollywood leading man.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a long road for the charismatic actor, whose first
major role came at age 11 in ``Crooked Hearts,'' a film drama about
a dysfunctional family. For awhile it looked as if his biggest
accomplishment would be playing the cocky hockey star Charlie
Conway in the ``Mighty Ducks'' film trilogy.
</P>
<P>
   But then, two years ago, ``Dawson's Creek'' exploded into the
popular consciousness and made instant stars of Jackson and his
co-stars James Van Der Beek, Michelle Williams and Katie Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   The other three have already headlined films, but Jackson wanted
to take some time to figure out exactly which project was best for
him. He chose ``The Skulls,'' he says, precisely because it offered
a role distinctly different from the wisecracking, emotionally
guarded Pacey Witter, whom he plays on ``Dawson's Creek.''
</P>
<P>
   Those used to the hunched stance and squeaky voice of
16-year-old Pacey may be surprised to see Jackson as a confident,
muscled college senior. They may also be surprised to see him
steaming up the screen with his pretty co-star, Leslie Bibb of
television's ``Popular.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Skulls,'' Jackson plays Luke McNamara, an Ivy League
student chosen as a member of a secret society known as the Skulls
_ closely modeled on a real Yale institution known as Skull and
Bones.
</P>
<P>
   Luke finds himself in an unfamiliar but seductively pleasant
world, but one that he gradually realizes has its own dark side.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can wax poetic here for a second,'' Jackson says, sipping
coffee at a New York restaurant, ``in a perfect world `Skulls'
would work on two levels. It would be a very fast-paced, engaging
thriller that keeps you interested from the first frame to the
last. It would also operate as a morality tale.
</P>
<P>
   ``This question posed to Luke is basically, `Do you believe in
yourself enough to adhere to what is right, or are you going to
sell your soul to achieve your goals?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll make no bones about it,'' says Jackson, a smart,
talkative and charming guy who seems to lack any trace of
movie-star ego. ``I've done work simply for the paycheck and simply
because I needed to pay my rent _ I didn't believe in it from the
beginning, but it's just something I had to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Having experienced that kind of Faustian deal made ``The
Skulls'' all the more enticing, the actor says.
</P>
<P>
   ``In high school, or in any social situation, you're constantly
being forced to check what you believe, swallow your words and
accept the status quo,'' he says. ``I have certainly been guilty of
not speaking up when I should have.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he adds with a smile, ``in life you fail much more than
you do in movies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Skulls'' couldn't have arrived at a more timely moment.
Among its members, the real-life Skull and Bones society, which was
founded at Yale in 1833, counts presidential candidate George W.
Bush and his father, former President George Bush. The Central
Intelligence Agency is said to have been conceived within the
society's walls.
</P>
<P>
   In such a power-permeated world, says producer Neal Moritz _ who
also cast Jackson in supporting roles in ``Urban Legend'' (1998)
and ``Cruel Intentions'' (1999) _ Jackson adds a crucial element of
humanity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has that really likable quality that young men and young
women can relate to and admire,'' Moritz says in a separate
interview. ``He's really grounded.''
</P>
<P>
   His co-stars on ``Dawson's Creek'' agree, even though Jackson
has been known to get a little stir-crazy on the show's remote
location in Wilmington, N.C. A native of Vancouver, British
Columbia, and a passionate hockey fan, Jackson admits that he hates
being unable to follow his hometown team, the Canucks, and misses
the rest of the Canadian world in which he grew up.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the strange thing about being in America,'' he says.
``It looks the same, sounds the same, smells the same. But it's
just not the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if ``The Skulls'' does as well as many are predicting
it will, a big-screen career may open new options for Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   After all, one of Hollywood's favorite locations for shooting
blockbuster films is Vancouver.

JUST WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE THAT HEAD OF YOURS? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Mass., N.J.)   (Science Times)  
 (af)  
 By SANDRA BLAKESLEE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two hundred years ago, the German anatomist Franz Joseph Gall
dazzled the public with his science of phrenology, the practice of
divining personality and intellect from the shape of the bumps on a
person's head. Each localized bump, he said, represented a
different characteristic, like secretiveness, acquisitiveness or
cautiousness.
</P>
<P>
   Later practitioners of phrenology even found locations for
pampering children, gluttony and Republican politics.
</P>
<P>
   Now the public is being dazzled once again by a technique called
functional magnetic resonance imaging, or FMRI, which is finding
precise brain locations related to all sorts of human traits and
activities. Among them are hyperactivity centers in children, cells
that specialize in the naming of fruits and even a spot in the
brain that lights up when a man is sexually aroused.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of having their bumps ``read'' during a Victorian parlor
game, people lie down and put their heads inside a powerful magnet
device that detects certain molecules in blood flowing through the
brain.
</P>
<P>
   When a particular location of the brain is engaged in a
cognitive task like naming fruits, it requires extra energy to do
its job. The energy arrives in the form of glucose, a simple sugar,
that is carried to the fruit-naming location via increased blood
flow.
</P>
<P>
   This increase in blood flow is then detected by the magnet and
depicted on a screen as splotches of light inside the brain.
</P>
<P>
   FMRI is wildly popular with researchers, thrilled to have a tool
that can peer inside the thinking, feeling human brain, said Dr.
William Newsome, a professor of neuroscience at Stanford. Unlike
standard MRI scans that take static pictures of brain anatomy _
used when doctors search for abnormalities _ functional imaging
captures the brain in action as it plans, schemes, imagines and
hallucinates.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, each week journals report new studies of ways the brain
works based on analyses of FMRI-based splotches of light inside
human heads. But many leading neuroscientists, including Newsome,
now chide colleagues, saying they are misusing a potentially
priceless research tool on studies that are often poorly designed
and sometimes bordering on the simple-minded.
</P>
<P>
   Most researchers using the new imaging are not asking difficult
questions about brain function, these critics say. Instead of
asking how the brain works, the technology is being used to answer
simple questions that repeat what is already known about the brain
or shed little light.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Newsome said, a researcher might put someone in a
scanner, ask the person to count from 1 to 10 and later to count
backwards from 10 to 1. The end result: an area for counting
backward that lights up as a blob in the brain.
</P>
<P>
   The technology is seductively easy to use, said Dr. Christopher
Moore, a postdoctoral fellow at Massachusetts General Hospital in
Boston who is carrying out a number of imaging studies. ``You can
think of an idea, throw five friends into the scanner overnight and
write up your results the next day. People don't have to think very
hard about what they're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Just because an area lights up does not mean something important
was found, Newsome said. Nor will researchers understand the brain
when the entire map is filled with blobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Localization data provide little insight into the exact nature
of the signals encoded in a given structure, the computations being
performed and the interactions between different structures,''
Newsome said. In other words, knowing where something happens does
not reveal how it happens.
</P>
<P>
   Neurologists now know that the brain is a dynamic system of
cellular circuits that constantly shift as people go through the
day. So the hard part of deciphering brain function is to figure
out how cells and widespread circuits are interconnected. How do
they fire together to produce behaviors?
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, ``there's a dirty little secret that people who
publish these studies don't reveal,'' said Dr. Terry Sejnowski, a
neuroscientist at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, Calif. ``The
signals they get are highly massaged. It means they clean up their
data to make it look good, like applying makeup, for a general
audience.'' The actual data they collect are far more complex, he
said, but difficult to decipher.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is that some parts of the brain seem to light up
all the time. The anterior cingulate _ found in front of the brain
near the fissure separating the two hemispheres _ is active when
people carry out scores of tasks, including, as French researchers
found, thinking about sex.
</P>
<P>
   And just because a brain area is correlated with a behavior in
FMRI studies does not mean that it causes the behavior, said Dr.
John Moore, a psychology professor at the University of
Massachusetts. Imaging studies often make this mistake, he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The most serious criticism of the imaging has to do with what
the researchers are measuring. Increased blood flow, as shown in
splotches of light, may not be an accurate surrogate for brain cell
function, some say. Sometimes a signal is picked up by the magnet
because the blood is draining into a larger vein and not from cells
that are using more energy. Thus, some imaging experiments may
measure what veins, not brains, are doing at any given moment.
</P>
<P>
   But all these criticisms do not mean that researchers abandon
their projects, Sejnowski said. ``Keep in mind that every time a
new technique comes along, a majority of the early studies will be
misguided,'' he said. ``FMRI has shown us things we could not have
seen any other way. It is especially useful in studying uniquely
human traits like spoken language, reading and sophisticated moral
reasoning.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, at Princeton Dr. Jonathan Cohen, a neuroscientist,
and his colleagues have used the imaging to discover a function for
the anterior cingulate that may explain its widespread activation
in imaging experiments. Many believe that this part of the brain is
responsible for controlled attention or that it responds to errors,
Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   But experiments that could have been done only with FMRI suggest
that its real role is to register conflict. This, in turn, leads a
person to pay more attention to what is happening. The distinction
is subtle but important, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Newsome, an expert in monkey brains, said an imaging experiment
in humans got results that conflicted with what was known in
monkeys. ``We went back and found that the monkey data were
incorrect,'' he said. Thus, human experiments can pay off in
unexpected ways.
</P>
<P>
   The imaging technology is improving rapidly, Sejnowski said.
Soon, it may be possible to measure blood flow in tiny areas called
cortical columns, clusters of neurons that carry out a single
function like detecting edges or direction of motion. It is
believed that these columns carry out the basic work of the
cerebral cortex, and if researchers can see how they wire and fire
together, they will have a better idea of how the brain is
organized.
</P>
<P>
   Other improvements include new methods of computer analysis that
allow researchers to distinguish meaningful signals out of
confusing experiments with the new imaging.
</P>
<P>
   Brain imaging researchers are extremely excited about efforts
under way to combine FMRI with other brain imaging techniques, like
magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electrophysiology. The new imaging
is good at finding functional locations in the brain but it is very
slow at picking up signals. While brain cells work in thousandths
of a second, functional imaging needs a couple of seconds to detect
blood flow. Other technologies like MEG and EEG are fast but are
not good at identifying where brain activity occurs.
</P>
<P>
   By combining images from all three techniques with the help of
powerful computers, researchers hope to produce ``movies'' of
thoughts inside a human head.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, ``our knowledge is akin to looking out of the window
of an airplane at night,'' Newsome said. ``We can see patches of
light from cities and towns scattered across the landscape. We know
that roads, railways and telephone wires connect those cities, but
we gain little sense of the social, political and economic
interactions within and between cities that define a functioning
society.'' The same is true of efforts to look into the human
brain, he said.

&HT;     ENVIRONMENTALISTS FIND ALLY IN BUSINESS AS RESORT TOWN SEEKS
NEW LOOK 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH LAKE TAHOE, Calif. _ This mountain town of 22,000, hugely
popular with tourists despite its shoddy 1960s look, is planning a
colossal face lift. It is a task as big as the lake next door.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning May 1, buildings at the north end of town will be
bulldozed by the dozens. In their place, according to proposals,
will be upscale hotels and timeshare complexes, a vast shopping
mall, gourmet restaurants, an outdoor ice rink, a convention
center, artists' studios and a movie multiplex _ all in a setting
reflective of the Sierra scenery that surrounds it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a whole new South Shore,'' said Pam Drum,
spokeswoman for the bistate Tahoe Regional Planning Agency. ``It's
going to have a rustic, but yet elegant, village kind of feel. It's
going to be a place where you can bring your whole family, where
you don't need your car to get from place to place.''
</P>
<P>
   Even its most ardent advocates admit that today's South Lake
Tahoe, which gets 2 million visitors a year, is hard on the eyes.
Built mostly in the 1960s, before the establishment of
environmental mandates, the city's 5 1/2-mile commercial strip
along U.S. 50 does not conform to the natural beauty of the vast
Tahoe Basin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's old, tired and ugly,'' said Dennis Harmon, president of
the Heavenly Ski Resort that rises from the south edge of town.
</P>
<P>
   Jaye Von Klug, the city's redevelopment manager, called the
strip ``a totally deteriorated, dilapidated physical environment
that is a blight on the landscape.''
</P>
<P>
   Low-rent motels, T-shirt stores (one hyping obscene messages)
and an endless array of ski rental outlets and souvenir shops line
South Lake Tahoe's main drag just south of the Nevada state line,
where a clutch of big casinos crowd as close to California as they
can.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-four acres of that sprawl could disappear under a plan
that is grandly _ some say unrealistically _ ambitious. The total
cost of the massive makeover might rise to $750 million, mostly
from private sources. Still, the town has taken on $100 million of
bonded indebtedness to cover redevelopment expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike earlier, hotly contested Tahoe development schemes, this
one is touted as environmentally sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us want to save the lake. There's no question about
that,'' Von Klug said.
</P>
<P>
   Conservationists appear to agree, marking a drastic reversal of
the traditionally bellicose relationship between the environmental
movement here and casino-dominated business interests.
</P>
<P>
   Since their battle began in the mid-1960s, any development was
energetically opposed by a litigious brigade of environmentalists.
Once, simple cabin-building permits were so restricted that they
were drawn from a bin by a blindfolded priest.
</P>
<P>
   With the blessing of those same eco-activists, 53 businesses
covering 19 acres on the mountain side of U.S. 50 soon will be
razed and, when possible, relocated.
</P>
<P>
   Once the dust has cleared, construction will start on two hotels
totaling 700 rooms, a 70,000-square-foot retail and restaurant
plaza, six-screen cinema, open-air skating rink and central transit
facility where visitors can board buses or a gondola to Heavenly.
The first and biggest phase could be finished in 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Less certain is a 15.7-acre project between the highway and the
lake, abutting the state border and Harveys hotel-casino. There _
replacing a warren of vintage motels and funky retail outlets _
developers hope to construct a convention complex, 165-room
time-share hotel, child care facility, artist studios and
galleries, and an environmental education center. Work on that
phase could begin in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   South Lake Tahoe's grand renewal schemes are driven by
nationwide changes in the skiing and gambling industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last 10 years ... if you look at (ski) resorts in North
America, from Canada on down, the trend is to create these alpine
villages,'' Harmon said. Also in vogue, he said, is the development
of ``ski in/ski out'' resorts, where skiers can walk from their
rooms to a nearby lift.
</P>
<P>
   The American Skiing Co., which owns Heavenly, is the primary
developer of the so-called Park Avenue project (named after the
street that forms its northern boundary). Two big hotels, the Lake
Tahoe Inn and the Grand Summit, a timeshare lodging, will be funded
by the company. So will the gondola that can carry 2,800 people per
hour up to the slopes.
</P>
<P>
   The South Shore's casino industry also suffers a competitive
disadvantage due to the spread of legalized gambling.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got to this market 12 years ago, Tahoe was the
fifth-biggest gaming market in the country,'' said Jim Rafferty,
senior vice president of corporate marketing for Harveys Casino
Resorts. ``Now it's the 25th.''
</P>
<P>
   Harveys hopes to develop the convention center across U.S. 50
from the Park Avenue project. Rafferty said most big conventions
are held in fall and spring _ when Tahoe tourism is slowest.
</P>

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No two people personify Tahoe's new realpolitik better than
Rafferty and Rochelle Nason.
</P>
<P>
   Nason was a lawyer in San Francisco who found her calling when
she took a case for an environmental group.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time, I was really excited about coming to work
in the morning,'' Nason said. In 1993 she left law to become
executive director of the League to Save Lake Tahoe, an
environmental organization with about 4,500 members.
</P>
<P>
   Formed in 1965, the league was once a paragon of radical
activism. Under James Bruner, executive director until the early
1980s, it aimed to drive casinos out of the Tahoe Basin. Their
bumper stickers read: ``Save Lake Tahoe. Gamble in Reno.''
</P>
<P>
   A gentler slogan, ``Keep Tahoe Blue,'' was adopted some years
back. Even that sentiment generated hostility among locals. Many
perceived the League and its objectives as a threat to their
economic well-being.
</P>
<P>
   ``A little over 10 years ago, a `Keep Tahoe Blue' bumper sticker
on your car could get the air let out of your tires or worse,''
Nason said.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't stop Rafferty from slapping one on his fender when
he arrived at Harveys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I believed in saving Lake Tahoe,'' said the
gregarious native of the Queens section of New York, who graduated
from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas and worked at an Atlantic
City casino before moving to the lake. ``I mean, I'm a child of the
'60s.``
</P>
<P>
   But ``somebody at work came up to me and said, `You've got to
take that off your car. You can't have a league bumper sticker.'''
</P>
<P>
   Dismayed, he scraped it away. ``I was still on probation,''
Rafferty recalled.
</P>
<P>
   These days, said Nason, the bumper stickers more common here.
</P>
<P>
   And, said Rafferty, ``We've come on a significant journey with
our environmental brothers. We've really come to find common
ground.''

   BUSH-REFORM (Austin, Texas) _ For Gov. George W. Bush, reform
has been a matter of legislative proposals rather than an
overriding political philosophy, which might explain why few people
in Texas would have picked the word reformer when asked to describe
the governor. ``He's an incremental change specialist,'' said Bruce
Buchanan, a political scientist at the University of Texas,

business issue, sometimes in a bipartisan way, such as small

   TRIBUNE-TIMESMIRROR (Undated) _ The Tribune Co. and Times Mirror
Co., two media companies whose flagship newspapers helped define
the brawling, partisan days of 19th century journalism, on Monday
announced plans to merge into a media company that would bring
their trademark regionalism to the multimedia world of the 21st
century. If nothing intervenes to disrupt the merger, the new
company, to be called Tribune Company, will own 11 daily
newspapers, 22 television stations and four radio stations. Its
combined audience of newspaper subscribers and television viewers
would give it a much greater national profile. But its core
strategy would be regional, exemplified by holdings in markets like
New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, with a mandate to deliver news,
entertainment and advertising through every kind of media _ print,
television and the Internet. By Felicity Barringer and Laura M.
Holson.

   JAPAN-RECESSION (Tokyo) _ Defying official optimistic forecasts,
hundreds of billions of dollars worth of government spending and
other financial stimulants, Japan's economy revealed its underlying
vulnerability on Monday in statistics that showed a retreat back
into recession in the final three months of 1999. The Economic
Planning Agency said the gross domestic product, the total output
of goods and services in the world's second-largest economy, fell
1.4 percent in the October-December quarter, for an annual rate of
decline of 5.5 percent. By Stephanie Strom.

   SCI-EVOLUTIONARY-PSYCHOLOGY (Undated) _ When two scientists
proposed in a recent book that rape was best viewed as a sexual act
with its roots in evolution, it set off a squall of protest from
feminists and social scientists, won the researchers appearances on
shows like NBC's ``Dateline,'' and became the talk of the cocktail
party circuit. Even last week the controversy continued, with the
book's authors conducting a rancorous exchange over a scathing
review in the scientific journal Nature. But the case put forward
was not, as some assumed, a fringe theory developed by a pair of
renegade researchers. Rather, the arguments fit into a larger
theoretical framework, the work of a group of scientists who have
ushered Darwin into new and provocative areas, including sexual
attraction between men and women, parenting, jealousy and violence,
as well as less touchy regions like the learning of language and
the organization of perception. By Erica Goode. (3500 words)

3RD BANK SEEKS TO JOIN MEGAMERGER IN JAPAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Sanwa Bank Ltd. is negotiating to join the merger of
Asahi Bank Ltd. and Tokai Bank Ltd., a combination that would
create the third-largest bank in the world in terms of assets,
executives at the banks said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The merged bank would have about 104 trillion yen ($979 billion)
in assets, second in Japan behind Mizuho Financial Group, which
will come to life this fall when Fuji Bank, Industrial Bank of
Japan and Dai-Ichi Kangyo merge into a bank with $1.3 trillion in
assets. The proposed merger of Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank in
Germany would create the world's second-largest bank, with $1.2
trillion in assets.
</P>
<P>
   It would mean that in less than one year, the ranks of large
Japanese ``city'' banks have started shrinking to five from nine as
the industry is forced to reorganize in the wake of the financial
crisis that gripped the country in late 1997 and early 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Only the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, which is itself the result of
an earlier merger, and Daiwa Bank remain unaligned, and many
analysts think Daiwa will be forced to find a partner.
</P>
<P>
   A Sanwa-Asahi-Tokai merger, which is expected to be completed in
the fall of 2001, would create Japan's first megabank aimed
squarely at Japanese consumers, a group of customers traditionally
ignored by Japan's biggest banks. Asahi, which is strong in the
Kanto region around Tokyo, and Tokai, which caters to customers in
the Tokai region between Tokyo and Osaka, had already announced a
merger that is scheduled to take place this fall. Adding Sanwa,
which is strong in the Kansai area around Osaka, would give the
consolidated bank a solid grip on the most populous part of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives Asahi and Tokai the Osaka piece they've been
missing,'' said James P. Fiorillo, a senior banking analyst at ING
Barings. ``Geographically, it makes sense.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fiorillo cautioned that while the merger was likely to have
long-term benefits, it would be disruptive and difficult over the
next three to five years. Like their European and American
counterparts, Japanese banks have found that consolidation is a
bigger challenge than they had anticipated. The struggles, sometime
bordering on internecine warfare, that have troubled Citibank and
UBS of Switzerland, to name two of the more prominent examples,
have become front-page news as they struggle to mesh distinct and
often conflicting cultures and management styles.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese banks are no different. Dai-Ichi Bank and Kangyo Bank
maintained separate personnel departments for decades after their
merger into Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank in the 1970s. And Mizuho, as
Dai-Ichi, Fuji and Industrial Bank will become after their merger,
will have three presidents, all of whom are well past what
Americans would consider retirement age.
</P>
<P>
   The challenges here may be even greater because Japanese banks
face a bigger challenge in getting up to speed with information
technology. When Bank of Tokyo joined with Mitsubishi Bank in 1996,
the costs of merging their computer systems together was twice what
they had anticipated, Fiorillo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all have a tendency to overestimate cost-savings and
underestimate the costs of merging systems, and that's not limited
to Japanese banks,'' he said.

SUPERBUG DISCOVERED  
 POLLUTION DECOR  
 SUN'S SURPRISES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Science Times)  
 (af)  
 By HENRY FOUNTAIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an episode of the old ``Superman'' television series, an
evil-doer tries to kill Clark Kent by lowering him into a bubbling
caldron of acid. It doesn't work, of course: faster than you can
say ``speeding bullet,'' Superman emerges unscathed, his civilian
clothes having been conveniently devoured by the acid.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists from the University of Wisconsin have now discovered
a microbe that can tolerate extreme acidity as well as the Man of
Steel can. But unlike a superhero, this bug is something of an
environmental villain.
</P>
<P>
   The microbe, a primitive single-celled organism known as an
archeon, was found in abundance in an old mine at Iron Mountain in
Northern California. These archea, the researchers discovered, are
able to transform sulfides in metal ores into sulfuric acid.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the scientists say in a report in the journal Science,
the microbes may be a primary source of the acid that contaminates
old mines and drains into surface and ground waters. Such drainage
is a major environmental problem worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The archea, which live in slimes and sediments in the hot and
wet mine environment, are capable of thriving even at a pH of 0,
which is as acidic as it gets. Why this should be is a mystery to
the researchers: the organism doesn't even have a cell wall for
protection, but simply a membrane. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How a home is decorated speaks volumes about the people who live
there. It may also have a say in how much pollution they are
exposed to.
</P>
<P>
   A study of benzene pollution in six European cities found that
people were exposed to more of the pollutant in their homes than
outside of it. Benzene is found in vehicle exhaust, and can cause
leukemia.
</P>
<P>
   The study, conducted in the Belgian city of Antwerp, Athens,
Rouen in France, Copenhagen, the Italian city of Padua, and Murcia,
Spain, found that the general level of benzene pollution decreases
as one goes from north to south among the cities studied. The
researchers attributed this to weather conditions, particularly
stronger winds in the south that would tend to clear the air.
</P>
<P>
   But personal exposure levels indoors increased from south to
north. The researchers, who described their work in the journal
Nature, say that home furnishings might be to blame. In the warmer
south, Europeans favor tile, marble and bare walls, while in
Northern Europe, carpeting, linoleum and wood surfaces are more the
norm.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers suggest that benzene entering from the street
tends to adhere more readily to the surfaces in northern homes,
increasing the concentration inside. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Sun can produce some nasty surprises. Flares and other
surface disturbances cause waves of plasma and radiation that can
create problems with spacecraft and earthly radio transmissions.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists can see these storms on the side of the Sun facing
Earth, but when one forms on the far side and then comes into view
as the Sun rotates, Earth is effectively blindsided.
</P>
<P>
   It is reassuring, then, to know that scientists have finally
been able to improve their solar weather forecasting by obtaining
images of storms on the far side. They do it by using the Solar and
Heliospheric Observatory to analyze sound waves bouncing around
inside the Sun.
</P>
<P>
   Sound waves produced in the Sun are altered by what they pass
through. Since the observatory, called Soho, was launched in 1995,
scientists have used it to analyze sound waves to help determine
the Sun's internal makeup.
</P>
<P>
   But sound waves are also accelerated by strong gravitational
fields, such as exist in the area of surface disturbances. So by
using Soho instruments to analyze how some sound waves get out of
step with one another (as some move faster) the location of
disturbances on the far side can be determined.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    ``I do look back on my life for certain lessons that I have
learned,'' said Otis Chandler, the man who was publisher of The Los
Angeles Times for 20 years, from 1960 to 1980.
 &HT;    ``I do look back with great appreciation for the kind of life
I've led, which has been fascinating. But I tend to live in the
moment and look forward to the future. So I don't sit in an office
surrounded by Los Angeles Times photos and memorabilia and Pulitzer
Prizes. No, I don't.''
 &HT;    Which makes it all the more surprising that Otis Chandler has
emerged, after a self-imposed silence of almost a decade, as
something of a latter-day hero to many newspaper journalists around
the country, a prophet lamenting in the wilderness.
 &HT;    For more than a quarter-century, beginning with his unexpected
rise at age 33 to the position of publisher of The Los Angeles
Times, which had been run by his father and grandfather and
great-grandfather before him, Chandler was a figure of the first
importance in the nation's second most important metropolis.
 &HT;    Late last year Chandler spoke out, chastising his successors at
The Los Angeles Times and charging that its bottom-line, Wall
Street-oriented management had compromised the reputation and
editorial integrity of his family's paper. His words echoed through
hundreds of newsrooms.
 &HT;    And they played against a backdrop of great change and anxiety
in the newspaper business, as increasing corporate ownership has
led to an era of cost-cutting and an obsession with stock prices.
 &HT;    During his 20 years as publisher Chandler was instrumental in
transforming The LA Times from a dreadful newspaper into one of the
two or three best in the country.
 &HT;    If his power came with a certain reputation for oddness _
fueled, perhaps, by a clear preference for outdoor derring-do over
the trappings of media mogulhood, as well as an assortment of
rich-guy hobbies like racing Porsches and hunting big game _ well,
that just made him more interesting, harder to categorize.
 &HT;    Then in 1980, he relinquished the job unexpectedly, though he
continued to serve for the next five years as chairman of the
parent company.
 &HT;    By the 1990s, his trips to Los Angeles were increasingly rare,
mostly to attend board meetings (he remained a director until 1998)
or to visit his celebrated but by then infirm mother, Dorothy
Buffum Chandler, who died in 1997.
 &HT;    Chandler hasn't been inside the Los Angeles Times building since
his final annual shareholder's meeting two years ago, and he says
he no longer feels welcome there. Many of the people in its
newsroom these days have never laid eyes on him.
 &HT;    ``The truth is, Otis was a symbol from the day he took over The
Times until the day he left, and still is today,'' said Bill
Thomas, editor of the paper for almost 18 years, during much of the
period that it was being transformed.
 &HT;    Chandler, now 72, stepped onto the public stage again in
November to end his silence about the way The Los Angeles Times was
being run. The management team headed by Mark H. Willes, a former
General Mills executive with no newspaper experience, had vowed to
``reinvent'' the newspaper, soar its circulation and raise the
price of the stock.
 &HT;    Willes came to the paper in 1995 as CEO; in '97, Willes
appointed himself publisher, a title he kept until 1999, when he
gave it to Kathryn M. Downing, the former head of the company's
legal-book publishing division. Downing likewise had no newspaper
experience.
 &HT;    Chandler says he kept silent about what was going on for so long
because he thought the new management deserved a chance. He
overlooked what he felt was its naivete and arrogance, especially
the talk of ``reinventing'' the paper.
 &HT;    But only after it was revealed that Willes and Downing had
approved a profit-sharing scheme with the owners of the Staples
Center, a new local sports arena, in which the advertising revenues
from a special edition of the paper's Sunday magazine about the
center would be shared with the subject of the stories, did he
decide that the integrity of his newspaper had been placed at risk.
 &HT;    ``When I saw the Staples thing come down, I just lost it,''
Chandler said. Chandler, who rarely grants interviews, says he had
been paying close attention to the Willes regime for some time _ to
the closing of Times-Mirror's New York Newsday and Baltimore
Evening Sun, as well as to cutbacks in staff and news space at The
Los Angeles Times.
 &HT;    ``I'd been looking at all these things, and I'd been saying, I'm
not going to criticize,'' Chandler said. ``We had just gone out and
hired this wonderful new CEO, and he's seen fit to hire a woman
publisher who's never been on a newspaper, but maybe she'll learn,
be quick on the job training, maybe they'll get their act
together.''
 &HT;    As long as the issues were merely financial, as long as the
prestige of the paper was not being seriously called into question,
Chandler kept quiet. But it was beginning to wear on him.
 &HT;    Then the Staples Center fiasco erupted. ``He has always cared
deeply about how The Los Angeles Times was regarded on the East
Coast,'' said David Shaw, the paper's Pulitzer-winning media
writer, who conducted an internal investigation of the Staples
incident, resulting in a 14-page special section. ``Once editorial
integrity was being questioned, he couldn't stay silent.''
 &HT;    ``It's been kind of cooking for quite a while,'' said Chandler's
sister, Mia Chandler Frost. ``He's been trying to bite his
tongue.''
 &HT;    Two weeks after the special Staples edition of the Sunday
magazine appeared, and a week after Downing told the staff she had
no intention of resigning, Chandler decided to act. He telephoned a
surprised Bill Boyarsky, the city editor.
 &HT;    He began to dictate, and Boyarsky transcribed. As the afternoon
progressed and copies of the statement were faxed back and forth
between Chandler and Boyarsky, word began to get around the
newsroom.
 &HT;    Michael Parks, the paper's top editor, and several other editors
asked Boyarsky not to read Chandler's statement aloud. But at 5:45,
a message went out to the entire staff.
 &HT;    ``Quite a crowd gathered,'' Boyarsky said. ``Most of them had
probably never seen him or certainly had never worked for him. But
they knew who he was and what he had done.''
 &HT;    Chandler's statement, Boyarsky said, signaled to them that
``they were fighting one of the great, great battles of modern
journalism.''
 &HT;    And although the statement was greeted with thunderous applause,
it stirred Downing to issue an ill-considered statement of her own
calling Chandler ``angry and bitter'' and lamenting that it was
``too bad when some people get old, they get bitter.''
 &HT;    To his detractors it was self-serving and came much too late.
But to his supporters it was invigorating proof that, despite his
long silence, Chandler was still there, still fighting the good
fight.

long silence, Chandler was still there, still fighting the good
fight.

   HIKING WITH LLAMAS
</P>
<P>
   The North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences opens its new
seven-story home on April 7 by the State Capitol in Raleigh, but
nature lovers can celebrate from one end of the state to the other.
With scores of guides and companies, the museum is sponsoring a
program called Afield but Not Afar, with 104 events and expeditions
from barrier islands to Appalachian peaks.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The trips _ on weekends from March 31 to May 2 _ include river
rafting, sea kayaking, rock climbing, bird-watching and llama
treks. They are as short as an hour, to view bird nests on April 8
in New River State Park, and as long as three days, to hike from
Bob Stratton Bald (elevation 5,400 feet) down to Joyce Kilmer
Memorial Forest (2,200 feet) on April 28 to 30. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the Escape to the Cape sea kayaking trip, March 31 to April
2, nights are spent in the old Cape Lookout Coast Guard Station.
Participants in a canoe exploration of Devil's Gut Swamp near
Williamston on April 8 and 9 will camp on a platform in the swamp. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half of the events are free; most of the others cost $10
to $345 a person. Rock climbing and camping expeditions with llamas
carrying the equipment on April 9 to 11 and 16 to 18 in the Smoky
Mountains start at $645 for a family of three. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A full list of the trips is available on the museum Web site,
www.naturalsciences.org, and from (919) 783-1036. &QL;

   AMERICAN MODERNISTS AT THE NATIONAL GALLERY  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the National Gallery of Art can get a short course
in American modernism by walking through the East Wing, where
``Twentieth-Century American Art: The Ebsworth Collection'' is on
view till June 11. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition, more than 70 works collected over the past 30
years by Barney A. Ebsworth, a St. Louis business executive, and
his wife, Pam, traces the course of American art from the legendary
1913 Armory Show in New York until the 1960's. Those dates are like
bookends in American art: at the Armory Show, Americans saw the
Cubist, Fauvist and Expressionist works of Europe's avant-garde
artists for the first time, and that sparked a creative period
during which American modernists first played catch-up and then
began to dominate the world art scene. But by the late 1960's,
critics would say, painting had died. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The show covers the waterfront of American modernism with works
like Charles Sheeler's ``Classic Landscape'' from 1913; Edward
Hopper's ``Chop Suey'' from 1929; Arthur Dove's ``Moon'' from 1935;
Jackson Pollock's ``Composition with Red Strokes'' from 1950; and
Andy Warhol's ``Campbell's Soup Can with Can Opener'' from 1962.
But there are surprises, too: works by lesser-known artists like
Bob Thompson, Alice Trumbull Mason and Suzy Frelinghuysen. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition will travel to the Seattle Art Museum, where it
will be on view from Aug. 10 through Nov. 12. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The National Gallery of Art, on the National Mall between Third
and Ninth Streets at Constitution Avenue NW, is open daily.
Admission is free. Information: (202) 737-4215 or www.nga.gov. &QL;

   ARKANSAS BOAT SINKING BRINGS SAFETY REVIEW  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Coast Guard meeting last month to discuss ``duck'' tourist
boats _ whose charm is that they can do sightseeing on land as well
as on water _ is likely to bring tighter regulations. The
conference was called in response to the sinking last summer of one
of the boats near Hot Springs, Ark. Twenty passengers were aboard;
13, including three children, died.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board, which investigated the
loss of the boat, the Majestic, said that more than 250 similar
boats, mostly of World War II vintage, were being operated as
tourist vehicles by 30 companies in 16 states.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a letter dated Feb. 18, the board, which has power only to
recommend rules, urged the operators to alter their vessels
``without delay'' to provide extra buoyancy. The Majestic, the
vessel in the fatal capsizing, had been in the water only five to
seven minutes when it swamped and sank in a minute. Passengers were
trapped inside the plastic canopy and windshields. Coast Guard data
indicate there were 18 accidents with ducks in several states
between March 6, 1991, and May 1, 1999, when the Majestic sank. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most of the ducks in operation were designed to accommodate two
drivers and 5,000 pounds of cargo. The last parts were manufactured
in 1945. The name derives from the military designation for these
vehicles, DUKW: the ``d'' stood for the year of the design, 1942;
``u'' for amphibious; ``k'' for front-wheel-drive and ``w'' for
rear-wheel drive.  &QL;

DOES `STREAMING MEDIA' GIVE YOU THE SCREAMING MEEMIES? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, March 19)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics.) 
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lord knows, this department tries to keep up. But no sooner is
the letter  &UR; e &LR;  fixed firmly in my mind in all its permutations as
the key to the new electronic world ( &UR; e-commerce &LR; ,  &UR; e-mail &LR; ,
 &UR; e-whatever &LR; ) than along come the jargoneers of digitese with
another letter to thrust it aside. Here comes  &UR; m-commerce &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   &UR; M &LR;  is not for the million things your mother gave you, as the
old song went. Rather, it stands for  &UR; mobile &LR; ; as the Internet
speeds up transactions, mobility is where it's at. (And  &UR; where it's
at &LR;  is no longer where it's at, either; I am on the lookout for the
latest phrase for what the French still call  &UR; au courant &LR; .)
</P>
<P>
   `` &UR; M-commerce &LR;  is  &UR; e-commerce &LR;  that's done over mobile phones
and other hand-held digital devices like personal digital
assistants,'' writes The Business Times of Singapore. ``It covers
buying and selling everything from stocks to flowers, using
handphones and PDAs.'' (Just be careful of chewing gum while
 &UR; m-commercing &LR;  on Lee Kwan Yew's tight little island _ you could
wind up running from a cane.)
</P>
<P>
   Though a British outfit named Logica claims coinage in 1997, the
locution is now coming on stream. ``Just when the language has
begun to absorb the letter `e' as a prefix,'' notes Katie Hafner in
The New York Times, ``comes the latest twist on electronic money
and the language of the digital age: mobile commerce, or
 &UR; m-commerce &LR; , which promises to turn your cell phone or hand-held
organizer into an electronic wallet.'' She quotes Richard Siber of
Anderson Consulting as foreseeing the day when `` &UR; m-commerce &LR;  will
be bigger than  &UR; e-commerce &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   Dunno 'bout that. (That's how impatient e-mail writers,
rat-tat-tat justlikethat, express ``I am not so sure that
linguistic prediction is well founded.'' That may bring in a lot of
 &UR; m-mail &LR; , a locution coined right here and now.)
</P>
<P>
   Both phrases use  &UR; commerce &LR;  as the suffix;  &UR; electronic &LR; , the
source for the  &UR; e &LR;  prefix, is a more general term than  &UR; mobile &LR;  and
may subsume it. Thus we would have ``mobile electronic commerce''
as against stationary electronic commerce (the sort you're involved
with when ordering kiwiburgers while parked), but that would bring
us  &UR; m-e commerce &LR; , too late for the ``me generation.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to mobile electronic commerce, as I get it, is the
ability to peddle while pedaling, or to buy on the fly. ``Rather
than stand in front of a soda machine fishing for a dollar bill
that is neither too faded nor too wrinkled,'' writes Hafner, ``you
may someday simply dial the phone number posted on the machine.''
</P>
<P>
   Here my with-it colleague has lapsed into an archaism.  &UR; Dial &LR; ,
the noun, originally meant ``the graduated face of a timepiece,''
as in a sundial, rooted in the Latin for ``day.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of us can remember when the verb  &UR; to dial &LR;  meant ``to turn
a disc with numbered finger holes.'' This verb was generalized, as
linguists like Sol Steinmetz say, into touching the numbers on a
touch-tone phone that has no dial. (Another such new generalization
is  &UR; to bookmark &LR; , which meant ``to place a marker in a book'' but
which has a newer sense of ``to mark the address of a Web site.'')
</P>
<P>
   Will the archaism  &UR; to dial &LR;  persevere in a dial-free age? Will
we long refer to digits on the broadcast spectrum as ``on your
radio dial''? Will marketers of the deodorant soap have to rename
their product? My guess is the verb will be replaced not by
 &UR; punch &LR; ,  &UR; poke &LR;  or  &UR; jab &LR; , which suggest dialing in anger, but by
 &UR; key &LR; ,  &UR; press &LR;  or  &UR; tip &LR; , as in ``fingertip.'' We are likely to  &UR; tip
in &LR;  rather than dial the numbers. (Where am I? Back to the future.)
</P>
<P>
   In a recent conversation in advanced digit-English with The New
York Times' new-media guru, Martin Nisenholtz, CEO of Times Company
Digital, I was told that my column might someday, in audio or video
form, be part of  &UR; streaming media &LR; . That was satisfying; I like my
prose to go with the flow.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in a 1995 Interactive Age (you were expecting maybe
Intrapassive Era?), Richard Karpinski defined  &UR; streaming media &LR;  as
delivering ``audio and video on demand, rather than requiring a
user to download a file off the Web and play it back from a local
drive.'' In that way, the simultaneous display and transfer of
sound and image can be watched and heard as the data flows in.
</P>
<P>
   And now for some  &UR; shovelware &LR; . A word association with
 &UR; streaming media &LR;  leaps to mind:  &UR; screaming meemies &LR; . This
expression, origin obscure, was first defined in The New Republic
in 1927 as a synonym for drunkenness. It soon came to mean
``hysterics'' like those in subsequent DTs, or delirium tremens. In
World War II, allied soldiers applied it to the  &UR; Nebelwerfer &LR; , a
German multibarreled rocket mortar that went off with a series of
high-pitched sounds.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Shovelware &LR; , according to Eric Raymond's Jargon File, is ``a
slipshod compilation of software dumped onto a CD-ROM without much
care for organization or even usability.'' Its source, I recall
vividly, is the newspaper term ``editing with a shovel,'' applied
to editors who fail to trim copy of extraneous paragraphs used by
lazy writers who have a certain space to fill. It's nice to see
that the old ``slug it `Slay''' lingo has found a place in the
streaming, screaming media-meemie language of technology.

ANALYSIS OF LUNAR DEBRIS OFFERS CLUES TO LIFE ON EARTH 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
(mk) 
 By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In popular lore, the Apollo 14 astronauts may be best remembered
for things they were not sent to the moon in 1971 to do. Alan
Shepard drove a golf ball in the low lunar gravity to a distance
Tiger Woods would die for. Edgar Mitchell on his own conducted what
he said were extrasensory perception experiments.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the astronauts kept their eyes on the prize and took time to
collect plenty of rocks and soil and bring them back in airtight
containers. One gram of that soil _ or regolith, as lunar dirt is
called _ has only now been put to a rigorous analysis, which has
revealed what may be a surprising new chapter in the history of the
solar system.
</P>
<P>
   The findings have even inspired speculation about another
possible extraterrestrial influence on the course of life on Earth.
Could an upsurge of meteorite bombardment have contributed to the
emergence of complex life forms with diverse anatomical designs?
The speculation is already drawing the fire of critics.
</P>
<P>
   By dating minute glass beads in lunar soil, melted debris from
the heat of asteroid and comet impacts, scientists at the
University of California at Berkeley and the Berkeley Geochronology
Center have made two discoveries, one expected and the other a big
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   The ages of many beads, the size of tiny peas or smaller,
confirmed the heavy meteorite bombardment of the moon from 4
billion to 3.5 billion years ago. This was a violent epoch in the
young solar system, which formed 4.5 billion years ago. Impacts of
asteroids and comets gouged out many of the larger lunar craters
and basins that remain virtually unchanged on the waterless,
airless moon.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists had not expected to find so many of the beads
with ages less than 400 million years old. After a relatively quiet
period of 3 billion years, they said, the inner solar system
appeared to erupt with another meteorite blitz, which continues
today. Earth, being larger than the moon, would presumably have
suffered even more impacts, though erosion and shifting crustal
plates would have erased most of the traces.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the findings in the current issue of the journal
Science, the Berkeley researchers concluded that the age data from
155 glass beads ``show that the crater production rate has not been
constant over the last 3 billion years, as had been generally
assumed.'' The data, they said, also provided evidence for a
striking increase in the cratering rate over the last 400 million
years.
</P>
<P>
   The research was conducted by Timothy S. Culler, a graduate
student at the University of California; his faculty adviser, Dr.
Richard A. Muller, a physicist, and Dr. Paul R. Penne, director of
the Berkeley Geochronology Center and a specialist in dating
technology. The ages of the impact-formed beads were determined by
a method of dating the decay of radioactive potassium to argon.
</P>
<P>
   Other scientists said they had confidence in the analytical
techniques used to date the beads. Dr. Graham Ryder of the Lunar
and Planetary Institute in Houston said the Berkeley researchers
``persuasively argue that there has been a substantial increase in
impacting in the earth-moon system'' in recent times. Some
geologists were concerned, however, that the soil sample, coming
from near the surface, might not be representative of impact
frequencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the sample is biased, then you could be drawing a totally
erroneous conclusion,'' Dr. Paul D. Spudis, a geologist at the
Lunar and Planetary Institute, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Renne said in response: ``We understand those things well. There
really is no uncertainty about the chronology we've put together.''
</P>
<P>
   But the sharpest criticism by geologists and paleontologists was
aimed at provocative remarks by the Berkeley scientists in the last
paragraph of their report. The data, they said, ``show an increase
in the cratering rate roughly coincident with the `Cambrian
explosion' of complex life on Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   While conceding that the bead ages were not specific enough to
support claims of a relationship to terrestrial life, the
scientists said ``the correlation is permissible evidence of a
causal relation.'' Their last sentence read: ``It is possible that
increased debris influx had a net stimulating effect on biotic
diversity, despite the occasional occurrence of large impacts with
destructive consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   A planetary geologist who spoke on condition of anonymity said
the speculation ``really came out of left field.'' For one thing,
the Cambrian explosion, the sudden rise of more diverse organisms
as preserved most famously in the Burgess shale of British
Columbia, started more than 500 million years ago. Nor is it clear,
paleontologists said, what life forms in what ecological niches
were destroyed by impacts at this time to clear the way for a new
epoch.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Muller said he was not arguing that there was a
connection, ``just noting that the impact increase happens to
coincide with the explosion of life.''
</P>
<P>
   The scientists said the more recent period of bombardment came
from relatively small objects, which have left few young large
craters on the moon. Their dating was not specific enough, they
said, to detect any upsurge in impacts at the time the dinosaurs
perished, presumably by an asteroid or comet impact 65 million
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Muller had the dinosaur extinction in mind when he proposed the
current research. In the 1980s, he proposed a controversial theory
that the sun has an unseen companion star, which he called Nemesis,
that orbits the Sun every 26 million years and periodically knocks
comets out of their orbits, sending them hurtling through the inner
solar system. This might, he said, explain the apparent
26-million-year cycles of widespread extinctions, including the one
that doomed the dinosaurs and cleared the way for mammals.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for evidence of increased impacts coinciding with those
extinctions, Muller had Culler examine glass beads collected by
Apollo 14 and other lunar missions to see if they reflected spurts
of objects crashing into the moon.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued by the University of California, Muller
said: ``The work opens up a new field that tells us something about
the history of our solar system that was totally unanticipated.
Until now, we did not realize how peculiar the past 500 million
years has been.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing an accompanying article in Science, Ryder of the Lunar
and Planetary Institute said there was now ``some fairly hard
evidence for the earlier tentative conclusion that cratering in the
earth-moon system has not been constant over the past 3 billion
years.''
</P>
<P>
   In that case, he concluded, there may be ``considerable
uncertainties in the absolute dating of other planetary surfaces,
such as Mars.'' Geologists have usually estimated these ages on the
abundance of craters left there by the steady bombardment of
asteroids and comets over time.

WOLVES: FROM BRINK OF EXTINCTION TO THE EDGE OF THE CITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Minn.)   (Science Times)  
 (af)  
 By DAVID BINDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DULUTH, Minn. _ Wolves prowl late in summer nights through the
streets of Brasov, a Romanian city of 320,000, as well as its
municipal garbage dump and a shopping mall.
</P>
<P>
   A no-less-bold wolf was shot and killed last year within the
city limits of Rochester, Minn. Wolves stroll the town of Ely, on
the edge of the state's rapidly expanding wolf range, and one was
tracked to within 19 miles of St. Paul, the state capital.
</P>
<P>
   Wolves have denned 25 miles from Rome where 2,800 years ago,
according to legend, a she-wolf suckled the abandoned Romulus, its
founder, and his twin, Remus.
</P>
<P>
   On the verge of extinction less than 40 years ago in many
countries, wolves have made a remarkable comeback and while
generally regarded as an extremely shy species, their presence in
or near urban centers should not come as a surprise, says Dr. L.
David Mech, a biologist with the United States Geological Survey.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have altered the concept of wolf habitat,'' he said. ``That
habitat is where wolves have prey and food and where people let
them live.''
</P>
<P>
   In places like Minnesota, wolf recovery is surging to such
levels that Mech, widely regarded as the doyen of wolf specialists
around the world, and others, say that prudent wolf managers must
consider controlled killing.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke at the end of a symposium here that drew more than 600
wildlife biologists, managers, educators and wolf fans from 44
states and 28 countries late last month.
</P>
<P>
   The four-day conference, ``Beyond 2000 _ Realities of Global
Wolf Restoration,'' assessed recent efforts to reintroduce and
protect wolves in a number of countries after centuries of
officially authorized extirpation of the species.
</P>
<P>
   Spain, for instance, has fostered a recolonization of vast areas
of Galicia and Asturias. There are more than 2,000 wolves in the
northwest of the country, a three-fold increase in a decade, said
Juan Carlos Blanco of Madrid's wolf project. ``Wolves can live
thanks to urban people's tolerance,'' he said. ``But farmers say,
`Kill all of them.' There is no common ground. We have a social war
in the name of the wolf.''
</P>
<P>
   Italy, with 500 wolves, is another restoration success, with
tolerance of increased numbers aided by subsidies for owners of
lifestock lost as prey to wolves and the skilled deployment of
guard dogs by shepherds.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Professor Luigi Boitani, a wolf biologist at the University
of Rome, has begun to ask himself, ``Did we do something wrong?''
The fact that ``today most of the public is in favor of wolves'' in
Italy has made it impossible for him to convince people of the need
for control of the wolf population. ``I tell people if we want the
wolf to come back, one day we'll have to kill them. But I find I
confront a very strong wall of emotion.''
</P>
<P>
   In Croatia, Dr. Djuro Huber of the University of Zagreb, wishes
he had Italy's problems. After many years of unlimited killing of
wolves, Croatia inaugurated protections in 1995 that include fines
of $6,000 for the willful killing of wolves. ``It went the opposite
of expectations,'' he said. ``Killing of wolves increased after
protection. Over 40. No one has paid the fine.'' Huber was even
threatened when he was in the field doing research on wolves. The
country now has about 100 wolves.
</P>
<P>
   Other speakers told of similar problems, suggesting that, just
as in ancient times, wolves still evoke extreme emotions: what
Blanco of Madrid called ``pathological hatred,'' and opposed to
that, an almost irrational devotion. Wolf lovers manifested the
latter at the conference with wolf pins, T-shirts, posters, books,
coffee mugs and fairly frequent, piercing wolf howls.
</P>
<P>
   On the negative side, Dr. Iyad A. Nader of Saudi Arabia, said,
``The wolf is considered the ancient enemy of man in the Middle
East.'' As in other countries, Saudi hunters who succeed in killing
a wolf often string up the carcass on a pole to show off. Nader, of
the King Khalid Wildlife Research Center in Riyadh, estimated a
total of 600 to 700 wolves in three protected areas of Saudi
Arabia. Otherwise they are not protected.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Countries with large wolf populations generally have large
problems with them, judging from the conference presentations.
Kazakhstan, has probably largest: 90,000 to 100,000 wolves. Sergei
Pole estimated that in 1987 and 1988 wolves killed 150,000 or more
domestic animals, mainly camels, cows and sheep, as well as 14,000
wild animals including boar, deer, ibexes, elk and bighorn sheep.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there were 50 attacks by rabid wolves on humans,
said Pole, from the zoology laboratory of the Plague Control
Research Institute in Almaty, the former capital of Kazakhstan.
Russia, despite heavy hunting and killing of wolves _ some 15,000
in 1998 alone, by all methods including poison _ still has a
population of 45,000, according to a comprehensive winter survey.
</P>
<P>
   Federal bounties are no longer paid on killed wolves and only
some state governments pay the equivalent of $25 for a killed
female. And the central government no longer encourages poisoning
wolves.
</P>
<P>
   Nikita G. Ovsianikov, a wolf specialist from Moscow, said that
nevertheless ``attitudes still remain negative'' with surveys
showing that wolves are seen as threats to livestock, despite the
paucity of attacks and that hunters believe that wolves kill prized
game and hunters' dogs. He listed statistics from the Tver region
that showed hunters killed far more dogs than wolves had killed.
</P>
<P>
   Ovsianikov said he was pleasantly surprised there was no
opposition to the Russian project to transform the
2,000-square-mile Wrangel Island in the Arctic Ocean into a nature
preserve with a wolf colony. Wolves are needed, he said, to cull
Wrangel's large herds of musk oxen and reindeer.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Japan, which ``got rid of its last wolves 100
years ago,'' said Naoki Maruyama of the Japan Wolf Association.
Opinion polls show skepticism toward reintroduction, not least
because people believe there is ``no space'' for them. Even
biologists are ``very conservative'' on the predators. But he saw
hope for wolves in the need to control Japan's proliferating Sika
deer, which are damaging forests.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the only country with lots of wolves and no outstanding
problems is Romania, which has an ancient tradition of honoring
wolves. The pre-Christian Dacian people even had a flag with a
wolf's head, Ovidiu Ionescu of the Ministry of Environment said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Romania's 2,500 wolves, weighing as much as 150 pounds
each, live in the heavily forested Carpathian Mountains, where
there are about 5 million people and millions of sheep. The sheep
are protected by shepherds' guard dogs, said Christoph Promberger
of the Munich Wildlife Society, and wolves prey largely on chamois,
roe deer and red deer.
</P>
<P>
   Having failed to track wolves on mountain slopes, Promberger
asked a Romanian shepherd for guidance. ``What are you looking for
up here; they are down there,'' said the shepherd, pointing below
to Brasov. Following this lead with night tracking equipment,
Promberger trailed a wolf through the city to garbage cans, the
dump and a shopping mall. He showed a film of the wolf at the
Duluth conference.

MANY MISS OUT ON MIGRAINE REMEDIES 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   About 28 million Americans, roughly one-tenth of the population,
suffer from migraine attacks, but only 52 percent have received an
official diagnosis, according to a recent study of migraines in
America.
</P>
<P>
   The study, by the National Headache Foundation, a nonprofit
organization that promotes public awareness about headaches, found
that 32 percent of those who suffer from migraines have never
consulted a doctor about their conditions, even though in the
mid-1990s, the first over-the-counter drug was approved by the Food
and Drug Administration specifically for the treatment of migraine.
In addition, a class of highly specific, prescription drugs known
as triptans were also approved for treatment of migraines.
According to the recent study, 57 percent of migraine sufferers
still rely on over-the-counter medications of all kinds
exclusively.
</P>
<P>
   The study, the largest epidemiological study of migraines in the
United States, surveyed about 30,000 Americans and compared their
answers to those of a study 10 years ago. Over all, the current
survey found the prevalence of migraines to be roughly the same now
as it was 10 years ago, but it found that current sufferers were
not taking advantage of new treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Migraine is definitely underdiagnosed and undertreated in the
United States,'' said Suzanne Simons, executive director of the
headache foundation, which is based in Chicago. ``Treatment
patterns have not kept pace with treatment options.''
</P>
<P>
   Misconceptions about migraines are still widespread, Simons
said. ``Many people still do not understand how disabling a
migraine can be. It is not just the severe pain that people can
experience, it is also the associated symptoms like nausea and
extreme sensitivity to light and sound.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the study, 13 million migraine sufferers say they
have consulted with doctors, but a survey of doctor diaries found
only 3.5 million patient visits specifically about migraine in the
same period.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call this the oh-by-the-way-doc phenomenon,'' said Dr.
Richard Lipton, a neurologist at the Albert Einstein College of
Medicine in Bronx, N.Y., and the lead author of the American
Migraine Study.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, the patient is in the office for some other reason,
a physical or high blood pressure, for instance, and before they
leave they mention that they have headaches,'' Lipton said.
``Unfortunately, this may not register with the doctor, and the
patient leaves thinking they have had a medical consultation
regarding their migraines and the doctor does not.'' He recommends
that patients make appointments specifically for headaches.
</P>
<P>
   Many sufferers say they are misunderstood. ``People don't think
of it as a serious condition,'' said Connie Christiansen, a reading
teacher in Easton, Pa. ``They think you are a weakling.''
</P>
<P>
   Christiansen, 53, who suffered her first migraine when she was
in high school, said: ``You hate to have tell people at work that
you are leaving early because your head hurts. Some just don't get
it. They think you should be able to tough it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Migraine has been recognized as a disease for 50 years or more,
said Dr. Jes Olesen, a professor of neurology at the University of
Copenhagen in Denmark. On Olesen's initiative, the International
Headache Society, a organization of professionals that is based in
London, decided in 1985 to classify and define the various headache
diseases. The group was the first to classify migraine headaches as
a separate condition from tension-type headaches, which are milder
and often caused by constriction of blood vessels, rather than
dilation and inflammation, which causes migraines.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis of the general population identified two main types
of migraine. The first, migraine without aura, is characterized by
headache attacks lasting 4 to 72 hours. The headache is usually
severe, often occurring on one side of the head and pulsating in
nature. It is also aggravated by physical activity and accompanied
by nausea, vomiting and hypersensitivity to light and noise.
</P>
<P>
   In the second type, migraine with aura, the attacks are preceded
by neurological symptoms called aura _ visual, sensory, speech or
motor impairments like tingling sensations, blurred vision or
seeing spots.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, The New England Journal of Medicine published a
landmark study that demonstrated unequivocally that migraine
attacks resulted from a series of complex neurological events.
Researchers were able to induce and document an actual migraine
with the aid of an imaging technique.
</P>
<P>
   According to Fred Sheftell, director of the New England Center
for Headache, a clinic in Stamford, Conn., the latest research
shows that a migraine attack starts in the brain cortex. Sufferers
often tend toward hyperexcitability of that brain area, he said,
setting events that lead to the release of neurotransmitters,
dilation of blood vessels, inflammation and pain.
</P>
<P>
   Sheftell said a variety of circumstances could touch off an
attack, including hormones, diet and changes in the weather, sleep
patterns or the seasons. But little is known about how those work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that the majority of people have a family history,''
he said. ``Migraine is not a simple disorder. It is a complex
disorder of the brain.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   A potent disturbance will cross the western Gulf Coast states
Tuesday, bringing a bout of rain to the region. Many locations
along the coast will receive occasionally heavy rainfall, with
localized flooding in poor drainage areas. To the north, showers
will develop over the Red River Valley and the central plains of
Texas. Some of the high clouds from this system will spread to the
east, dimming the sun at times along the eastern Gulf Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Abundant sunshine will lead to mild readings from the Tennessee
Valley to the Middle Atlantic states as high pressure remains
overhead. Farther north, a weak disturbance passing through the
southern Great Lakes will promote some clouds along with an
isolated shower in spots. Meanwhile, northern New England will
remain cloudy with showers and flurries ahead of a fast-moving warm
front.
</P>
<P>
   A cold front sweeping across the northern Plains will bring
chilly air and scattered flurries to North Dakota, northeast
Montana and northern Minnesota. Snow will also fall in the
Bitterroots and mountains of northern Wyoming as an area of low
pressure passes through the region. Some peaks in western Montana
will receive several inches of snow. To the south, sunny skies in
the Southwestern states will lead to temperatures in the 90s in the
deserts.
</P>
<P>
   Onshore flow in the Pacific Northwest will allow coastal showers
and mountain snow showers to persist. Clouds will stretch to the
south into portions of northern California. Sunshine and offshore
breezes will keep southern California warm.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: On Its Own
</P>
<P>
   A record 10 inches of snow fell Sunday in Caribou, Maine,
eclipsing the previous record of 8.9 inches set in 1959. This
raised the seasonal snowfall to 102 inches, just half a foot shy of
the average snow in a normal year. Northern Maine is one of only a
few locations in the Northeast that has accumulated a near normal
amount of snow for the winter. A separate stream of frigid air has
regularly been sweeping east from Quebec across northern New
England this winter. Lately, the cold air has arrived in Caribou
coincidentally with moisture from the Atlantic. Another period of
snow is likely later Tuesday.

   Today is St. Patrick's Day, of course, but it's also the 81st
anniversary of the birth of legendary singer Nat ``King'' Cole.
Where was Cole born? &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   One of this week's featured wine's aromatic qualities is a
definite dusty, ``Ramblin' Rose'' nuance. But it's the raspberry
fruit on the palate that makes the  &UR;  &LR; 1997 Ravenswood ``Napa
Valley'' Zinfandel _ 4 1/2 stars _ so ``Unforgettable.''
</P>
<P>
   The $15.99 price tag is quite reasonable for a wine of this
quality, too, which means you won't have to hock your ``Mona Lisa''
to indulge in a bottle or two.

   Cole was born in Montgomery, Ala.

DINOSAURS' EVOLUTION CONTINUES EVEN TODAY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Dinosaurs keep evolving. It doesn't matter that they died out en
masse 65 million years ago, that not a single giant lizard remains
alive, even in some remote and steamy Amazonian plateau. None of
that matters: They evolve anyway.
</P>
<P>
   They evolved from cold-blooded sluggards to warm-blooded
amphetamine addicts. They grew feathers. The carnivores bent over
from the anthropomorphized Godzilla posture they used to have to
something a lot more like a gigantic clucking hen.
</P>
<P>
   Such changes shouldn't be surprising. As scholarship advances,
our images of the dinosaurs have had to step forward, too. But it
isn't only paleontology that has caused the changes in our sense of
prehistoric life. It is also politics.
</P>
<P>
   We have a more inclusive sense of culture these days, so the
primarily European and North American bias we have had in the past
about our Mesozoic predecessors has changed to make room for Asia,
Africa and South America.
</P>
<P>
   When I was a boy, fascinated by everything dinosaurian in the
1950s, there were about 20 or so beasts that made up the
``canonical'' list of dinosaurs. They included brontosaurs,
stegosaurs, tyrannosaurs, triceratops and a variety of oddly
ornamented hadrosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   These were the basic animals that populated our vision of a
misty, green tropical prehistory. They are the beasts of ``King
Kong, Lost World'' and dozens of other pop culture permutations of
the terrible lizards.
</P>
<P>
   They also were the fossils found in Wyoming, Utah and New
Jersey. They were ``our'' dinosaurs, and they somehow seemed more
important for that.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there were always more genera of fossil than the popular
ones. And with a recent explosion in dino digs, the number of
official dinosaur genera has increased to something like 350. And
that is just genera: Several of them also include multiple species.
By one count, there are 15 species of triceratops.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in the popular awareness of dinosaur genera _ as
evidenced in many of the recent books on the subject for the
general reader _ is as much a change in our openness to diversity
as it is the number of new fossils found.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, a few ``representative types'' were enough to
define the prehistoric world. But now, those types _ and their
origins _ seem too limited.
</P>
<P>
   And further evidence of this are the many names for dinosaurs
that sound multiculti on the tongue: jubbulpuria (India);
yangchuanosaurus (China); austrosaurus (Australia); majungasaurus
(Africa); riojasaurus (Argentina). There is even an antarctosaurus.
</P>
<P>
   And from the Navajo Reservation in northern Arizona comes the
segisaurus, from Tsegi Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   Just open the new book, ``Walking With Dinosaurs: A Natural
History'' (DK Publishing, $25), and there on a single page you find
leaellynasaura, muttaburrasaurus and koolasuchus, names with a
decidedly third-world flavor on the tongue.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt there is a long way to go before the laplatasaurus of
South America supplants the more familiar North American
apatosaurus (formerly the brontosaurus) in third-graders'
imaginations, but open up any recent book on the subject and you
will find newer, sexier and more politically diverse dinosaurs
showing up.
</P>
<P>
   Prehistory now seems as diverse as today. &QL;

<P>
   Q. As someone who loathes the constant snap, crackle and pop of
neighborhood fireworks that seem to go on for a week preceding
Independence Day, where could I, my partner and perhaps even our
Labrador retriever go for a fireworks-free holiday? _ S.W., Kansas
City, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   A. You might try a farm or a ranch vacation _ far from populous
areas where fireworks are more likely to go off. We checked on
ranch vacations and farm bed-and-breakfasts in Kansas, Missouri and
Iowa, and came up with a few possibilities:
</P>
<P>
   The Bucks and Spurs Ranch, (417) 683-2381, on the Big Beaver
Creek River in Ava, Mo., is about four hours from Kansas City. It
offers traditional ranch activities, like riding, as well as
fishing on the river. The owners promise there will be no
fireworks. A week at the ranch, including meals, is $1,100 a
person, based on double occupancy. No pets, however, so Fido will
have to stay home with his paws over his ears.
</P>
<P>
   Garst Farm Resorts near Coon Rapids, in western Iowa, (712)
684-2964, fax (712) 684-2887, has a kennel on the property and is a
five-hour drive from Kansas City. Khrushchev visited this farm in
1959. If you reserve the Woodland Carriage House ($120 a night,
with room for up to seven) on this 4,500-acre farm, you'll be about
four miles from the Coon Rapids fireworks display, according to Liz
Garst, one of the owners. No meals are included. There is canoeing,
mountain biking and horseback riding (all at extra cost). Cattle
and buffalo are raised on the farm. On the Web: www.farmresort.com.
</P>
<P>
   About two and a half hours from you, in the Flint Hills area of
Kansas, is the Homestead Ranch, a 4,000-acre working cattle spread.
It has a bunkhouse that rents for $150 a night (meals extra), with
a hot tub outside on the deck. Jennifer Maceau, who runs the ranch
program, says that she can't recall the last time she heard a
firecracker out there. Guests can go mountain biking on the rolling
hills, ride horses (extra cost), fish in the ranch's ponds or help
with the chores. Call (316) 753-3416; Web site:
www.guestranches.com/homestead. No pets allowed.

   Q. We are planning a windjammer cruise out of Rockland, Me., in
the latter part of June. Afterward, we would like a guided tour of
coastal Maine for five to seven days. Are there any bus-tour
companies operating out of Rockland or Portland providing this
service? _ E.S.L., Sarasota, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   A. The selections are limited, because Maine's summer tourism
season is relatively short. But two companies may be able to
provide some help, and the owner of a third offered some free
advice if you're willing to do the driving.
</P>
<P>
   Mainely Tours, 5{ Moulton Street, Portland, Maine 04101, (800)
282-1240, conducts half-day tours of the city. Its Lighthouse
Lovers tour ($25 a person) stops at four lighthouses and is offered
three to four times daily in summer. It also combines a tour of
Portland, where Winslow Homer painted, and Casco Bay for $21.
</P>
<P>
   Maine Line Tours, 184 Main Street, Portland, Maine 04106, (800)
341-0322, offers a three-day tour from Portland to Bar Harbor this
summer. The dates are June 23 to 25 and July 14 to 16. It includes
two nights at the Holiday Inn Sunspree, on Eden Street one mile
from downtown Bar Harbor, a tour of Acadia National Park, a
whale-watching cruise and a lobster bake. Prices are $289 a person,
double occupancy, for the June trip.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Hayward, who operates Harbor Light Tours, 162 North Main
Street, Rockland, Maine 04841, (207) 594-8170, usually takes large
groups on custom-designed tours. But he offered to put together an
itinerary for a driving tour, free, if you'll rent a car and do
your own driving.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Q. I am planning a driving trip in France this July. I need to
find an airline that flies from Bordeaux to London at a reasonable
fare, because we plan to drop off our rental car at the airport in
France and visit London for a few days before returning home. _
J.F., Manalapan, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   A. The lowest one-way fare we found by checking on Travelocity
and Expedia, using July 8 through 11 (a Saturday-to-Tuesday period)
as an example, was the same each day: $320.72 (actually, the fare
was 8 cents higher on Travelocity).
</P>
<P>
   This was on flights listed under British Airways, but flown by
Air Liberte, using a Fokker 100. The flight takes about 90 minutes,
landing at Gatwick Airport. A similar fare was offered on the
British Airways Web site. Conditions apply to this fare, including

   Q. A few years ago, my family and I visited Tuscany and Umbria.
While driving through the countryside, we came upon a medieval
festival. It featured the townspeople in period costumes
demonstrating traditional skills, such as papermaking, dyeing,
weaving and candlemaking _ on streets that had all traces of the
20th century removed or concealed. We will be back in the area this
June and were wondering if you could suggest any such festivals
then. _ Georgia Wood, New York, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A. There is one major medieval fair that will be held in the
region while you will be there.
</P>
<P>
   In Bevagna, a town in Umbria about 22 miles from Perugia, the
Fair of the Gaite takes place June 16 to 25. This is a re-creation
of life during the Middle Ages. Along the streets and alleyways of
Bevagna, the inhabitants of the four Gaite (town wards) will
compete with one another to reproduce the typical workshops, inns
and markets of those times. There will be shows, concerts,
exhibitions and conferences as well as an archery contest. But the
main focus of the fair is traditional craftwork; in the cramped,
dimly lighted workshops, artisans will demonstrate original
techniques. Contact the Umbrian Touristic Promotion Board, Via
Mazzini 21, 06100 Perugia; telephone (39-075) 575951, fax (39-075)
5736828.
</P>
<P>
   If you can extend your stay, you can see the Festa Medievale,
July 1 and 2, in the town of Vicopisano in Tuscany, about 9 miles
from Pisa and 18 miles from Lucca; call (39-050) 796511, fax
(39-050) 796540.

&HT;     TAKING THE ULTIMATE BIKE RIDE IN THE BAY AREA 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By TOM STIENSTRA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The ultimate Bay Area bike ride _ a loop of 475
miles in nine counties _ features the best of the best: the coast,
ridge lines, mountains and remote valleys.
</P>
<P>
   This trip will start at the Golden Gate Bridge and be routed
south to the Peninsula Skyline to Highway 9 and Los Gatos, then
loop around the Santa Clara Valley and up to Mount Hamilton, over
the top and down the other side to Livermore. Then the trip will
take riders across the Antioch Bridge, and up through the foothills
to the Napa and Sonoma Valleys, out the Russian River to the coast,
and then down to the flank of Mt. Tamalpais and across the Golden
Gate Bridge back to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   It rivals the back roads of Vermont with fall colors as the most
scenic bike ride in North America.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, of course, is this: Where to stay at night? The Bay
Area has 25 campgrounds, but none are located along the ideal
route.
</P>
<P>
   But now comes the solution. It turns out that the Greenbelt
Alliance has solved that, arranging with a half-dozen churches on
the route to allow camping during the week of April 16-22 leading
up to Earth Day.
</P>
<P>
   That is providing a one-of-a-kind chance to complete this trip
in a week, riding an average of about 70 miles a day. It is planned
as a ``group ride,'' though the term is used loosely, because
typically riders will get strung over great distances; it will be
limited to 70 participants.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the loop ride will be on roads, though even the bike
trails on the route will be paved. So riders with light road
touring bikes with skinny tires are well suited. Yet according to
Amy Tanner at Greenbelt, about half of the early sign-ups are those
with mountain bikes who have never completed a long-distance trek.
After all, for many, this will be too good to pass up.
</P>
<P>
   The reason Greenbelt is organizing this trip is to show off the
best of the Bay Area's open space, and in turn, inspire people to
join the mission to protect it. That is Greenbelt's sole mission.
About 600,000 acres in the Bay Area foothills has been preserved
for open space and recreation, according to Greenbelt, and another
600,000 acres are at risk, with the most critical areas identified
as the Hayward hills, Peninsula foothills east of Skyline, and open
space in north Marin and south Sonoma counties.
</P>
<P>
   Prospects who want to join Greenbelt on this epic Bay Area loop
ride are required to raise a $600 sponsorship to cover their costs.
For information, phone 1-800-543-GREEN.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, any of the seven planned routes can be ridden or
driven at any time, perhaps to test if you are up for the
challenge, or just to enjoy the region's prettiest landscapes. Here
is a preview:
</P>
<P>
   _ Day 1: San Francisco to Los Gatos, 68 miles, featuring Golden
Gate Park, Ocean Beach, Skyline Boulevard on the Peninsula, and
Highway 9 in the Santa Cruz Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   _ Day 2: Los Gatos to Evergreen College in East San Jose, 67
miles, featuring the foothill of Mount Umunhum, and the canyons of
Uvas and Coyote lakes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Day 3: From Evergreen College to Livermore, 76 miles,
featuring the twisty but gentle grade up Mount Hamilton and over
the other side in to San Antonio Valley (wildflowers galore) and
north along Mines Road.
</P>
<P>
   _ Day 4: Livermore to Fairfield, 82 miles, featuring Vasco Road,
over the Antioch Bridge in the San Joaquin Delta and through the
Montezuma foothills.
</P>
<P>
   _ Day 5: Fairfield to Santa Rosa, 62 miles, featuring the
Silverado Trail and Sonoma County wine country.
</P>
<P>
   _ Day 6: Santa Rosa to Olema, 74 miles, featuring the Russian
River Valley out to Highway 1, then heading south on the coast past
Tomales Bay and Point Reyes National Seashore.
</P>
<P>
   _ Day 7: Olema to San Francisco, 46 miles, featuring the
Shoreline Highway south to the flank of Mount Tamalpais and then
across Golden Gate Bridge to San Francisco.

LDS CHURCH OFTEN STILL MISUNDERSTOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MAUREEN JENKINS  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (EDITORS: INCLUDES KEY POINTS, LIST OF BELIEFS AT END OF TAKE.
ALSO MOVING IN THE ``L'' CATEGORY) PHOENIX _ In some ways, the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is a quintessential
American success story.
</P>
<P>
   Fleeing religious and political persecution in the 1840s,
members of this newly established church left Nauvoo, Ill., and
trekked west, setting up colonies and a distinct way of life. A
century and a half later, the little church organized by Joseph
Smith is one of the fastest-growing religions in the Americas &UR; and
across the globe, as well as the richest church per capita in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   So, why is the Mormon Church still so maligned and little
understood within some Christian circles?
</P>
<P>
   This never-quite-resolved question again moved to the forefront
with an ``East Valley Tribune'' story headlined ``Christian fest
snubs Mormons,'' referring to the Jan. 15 Festival of Faith 2000
event at Bank One Ballpark in Phoenix. A gathering billed as the
largest-ever ecumenical assembly of Christians in Arizona history,
it attracted 35,000 people from about 400 Protestant, Catholic and
Orthodox congregations.
</P>
<P>
   The Latter-day Saints, however, were not among these.
</P>
<P>
   Initially included in the festival's planning, the Mormon Church
later found itself excluded, apparently because some conservative
organizers didn't consider Latter-day Saints to be Christians.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an ideal world, there would be total acceptance, total
understanding, total love,'' said the Rev. Paul Eppinger, executive
director of the Arizona Ecumenical Council and a Festival of Faith
lead organizer. ``But unfortunately, we do not live in an ideal
world and therefore, in our desire to make the Christian church
more understanding of each group, there are first steps we must
take, then the second step, the third step, the fourth step.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting Evangelicals, mainline Protestants, Catholics and
Eastern Orthodox Christians to meet with each other was that first
step. Broadening the ecumenical net to include churches such as the
Latter-day Saints clearly would be another.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of this issue lie matters of doctrine and theology
_ and the notion of just WHO is a Christian.
</P>
<P>
   Evangelicals who believe in literal biblical interpretation say
the Mormons aren't. The Latter-day Saints, who believe their faith
is a restoration of the original church founded by Jesus Christ and
his 12 disciples, claim they belong to the true Christian church. &QL; 
ROOTS OF DISAGREEMENT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But just who creates the yardstick that determines which
denominations are Christians? And what standard are these groups
measured against?
</P>
<P>
   Is it a historical faith believed to be derived from the intent
of Jesus' teachings? Or is it the European-spawned brand of
Catholicism and Protestantism, with its various creeds and
traditions influenced by culture?
</P>
<P>
   And does a church's definition of itself determine where it fits
on the religious landscape?
</P>
<P>
   Although the Mormon Church is neither Catholic nor Protestant,
says Phoenix metro area spokesman Wilford Andersen, it's no less
Christian.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people understand we can respectfully disagree on
matters of Christian doctrine,'' Andersen said, ``but should never
disagree on Christian conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``There certainly are some (churches) who find it difficult to
work together with us, and I respect that as long as we don't have
ill will toward each other and as long as we don't have
misinformation.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, of course, is the crux of the rift between Mormons and
evangelical Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Richard N. Ostling, co-author of the acclaimed ``Mormon America:
The Power and the Promise'' (HarperSanFrancisco, $26), says the LDS
Church's ``sweeping policy of secrecy'' contributes to the faith
being misunderstood in mainstream American religious culture. Its
weddings are held in temples that require church-issued
``recommends'' to enter, meaning non-Mormons never get inside. Even
the church's governing documents _ the sort that many denominations
publish on their Web sites _ are off-limits to outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you have this situation, it creates rumors,
speculations, misinformation,'' said Ostling, who wrote ``Mormon
America'' with his wife, Joan K. Ostling. ``There is room for a lot
of confusion.``
</P>
<P>
   Not that Mormons and their conservative Christian critics tend
to disagree much on matters of morality and social values. Both
groups stress the importance of family and personal responsibility,
and decry abortion, gambling and same-sex unions.
</P>
<P>
   In California, for example, a coalition of Southern Baptists,
Catholics and Mormons recently joined forces to pass Proposition 22
on Tuesday, which would ban same-sex marriages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the disagreement is doctrinal,'' Ostling said,
``rather than moral, political and cultural. The fundamental issues
between Mormonism and traditional Christianity are the nature of
God, the doctrine of Christ, the Bible's authority, and the
doctrine of humanity and relating to God.''
</P>
<P>
   Attempting to examine the commonalities and differences between
the groups, professors Craig L. Blomberg of Denver Seminary and
Stephen E. Robinson of Brigham Young University wrote the 1997
book, ``How Wide the Divide? A Mormon and an Evangelical in
Conversation'' (InterVarsity Press, $11.99).
</P>
<P>
   Their point-counterpoint text includes a ``joint conclusion'' at
the end of each chapter and doesn't dwell on trying to prove the
other wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen says this civil tolerance and respect _ rather than
active teaching against other religions _ is central to Mormon
faith. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DIFFERENT, YET SIMILAR &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ostling says it's ``almost predictable'' that Mormons and
evangelicals butt heads theologically, as both target the same
group of potential converts.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Cornwall, a sociology professor at the LDS Church's
Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   Many sociologists believe the animosity between the groups
exists because ``we share the same niche,'' Cornwall said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can use that marketplace language, both Evangelicals
and Mormons share the same target: the unchurched,'' she adds. ``We
compete in the marketplace of religion, and evangelicals want to
make sure their targets realize Mormons are different.''
</P>
<P>
   Ostling thinks today's Mormon Church, especially under current
President Gordon B. Hinckley's administration, goes ``back and
forth'' on positioning itself closer to ``mainstream''
Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mormonism probably presents less of its doctrine to persons
before baptism than any other religious group I can think of,'' he
said. ``The key to winning converts and solidifying them in the
faith is the community, and not the isolated individual. Some of
the more complex doctrinal areas are left for later on.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Andersen says the church doesn't dilute its theology
just to make connections with potential members or other
Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past several decades, the church has sought
opportunities to team up with other faiths in humanitarian efforts.
</P>
<P>
   In the Phoenix area, LDS Church members belong to the InterFaith
Action Coalition of Arizona, which is composed of representatives
of 12 different faiths, from Jewish to Buddhist to Christian.
</P>
<P>
   Mormons' involvement in such groups across the nation probably
is a trickle-down effect of Hinckley's public relations-savvy
administration, which is trying to build bridges with other
religions while highlighting positive aspects of Mormon life.
</P>
<P>
   Cornwall says Hinckley's just-released book, ``Standing for
Something: 10 Neglected Virtues That Will Heal Our Hearts and
Homes'' (Times Books, $24.00), is one such effort, capitalizing on
Americans' interest in back-to-basic values without hitting readers
over the head with Mormon theology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mormons want to be both different and the same (as other
Americans),'' Cornwall said. ``Different in the sense we know our
faith is different from other faiths, but the same in that we want
people to see that we can be as successful as anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's establishing this common ground, Andersen says, that
will ultimately break down barriers, both social and doctrinal,
that stand between faith groups. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
SOME FACTS ABOUT THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS: &QL; 
 &QL; 
_One of the world's fastest-growing religions, the LDS Church
claims 10.3 million members, with just more than half living
outside the United States. About one-sixth of LDS members live in
Utah. &QL; 
_If the LDS Church were a U.S. corporation, its revenues would
place it No. 243 on the ``Fortune'' 500 list. &QL; 
_The Mormon Church is one of the nation's largest landowners, with
property equal to the size of Delaware. &QL; 
_Unlike most churches, the LDS Church has no professional clergy.
Members take turns speaking at Sunday sacrament meetings, or
worship services. Members also serve in unpaid ``callings,'' or
assignments, that get work done throughout the church. &QL; 
_Some of the church's best-known members include Steve Young, a San
Francisco 49ers quarterback; singers Donny and Marie Osmond and
Gladys Knight; Stephen R. Covey, bestselling author of ``7 Habits
of Highly Effective People''; and Orrin Hatch, a Utah senator and
former presidential candidate. &QL; 
_Until 1978, Black men were not ordained to the lay priesthood _ a
position reversed by official declaration of then-President Spencer
W. Kimball. Today, R&AMP;B singer Knight is probably the Mormon
Church's best-known Black member. &QL; 
_Source: ``Mormon America: The Power and the Promise,''by Richard
N. Ostling and Joan K. Ostling. &QL; 
_About 150,000 Mormons live in the Phoenix area, and about 300,000
live within Arizona. &QL; 
 &QL; 
SOME KEY BELIEFS &QL; 
 &QL; 
_With the revelations delivered by God the father and his son,
Jesus Christ, to church founder Joseph Smith in 1820, a restoration
of the ``truths, powers and priesthood authority of the ancient
church'' was constituted as the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints. Mormons believe they follow Christ's true
gospel, which they say was lost after the deaths of the original 12
disciples. &QL; 
_Divine revelation for the church's direction comes from God to the
president of the church (currently Gordon B. Hinckley). Presidents
are viewed as prophets in the same tradition as Abraham, Moses and
Peter. &QL; 
_In addition to the King James version of the Christian Bible,
Latter-day Saints consider ``The Book of Mormon: Another Testament
of Jesus Christ'' divinely inspired scripture, along with ``The
Doctrine and Covenants'' and ``The Pearl of Great Price,'' other
revelations and writings given since the church's start in 1830. &QL; 
_Mormons don't believe in the traditional concept of ``original
sin'' (that all humans are born sinners because of the Garden of
Eden sin of Adam and Eve), but rather that people are punished for
the sins they commit. &QL; 
_Mormons abstain from using tobacco, alcoholic beverages, tea and
coffee in adherence to ``The Word of Wisdom,'' a health code
revealed to founder Joseph Smith in 1833. &QL; 
_Members are required to tithe, or give a 10th of their income, to
the church to remain members in good standing and gain access to
temples for sacred ordinances. &QL;

FUEL SURCHARGES ADDED TO AIR AND BUS TICKETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, March 19) 
(DW) 
 By BETSY WADE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The price of oil is affecting travel everywhere. Surcharges of
$20 on a round trip are being added to most airline tickets.
Airport shuttle prices are inching up. Although a spokesman for
Greyhound Lines says increases in the cost of driving improve the
company's business, Greyhound has also added a fuel surcharge.
Officials in the hotel industry, noting the possibility that higher
prices will bring a downturn in travel, say there could be an
impact there, too: inexpensive motels might lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   The increases are unpredictable. Supershuttle, an airport van
service in many major cities, has added a charge of 50 cents to its
trip prices. But Gray Line, which serves airports in New York, has
not, although Lee Gelber, a spokesman, said that the fare for the
day trip to the Woodbury Common mall had increased by $1. On Feb.
2, Olympia Bus Service raised its fare from the Port Authority Bus
Terminal in midtown Manhattan to Newark Airport from $10 to $11,
but created a round-trip fare of $20. A spokeswoman called it a
fuel surcharge, but acknowledged that it was unlikely to be
withdrawn. This supports the notion that a surcharge is simply an
increase that will stay even if oil prices drop.
</P>
<P>
   Air passengers are feeling the biggest impact right now. Last
week brought turmoil in fares provoked by fuel costs, but even
before that, the major lines followed Continental's lead in adding
$10 to each one-way fare. But because Southwest Airlines has not _
although it has increased fares slightly _ some other airlines are
not adding the surcharge in areas where they compete with Southwest
or other discount lines. For example, United's service in
California does not have surcharges.
</P>
<P>
   My encounter with the fuel surcharge uncovered what appears to
be the most eccentric pattern in its application. I went to a
Continental ticket counter last month to exchange two senior
coupons for a round-trip ticket to San Antonio in April. For those
unfamiliar with senior coupons, all the lines sell them to people
over 62 for roughly competitive prices; each coupon is good for a
one-way flight in the 48 states. My coupons cost $579 for four, and
I was expecting to use two _ or about $289 worth _ for my San
Antonio trip.
</P>
<P>
   The agent said there would be a $20 surcharge, bringing my fare
to $309 for a schedule that required a connection on the way home.
This was irritating. I made another choice, a ticket for $355,
figuring I would use the coupons when they represented a greater
saving.
</P>
<P>
   Not all airlines impose the extra charge on the coupons, I
discovered when I examined the major lines' fuel-surcharge
policies.
</P>
<P>
   Continental put its $10-each-way surcharge into all domestic
markets on Feb. 1. As I found, it adds the charge to senior coupons
when they are turned into tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Both American Airlines and Trans World Airlines are adding the
surcharge to all their domestic tickets regardless of the
competition, they say. Both put the charge into effect Feb. 1;
neither adds a surcharge to senior coupons. If the tickets were
bought before the increase took effect, it is not added later. Jim
Brown, a TWA spokesman, said that when the line had a fare sale for
four days in mid-February, there was no fuel charge on those
tickets. There might be such sales again, he said. But when asked
if the surcharge was ever going to go away, he said ``no comment,''
as did every other airline spokesperson.
</P>
<P>
   American, TWA and all the others add the fuel charge if the
passenger changes an itinerary on a ticket purchased before the
surcharge went into effect. This is on top of the regular fee for
changing a ticket. The airlines contend that it becomes, in effect,
a new ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest Airlines imposes the charge in most markets, according
to Dennis Mollura, a spokesman. ``In competitive markets,'' he
said, ``we do what the competition is doing.'' Senior coupons are
not surcharged.
</P>
<P>
   United Airlines, according to Joseph P. Hopkins, a spokesman,
matches Continental and Southwest where it competes with them.
Senior coupons are not surcharged.
</P>
<P>
   US Airways levies the surcharge in most domestic markets, but
not on the Boston-New York-Washington shuttle. US Airways adds the
charge to tickets bought with senior coupons.
</P>
<P>
   Delta also adds the surcharge to most domestic tickets, except
where it competes with low-price airlines, according to John
Kennedy, a spokesman. The Boston-New York-Washington shuttle is
exempted, as are senior coupons.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest Airlines disdains a fuel surcharge; Ed Stewart, a
spokesman, said, ``A fare increase is a fare increase.'' On Jan.
25, Southwest increased its ticket prices $2 for a trip of up to
600 miles; $3 for 600 to 900 miles, and $4 for more than 900 miles.
The increases are doubled for a round trip.
</P>
<P>
   Both the American Society of Travel Agents and an organization
called the U.S. Travel Agent Registry, a group formed in 1995 that
says it has 780 member agencies, sent complaints in January and
February to the Department of Transportation saying that the
airlines' computer fare displays did not show the fuel surcharges,
or other added fees, on the first screen. Sam Podberesky, in the
department's regulatory division, combined the two complaints, and
the department has asked several airlines to respond.
</P>
<P>
   The complaints can be read on the Web at dms.dot.gov. When the
``search'' box appears, enter the last four digits of the docket
identifier: OST-200-6821.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on the ground, Greyhound increased fares 1.5 percent
in late January. ``Part is fuel, part is a general price
increase,'' said George Gravley, a spokesman. ``We have a lot of
trouble raising prices,'' he said. ``But we pick up passengers
because of the cost of driving.''
</P>
<P>
   Gale C. Ellsworth, president of Trailways, said that its 54
franchised operators were responding individually. ``Some are
calling it a surcharge,'' Ellsworth said, ``some are calling it an
increase.'' Peter Pan, in New England, has added 50 cents for any
one-way trip, and Adirondack Trailways in New York went up 5
percent across the board.
</P>
<P>
   Gasoline prices for cars have taken a huge swing, from an
average of 96 cents a gallon for self-service regular unleaded in
February 1999 to $1.37 last month, according to AAA figures. Jerry
Cheske, a AAA spokesman, said prices would probably continue to
rise. But, he said, the response has been different from 1990, when
gas prices rose and in August ``tourism almost fell through the
floor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't see the kind of outrage we saw then,'' he said. The
economy is better and people are driving vehicles that use a lot
more gas, he said.
</P>
<P>
   If people who drive on their vacations hold back this summer,
according to Warren J. Marr, director of hospitality and leisure
consultants at PricewaterhouseCoopers, it will affect prices at
less expensive hotels but not luxury places.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who have to do business will still do it,'' Marr said,
``but there may be more aggressive pricing at the lower-priced
hotels by summer.''

Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule reviews of new books:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``AFTERBURN'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Colin Harrison (FSG, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The thing about thrillers is that so many of them are bad.
Abysmal, even. It's a genre so plagued by hack writers and
bush-league prose that when you find one like this, you want to
call it by another name. But a thriller it is _ the long, patient
kind, with underplayed dialogue and characters who sidestep
stereotype every time it shows up to claim them. The protagonist is
Charlie Ravich, a former Vietnam fighter pilot and POW now in his
late 50s who faces crisis in his private life and in his
multimillion-dollar corporate affairs. Harrison spends much of his
book establishing a thin connection between Charlie and a young
woman named Christina Welles, who has just been released from
prison and who, with her former boyfriend, is suspected of stealing
from a mobster who really, REALLY, wants his money back. There's
sex. There's violence (we don't want to spoil your fun if you have
a taste for it, but for the sake of the squeamish, we'll mention a
little torture scene involving an electric drill and a circular saw
_ and that's not the last of it). If you can take the gore, this
book is enough to give a weak genre a good name. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``CINEMA SOUTHWEST'' &QL; 
 &UR; By John A. Murray (Northland, $21.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The photo on the cover is of John Ford making a scene from ``The
Searchers'' in 1956, but that's just the predictable side of
filmmaking in the American Southwest. Think of the alternatives. In
1965, Max Von Sydow, as Jesus, delivered the Sermon on the Mount on
Utah's Green River Overlook in ``The Greatest Story Ever Told.''
Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda camped in Anasazi ruins on their way
east in ``Easy Rider.'' Robert Duvall turned his life around on the
Texas prairie in ``Tender Mercies,'' and in ``Bonnie and Clyde,''
Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway robbed an actual bank in the rural
community of Pilot Point, Texas _ the same bank that the real
Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow had robbed about 40 years earlier.
In this book, due out at the end of the month, Murray looks at the
Southwest and its starring role in so many American films. Included
are some great photographs _ our favorite, we confess, is of John
Wayne (in ``She Wore a Yellow Ribbon'') looking grandly out at that
mist-shrouded Big Daddy of film locations, Monument Valley. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``EATING WELL FOR OPTIMUM HEALTH'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Andrew Weil (Knopf, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's a chapter here in which Weil sets out to devise what he
calls ``the worst diet in the world,'' which after a few paragraphs
sounded so suspiciously like our own bill of fare that we began to
wonder whether Weil had us under surveillance. It was humbling, but
more fun to read than, say, the section called ``A Healing Story:
From French Fries to Kale,'' or ``The Macronutrients: An
Overview.'' But we are not hopeless, no siree. We love broccoli. We
love salmon. Unfortunately, we have learned from Weil that not all
salmon are equal, that we need to worry not only about our own
diets but about the diets of the fish we eat, which is one step
further down the food chain than we care to go. Eggs are another
research project. ``Eggs of chickens,'' Weil writes, ``(are) good
sources of omega-3 fatty acids if they come from free-range
chickens or chickens whose diets are supplemented with omega-3-rich
algae.'' Are we up to this task? No, but we know that Weil has made
many converts-to-wellness, so rush to the store: His new book is
out, with the author looking hale and hearty on the cover.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``TIGERS IN THE SNOW''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By Peter Matthiessen (North Point, $27) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most of us know that the tiger is beautiful, but we also have
been raised with an unshakable idea of its fierceness, the
fearsome, predatory aggression of Shere Khan in Rudyard Kipling's
``The Jungle Book.'' But Matthiessen points out that the hunter,
Jim Corbett, in his book ``The Man-eaters of Kumaon,'' refers to
the tiger as ``a large-hearted gentleman of bottomless courage.''
That's what this book aims to give you _ a new look at the tiger,
at its history, its endangered habitats, its dwindling numbers, its
extreme vulnerability to poachers, and finally, at the efforts of
researchers and wildlife biologists to study and preserve it. The
book also conveys the quiet majesty of the animal, largely through
the author's eloquent interest and regard for it. With an
introduction and color photographs by Maurice Hornocker, tiger
expert and co-founder of the Siberian Tiger Project. Matthiessen's
fans should also look for ``The Peter Matthiessen Reader''
(Vintage, $14), in which editor McKay Jenkins assembles excerpts
from the author's books of non-fiction, including ``The Snow
Leopard'' and ``Men's Lives.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite the loss of two Mars-bound spacecraft last year, the
reliable Mars Global Surveyor keeps orbiting the planet 12 times a
day, well into the third year of its mission, and taking mapping
pictures of the landscape that are up to 50 times as detailed as
any previous photography there. The sharper focus is giving
scientists a clearer and more intriguing view of the planet's
two-faced geology.
</P>
<P>
   The ancient cratered highlands of the southern hemisphere of
Mars could not be more different from the low, flat plains of the
north, possibly the basin of a former ocean. A new gravity survey
suggests how water from the south once found its way to the
northern basin.
</P>
<P>
   Even the poles are, well, poles apart in appearance. The
differences in the size, content and seasonal change in the polar
ice caps were recognized in earlier spacecraft photography. But
more detailed pictures have now revealed something of the distinct
underlying topography at the poles and may offer clues to the
climate history of Mars.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists examining Global Surveyor's closeup pictures said the
flat, pitted texture of the north polar ice cap resembled cottage
cheese, while larger pits, holes and flat-topped mesas of the south
polar cap looked more like Swiss cheese.
</P>
<P>
   The much more extensive northern residual ice cap, the part that
survives the summer, is frozen water. The southern residual cap
seems to be made of frozen carbon dioxide, or dry ice. Scientists
said the new pictures might help them decide if the southern ice
cap was only a thin veneer or a solid block extending to depths of
more than a mile.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unusual shapes of the land forms on the north and south
polar caps suggest that these regions have had different climates
and histories for thousands or perhaps even millions of years,''
said Dr. Peter C. Thomas, a planetary geologist at Cornell
University.
</P>
<P>
   The new interpretations of the two faces of Mars were described
in interviews last week and in reports in the current issues of the
journals Nature and Science. Thomas was the principal author of the
Nature report on the polar ice caps.
</P>
<P>
   ``These findings indicate that the differences between the caps
are substantial (rather than reflecting short-lived differences in
frost cover), and so support the idea of long-term asymmetry in the
polar climates of Mars,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The southern region, for example, is much drier and colder than
the north and stands at a higher elevation. The Swiss cheese aspect
of the southern cap, geologists said, appears to be the result of
periodic collapses of deposited ice and dust, probably influenced
by the underlying topography.
</P>
<P>
   In another report on Global Surveyor's findings, published in
Science, a team of geophysicists led by Dr. Maria Zuber of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology described gravity
measurements revealing the structure of the crust of Mars _ and
more evidence of the planet's split geological personality.
</P>
<P>
   The varying pull of gravity caused the spacecraft's orbital
altitude to change slightly, the motions showing up in its radio
transmissions. From these variations, scientists plotted
differences in the planet's subsurface density. They determined
that the crust was thickest under the southern highlands.
</P>
<P>
   A more refined analysis of the gravity measurements has revealed
what the scientists described as likely traces of buried channels
that could have been carved out by floods of water from the
southern highlands flowing into the northern lowlands billions of
years ago. The channels, which once were on the surface but have
since been filled and covered over by sediments, were as much as
125 miles wide and more than 1,000 miles long.
</P>
<P>
   If these are indeed water channels, scientists said, they could
be important evidence for the existence of oceans and a warmer
climate in the planet's early history, conditions that might have
been conducive to the emergence of life. In an accompanying
article, several scientists cautioned that there could be other
explanations of the gravity measurements and that it would be
difficult to test which was correct.

BLEAK WORKS BELIE WRITER RICK MOODY'S JOY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA YOST  
   
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (EDITORS: RETRANSMITTING; ALSO MOVING IN THE ``L'' CATEGORY)
 &UR; Never mind that his novels employ less-than-joyful themes _
electrocution, prepubescent sex, ailing mothers who dribble
``stalactites of drool,'' drug addiction, self-immolation, Richard
Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Moody has written such bleak stories as ``The Ice Storm,'' which
became the bleak 1997 Ang Lee-directed movie starring Kevin Klein
and Sigourney Weaver.
</P>
<P>
   Writing gloom under cover of mirth, he follows a daily regimen
but works only when the spirit moves him. At his home on Fishers
Island in Long Island Sound, he might write by day or he might
write all night, a comfortable schedule that fosters bliss.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hypothesis is that the best way to convey joy to my readers
is if I am joyful when I'm on the job,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Joy brings productivity. At age 38, he's already published three
novels (``The Ice Storm,'' `` Garden State, Purple America''), a
collection of short stories (``The Ring of Brightest Angels Around
Heaven'') and edited a collection of essays titled ``Joyful Noise''
_ and there's that word again.
</P>
<P>
   Although Moody has been variously compared to the greats who
preceded him _ Cheever, Roth, Updike _ he modestly dismisses such
accolades, eschewing public-relations hype while recognizing that
hype and a hit movie have made him a marketable author who so far
can depend on each new work's being accepted by his publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Acclaim also drags him into the Okefenokee Swamp of the book
tour, slogging across America to tout his latest work, leaving
behind his longtime companion, Amy, a computer-software writer who
comes along only to the more attractive cities.
</P>
<P>
   Amy will be coming along when Moody speaks during the Phoenix
Public Library's lecture series, ``Soothing Words,'' a three-month
event that began in January. This month's featured writers include
Moody on Thursday, March 16.
</P>
<P>
   Moody will appear at 7 p.m. at the Burton Barr Phoenix Central
Library to read from his coming collection of stories,
``Demonology,'' due out in January.2001.)
</P>
<P>
   Then he and Amy will head for his father's winter home in
Wickenburg, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Moody is a writer's writer, besotted by the English
language, heir to legendary wordsmiths Hemingway, Fitzgerald,
Joyce, Bellow, Beckett. He loves words as a writer because he loves
words as a reader and sprinkles his conversation with literary
quotations.
</P>
<P>
   Moody's own work is highly stylized _ too much so, some critics
say. But he prides himself on writing that has become denser over
the course of three novels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've made language exciting again,'' he says, less a boast
than an exaltation in the sheer beauty of well-crafted prose.
</P>
<P>
   Moody has been writing for 30 years. As a boy, he dabbled, but
he was easily distracted by other boyhood occupations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lacked follow-through,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Childhood in suburban Connecticut appeared idyllic from the
outside, but he confesses to harboring ``demons,'' suffering
frequent illnesses and being overly sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   The sensitivity that plagued him in his youth has served him
well as an adult observer of human emotions. He credits his
``finely calibrated compass that picks up what's going on in a
room.''
</P>
<P>
   In his teens, Moody began to write in earnest, producing short
stories and poems.
</P>
<P>
   Son of literary parents, he majored in English at Brown
University and began to write ``Garden State'' in 1986 while living
in Hoboken, N.J., holding down a day job in the editorial
department of the Simon &AMP; Schuster publishing house.
</P>
<P>
   Although the job slowed work on his novel, it taught him the
intricacies of the publishing business _ how to find an agent, how
to write a contract. It did not help sell his book, which was
rejected 22 times in a 15-month period.
</P>
<P>
   Moody despaired of drowning in the seas of rejection. Then, a
small press called Pushcart threw him a lifeline and even awarded
him its Pushcart Editors' Book Award.
</P>
<P>
   Work on his second novel, ``The Ice Storm,'' began in 1990.
Having quit his day job, he was able to write more swiftly,
completing the book in just two years. He was single then,
supporting himself on freelance editing and living hand to mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ice Storm'' was accepted by big-time publisher Little,
Brown and Co., and Moody forged a relationship with an editor who
respects his distinctive style.
</P>
<P>
   Moody became proficient at his craft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured out how to tell a story,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Moody tries to do something different with each of his works,
their thread ``fealty to human emotions and human psychology.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Garden State'' is the story of disaffected youth lost in
suburban New Jersey, contemplating life, death and rock and roll.
</P>
<P>
   ``Purple America'' is a deeply emotional book that examines how
one family's remorse ``trickles down through the generations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Black Veil,'' a non-fiction work due out this summer,
comes from family folklore about the Rev. Joseph Moody, said to
have inspired ``The Minister's Black Veil,'' a short story by
American author Nathaniel Hawthorne.
</P>
<P>
   But ``The Ice Storm'' has been his bestseller, thanks in part to
the movie. The grim saga traces a brief span in the life of
Benjamin Hood, a suburbanite bored with marriage who dallies with a
neighbor, struggles to rein in his precocious daughter, Wendy, and
tries to discover himself during the sexual liberation of the
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Moody was warned to fear the worst from Hollywood, and ``I DID
fear the worst.''
</P>
<P>
   Meeting the respected Ang Lee, who also directed ``Sense and
Sensibility,'' allayed those fears. One red flag raised was the
casting of Christina Ricci, who had appeared in such films as ``The
Addams Family'' and ``Casper.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ricci's teen sexpot portrayal impressed Moody, as did the
film as a whole. Now he is waiting to hear about options on his
other works. Buoyed by his positive experiences with ``The Ice
Storm,'' he would happily return to Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   With such success comes book tours, not the choicest part of the
profession. One tour took Moody on the road for five grueling
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But he enjoys meeting his readers, most of whom are under age
40.
</P>
<P>
   Writing is an isolating profession, after all, he notes as he
sits alone in his home on Fishers Island, while Amy lives across
the water in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   It is Amy who reads his work first and then filters the reviews,
passing along only those that offer constructive criticism.
Although wary of shaping his style to please critics, Moody says he
sometimes can learn from them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I trust in the possibility that some harsh criticism will give
me an opportunity to improve,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And improvement brings joy. &QL; Reach the reporter at

 &HT;    TECH INDUSTRY DESPERATE FOR FOREIGN WORKERS, DELL SAYS
 &HT;    240&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAIRFAX, Va. _ High-tech companies are facing worker shortages
so severe that only an infusion of foreign labor can help, Dell
Computer Corp. chairman Michael Dell said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Congress should move quickly to approve legislation raising the
annual limit on the number of high-skilled immigrants allowed to
enter the country on H-1B visas, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cap should definitely be increased because there is a huge
shortage of workers,'' Dell said at the Global Internet Summit at
George Mason University in Northern Virginia. ``If you want to
bring wealth to this country, you'll bring in knowledgable
workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's tight labor pool is driving up the cost of doing
business, he said. ``What happens is the limited supply of workers
who actually have the skills get bid up, just like Internet
stocks,'' Dell said.
</P>
<P>
   Spiraling wages in this country could spur U.S. employers to
expand overseas, he warned.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is considering several bills that would boost the
annual limit on H-1B visas from 115,000 to as much as 195,000.
</P>
<P>
   Dell blamed the worker shortage on educators who are failing to
teach young people the skills they need to get jobs in the
economy's booming technology sector. ``The education system needs
to fundamentally embrace the idea of computing being a central
skill,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Assuming Dell Computer can find workers in coming years, the
company has ``a massive opportunity'' to grow along with the
Internet, he said. Besides making personal computers, the company
will be focusing on building the Internet infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to the Internet, ``there is a huge buildout that
has yet to come,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dell said his company was hurt last year by a shortage of
components, but with that problem now solved, the company is ``in a
great position.''
</P>
<P>
   The growth of hand-held, high-tech devices such as the Palm
Pilot, are not a threat to Dell Computer because consumers still
want big-screen personal computers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   On a Palm Pilot or a cell phone, ``you just can't display that
much information,'' he said. In the future, people will use
phone-sized devices for ``for small bits of information,'' he said.
``But the PC takes on the role for (handling) more complex
information.''
</P>
<P>
   Dell also said that if Congress were to allow states to impose
sales taxes on interstate retail transactions, his company would be
able to adapt to the change without losing business. But he warned
that because cyberspace is borderless, U.S. online retailers might
move operations overseas to avoid taxes.

 &HT;    SEVERE DROUGHT IN EASTERN U.S. LIKELY TO WORSEN, OFFICIALS
PREDICT
 &HT;    By ISMAIL TURAY Jr.
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The severe drought affecting parts of the South and
Midwest is expected to intensify this spring, raising the threat of
crop damage, wildfires and water shortages, the federal government
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take a large, large amount of precipitation'' to
end the drought, and ``we don't see anything on the horizon to
bring that in,'' said Jack Kelly, director of the National Weather
Service.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly appeared at a news conference with Agriculture Secretary
Dan Glickman, Commerce Secretary William Daley and other officials
to release the government's first-ever drought forecast.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Geological Survey, which monitors streams across the
country, said that more than 95 percent of its gauges are reporting
below-normal flows.
</P>
<P>
   Stream flows are 95 percent below average in Georgia, 89 percent
in Florida, 86 percent in Ohio and 54 percent in Texas, said Harry
Lins, USGS' drought science coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the time of the year where stream flow conditions
should be about normal, but in the eastern half of the country,
we're anywhere but that,'' said USGS director Charles Groat. ``We
should be seeing ground water recharge taking place now, and we're
not seeing that either.''
</P>
<P>
   The rain shortfall could threaten the economy, the officials
said. They said agriculture and shipping could suffer the most, but
that water shortages could also affect recreation and tourism.
</P>
<P>
   The eastern United States faces a ``dangerous situation,'' Daley
said. In an average year, he said, droughts cost the economy more
than $6 billion, nearly twice as much as floods. The 1988 drought,
the most expensive weather disaster in recent history, cost $40
billion, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Glickman said forest fires and wildfires are also likely to
increase. He said wildfires this year have already claimed 208,000
acres, nearly four times as much as last year.
</P>
<P>
   It is too early to tell if the drought will affect food prices,
but more than 60 percent of Texas' winter wheat crop is rated no
better than poor, agriculture department officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The La Nina weather pattern, associated with colder than normal
waters in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean, is largely
responsible for the drought, said D. James Baker, administrator of
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. He said La
Nina has reduced rainfall in the United States for the past two
years.

annual limit on H-1B visas from 115,000 to as much as 195,000.

<P>
   Dell blamed the worker shortage on educators who are failing to
teach young people the skills they need to get jobs in the
economy's booming technology sector. ``The education system needs
to fundamentally embrace the idea of computing being a central
skill,'' he said.

</P>
<P>
   Assuming Dell Computer can find workers in coming years, the
company has ``a massive opportunity'' to grow along with the
Internet, he said. Besides making personal computers, the company
will be focusing on building the Internet infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to the Internet, ``there is a huge buildout that
has yet to come,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dell said his company was hurt last year by a shortage of
components, but with that problem now solved, the company is ``in a
great position.''
</P>
<P>
   The growth of hand-held, high-tech devices such as the Palm
Pilot, are not a threat to Dell Computer because consumers still
want big-screen personal computers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   On a Palm Pilot or a cell phone, ``you just can't display that
much information,'' he said. In the future, people will use
phone-sized devices for ``for small bits of information,'' he said.
``But the PC takes on the role for (handling) more complex
information.''
</P>
<P>
   Dell also said that if Congress were to allow states to impose
sales taxes on interstate retail transactions, his company would be
able to adapt to the change without losing business. But he warned
that because cyberspace is borderless, U.S. online retailers might
move operations overseas to avoid taxes.

BLEAK WORKS BELIE WRITER RICK MOODY'S JOY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA YOST  
   
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (EDITORS: RETRANSMITTING; ALSO MOVING IN THE ``E'' CATEGORY)
 &UR; Never mind that his novels employ less-than-joyful themes _
electrocution, prepubescent sex, ailing mothers who dribble
``stalactites of drool,'' drug addiction, self-immolation, Richard
Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Moody has written such bleak stories as ``The Ice Storm,'' which
became the bleak 1997 Ang Lee-directed movie starring Kevin Klein
and Sigourney Weaver.
</P>
<P>
   Writing gloom under cover of mirth, he follows a daily regimen
but works only when the spirit moves him. At his home on Fishers
Island in Long Island Sound, he might write by day or he might
write all night, a comfortable schedule that fosters bliss.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hypothesis is that the best way to convey joy to my readers
is if I am joyful when I'm on the job,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Joy brings productivity. At age 38, he's already published three
novels (``The Ice Storm,'' `` Garden State, Purple America''), a
collection of short stories (``The Ring of Brightest Angels Around
Heaven'') and edited a collection of essays titled ``Joyful Noise''
_ and there's that word again.
</P>
<P>
   Although Moody has been variously compared to the greats who
preceded him _ Cheever, Roth, Updike _ he modestly dismisses such
accolades, eschewing public-relations hype while recognizing that
hype and a hit movie have made him a marketable author who so far
can depend on each new work's being accepted by his publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Acclaim also drags him into the Okefenokee Swamp of the book
tour, slogging across America to tout his latest work, leaving
behind his longtime companion, Amy, a computer-software writer who
comes along only to the more attractive cities.
</P>
<P>
   Amy will be coming along when Moody speaks during the Phoenix
Public Library's lecture series, ``Soothing Words,'' a three-month
event that began in January. This month's featured writers include
Moody on Thursday, March 16.
</P>
<P>
   Moody will appear at 7 p.m. at the Burton Barr Phoenix Central
Library to read from his coming collection of stories,
``Demonology,'' due out in January.2001.)
</P>
<P>
   Then he and Amy will head for his father's winter home in
Wickenburg, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Moody is a writer's writer, besotted by the English
language, heir to legendary wordsmiths Hemingway, Fitzgerald,
Joyce, Bellow, Beckett. He loves words as a writer because he loves
words as a reader and sprinkles his conversation with literary
quotations.
</P>
<P>
   Moody's own work is highly stylized _ too much so, some critics
say. But he prides himself on writing that has become denser over
the course of three novels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've made language exciting again,'' he says, less a boast
than an exaltation in the sheer beauty of well-crafted prose.
</P>
<P>
   Moody has been writing for 30 years. As a boy, he dabbled, but
he was easily distracted by other boyhood occupations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lacked follow-through,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Childhood in suburban Connecticut appeared idyllic from the
outside, but he confesses to harboring ``demons,'' suffering
frequent illnesses and being overly sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   The sensitivity that plagued him in his youth has served him
well as an adult observer of human emotions. He credits his
``finely calibrated compass that picks up what's going on in a
room.''
</P>
<P>
   In his teens, Moody began to write in earnest, producing short
stories and poems.
</P>
<P>
   Son of literary parents, he majored in English at Brown
University and began to write ``Garden State'' in 1986 while living
in Hoboken, N.J., holding down a day job in the editorial
department of the Simon &AMP; Schuster publishing house.
</P>
<P>
   Although the job slowed work on his novel, it taught him the
intricacies of the publishing business _ how to find an agent, how
to write a contract. It did not help sell his book, which was
rejected 22 times in a 15-month period.
</P>
<P>
   Moody despaired of drowning in the seas of rejection. Then, a
small press called Pushcart threw him a lifeline and even awarded
him its Pushcart Editors' Book Award.
</P>
<P>
   Work on his second novel, ``The Ice Storm,'' began in 1990.
Having quit his day job, he was able to write more swiftly,
completing the book in just two years. He was single then,
supporting himself on freelance editing and living hand to mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ice Storm'' was accepted by big-time publisher Little,
Brown and Co., and Moody forged a relationship with an editor who
respects his distinctive style.
</P>
<P>
   Moody became proficient at his craft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured out how to tell a story,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Moody tries to do something different with each of his works,
their thread ``fealty to human emotions and human psychology.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Garden State'' is the story of disaffected youth lost in
suburban New Jersey, contemplating life, death and rock and roll.
</P>
<P>
   ``Purple America'' is a deeply emotional book that examines how
one family's remorse ``trickles down through the generations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Black Veil,'' a non-fiction work due out this summer,
comes from family folklore about the Rev. Joseph Moody, said to
have inspired ``The Minister's Black Veil,'' a short story by
American author Nathaniel Hawthorne.
</P>
<P>
   But ``The Ice Storm'' has been his bestseller, thanks in part to
the movie. The grim saga traces a brief span in the life of
Benjamin Hood, a suburbanite bored with marriage who dallies with a
neighbor, struggles to rein in his precocious daughter, Wendy, andtries to discover himself during the sexual liberation of the
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Moody was warned to fear the worst from Hollywood, and ``I DID
fear the worst.''
</P>
<P>
   Meeting the respected Ang Lee, who also directed ``Sense and
Sensibility,'' allayed those fears. One red flag raised was the
casting of Christina Ricci, who had appeared in such films as ``The
Addams Family'' and ``Casper.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ricci's teen sexpot portrayal impressed Moody, as did the
film as a whole. Now he is waiting to hear about options on his
other works. Buoyed by his positive experiences with ``The Ice
Storm,'' he would happily return to Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   With such success comes book tours, not the choicest part of the
profession. One tour took Moody on the road for five grueling
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But he enjoys meeting his readers, most of whom are under age
40.
</P>
<P>
   Writing is an isolating profession, after all, he notes as he
sits alone in his home on Fishers Island, while Amy lives across
the water in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   It is Amy who reads his work first and then filters the reviews,
passing along only those that offer constructive criticism.
Although wary of shaping his style to please critics, Moody says he
sometimes can learn from them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I trust in the possibility that some harsh criticism will give
me an opportunity to improve,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And improvement brings joy. &QL; Reach the reporter at

 &HT;    TECH INDUSTRY DESPERATE FOR FOREIGN WORKERS, DELL SAYS
 &HT;    240&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX

<TEXT>
<P>
   FAIRFAX, Va. _ High-tech companies are facing worker shortages
so severe that only an infusion of foreign labor can help, Dell
Computer Corp. chairman Michael Dell said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Congress should move quickly to approve legislation raising the
annual limit on the number of high-skilled immigrants allowed to
enter the country on H-1B visas, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cap should definitely be increased because there is a huge
shortage of workers,'' Dell said at the Global Internet Summit at
George Mason University in Northern Virginia. ``If you want to
bring wealth to this country, you'll bring in knowledgable
workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's tight labor pool is driving up the cost of doing
business, he said. ``What happens is the limited supply of workers
who actually have the skills get bid up, just like Internet
stocks,'' Dell said.
</P>
<P>
   Spiraling wages in this country could spur U.S. employers to
expand overseas, he warned.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is considering several bills that would boost the
annual limit on H-1B visas from 115,000 to as much as 195,000.
</P>
<P>
   Dell blamed the worker shortage on educators who are failing to

economy's booming technology sector. ``The education system needs

 c.2000 Special for The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (EDITORS: Also moving in the ``E'' category) &QL; 
Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule reviews of new books:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``AFTERBURN'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Colin Harrison (FSG, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The thing about thrillers is that so many of them are bad.
Abysmal, even. It's a genre so plagued by hack writers and
bush-league prose that when you find one like this, you want to
call it by another name. But a thriller it is _ the long, patient
kind, with underplayed dialogue and characters who sidestep
stereotype every time it shows up to claim them. The protagonist is
Charlie Ravich, a former Vietnam fighter pilot and POW now in his
late 50s who faces crisis in his private life and in his
multimillion-dollar corporate affairs. Harrison spends much of his
book establishing a thin connection between Charlie and a young
woman named Christina Welles, who has just been released from
prison and who, with her former boyfriend, is suspected of stealing
from a mobster who really, REALLY, wants his money back. There's
sex. There's violence (we don't want to spoil your fun if you have
a taste for it, but for the sake of the squeamish, we'll mention a
little torture scene involving an electric drill and a circular saw
_ and that's not the last of it). If you can take the gore, this
book is enough to give a weak genre a good name. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``CINEMA SOUTHWEST'' &QL; 
 &UR; By John A. Murray (Northland, $21.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The photo on the cover is of John Ford making a scene from ``The
Searchers'' in 1956, but that's just the predictable side of
filmmaking in the American Southwest. Think of the alternatives. In
1965, Max Von Sydow, as Jesus, delivered the Sermon on the Mount on
Utah's Green River Overlook in ``The Greatest Story Ever Told.''
Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda camped in Anasazi ruins on their way
east in ``Easy Rider.'' Robert Duvall turned his life around on the
Texas prairie in ``Tender Mercies,'' and in ``Bonnie and Clyde,''
Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway robbed an actual bank in the rural
community of Pilot Point, Texas _ the same bank that the real
Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow had robbed about 40 years earlier.
In this book, due out at the end of the month, Murray looks at the
Southwest and its starring role in so many American films. Included
are some great photographs _ our favorite, we confess, is of John
Wayne (in ``She Wore a Yellow Ribbon'') looking grandly out at that
mist-shrouded Big Daddy of film locations, Monument Valley. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``EATING WELL FOR OPTIMUM HEALTH'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Andrew Weil (Knopf, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's a chapter here in which Weil sets out to devise what he
calls ``the worst diet in the world,'' which after a few paragraphs
sounded so suspiciously like our own bill of fare that we began to
wonder whether Weil had us under surveillance. It was humbling, but
more fun to read than, say, the section called ``A Healing Story:
From French Fries to Kale,'' or ``The Macronutrients: An
Overview.'' But we are not hopeless, no siree. We love broccoli. We
love salmon. Unfortunately, we have learned from Weil that not all
salmon are equal, that we need to worry not only about our own
diets but about the diets of the fish we eat, which is one step
further down the food chain than we care to go. Eggs are another
research project. ``Eggs of chickens,'' Weil writes, ``(are) good
sources of omega-3 fatty acids if they come from free-range
chickens or chickens whose diets are supplemented with omega-3-rich
algae.'' Are we up to this task? No, but we know that Weil has made
many converts-to-wellness, so rush to the store: His new book is
out, with the author looking hale and hearty on the cover.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``TIGERS IN THE SNOW''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By Peter Matthiessen (North Point, $27) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most of us know that the tiger is beautiful, but we also have
been raised with an unshakable idea of its fierceness, the
fearsome, predatory aggression of Shere Khan in Rudyard Kipling's
``The Jungle Book.'' But Matthiessen points out that the hunter,
Jim Corbett, in his book ``The Man-eaters of Kumaon,'' refers to
the tiger as ``a large-hearted gentleman of bottomless courage.''
That's what this book aims to give you _ a new look at the tiger,
at its history, its endangered habitats, its dwindling numbers, its
extreme vulnerability to poachers, and finally, at the efforts of
researchers and wildlife biologists to study and preserve it. The
book also conveys the quiet majesty of the animal, largely through
the author's eloquent interest and regard for it. With an
introduction and color photographs by Maurice Hornocker, tiger
expert and co-founder of the Siberian Tiger Project. Matthiessen's
fans should also look for ``The Peter Matthiessen Reader''
(Vintage, $14), in which editor McKay Jenkins assembles excerpts
from the author's books of non-fiction, including ``The Snow
Leopard'' and ``Men's Lives.'' &QL;

RUSSIANS CAPTURE CHECHEN REBEL FIGURE
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ After a series of battlefield reversals, Russia has
captured one of Chechnya's most notorious warlords and whisked him
to Moscow to stand trial, Acting President Vladimir Putin said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Russian agents seized the warlord, Salman Raduyev, without a
fight on Sunday, Putin said. Raduyev, a Chechen commander best
known for a daring 1996 hostage-taking raid in neighboring
Dagestan, was taken to Moscow's Lefortovo prison, where he was
shown Monday night on Russian television.
</P>
<P>
   Though he was one of the most wanted men in Russia, Raduyev's
capture was not as significant as the capture of the chief rebel
leaders would be. Raduyev is not nearly as important a leader as
the rebel chief known as Khattab, an Arab and self-declared Islamic
warrior, or Shamil Basayev, who lost part of a leg in fighting,
both of whom have managed to elude Russian forces so far.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the reported arrest of Raduyev was a political gift to
Putin, an ardent proponent of the war, who has endured a week of
discouraging news from Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the recent reports by his military have not been
reassuring. Just last Friday the Russian military announced that
156 of its troops had been killed that week, one of the highest
weekly tolls during more than five months of fighting in the
breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
   The losses included 84 paratroopers from the Russian town of
Pskov, who died in a single battle after they were overrun by a
band of an estimated 1,500 militants. Russian commanders had
earlier denied that so many paratroopers had been killed, and the
disclosure has undermined the Russian government's already shaky
credibility with the Russian public.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the Russian military's humiliation, Chechen rebels
have managed to break out of the Chechen highlands, where Russian
commanders had insisted the Chechens were surrounded.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels seized the village of Komsomolskoe, on the edge of
the Chechen lowlands. After a week of Russian air strikes and
artillery raids, militants still appear to be lodged in the
village, which, like Grozny, is gradually being reduced to a ruin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The war is not over,'' Col. Gen. Genndai Troshev, the deputy
commander of Russian forces in the North Caucasus, recently
conceded.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month the Russian high command had declared the war
all-but-won and had even begun to talk about bringing many of the
troops home.
</P>
<P>
   The subsequent bad news has prompted a debate over the Russian
military's training and tactics. And it has spurred fears that
Russia is mired in an open-ended conflict that will continue to
send young Russians home in zinc coffins.
</P>
<P>
   The growing anxiety among the public has not been enough to
erase Putin's formidable lead in the opinion polls. But with the
presidential election less than two weeks away, Putin was
nonetheless eager to find something positive to talk about, and he
cast his report of the capture of Raduyev by a team of Russian
intelligence agents as a blow against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now he is in prison, which is the right place for him,'' Putin
said. ``We would like to think this is just the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   No sooner was Raduyev's capture announced that Russia's acting
prosecutor general charged him with terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will get what he deserves,'' the prosecutor general,
Vladimir Ustinov, said. ``The final decision rests with the Russian
court. So let's not try to guess whether he will be behind bars for
20 or 50 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Raduyev, 33, is a relative of Dzhokar Dudayev, the leader of the
Chechen republic who was killed during Chechnya's earlier effort to
secede, which ended with a defeat for Russian troops but without
independence.
</P>
<P>
   But Raduyev is best known for the 1996 raid he led into
Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   He seized a hospital, taking doctors and patients hostage, at
the Dagestani town of Kyzlyar and demanded that the Russians agree
to a cease-fire. He negotiated his way out of Kyzlyar and later
fought his way back to Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians have also blamed him for organizing the bombing of
a railroad station in Pyatigorsk in 1997. Raduyev has also claimed
that he was behind an assassination attempt against President
Eduard Shevardnadze of neighboring Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Raduyev suffered serious head wounds during the first war in
Chechnya and went abroad last year for plastic surgery. He
reportedly signed an agreement promising not to seek retribution if
the operation failed.
</P>
<P>
   The captive's facial injuries were apparent Monday night on
Russian television, where he was shown at the Lefortovo prison, the
former KGB prison in central Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Shorn of his beard and without sunglasses, Raduyev was shown
giving his name, date and place of birth. The left side of his face
appeared battered and his eye was distended.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials said that Raduyev had been arrested without a
fight near the town of Novogroznensky and that his personal guards
had been unaware of his whereabouts until it was announced by
Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials said Raduyev would face trial, but Putin
talked as if he had already been convicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The seizure of hostages at the village of Pervomaiskoye and
the town of Kizlyar is on the conscience of this criminal,'' Putin
said. ``These terrorist actions have claimed victims among the
civilian population.''

   Fleeing religious and political persecution in the 1840s,
members of this newly established church left Nauvoo, Ill., and
trekked west, setting up colonies and a distinct way of life. A
century and a half later, the little church organized by Joseph
Smith is one of the fastest-growing religions in the Americas &UR; and
across the globe, as well as the richest church per capita in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   So, why is the Mormon Church still so maligned and little
understood within some Christian circles?
</P>
<P>
   This never-quite-resolved question again moved to the forefront
with an ``East Valley Tribune'' story headlined ``Christian fest
snubs Mormons,'' referring to the Jan. 15 Festival of Faith 2000
event at Bank One Ballpark in Phoenix. A gathering billed as the
largest-ever ecumenical assembly of Christians in Arizona history,
it attracted 35,000 people from about 400 Protestant, Catholic and
Orthodox congregations.
</P>
<P>
   The Latter-day Saints, however, were not among these.
</P>
<P>
   Initially included in the festival's planning, the Mormon Church
later found itself excluded, apparently because some conservative
organizers didn't consider Latter-day Saints to be Christians.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an ideal world, there would be total acceptance, total
understanding, total love,'' said the Rev. Paul Eppinger, executive
director of the Arizona Ecumenical Council and a Festival of Faith
lead organizer. ``But unfortunately, we do not live in an ideal
world and therefore, in our desire to make the Christian church
more understanding of each group, there are first steps we must
take, then the second step, the third step, the fourth step.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting Evangelicals, mainline Protestants, Catholics and
Eastern Orthodox Christians to meet with each other was that first
step. Broadening the ecumenical net to include churches such as the
Latter-day Saints clearly would be another.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of this issue lie matters of doctrine and theology
_ and the notion of just WHO is a Christian.
</P>
<P>
   Evangelicals who believe in literal biblical interpretation say
the Mormons aren't. The Latter-day Saints, who believe their faith
is a restoration of the original church founded by Jesus Christ and
his 12 disciples, claim they belong to the true Christian church. &QL; 
ROOTS OF DISAGREEMENT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But just who creates the yardstick that determines which
denominations are Christians? And what standard are these groups
measured against?
</P>
<P>
   Is it a historical faith believed to be derived from the intent
of Jesus' teachings? Or is it the European-spawned brand of
Catholicism and Protestantism, with its various creeds and
traditions influenced by culture?
</P>
<P>
   And does a church's definition of itself determine where it fits
on the religious landscape?
</P>
<P>
   Although the Mormon Church is neither Catholic nor Protestant,
says Phoenix metro area spokesman Wilford Andersen, it's no less
Christian.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people understand we can respectfully disagree on
matters of Christian doctrine,'' Andersen said, ``but should never
disagree on Christian conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``There certainly are some (churches) who find it difficult to
work together with us, and I respect that as long as we don't have
ill will toward each other and as long as we don't have
misinformation.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, of course, is the crux of the rift between Mormons and
evangelical Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Richard N. Ostling, co-author of the acclaimed ``Mormon America:
The Power and the Promise'' (HarperSanFrancisco, $26), says the LDS
Church's ``sweeping policy of secrecy'' contributes to the faith
being misunderstood in mainstream American religious culture. Its
weddings are held in temples that require church-issued
``recommends'' to enter, meaning non-Mormons never get inside. Even
the church's governing documents _ the sort that many denominations
publish on their Web sites _ are off-limits to outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you have this situation, it creates rumors,
speculations, misinformation,'' said Ostling, who wrote ``Mormon
America'' with his wife, Joan K. Ostling. ``There is room for a lot
of confusion.``
</P>
<P>
   Not that Mormons and their conservative Christian critics tend
to disagree much on matters of morality and social values. Both
groups stress the importance of family and personal responsibility,
and decry abortion, gambling and same-sex unions.
</P>
<P>
   In California, for example, a coalition of Southern Baptists,
Catholics and Mormons recently joined forces to pass Proposition 22
on Tuesday, which would ban same-sex marriages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the disagreement is doctrinal,'' Ostling said,
``rather than moral, political and cultural. The fundamental issues
between Mormonism and traditional Christianity are the nature of
God, the doctrine of Christ, the Bible's authority, and the
doctrine of humanity and relating to God.''
</P>
<P>
   Attempting to examine the commonalities and differences between
the groups, professors Craig L. Blomberg of Denver Seminary and
Stephen E. Robinson of Brigham Young University wrote the 1997
book, ``How Wide the Divide? A Mormon and an Evangelical in
Conversation'' (InterVarsity Press, $11.99).
</P>
<P>
   Their point-counterpoint text includes a ``joint conclusion'' at
the end of each chapter and doesn't dwell on trying to prove the
other wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen says this civil tolerance and respect _ rather than
active teaching against other religions _ is central to Mormon
faith. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DIFFERENT, YET SIMILAR &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ostling says it's ``almost predictable'' that Mormons and
evangelicals butt heads theologically, as both target the same
group of potential converts.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Cornwall, a sociology professor at the LDS Church's
Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   Many sociologists believe the animosity between the groups
exists because ``we share the same niche,'' Cornwall said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can use that marketplace language, both Evangelicals
and Mormons share the same target: the unchurched,'' she adds. ``We
compete in the marketplace of religion, and evangelicals want to
make sure their targets realize Mormons are different.''
</P>
<P>
   Ostling thinks today's Mormon Church, especially under current
President Gordon B. Hinckley's administration, goes ``back and
forth'' on positioning itself closer to ``mainstream''
Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mormonism probably presents less of its doctrine to persons
before baptism than any other religious group I can think of,'' he
said. ``The key to winning converts and solidifying them in the
faith is the community, and not the isolated individual. Some of
the more complex doctrinal areas are left for later on.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Andersen says the church doesn't dilute its theology
just to make connections with potential members or other
Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past several decades, the church has sought
opportunities to team up with other faiths in humanitarian efforts.
</P>
<P>
   In the Phoenix area, LDS Church members belong to the InterFaith
Action Coalition of Arizona, which is composed of representatives
of 12 different faiths, from Jewish to Buddhist to Christian.
</P>
<P>
   Mormons' involvement in such groups across the nation probably
is a trickle-down effect of Hinckley's public relations-savvy
administration, which is trying to build bridges with other
religions while highlighting positive aspects of Mormon life.
</P>
<P>
   Cornwall says Hinckley's just-released book, ``Standing for
Something: 10 Neglected Virtues That Will Heal Our Hearts and
Homes'' (Times Books, $24.00), is one such effort, capitalizing on
Americans' interest in back-to-basic values without hitting readers
over the head with Mormon theology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mormons want to be both different and the same (as other
Americans),'' Cornwall said. ``Different in the sense we know our
faith is different from other faiths, but the same in that we want
people to see that we can be as successful as anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's establishing this common ground, Andersen says, that
will ultimately break down barriers, both social and doctrinal,
that stand between faith groups. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
SOME FACTS ABOUT THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS: &QL; 
 &QL; 
_One of the world's fastest-growing religions, the LDS Church
claims 10.3 million members, with just more than half living
outside the United States. About one-sixth of LDS members live in
Utah. &QL; 
_If the LDS Church were a U.S. corporation, its revenues would
place it No. 243 on the ``Fortune'' 500 list. &QL; 
_The Mormon Church is one of the nation's largest landowners, with
property equal to the size of Delaware. &QL; 
_Unlike most churches, the LDS Church has no professional clergy.
Members take turns speaking at Sunday sacrament meetings, or
worship services. Members also serve in unpaid ``callings,'' or
assignments, that get work done throughout the church. &QL; 
_Some of the church's best-known members include Steve Young, a San
Francisco 49ers quarterback; singers Donny and Marie Osmond and
Gladys Knight; Stephen R. Covey, bestselling author of ``7 Habits
of Highly Effective People''; and Orrin Hatch, a Utah senator and
former presidential candidate. &QL; 
_Until 1978, Black men were not ordained to the lay priesthood _ a
position reversed by official declaration of then-President Spencer
W. Kimball. Today, R&AMP;B singer Knight is probably the Mormon
Church's best-known Black member. &QL; 
_Source: ``Mormon America: The Power and the Promise,''by Richard
N. Ostling and Joan K. Ostling. &QL; 
_About 150,000 Mormons live in the Phoenix area, and about 300,000
live within Arizona. &QL; 
 &QL; 
SOME KEY BELIEFS &QL; 
 &QL; 
_With the revelations delivered by God the father and his son,
Jesus Christ, to church founder Joseph Smith in 1820, a restoration
of the ``truths, powers and priesthood authority of the ancient
church'' was constituted as the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints. Mormons believe they follow Christ's true
gospel, which they say was lost after the deaths of the original 12
disciples. &QL; 
_Divine revelation for the church's direction comes from God to the
president of the church (currently Gordon B. Hinckley). Presidents
are viewed as prophets in the same tradition as Abraham, Moses and
Peter. &QL; 
_In addition to the King James version of the Christian Bible,
Latter-day Saints consider ``The Book of Mormon: Another Testament
of Jesus Christ'' divinely inspired scripture, along with ``The
Doctrine and Covenants'' and ``The Pearl of Great Price,'' other
revelations and writings given since the church's start in 1830. &QL; 
_Mormons don't believe in the traditional concept of ``original
sin'' (that all humans are born sinners because of the Garden of
Eden sin of Adam and Eve), but rather that people are punished for
the sins they commit. &QL; 
_Mormons abstain from using tobacco, alcoholic beverages, tea and
coffee in adherence to ``The Word of Wisdom,'' a health code
revealed to founder Joseph Smith in 1833. &QL; 
_Members are required to tithe, or give a 10th of their income, to
the church to remain members in good standing and gain access to
temples for sacred ordinances. &QL;

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In popular lore, the Apollo 14 astronauts may be best remembered
for things they were not sent to the moon in 1971 to do. Alan
Shepard drove a golf ball in the low lunar gravity to a distance
Tiger Woods would die for. Edgar Mitchell on his own conducted what
he said were extrasensory perception experiments.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the astronauts kept their eyes on the prize and took time to
collect plenty of rocks and soil and bring them back in airtight
containers. One gram of that soil _ or regolith, as lunar dirt is
called _ has only now been put to a rigorous analysis, which has
revealed what may be a surprising new chapter in the history of the
solar system.
</P>
<P>
   The findings have even inspired speculation about another
possible extraterrestrial influence on the course of life on Earth.
Could an upsurge of meteorite bombardment have contributed to the
emergence of complex life forms with diverse anatomical designs?
The speculation is already drawing the fire of critics.
</P>
<P>
   By dating minute glass beads in lunar soil, melted debris from
the heat of asteroid and comet impacts, scientists at the
University of California at Berkeley and the Berkeley Geochronology
Center have made two discoveries, one expected and the other a big
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   The ages of many beads, the size of tiny peas or smaller,
confirmed the heavy meteorite bombardment of the moon from 4
billion to 3.5 billion years ago. This was a violent epoch in the
young solar system, which formed 4.5 billion years ago. Impacts of
asteroids and comets gouged out many of the larger lunar craters
and basins that remain virtually unchanged on the waterless,
airless moon.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists had not expected to find so many of the beads
with ages less than 400 million years old. After a relatively quiet
period of 3 billion years, they said, the inner solar system
appeared to erupt with another meteorite blitz, which continues
today. Earth, being larger than the moon, would presumably have
suffered even more impacts, though erosion and shifting crustal
plates would have erased most of the traces.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the findings in the current issue of the journal
Science, the Berkeley researchers concluded that the age data from
155 glass beads ``show that the crater production rate has not been
constant over the last 3 billion years, as had been generally
assumed.'' The data, they said, also provided evidence for a
striking increase in the cratering rate over the last 400 million
years.
</P>
<P>
   The research was conducted by Timothy S. Culler, a graduate
student at the University of California; his faculty adviser, Dr.
Richard A. Muller, a physicist, and Dr. Paul R. Penne, director of
the Berkeley Geochronology Center and a specialist in dating
technology. The ages of the impact-formed beads were determined by
a method of dating the decay of radioactive potassium to argon.
</P>
<P>
   Other scientists said they had confidence in the analytical
techniques used to date the beads. Dr. Graham Ryder of the Lunar
and Planetary Institute in Houston said the Berkeley researchers
``persuasively argue that there has been a substantial increase in
impacting in the earth-moon system'' in recent times. Some
geologists were concerned, however, that the soil sample, coming
from near the surface, might not be representative of impact
frequencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the sample is biased, then you could be drawing a totally
erroneous conclusion,'' Dr. Paul D. Spudis, a geologist at the
Lunar and Planetary Institute, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Renne said in response: ``We understand those things well. There
really is no uncertainty about the chronology we've put together.''
</P>
<P>
   But the sharpest criticism by geologists and paleontologists was
aimed at provocative remarks by the Berkeley scientists in the last
paragraph of their report. The data, they said, ``show an increase
in the cratering rate roughly coincident with the `Cambrian
explosion' of complex life on Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   While conceding that the bead ages were not specific enough to
support claims of a relationship to terrestrial life, the
scientists said ``the correlation is permissible evidence of a
causal relation.'' Their last sentence read: ``It is possible that
increased debris influx had a net stimulating effect on biotic
diversity, despite the occasional occurrence of large impacts with
destructive consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   A planetary geologist who spoke on condition of anonymity said
the speculation ``really came out of left field.'' For one thing,
the Cambrian explosion, the sudden rise of more diverse organisms
as preserved most famously in the Burgess shale of British
Columbia, started more than 500 million years ago. Nor is it clear,
paleontologists said, what life forms in what ecological niches
were destroyed by impacts at this time to clear the way for a new
epoch.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Muller said he was not arguing that there was a
connection, ``just noting that the impact increase happens to
coincide with the explosion of life.''
</P>
<P>
   The scientists said the more recent period of bombardment came
from relatively small objects, which have left few young large
craters on the moon. Their dating was not specific enough, they
said, to detect any upsurge in impacts at the time the dinosaurs
perished, presumably by an asteroid or comet impact 65 million
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Muller had the dinosaur extinction in mind when he proposed the
current research. In the 1980s, he proposed a controversial theory
that the sun has an unseen companion star, which he called Nemesis,
that orbits the Sun every 26 million years and periodically knocks
comets out of their orbits, sending them hurtling through the inner
solar system. This might, he said, explain the apparent
26-million-year cycles of widespread extinctions, including the one
that doomed the dinosaurs and cleared the way for mammals.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for evidence of increased impacts coinciding with those
extinctions, Muller had Culler examine glass beads collected by
Apollo 14 and other lunar missions to see if they reflected spurts
of objects crashing into the moon.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued by the University of California, Muller
said: ``The work opens up a new field that tells us something about
the history of our solar system that was totally unanticipated.
Until now, we did not realize how peculiar the past 500 million
years has been.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing an accompanying article in Science, Ryder of the Lunar
and Planetary Institute said there was now ``some fairly hard
evidence for the earlier tentative conclusion that cratering in the
earth-moon system has not been constant over the past 3 billion
years.''
</P>
<P>
   In that case, he concluded, there may be ``considerable
uncertainties in the absolute dating of other planetary surfaces,
such as Mars.'' Geologists have usually estimated these ages on the
abundance of craters left there by the steady bombardment of
asteroids and comets over time.

A BIG MAINTENANCE PROBLEM AT THE HMO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Minn.)   (Science Times)  
 (af)  
 By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The initials HMO stand for health maintenance organization, but
where, I'd like to know, is the ``health maintenance'' these
organizations are supposed to provide? Despite the extensive
reorganization of medical care that this country has witnessed in
recent years, the system remains penny-wise and pound-foolish. And
you, the consumer, are paying the price _ with your health as well
as through your pocket.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of negative publicity has been given to the fact that,
under so-called managed care, even people in need of urgent care
often have to take extreme measures before they get optimal
treatment or referral to an appropriate specialist. But not enough
attention has been paid to the failure of medical insurers to cover
the costs of keeping people healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Because we have long known that the best way to deal with an
illness is to prevent it and the second-best way is to detect it in
its infancy, it is time for consumers to start demanding that
managed care plans uniformly provide coverage for well-person
checkups, screening tests for early detection, programs to help
people shed unhealthy habits and more effective guidance for
dealing with chronic health problems.
</P>
<P>
   Under traditional medical policies, like major medical
insurance, doctors were routinely forced to lie on insurance forms,
claiming that their patients who saw them for health maintenance
had medical problems so that insurers would cover the cost of the
visits.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs, with their supposed emphasis on keeping people healthy to
keep medical care costs down, were supposed to put an end to all
that.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are many serious and potentially costly problems,
like alcohol abuse, overweight and undue stress, and habits like
smoking, inactivity and poor diet, the treatment of which are
rarely covered by managed care.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent report the Center for the Advancement of Health, a
nonprofit health care watchdog organization in Washington, pointed
out that ``although nearly half of the nation's premature deaths
are linked to such things as unhealthy diet, inactivity or
substance abuse, few managed care plans routinely use proven
strategies to help their enrollees change these behaviors.''
</P>
<P>
   More often than not, the center reported, health plans that do
offer some services to help members modify risky health behaviors
or better manage chronic health problems simply hand out pamphlets
or brochures, a tactic ``known to be ineffectual'' in helping
people make the needed changes in their living habits.
</P>
<P>
   The center based its conclusion on a survey of medical directors
of health maintenance organizations in five states and the District
of Columbia, interviews with public and private health care
purchasers and a review of the literature on the effectiveness of
behavior-change interventions within medical settings.
</P>
<P>
   Both the HMO survey and interviews with purchasers of health
care policies investigated to what extent coverage was provided for
services intended for reducing health risks _ like smoking
cessation, exercise programs, nutritional counseling and treatment
of substance abuse _ and for managing chronic diseases like asthma,
back pain, depression and diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   It is not that HMO medical directors are unaware of the
influence of people's living habits on their health. The report
found that most directors believe that health behaviors powerfully
influence health outcomes. In fact, studies have shown repeatedly
that modifiable health risks add significantly to the costs of
health care, accounting for as much as 70 percent of all medical
care spending.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the HMO directors were reluctant to include health behavior
interventions in their provided coverage in part because they were
uncertain about the cost impact of doing so, the center report
stated. Preventive efforts incur costs up-front, but their payoffs
may be many years down the line, further, apparently, than most
managed care plans are able to see.
</P>
<P>
   However, the costs of unhealthy behaviors are often incurred
short-term as well as long-term. For example, in December in The
Journal of the American Medical Association, Dr. Nicolaas P. Pronk
and colleagues at the HealthPartners Center for Health Promotion in
Minneapolis studied a random sample of 5,689 health plan enrollees
ages 40 or older to determine the short-term health care charges
related to physical inactivity, obesity and smoking.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   They found that smokers had 18 percent higher medical care
charges than people who never smoked, each unit of increase in body
mass index (a BMI between 19 and 25 is considered ``normal''
weight) raised medical charges by 1.9 percent and each day of
physical activity per week reduced medical charges by 4.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Neither are the purchasers of health care plans in the dark
about the role of health behaviors in preventing disease and
reducing complications from pre-existing illness. Most purchasers
interviewed by the center believed that ``the managed care plans
they contract with are responsible for health behavior change
services (and) those plans are already providing such services as
part of a comprehensive health benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   However, few purchasers actually negotiate with health plans for
coverage of specific behavior change services, the survey revealed.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it is time for those who sign health care contracts to
look more closely at the services that are actually provided,
especially those negotiating contracts for employees, who remain at
the mercy of unions and employers to provide health care coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps all concerned should heed the advice of the Minneapolis
researchers: ``Health plans and self-insured employers seeking to
maximize health return on each dollar spent for medical care may
wish to consider strategic investments in interventions that
effectively improve modifiable health risks. Primary prevention of
smoking and increased physical activity appear to have substantial
potential to reduce health care charges.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, what can the health-conscious consumer do? You might
try petitioning your health insurer to cover the cost of a needed
health maintenance service, like a program to quit smoking or, for
someone at risk of heart disease or diabetes, a consultation with a
dietitian and exercise physiologist.
</P>
<P>
   A woman I know who was dangerously obese and had failed
repeatedly at various weight-reduction efforts was initially told
by her insurer that surgery to treat her obesity would not be
covered because she had no obesity-related health problem. Her
response was, ``Why wait until I'm sick? Why not treat me now so
that I can stay healthy?''
</P>
<P>
   She voiced her plea to a hearing committee set up by the insurer
and the company decided to cover the cost of her surgery, which
over the course of a year resulted in the loss of 150 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   But let's say coverage for the service you seek is denied. It is
still in your best interest to pay for the services you need, even
if that means making other sacrifices to make ends meet. It is hard
to imagine what is more important than your health, because once
you lose your health, everything else in your life is in jeopardy
as well.

   AETNA _ Aetna's rejection of a $10 billion takeover offer from
WellPoint Health Networks and ING Group should hearten shareholders
and investors in Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Georgia. WellPoint
is scheduled to buy Blue Cross, but its offer for Aetna, because of
regulatory concerns, had imperiled that deal. Meanwhile, Aetna
shares fell as much as 16 percent after the WellPoint bid was

as investors returned to beaten-down blue chip stocks, while

after warning that its profit performance this quarter won't be as

   AETNA _ Aetna's rejection of a $10 billion takeover offer from
WellPoint Health Networks and ING Group should hearten shareholders
and investors in Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Georgia. WellPoint
is scheduled to buy Blue Cross, but its offer for Aetna, because of
regulatory concerns, had imperiled that deal. Meanwhile, Aetna
shares fell as much as 16 percent after the WellPoint bid was

   BKN-ELLIOTT14 _ SAN ANTONIO _ Sean Elliott knows there are those
who worry about whether he can stand up to the rigors of the NBA
after undergoing a kidney transplant. The San Antonio Spurs forward
knows that two factions he must count on the most, his coach and
some teammates, are among them. He also knows something they may
not. There was the kidney transplant recipient who was kicked by a
horse. Another who was gored by handlebars in a motorcycle wreck. A
third who played college football. They took their shots. Their
kidneys survived. Now, Elliott will add one more person to his
list: himself. Some time after 7:30 p.m. today, the San Antonio
Spurs' forward will become the first athlete in professional sports
to return from a kidney transplant. (Rosner, Austin

&HT;     THE GORE, BUSH BLAB CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W.
Bush have 34 more weeks to fill with mutual insults and assorted
accusations before we finally reach Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, dear. They may not get exhausted, but we certainly will. Ear
muffs, anyone?
</P>
<P>
   We already have heard a great deal of what they will say to each
other as they rehearsed their lines on their hapless primary
opponents. Both have made it clear they believe the end justifies
the means in this scrap. Anything goes, the nastier the better.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has repeated to Bush the offer he made to Democratic rival
Bill Bradley to hold twice-weekly debates; the catch is that it's
only a deal if the other guy agrees to abandon those 30-and
60-second attack commercials. Bradley didn't want to give up his
ads and he wasn't keen on too many debates with Gore, where he was
clearly outmatched.
</P>
<P>
   When Gore made his offer to Bradley, it was ridiculed as a
stunt, carrying the debate concept to extremes for his own selfish
purposes. Bush isn't about to take the bait any more than Bradley
did, for his own selfish reasons.
</P>
<P>
   This time the challenge isn't laughable; it is aggressive of
Gore to push debates and defensive of Bush to duck, conceding Gore
the stronger image. Debating about debates has a limited
public-interest shelf life, however.
</P>
<P>
   Previous sparring partners have discovered that debating Gore is
hard, uphill work and Bush is not yet ready. He may not be the dim
bulb he is portrayed, but his mental information retrieval bank on
both domestic and foreign affairs is not nearly as deep as Gore's.
Former GOP vice presidential nominee Jack Kemp, who proved
inadequate against a relentless Gore in their own 1996 debate,
advised Bush succinctly in a Sunday interview: ``Start preparing
right NOW.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter how much the news media like the idea of debates in
principle, two a week is too much of a good thing. That translates
into 68 debates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holy guacamole,'' as my grandson Michael likes to say. The
mind reels. How many insults and put-downs can they invent to fill
all that time?
</P>
<P>
   But those nasty, repetitive and expensive commercials are too
much of a bad thing, and any proposal to get rid of them should be
taken seriously. And that leads us into the issue of overhauling
the campaign finance laws and the soft money (the unregulated
donations to political parties and causes) that pays for most of
that advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gore and Bush have raised a lot of campaign money, although
Bush's $70 million so far takes the prize. Gore is now campaigning
to overhaul the money-raising system, even though for eight years
he willingly participated in it. Bush, who seeks more modest
changes in the fund-raising system, calls Gore hypocritical. Gore,
in turn, calls Bush a captive of his rich donors.
</P>
<P>
   Bush repeatedly raises Gore's visit to a Buddhist temple during
the 1996 campaign _ during which Democratic campaign funds were
improperly raised _ as an example of Gore's lack of ethics. Gore
insists he did not know the event was a fund-raiser and says he is
playing by the rules as they exist, just as Bush is.
</P>
<P>
   But this rapidly deteriorating argument is not all this campaign
is about. Pat Buchanan, clawing for political attention, contends
there are no basic policy differences between Gore and Bush; their
competition is a ``nothing-burger'' he says _ presumably all filler
and no beef. Buchanan, as usual, is wacky.
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty to argue about here, if they would just get to
it and stop the name-calling. The two men differ on most social
issues _ abortion, judicial appointments, the treatment of gays,
the validity of the Confederate flag, protecting the environment.
They differ on education _ more direct aid for public schools
versus tax-paid vouchers to subsidize private schools.
</P>
<P>
   They differ on the size, scope and direction of tax cuts _
whether to have large cuts that mostly help the wealthy or smaller
cuts that leave money to pay for Social Security and some new
domestic programs. They differ on the substance of health care
reforms. They differ on gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Where they disagree on foreign policy is still murky. The
subject doesn't come up much.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has already made some minor boo-boos on international
topics, revealing a governor's limited experience with such issues.
By contrast, Gore can be boring when he details his extensive
acquaintance with world leaders and their problems.
</P>
<P>
   But something will come up. It always does. China will thumb its
nose at us. North Korea will pull some stupid stunt. Kosovo will
deteriorate into full-scale warfare. Ireland will fall apart again.
Middle Eastern terrorists will strike. Russia will be Russia. The
candidates will be expected to understand the strategic
implications and respond accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   So there will be plenty to talk about, after all. But can we
please have a few moments of silence somewhere along the way to the
conventions?

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: No compromise on attacks
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trying to grab the fund-raising reform issue for the general
election, George W. Bush and Al Gore accused each other of
compromising for campaign cash. ``This guy will say anything to get
elected,'' Bush told high school students in Metairie, La., on
Monday. He said ``It's going to be a heck of a challenge'' to run
against such a foe but that he hoped ``the American people will see
through all the rhetoric.'' Gore was visiting a Miami-area hospital
Monday, repeating charges that Bush cares nothing for expanding
access to health insurance because it's not a priority for his
campaign financiers. Later Monday, Gore flew to Nashville, Tenn.,
to vote for himself in Tuesday's Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
   MORE SNIPING OVER GUNS
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore, citing a ``sickness'' at the heart of the gun lobby,
blasted the NRA Monday and demanded an apology from executive
director Wayne LaPierre. A day earlier, LaPierre said President
Clinton is ``willing to accept a certain level of killing to
further his political agenda _ and the vice president, too.''
</P>
<P>
   BUT IT'S GOOD PRACTICE IN VOTING
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's Southern primaries were supposed to be the Southern
Super Tuesday, the day when the South muscled its way into the
primary calendar and showed itself as a fearsome voting bloc. But
Mike Francis now has a somewhat different name for it. ``I call it
Stupid Tuesday,'' said Francis, chairman of Louisiana's Republican
Party. ``The taxpayers of Louisiana are going to spend about $4
million so that maybe 40,000 people can show up to vote in a
meaningless primary. Isn't that ridiculous?''
</P>
<P>
   `FRESH, NEW,' AND NOT MUCH OF A CHANCE
</P>
<P>
   Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan said Monday that George W.
Bush hasn't shown the ``depth or capacity'' to be president and Al
Gore is marred by improper fund-raising in 1996. Buchanan said he
would be a ``fresh, new'' alternative for voters. Buchanan said he
could appeal to John McCain's voters who want an anti-establishment
candidate. Interviewed on NBC, Buchanan predicted the race would
look this way: ``Bush: same old, same old. Gore: same old, same
old. Reform Party: fresh, new.''
</P>
<P>
   MAYBE NOT THE BEST WAY TO GAIN SUPPORT
</P>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan hopes to pick up supporters from John McCain's
suspended GOP campaign, but won't back away from his strong
anti-abortion stance or his call for a ``cultural war.'' Such
positions are at odds with most of the Reform Party's members and
also unlikely to appeal to the independents, moderate Republicans
and Democrats who supported McCain. Ex-party Chairman Russell
Verney, a top aide to party founder Ross Perot, said, ``The
majority would be best described as secular. They don't want the
government to take a position on those issues.''
</P>
<P>
   PATAKI READY TO LOOSEN THINGS UP
</P>
<P>
   Stung by accusations that he had tried to stack the deck in New
York's primary for George W. Bush, Gov. George Pataki is proposing
a more open primary next time around. Pataki's proposal, announced
Monday, would allow all nationally recognized Republican
presidential candidates onto the New York ballot and make the
state's primary a winner-take-all contest for the party. New York
Republicans also would get to vote directly for the candidates, not
for delegates as is currently the rule.
</P>
<P>
   DON'T QUOTE HIM ON THAT ONE
</P>
<P>
   With exit polls from the early primaries showing that some
voters are concerned about whether George W. Bush has the
intellectual heft they believe is required of a president, Al Gore
returned repeatedly to versions of the same refrain: ``Does
Governor Bush have the kind of decision-making tests under his belt
to be president?' ... the experience? ... the sense of
perspective?'' Asked in an interview with The Associated Press if
he wasn't really trying to say Bush is ``too dumb'' to be
president, Gore convulsed in laughter while taking a drink of Diet
Coke. He grabbed a towel to hold against his mouth then, finally
swallowing, insisted the tape recorder be stopped for an
off-the-record observation.
</P>
<P>
   NEW PARLOR GAME: PICK THE RUNNING MATES
</P>
<P>
   Reporters for several media outlets are discussing possible vice
presidential candidates. For Republicans, the list includes Sen.
Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, who backed John McCain in the primary
season; Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania; Elizabeth Dole, the former
Cabinet member and presidential candidate; Sen. Fred Thompson of
Tennessee, a supporter of government reform; and Dick Cheney, a
former Defense secretary. On the Democratic list were ex-Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin, an articulate economics expert; Gov. Gray
Davis of California; and Sens. Dianne Feinstein of California, Evan
Bayh of Indiana and Bob Graham of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   LOW TURNOUT, MORE DELEGATES FOR GORE
</P>
<P>
   A smaller-than-expected turnout of about 11,000 people at the
first Democratic weekend caucuses in Minnesota gave Al Gore a near
sweep in a binding presidential poll. Gore also was expected to
pick up all 20 delegates at stake after a resounding victory Sunday
at caucuses in Nevada where there were even fewer voters. With 14
of 17 counties reporting in Nevada, Gore led 92 percent to 8
percent over Bill Bradley. State Chairman Rory Reid noted that
there was no chance Bradley would get the necessary 15 percent in
either of Nevada's two congressional districts to win any
delegates. More than 1,000 Nevada Democrats voted Sunday, up from
about 600 four years ago, Reid said.
</P>
<P>
   RUNNING AGAINST BOB JONES U.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, eager to regain control of Congress, are trying to
tie Republicans to Bob Jones University, the fundamentalist
Christian university in Greenville, S.C. In the Senate, Democrats
pushed a resolution condemning the school, while in the House, the
party's fund-raising arm distributed a memorandum on Bob Jones'
policies and urged candidates to use it to attack Republicans.
Until earlier this month, the school had anti-Catholic statements
on its Web site and forbade interracial dating.
</P>
<P>
   VOTE OF CONFIDENCE FOR INTERNET BALLOTING
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's first-of-its-kind Internet election showed online
voting can work with a relatively small population. The question
now is whether it can succeed with much larger groups. One way or
the other, critics and supporters agree that eventually most
Americans will have the option of voting by clicking a computer
mouse. The primary drew about 78,000 ballots, doubling the state's
previous turnout record. ``We opened up the gates today to people
who might not otherwise have voted,'' state Rep. Leah Landrum said
at a victory party for the Internet voting that ended Saturday.
``This is something I know is going to stick around.''
</P>
<P>
   EVERYTHING IN MODERATION
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman says the GOP must convince
voters that the extreme right wing of the Republican Party doesn't
represent the whole. ``The reality for us is we have to convince
enough of the American people, especially those who are in the
center, that our party shares their concerns and shares their
ideas,'' she told the Republican Leadership Council. Whitman
accused Democrats of portraying the party as one that has forgotten
its roots. ``That's what Al Gore and the Democrats want to do ...
persuade people that the Republican Party has left them,'' she
said. ``This year our biggest challenge is to make sure this tactic
doesn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   DEMONSTRATIONS IN CHAPPAQUA
</P>
<P>
   Two dozen protesters chanting ``Israel yes, Hillary no,''
demonstrated in Hillary Clinton's new neighborhood in Chappaqua,
N.Y., but roughly 40 police officers kept them away from the
Clinton home and she was in Washington. The protesters denounced
the first lady's support for the current Mideast peace process, and
claimed she was against freeing Israeli spy Jonathan Pollard. The
protesters were from groups including Kach and Kahane Chai, said
Michael Guzofsky, a protest organizer. Both groups are on the State
Department's list of terrorist organizations.
</P>
<P>
   SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton and Rudy Giuliani met face-to-face for the first
time since she began campaigning in New York more than a year ago.
Both were roasted at an Inner Circle spoof on New York politics
staged by political reporters Saturday night. The annual show is
renowned for its rollicking tastelessness. Many jokes, some of them
crude, were made at Clinton's expense, but the Washington Post
reported that she proved she could take a hit. Giuliani put on some
disco moves in a white suit, then dressed in drag for a skit titled
``Rudy/Rudia.'' The two candidates shook hands and exchanged
pleasantries.

<P>
   The acquisition of The Los Angeles Times by the Tribune Co.
(price: $6.38 billion) may or may not damage the paper's editorial
quality. But it's certainly a historic humiliation for Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, when the L.A. Times _ despite a certain stuffiness
_ came into its own, it became a significant point of civic pride
for Angelenos to say that Los Angeles stood alongside New York City
(home of The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal) and
Washington, D.C. (home of The Washington Post) as one of the
nation's three preeminent newspaper cities. It was another way of
saying that Los Angeles was one of the three most important cities,
period.
</P>
<P>
   And since Washington, D.C., is a special case, this really made
Los Angeles the nation's ``second city,'' not merely in population
but also in cultural influence. Take that, Chicago!
</P>
<P>
   As a teen-ager in Beverly Hills during this period, I recall
being bombarded at school almost daily with the message that Los
Angeles, having eclipsed Philadelphia and Chicago, would soon
overtake New York City as the Most Important City in America _ this
was, remember, the decade when New York City was broke,
crime-ridden, and seemingly in irreversible decline
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles' high-culture ambitions were bracketed by
construction of the downtown Music Center (built largely by L.A.
Times matriarch Dorothy Chandler) and Malibu's J. Paul Getty
Museum, a monstrosity built to resemble a Roman villa that later
would be replaced by the handsome Getty Center.
</P>
<P>
   The city's pop-culture ambitions had long since been realized by
the movie, TV, and recording industries. Its aerospace industry,
fueled by the ever-expanding Cold War Pentagon budget, kept the
regional unemployment rate at negligible levels.
</P>
<P>
   Northern California, which everyone agreed was more charming
than Southern California, had no non-agricultural economy (this was
before the advent of Silicon Valley), lousy newspapers (the San
Jose Mercury News hadn't yet taken off), and surprisingly little
cultural ferment going on behind those brightly colored Victorian
facades.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles was the cradle of a new civilization! Hey, even Will
and Ariel Durant lived there! The L.A. Times was an important tool
in this manifest destiny. As Times-Mirror, its parent company,
acquired Newsday, the Baltimore Sun (H.L. Mencken's paper!), and
The Hartford Courant, word began to spread that Los Angeles was
taking over the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, Los Angeles is being recolonized by the same
uncouth prairie-dwellers who populated it in the early part of the
20th century. The Rust Belt has purchased Times-Mirror! Even in an
age when newspapers don't have the clout they once did, that
stings.
</P>
<P>
   As the L.A. Times' account of the merger points out, it also
means that Atlantic Richfield Co. remains the only Fortune 500
company headquartered in downtown Los Angeles _ and Arco, if the
feds allow it, will soon be acquired by BP Amoco. Who's the second
city now?

   UNDATED _ Proverbs 22:6 says, ``Train a child in the way he
should go and when he is old he will not turn from it.'' I read an
interesting twist on that proverb recently in my study Bible and it
went something like this: ``Train a child in the way he should go _
and go there yourself once in a while.'' If you are wondering how
to have a moral and lasting effect on your children, that in
essence is the sum of God's advice to us. It is up to us to accept
it and apply it to our lives. By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES. Story has

against these icons. But not unfair to bear in mind that the office
itself deserves greatness. By JIM WRIGHT. Story has moved in ``k''

EMOTIONAL MARINO TAKES A PASS ON FOOTBALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVIE, Fla. _ In a speech marked by long pauses, deep sighs, and
throat clearing, Dan Marino announced his retirement from football
Monday at the Miami Dolphins' training facility. Marino struggled
to keep his emotions in check as he read a statement and then
answered questions in a somber auditorium filled with more than 200
reporters, family, friends, and former Dolphins. He called the
choice to retire without changing uniforms and without a Super Bowl
ring ``a family and a health decision.''
</P>
<P>
   As the most prolific passer in NFL history reflected on the
``huge loss'' he felt leaving the league after 17 record-setting
years, his face fell into a stoic grimace. He paused, pursed his
lips, puffed out his cheeks, and waited for the swell of emotion to
pass before continuing. Marino did not shed any tears, but took his
time and chose his words carefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 17 years, I would like to announce my retirement from
the Miami Dolphins,'' said Marino, who has no immediate plans for
his post-football life but is considering many options, including
business opportunities and television. ``After playing the game of
football most of my life, this was an extremely difficult decision.
But I know that I have made the right decision for me and my
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very proud of the success that we have had as a team for
17 years as well as all my individual accomplishments. Not many
people have the opportunity to spend 17 years of their life doing
what they truly love to do. And as I stand here before you today, I
can say that I have been blessed with a career greater than I could
have imagined.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite strained relations in recent weeks between Marino and
the Dolphins, the quarterback's retirement was intended to be a
celebratory affair. Marino had received mixed signals about how
warmly the organization would welcome him back for another season.
Conspicuously absent from Marino's lengthy list of thank yous _
which included everyone from the video man to Don Shula _ was
former Miami coach Jimmy Johnson. Marino acknowledged that he
``wasn't very happy here'' while Johnson was coaching.
</P>
<P>
   But Dolphins owner Wayne Huizenga, taking the podium after
Marino, left no doubt about how much Marino meant to the
organization. Huizenga immediately retired Marino's No. 13 and
announced plans to induct Marino into the Dolphin honor roll at the
first regular-season home game, name a street after Marino at the
stadium, and erect a statue of the quarterback outside the stadium.
The tributes brought a smile to Marino's face, but they could not
erase the bittersweet feelings the occasion evoked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad for me, but I'm happy for him because he was able to
go out on his terms,'' said former Dolphins wide receiver Mark
Clayton, who caught more Marino touchdown passes than anyone else.
``I just happy to have had the opportunity to catch a pass from my
man.''
</P>
<P>
   The last passer selected in the heralded quarterback class of
1983 at No. 27, Marino was the last to retire. And he left the game
holding 25 NFL records outright and sharing five others. Marino
stands atop the list for passing yardage at 61,361 _ outdistancing
John Elway by almost 10,000 _ including a record 5,084 in 1984. He
passed for a record 420 touchdowns, including an almost
unfathomable 48 in 1984. He also leads the NFL in career pass
attempts (8,358) and completions (4,967).
</P>
<P>
   ``From the time in mini-camp when we first got Dan down here and
standing side-to-side with our other quarterbacks, it was just so
evident that he was something special,'' said Shula, Marino's first
coach in Miami. ``He had that great year in '84, which is the year
with the records that may never be broken. It's hard to say never,
but the 48 touchdown should hold up. (There was) the Super Bowl
that year, the great career and the feeling you were never out of a
ballgame with Dan Marino as your quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that he's made this decision, I'm supporting it. I think
that this is a celebration of a great career, that's how I think
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   As impressive as Marino's numbers are, the lack of a
championship ring remained an issue until his very last day as a
Dolphin. The quarterback said the only reason to continue playing
would have been the chance to win a Super Bowl. A shot at a ring
was also the reason he seriously entertained the thought of playing
for the Minnesota Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the burning desire,'' said Marino. ``I think that I
wanted to know what it felt like as a player to win a Super Bowl,
and any time you have a chance maybe to get that, you are going to
want to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Marino took great pride in the fact that he played
his entire career for the Dolphins. And the absence of a
championship ring will not diminish what the quarterback achieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a moment, you get caught up in that you won't see Dan
Marino on Sundays,'' said former Dolphin and Hall of Fame center
Dwight Stephenson. ``But then, you look at the positive side and
that's what Dan will do. Time to do something else. Whatever he
does, I'm sure it's going to be exciting.''

BARAK'S BELEAGUERED COALITION SURVIVES FOR ANOTHER DAY
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ For the first time, poetry _ Palestinian poetry, no
less _ was used Monday to try to topple an Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
   But scores of other subjects, small and large, have been
employed as potential vehicles of dethronement. In Israel's
turbulent democratic system, where there is no such thing as an
argument without talk of divorce, parliamentary motions of no
confidence in the government are becoming more and more routine.
</P>
<P>
   Monday alone, the parliament debated two motions of no
confidence in Prime Minister Ehud Barak, one from the right and the
other from the left.
</P>
<P>
   A third was withdrawn from the floor at the last moment.
</P>
<P>
   Both motions failed, and Barak, who is facing frustration on
several fronts _ in his peacemaking efforts, the police
investigation of his election campaign and the instability in his
coalition _ remained in power. The results were not surprising
because it would have taken a two-thirds vote, or 80 out of 120
votes, for the lawmakers to remove Barak and stay in office
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But Barak's beleaguered government endured what is becoming an
institutionalized part of the parliamentary theatrics here. It
withstood hours of verbal battering by those who choose the extreme
vehicle of seeking to bring down the government in order to seize
the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Eroding the government's authority is a side benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty dull tool, emptied of significance by overuse,
like crying wolf,'' said Yaron Ezrahi, a political scientist at
Hebrew University. ``But it's better than a regular vote because
it's a more dramatic parliamentary gesture. The media carry it.
People are tense, attentive. There is horse-trading involved. And
while it cannot really destroy a government, it can hurt it.''
</P>
<P>
   The opposition Likud Party argued Monday that a decision to
include five works of a nationalist Palestinian poet in the
literature curriculum for Israeli high school students was grounds
enough to declare no confidence in the government.
</P>
<P>
   Mahmoud Darwish, 58, the poet, who has written 25 volumes of
verse, received unexpected exposure in an unlikely forum. He was
the object of a raging literary criticism session in the
flat-roofed bastion of Zionism that is the parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Having perused his works, right-wing lawmakers cited verses of
his that they found inflammatory and violently anti-Zionist. And
one Labor Party legislator, Colette Avital, gave a tender reading _
in Hebrew _ of a lyrical and seemingly apolitical poem that began,
``A woman I am, no more, no less.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, addressing her colleagues, Avital said: ``Will this be an
open, pluralistic, democratic society while respecting different
traditions? Or will we keep ourselves locked up within the confines
of a kind of spiritual and intellectual ghetto? Is Darwish, whom we
have so successfully made famous because of this debate, such a
threat to our strength?''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, answered, Uzi Landau, speaking for the Likud Party. ``If
you want to teach Darwish,'' Landau said, ``show him to be one who
demonizes us, but do not legitimize him. We are legitimizing our
own delegitimization.''
</P>
<P>
   Yossi Sarid, the leftist education minister, who modified the
curriculum to include several new writers, denounced ``the way that
every public debate deteriorates into a vote of no confidence,''
and said he never imagined a few poems would provoke such
``hysteria.''
</P>
<P>
   The first motion lost, 42-48. But it was supported by all the
members _ though not the ministers _ of the rigorously Orthodox
Shas party, which is the most problematic of three balky partners
in Barak's six-party coalition. The National Religious Party
members also voted against the government in which they sit, and
Yisrael Baaliyah, the Russian immigrant party, walked out before
the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Likud Party officials are starting to strategize effectively for
the first time since they moved into the opposition with Barak's
election. They are pushing votes on issues that Shas, the National
Religious Party and Yisrael Baaliya cannot support without
alienating their members.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, Israelis have cast separate ballots to select their
prime minister and their parliamentary representatives. A motion of
no confidence that passed by an absolute majority of 61 votes would
dissolve the entire government, forcing both lawmakers and the
prime minister to go to new elections. But unless the political
scenario is dire, few lawmakers choose that route and the bar for
removing just the prime minister remains high.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Shas was specifically voting against Sarid, the
education minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked for a connection between Darwish and Sarid and found
that their names are comprised of the same letters'' in Hebrew,
said Nissim Zeev, a Shas lawmaker, reflecting the mysticism that
many in the party attach to numbers and letters.
</P>
<P>
   Shas leaders and Sarid have been engaged in an intense battle
over the financing, management and curriculum of the parochial
schools that are the center of Shas' &UR;  &LR; growing power base among
Israel's poor and working-class Jews of Middle Eastern origin.
</P>
<P>
   But Shas, as it frequently has, was also demonstrating once more
that it considers itself a free agent. Shas' 17 votes, which the
prime minister wants desperately to back his peace efforts, can
swing for him or against him, its leaders have said repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   As if to demonstrate what would await Barak if Shas were to bolt
his coalition, the Communist Party, which mostly represents Israeli
Arabs, offered its own motion of no confidence. If Barak were to
alter his coalition or lose the three balky parties, he would be
forced to rely on the Israeli Arab parties. But they, too, as
indicated Monday, have a price.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Arab lawmakers said the government does not care about
the disparity in the way that Jewish and Arab convicts are treated.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a Jewish settler sentenced to life imprisonment for
an execution-style killing of a Palestinian terror suspect was
given parole after seven years in jail. The decision highlighted
the more lenient way that the Israeli legal system treats Jews who
have committed nationalist murders.
</P>
<P>
   After the votes, Barak rose from his seat in the parliament with
a tight, tired smile. Later, brushing off the hours of incendiary
debate, Barak said, ``Nothing that occurs in the parliament can
move this government from the mission that was imposed on it by the
nation of Israel.''

 &HT;    SCIENCE/HEALTH: Trust intuition, love over latest medical trend
 &HT;    By Paul Reid
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ It's been seven months since my mother's
doctor said it was time to make the feeding tube decision.
</P>
<P>
   Feeding tube. An ugly phrase sure to take away your appetite.
Roll it around on your tongue, practice it. Ponder its
implications. There is a feeding tube in your future, one way or
another. Be prepared. You'll be learning lessons in pathology,
medical ethics, the law, nutrition, theology and metaphysics.
</P>
<P>
   My mother's muscles, including those in her throat, are
contorted and spasmodic with Parkinson's disease. Sometimes she
can't swallow.
</P>
<P>
   She is almost 90, so there's more, of course. Her short-term
memory loss is now total. Her vital signs are just fine, but her
dementia has removed her, for the most part, from this world. She
is prone to infections. The good news? She can't move, so she won't
be breaking a hip.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this were my mother,'' her doctor said last year, ``I would
not insert a feeding tube.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, my mother was hospitalized, fighting numerous
infections, any one of which could kill her. She had a high fever
and was delirious on top of everything else. Something was going to
give. It looked like the end to us. It looked like the end to her
doctor.
</P>
<P>
   He had just taken over her care from a doctor who taught us the
first lesson: When in doubt, get answers. If you don't get answers,
get a new doctor.
</P>
<P>
   My mother's new doctor was attentive, perceptive and intuitive
(very important). He's a humanist and a scientist, too. Which is a
good thing, because he inherited a patient with enough untreated
ailments to fill a ward.
</P>
<P>
   So the stage was set. My mother was virtually comatose, perhaps
in the final stages of her dementia and Parkinson's. And we _ my
brother, sister and I _ agreed with her physician's feeding tube
philosophy. No extraordinary or artificial measures.
</P>
<P>
   But my mother had not signed a living will, so her doctor wanted
_ needed _ complete agreement on our part. Second lesson: Sign
living wills when everybody is competent. Don't wait. Your sick
mother may nod, yes, she wants to go to heaven. But does she mean
today? And are you prepared to send her?
</P>
<P>
   MEDICAL JOURNALS WEIGH IN
</P>
<P>
   Just to make all of us family members feel more comfortable with
our momentous decision, medical literature was slamming feeding
tubes. The New England Journal of Medicine finally said what
doctors have known for years: Feeding tubes do not improve life for
comatose patients and the elderly in the final phase of dementia _
a terminal disease. They can cause infections and can be painful.
But not in all cases. They're overused in nursing homes, where
overworked staff save management time, money and possible lawsuits
by routinely hooking up patients to feeding tubes.
</P>
<P>
   So, our decision was simple. On the surface. We assumed we would
be called upon to veto the feeding tube, officially, within hours
or days.
</P>
<P>
   But then the doctor made a final suggestion: Let your mother's
live-in nurse take your mother home if we get the infections under
control. Maybe the infections are clouding the issue, he said. If
we can get her eating again, make her comfortable, maybe we can
stop the IV lines and get her back to a level where, possibly, she
can enjoy a limited but meaningful life. The doctor was skeptical
of his own plan, but it offered my mother a long shot, and if it
didn't work out, well, we all would have done the best we could.
</P>
<P>
   Now, here's the key to this story: My mother's live-in caregiver
and the women who fill in for her on occasion are extraordinary
women. The main caregiver _ and some glowing ember of my mother's
fiery will _ wrought a remarkable change. This woman brought my
mother back with a spoonful of mush at a time. A thimble of water
at a time, given slowly and with infinite patience. My mother's
infections are gone. Fever, gone. A change of Parkinson's
medications made for fewer problems swallowing. Within a week of
going home, my mother regained her previous state of awareness,
which isn't much.
</P>
<P>
   There's wasn't a lot of Mom left, but there was still some Mom
in Mom. More than the doctor had thought.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't often recognize her children, but then again,
sometimes she does.
</P>
<P>
   When I brought her flowers from my garden, she leaned over to
drink in the aroma. ``Nice,'' she said. ``Bring more.''
</P>
<P>
   When I asked her if she was Italian or Irish, she threw me a
hard look, as if I were the foggy one, and said, ``Irish. My
parents were Mike and Mary Quinn, from Galway.''
</P>
<P>
   When I tell her she's so small she wouldn't stand a chance
against me in a boxing match, she says, ``Try me.''
</P>
<P>
   When I brought my children to see her at Christmas, she knew
them all.
</P>
<P>
   Her doctor was surprised, incredulous actually. ``I didn't know
how strong she was,'' he said. ``And I didn't know of the
incredible power of the women who are caring for your mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, her doctor changed his mind and advised the
insertion of a feeding tube, to be used on those occasions when my
mother can't swallow. Her feeding tube is not extraordinary life
support, not a futile gesture to sustain a life already lost. Third
lesson: All feeding tubes are not the same. The medical journals
didn't present their findings in black and white, but some press
accounts paraphrased away the gray areas. Do your homework, as Mom
used to say. Read the primary sources.
</P>
<P>
   QUALITY OF CARE IS CRUCIAL
</P>
<P>
   The cost of her home care will deplete my mother's modest
estate, but it's my mother's money, no? And, my brother the tycoon
makes up the shortfall each month, to the tune of many thousands of
dollars each year. But not everyone has a tycoon for a son, or a
live-in nurse from central casting, or a wise and contemplative
doctor. Fourth lesson: Quality of life is wrapped up in quality of
care.
</P>
<P>
   My mother's quality of life? Diminished, to say the least. But
it's her diminished life. Whatever dreams she dreams are hers. Her
memories, visions, no matter how clouded they seem, are hers. She's
not in pain; her vital signs are good.
</P>
<P>
   Her dementia will get my mother some day. A clot, a final
hideous infection, kidney or liver failure. Something. No amount of
care or money can change the final chapter. She will cross a
boundary into a region of near-death where feeding tubes may well
have no place. But she's not there yet.
</P>
<P>
   Thing is, had we gone with the new conventional wisdom on
feeding tubes, she'd already be there and gone.

 &HT;    Once and again, `NYPD Blue' is red hot in ratings
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. _ Danny Sorensen is a fidgety,
night-sweating mess, burdened by some secret in his past. Lt. Fancy
is reaching out to a fellow African-American officer who's burning
out big time. The new guy, Detective Baldwin Jones, has brought an
urbane and brooding presence to the 15th Precinct house, as well as
a willingness to doff his shirt on camera.
</P>
<P>
   And fans of ``NYPD'' have been glomming on to each new episode
like a snitch on a C-note. The cop show's audience has increased
more than 10 percent this season _ from 14.4 million viewers last
season to 16.2 million _ almost unheard of for the seventh season
of a TV drama.
</P>
<P>
   You could argue that it's been the compelling story-telling
(Jimmy who?). But it hasn't hurt that ABC delayed the season
premiere of ``Blue'' until January and is in the middle of running
22 straight episodes through the end of May, without a single rerun
or pre-emption.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years we've fielded hundreds of letters and phone calls
from people p---ed off at the erratic scheduling of `NYPD,''' said
Steven Bochco, ``Blue's'' co-creator. ``It's on for two weeks, it's
off for three weeks, it's on for four weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   The rerun-free run is ``a big plus for our viewers, and it
really galvanized our audience.''
</P>
<P>
   At 56, Bochco is an elder statesman of TV producers (he gave
David E. Kelley his first job in television back in the 1980s), who
still wears jeans and denim shirts around the office and puts on a
tie only when he has to. He's the antithesis of a network suit,
even though he almost became one. In 1987 he was offered the
presidency of CBS, but he decided to go on being a producer.
</P>
<P>
   Time for reinvention
</P>
<P>
   Bochco has been a constant critic of the way the networks
continue to do business, both in their outmoded economic models and
in their aversion to risk. One of his messages is that networks are
losing their audience because they won't try edgy, adult programs
such as HBO's ``The Sopranos'' and ``Sex and the City.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to sit on the sidelines. If I were running a network
today, I certainly wouldn't have only `The Sopranos' and `Sex and
the City' and `NYPD Blue.' But I certainly would insist on making
room for that kind of program.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at so much of what is on television, so much of
it isn't very good that it's hard to justify leaving it on. If we
don't get serious and change our game, we're going to be left in
the dust,'' he warned. ``We ought to be reinventing the medium.''
</P>
<P>
   Just don't reinvent it at the expense of one of his shows. The
reason ABC waited until January to go ``Blue'' was that it was
keeping the new drama ``Once and Again'' in ``Blue's'' home, 10
p.m. Tuesdays, and was even considering booting ``Blue'' to another
slot completely. That sign of disrespect made Bochco go ballistic,
and months later it still rankles him.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the move worked for ``Blue,'' still the most grown-up show
on network television in terms of realistic street language and
partial nudity. When it debuted in 1993, advertisers rebelled
against the profanity, and ABC was nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to put something on network TV the likes of which
you could only see on cable. We had no net,'' Bochco recalled
recently on the 20th Century Fox lot, sitting in his office at the
production company he owns. ``If for some reason people hadn't
tuned in, that show would have been gone instantly, in three
weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``NYPD'' racked up Emmy Awards and became a Top 20 show;
advertisers line up to get on. What it didn't do, however, was open
up network dramas to more adult content, the way many predicted it
might if it was successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really see what's changed, and I'm surprised at
that,'' Bochco said. ``To me, `NYPD Blue' exists in its own little
world. I don't know that it's opened up any floodgates.''
</P>
<P>
   Bochco's other show, ``City of Angels'' (8 p.m. Wednesdays on
CBS), hasn't fared as well. A hospital drama with a predominantly
black cast and writing staff, it launched in January with a huge
buildup as the ``great black hope'' of prime-time television. But
it has sunk to 89th in the Nielsen rankings, averaging an
unimpressive 8.8 million viewers a week.
</P>
<P>
   The show is getting a face-lift to try to appeal to more
viewers. The lighting is brighter, the gospel music on the
soundtrack has given way to more modern music, and stories are
being punched up.
</P>
<P>
   Even failures are interesting
</P>
<P>
   Bochco is no come-lately to writing about African-Americans. One
of his pre-``Hill Street'' shows was ``Paris,'' a short-lived ABC
series that starred James Earl Jones as a criminologist. And Henry
Simmons has brought a smoldering presence and strong black
consciousness to ``NYPD'' as Baldwin Jones. In a throwaway line
several weeks ago, he quietly explained that he was named after
writer James Baldwin.
</P>
<P>
   Inside Steven Bochco Productions, the producer's private office
is dominated by a large, disturbing painting by Joel Pace titled
``Falling,'' inspired by a James Dickey poem about a stewardess
sucked out of an airplane door; it shows a woman in midair free
fall, her clothes being sucked off by the friction. On a window
seat is a large, stuffed collie, one of Lassie's late stand-ins.
</P>
<P>
   ``It freaks actors out when they come in,'' Bochco explained,
referring to the dog, not the painting.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Bochco Productions is as proud of its failures, though,
as it is of its hits. In the large, open foyer, there are big
advertising banners for ``Cop Rock,'' the 1990 experiment at
blending ``Hill Street Blues'' with musical theater, and ``Murder
One,'' the post-O.J. drama that followed one murder case for an
entire season.
</P>
<P>
   ``His failures are as interesting as his successes,'' said David
Marc, author of ``Prime Time, Prime Movers.'' That's an accolade
``usually reserved for great novelists and European film directors,
but almost never for TV producers.''

TAIWAN STOCK MARKET IS SHAKEN BY ELECTION FEARS  
(HLW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds., this story moved earlier as CHINA-TAIWAN; repeating now to
correct slug; no other changes. Related CHINA-TAIWAN, by Eckholm,
will move shortly.)   By MARK LANDLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Fears that Taiwan's governing Nationalist Party may
lose next Saturday's closely fought presidential election surged
through the Taipei stock market Monday, causing its largest
single-day point loss in its history and the largest percentage
decline in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Taipei's main stock index plummeted 617 points, or 6.6 percent,
to 8,811.95 in a panicky session described as driven almost
entirely by politics. Analysts said investors were worried that a
victory by the Democratic Progressive Party candidate, Chen
Shui-bian, would inflame relations between Taiwan and China.
</P>
<P>
   China has sharply criticized Chen for advocating independence
for Taiwan, which it views as a renegade province. Chen's party
formally favors an independent Taiwan, though he has pledged not to
declare independence if elected.
</P>
<P>
   The three main candidates to succeed President Lee Teng-hui _
Chen, Vice President Lien Chan of the Nationalist Party, and James
Soong, an independent _ are running neck and neck in the most
competitive presidential race ever seen here. But Chen seems to be
gaining momentum at the expense of Lien.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's law bans the publication of opinion polls in the final
two weeks of the campaign, though, which means that statistical
predictions have been replaced by anecdotal evidence, hunches, and
pure speculation.
</P>
<P>
   Chen received endorsements over the weekend from three
influential corporate leaders and one of Taiwan's most eminent
academics, Lee Yuan-tseh. Lee, a Nobel-Prize-winning chemist,
offered to resign as president of a top research institute to serve
as an adviser to Chen.
</P>
<P>
   Chen also drew an estimated 400,000 people to a rally in
Kao-hsiung, a southern port city that is a stronghold of the
Democratic Progressive Party. The rally, the largest and most
raucous of the campaign so far, impressed political oddsmakers with
its organization and fervor.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Chen Shui-bian wins the election, there is likely to be a
period of volatility because of the uncertainty about Taiwan's
policies toward China,'' said Dong Tao, a regional analyst at
Credit Suisse First Boston. ``There would also be uncertainty about
how to deal with the Nationalist Party.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in Taipei last week, Chen contended that the
Nationalist Party was playing the ``China terror card'' _ warning
that a Chen victory would wreak havoc on the stock market and the
economy. Monday, Chen and several market analysts said they believe
that the Nationalists ordered government-related funds to sell
their shares to deepen the market decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is heartbreaking and regrettable to see the Nationalists
ignoring the interests of civilians and stock investors,'' Chen
said at a rally near Taipei.
</P>
<P>
   The Nationalists denied that they orchestrated the selloff. And
they contended that legislators from the Democratic Progressive
Party had held up the approval of a $16.3 billion ``stabilization
fund,'' which the government could have used to protect the market
from just this kind of politically driven panic.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of a gyrating stock market on the vote is
unpredictable, though analysts believe that instability generally
helps the Nationalist Party, since it represents the status-quo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The party is taking a risk here,'' said one market analyst.
``Instead of pushing up the market to please voters, they're
saying, `If you don't vote for us, this is the danger.'''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Whatever Chen's concrete support, there is no question that his
campaign is generating more attention in the closing days than
those of either of his rivals. The endorsements from Lee Yuan-tseh
and the business executives are important because they lend weight
to a candidate whose support is seen as coming mostly from younger
voters and from native Taiwanese, like Chen himself, instead of the
mainlanders who fled to Taiwan after the Communists gained control
of the mainland in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   The three executives _ Stan Shih of Acer Computer, Chang
Rong-far of Evergreen Group, and Hsu Wen-lung of Chi Mei Industry _
are also native Taiwanese. But collectively, they represent the
industrial elite.
</P>
<P>
   They also have close ties to Lee Teng-hui, whom analysts say has
tepid feelings for his vice president, Lien. Though Lee insists he
supports Lien and campaigned for him over the weekend, rumors swept
the market today that the president was about to abandon his deputy
for Chen.
</P>
<P>
   The Nationalist Party has not only lost supporters to Chen.
Several senior party officials have defected to Soong, who was
himself a party heavyweight. One of those officials, Chen Pi, said
in an interview that he could not support Lien because ``his style
is to do little or nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People in Taiwan long for reform,'' said Chen, a former
provincial police chief of Taiwan. ``But Mr. Lien hasn't satisfied
people's expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts said there would be more twists and turns
before March 18. And they cautioned that despite the mood Monday,
the Nationalist Party would have an unrivaled ability to mobilize
voters on election day.

 &HT;    Couric on colon cancer crusade
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You'll be seeing a lot of TV personality Katie Couric this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, her husband, Jay Monahan, died at age 42 of colon
cancer. Shocked to learn that this little-discussed disease is the
second-leading cause of death from cancer _ and that it is
substantially preventable _ Couric vowed to increase public
knowledge and funding.
</P>
<P>
   The first fruit of her efforts was getting March named the first
National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month. The awareness campaign
includes a series about the cancer that ran on NBC's ``Today'' show
last week and can still be viewed online (at www
</P>
<P>
   .msnbc.com/news/todaycoloncancerfront
</P>
<P>
   .asp). The campaign also includes celebrity appearances on
television and in print media.
</P>
<P>
   Colon cancer strikes 130,000 Americans every year and kills
55,000 of them, one in four of whom are under age 50. When caught
in its earliest stages, more than 90 percent of cases can be cured.
The American Cancer Society advises all men and women 50 or over to
have a yearly fecal occult blood test, plus flexible sigmoidoscopy
every five years, or colonoscopy every 10 years, or a double
contrast barium enema every five to 10 years.

 &HT;    Crosby remains in harmony with today's fans
 &HT;    By Nick Tate
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In this era of one-hit-wonder bands, it's hard to believe
Crosby, Stills, Nash &AMP; Young are touring again behind a strong new
album, ``Looking Forward,'' the group's fourth in three decades.
</P>
<P>
   More incredible, perhaps, is that David Crosby is still around
at all. His battles with drug addiction, the law and liver disease
have lately garnered the 58-year-old Rock and Roll Hall of Famer
more headlines in the tabloids than the rock press. The latest news
_ that he's the biological father of two sons born to Melissa
Etheridge's partner, Julie Cypher _ was the talk of the Grammy
Awards last month and grist for the nation's humor mill.
</P>
<P>
   We talked to Crosby by telephone from a tour stop in Dallas. Q:
Heard any good jokes lately? Seriously, were you surprised at the
response to your latest adventures in parenting?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not really. You don't have a choice about it, if you live in
the public eye. You just have to deal with it. It'll soon all be
gone. I'm really more concerned with playing music right now. If
people are looking to figure out who I am, the truth of that is in
the songs. And if they come to the concert, they'll get it. Can we
talk about the music now?
</P>
<P>
   Q: Sure. How have concert audiences been taking to the new
music?
</P>
<P>
   A: The response has been unbelievable. When a band is out there
for as long as we have been, with music people know and love, you'd
think they want to hear that at the shows. But they want to hear
the new stuff. Some of the songs sound better now than when we
recorded them. (CSNY) has its own special chemistry; it's not like
CSN, or Crosby and Nash. When we started playing again, it was like
riding a bike. This may sound egotistical, but I think we sound
better now than we ever have. We're not any better looking
(laughs), but we're playing better.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you feel any connection with the Backstreet Boys and other
bands that are bringing vocal harmony-based songs back to pop
music?
</P>
<P>
   A: You listen to Boyz II Men, 'N Sync or the Backstreet Boys ...
and I like what they do with harmony, but those groups are mostly
constructions. They're put together by a producer and they don't
write the music. So they're very different from us. We construct
the music ourselves, and it's more organic. I love songs that are
finely crafted and songs that are about something. And I listen to
a lot of weird stuff, man. There's a great vocal group out there
called Kitka that you've never heard of. And I like Shawn Colvin
and Marc Cohn, Dave Matthews, Michael Hedges ... Venice. I love
songs that make people feel something.
</P>
<P>
   Q: CSNY has a history of recording a new album every 10 or 15
years or so. Will there be another CSNY record, and when?
</P>
<P>
   A: We have about half an album already in the can, so I think it
will come sooner than that. I've also got half of a CPR album done
also. So we'll probably finish that one and get CPR on the road
this summer.

 &HT;    Shine wears a bit thin on Elton's formulaic `El Dorado'
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When he was pounding out ``Rocket Man,'' Elton John could not
have predicted his second career would be as the Richard Rodgers of
the preteen set. But after two Oscars, three Grammys and 10 million
in sales for the soundtrack to Disney's warm-fuzzy classic ``The
Lion King,'' it's not surprising that the '70s pop star would do it
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Road to El Dorado'' (Dreamworks), John's second CD of
tunes written specifically for an animated film, arrives in stores
today.
</P>
<P>
   Once more, the 52-year-old artist teams with ``Lion King''
lyricist Tim Rice and composer Hans Zimmer on 14 tracks of sweeping
soundtrack music, this time penned for cartoon characters in search
of the lost City of Gold. Like ``The Prince of Egypt,'' also made
by Dreamworks Pictures, ``El Dorado'' uses radio-friendly pop tunes
to move the action, along with voices by actors such as Kenneth
Branagh, Kevin Kline and Armand Assante.
</P>
<P>
   John must really like this line of work. Of the 11 tunes he's
written here, including the single ``Someday Out of the Blue,''
only six are actually used in the movie. Three of these `bonus
tracks' are songs that were composed for the film but not included;
two tracks are songs written specifically for the album.
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by hit singles such as ``Can You Feel the Love Tonight,''
John's ``Lion King'' soundtrack spent nine weeks at No. 1 on
Billboard's pop album chart. But this CD is nothing to roar
about.Though Dreamworks is mimicking that film's winning formula ,
the tunes here are as indistinguishable as bowling pins.
</P>
<P>
   As a showtune writer, John sounds like he's cutting these
melodies out on deadline from the same pattern tissue he used
before _ swelling piano, dramatic ``Candle in the Wind'' vocal
styling, even the required goofy duet (this time with Randy Newman)
that's become standard fare in every animated film made since Baloo
sang ``Bare Necessities'' in ``The Jungle Book.'' Though there's
twice as much material here, the album sounds like ``The Lion
King'' CD stuck on random play.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they should have named it ``Return to Simba.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Road to El Dorado''
</P>
<P>
   Elton John. Dreamworks. 11 tracks.
</P>

 &HT;    Gays making progress fighting bias, report says
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You wouldn't know it by listening to talk-radio celebrity Dr.
Laura Schlessinger, but gays are gaining ground in their battle
against discrimination. In a 14-page investigation, Newsweek
($3.50) reports that a majority of Americans no longer considers
homosexuality a sin. Forty-six percent say it is, but that figure
is down from 54 percent in 1998. The Newsweek poll also shows
support for gays as high school teachers (63 percent), in the
military (69 percent) and political officeholders (71 percent). In
a separate poll of gay males and lesbians, most surveyed say their
main goals are getting equal rights in job opportunities, housing,
health insurance and employee benefits for gay spouses.
</P>
<P>
   The report includes a series of profiles demonstrating how gays
and straights are interacting in schools, the workplace, the
military, and the church. And, in a sidebar, Dr. Laura responds to
gay criticism of her stand against homosexuality by saying she
never meant to ``contribute ....to an atmosphere of hate or
intolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Jane and more: Talk ($3.50) dishes up quite an appetizing
issue this month, with a cover story on Tom Cruise, a fascinating
portrait of the chain-smoking 12-year-old terrorist twins Luther
and Johnny Htoo, and a short but interesting feature on Atlanta
pastor Gerald Durley . Touted by Talk as ``the man who saved Jane
Fonda,'' Durley remains mum on his relationship with Ted Turner's
estranged wife. ``All I can say is that I admire Jane,'' he says.
``I believe she is on a sincere, honest search for spiritual
wholeness.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The big four-oh. If you're turning 40 soon, don't worry.
You're not alone. According to U.S. News &AMP; World Report ($3.50),
the biggest class of baby boomers are hitting the midlife mark this
year. Unlike their parents, this group of soon-to-be
fortysomethings are healthier and more adventurous. For example:
Atlanta resident Arlene Vincent-Mark decided to quit her sports
marketing job at 40 and enroll in a Ph.D. program in international
relations. Now 45, Vincent-Mark, who ran the marathon in the 1988
Olympics for her native Grenada, plans to graduate in December.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Hooray for Hollywood: Vanity Fair ($3.95) pays tribute to the
impending Academy Awards with a 470-page issue devoted primarily to
the movies. Articles include a 44-page portfolio of the great and
the glamorous, from Ashley Judd and Jude Law to Al Pacino and
Sidney Poitier, as seen through the lenses of Annie Leibovitz, Herb
Ritts, Bruce Weber and other acclaimed photographers. Most
impressive is a group shot of nearly every living writer and actor
who had been blacklisted during the McCarthy era. Also of note is a
fun piece by James Wolcott on the Rock Hudson-Doris Day romantic
comedies of the early '60s. The plots may have been as synthetic as
the fabric of that era, Wolcott writes, but films such as ``Pillow
Talk'' and ``Lover Come Back'' remain martini-and-fur-muff
classics.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Redesigned America: Time ($3.50) looks at the shape of things
and concludes that function is out and form is in. A new generation
of designers are leaving their mark on everything from
candy-colored computers to futuristic toothbrushes. Design used to
be considered ``precious,'' but now, says Time writers Frank Gibney
Jr. and Belinda Luscombe, it's available to all _ ``from the crowd
that shops at Target to those aesthetes who can pick out an Enzo
Mari from 20 paces.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Post mortem: The New Yorker ($3) writer mixes style and
substance its fashion issue. Michael Specter profiles Manolo
Blahnik, the famous Milan shoe designer who provides footware for
Madonna, and Susan Orlean offers her take on one of the
eye-catching elements at the Paris shows _ hot pants. On the
substance side, Jeffrey Toobin interviews Washington Post publisher
Donald Graham about the newspaper after Watergate. The Post, Toobin
says, ``is no longer the scrappy, irreverent paper it once was.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Publishing notes: Good news for those who can't get enough
celebrity news from People and Entertainment Weekly. Beginning
Friday, US magazine will become a weekly
publication....Cosmopolitan has surpassed TV Guide as the magazine
with the largest newsstand circulation. Cosmo reports its paid
circulation as 2.85 million with newsstand sales of 2 million.

 &HT;    Worry not, or make your life a living `Elle'
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The practical man read Elle last week.
</P>
<P>
   And liked it.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, the practical man wouldn't sully his hands with
fashion magazines, for they are trivial tomes for the terminally
insecure _ and incitements to revolt for housewives everywhere. But
since his doctor doesn't subscribe to Rivet Review, he figured what
the heck, he'd do some field research from the waiting room.
</P>
<P>
   And now he's a fan. Here's why.
</P>
<P>
   The models are nude.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get the practical man wrong. He's no lonely lech leering
at little girls. He's just happy to welcome converts into his camp.
</P>
<P>
   For years, fashion was a mystery to the practical man. The
clothes were designed, presumably, to make women more attractive to
men, but the zillion-dollar get-ups ignored the obvious: Men don't
care about clothes. To them, one utterly average but naked woman
inspires more adoration than a dozen supermodels besotted by
sequins.
</P>
<P>
   So it was with innocent jubilation that the practical man
flipped through Elle, eyed the topless babes, and discovered that
fashion is finally making sense.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, he also discovered something else: Women scare
easy.
</P>
<P>
   This terrible truth was revealed on page 226, where women listed
30 common fears. Among them: (7) ``I'm afraid I'll date a
Republican,'' (15) ``I'm afraid I'll never meet Prince Charming,''
(18) ``I'm afraid I don't smell good,'' (25) ``I'm afraid I'm
ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   With a heavy heart, the practical man reviewed the sad catalog.
Overcome, he resolved to help his sisters, at least with the first
five.
</P>
<P>
   1. I'm afraid I'll be alone _ forever: The practical man urges
women to dispel their No. 1 fear as follows: Lower your standards.
</P>
<P>
   While it may seem untenable at first, this brilliant stroke
actually poses little risk, for once married, almost every Romeo
becomes a Ralph _ a probably fat and certainly self-centered dufus
primarily interested in sex and food. Aim directly at this target
from the get-go, and you won't be alone for long.
</P>
<P>
   2. I'm afraid I'm too clingy with men I like: Fear not, ladies,
for you can easily determine whether you are too clingy by quizzing
yourself as follows: Am I clingy at all? If the answer is yes,
you're too clingy.
</P>
<P>
   3. I'm afraid I made a lame career choice: You have made a lame
career choice. The practical man knows this because, had you chosen
wisely, you wouldn't be wondering.
</P>
<P>
   But while poor judgment is no cause for fear, it is cause for
action. So go back to school. Get another job. Keep trying till
you're content. A woman who has 15 jobs before she settles in for
the long haul is wiser than the dolt who drones on at one while
secretly moping about her ``career choice.''
</P>
<P>
   4. I'm afraid I'm losing my hair: There there, child. It's going
to be all right. Lean in close and let the practical man coo
consolation in your ear and calm those fears with well-chosen words
of wisdom. Ready? Here goes: SWEET JESUS, GROW UP!
</P>
<P>
   If you're losing your hair to chemotherapy, you've got something
to fear. Otherwise, bah! Let the locks fall and press on with
pride.
</P>
<P>
   5. I'm afraid I'll have to fake orgasms for the rest of my life:
Then don't.
</P>
<P>
   Fake anything infuriates the practical man, but there is no more
pathetic charade than faked sexual pleasure, which makes a mockery
of life's main event.
</P>
<P>
   Remedy: Stop faking and start talking. Once you've wised him up,
your guy will likely care enough to treat you right. If not, get a
new guy. Life is too short to keep your mouth shut.
</P>
<P>
   READER Q&AMP;A
</P>
<P>
   Dear Practical Man: I'm sure mine is not the only response to
your blathering about Hooters. That guy took his son to Hooters
because he was too lazy to explain things himself; and he waited
about six years too long to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the real question: How would you classify a mother who
takes her daughter to a similar place for women to keep the girl
from muddling through puberty? Certainly not ``mother of the
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Come on, be practical, Practical Man. Cut out that double
standard.
</P>
<P>
   _ Kathy Hickok, Delray Beach
</P>
<P>
   A. The only double standard the practical man admits is this: He
gets doubly ticked when people assume he has something against
women because he's ``practical.''
</P>
<P>
   If he saw a mom and Girl Scout at a beefcake bar, he'd write the
same column. But it's not his fault he doesn't join in on girls'
night out _ he is, after all, the practical man.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Practical Man: Please weigh in (pun intended) on the ``Do I
look fat?'' question. Several days ago, my girlfriend asked me if
she looked fat. I said no, but she wouldn't believe me. She swore
she wanted an honest appraisal, so I told her she wasn't fat but
might be a little out of shape. Ever since, she's been saying
things like ``I guess I can't wear these jeans because they'll make
me look even fatter,'' and she glares at me. How does the Practical
Man respond to that question?
</P>
<P>
   A. Before the practical man blinds you with his brilliance, let
him confess that his insight into this thorny matter was hard won.
</P>
<P>
   In his early years, he assumed his fair maid actually wanted the
truth. Thus, he concentrated on gentle ways to deliver it _ riffs
like ``O Honey, I love your chub!'' He blames himself for the
ensuing tears, for he didn't understand what was being asked.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he drew up a wiser, two-pronged strategy.
</P>
<P>
   If his darling had put on a few pounds, he assumed she wanted to
know not the truth, but whether he found her attractive despite her
extended girth. Thus, his reply of choice became ``Don't be
silly!'' followed by a kiss juicy enough to keep her from pressing
the issue.
</P>
<P>
   If she was not fat, the practical man assumed she desired not a
mere statement of the obvious, but some suitably fawning
acknowledgment of her fatlessness. He would parry appropriately,
perhaps with ``Fat? Pshaw! The only thing you have in excess, my
dear, is beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   These were OK and pried the practical man out of many a sticky
situation, but he was still unsatisfied. A more elegant solution
would consist of a single, all-purpose response. He leaned his
brain into it, and crafted a master stroke:
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I look fat?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sweetheart, the question is meaningless. Women heavier than
you are fat. Those lighter, too thin. For in my eyes, you remain
perfect no matter what you weigh.''
</P>
<P>
   Dear Practical Man: About old discarded workers, I can identify
with your thoughts on this matter. I found myself on the outside
looking in after many years in the corporate world. I learned the
shoe maker trade and have been doing it full time for the past 15
years. I am 76 years old and work every day. I think it beats hell
out of golf and bowling and gives me a sense of doing something
that helps make the world go around.

TAIWAN STOCK MARKET IS SHAKEN BY ELECTION FEARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Duplication warning, also moved in `i' category; see related
CHINA-TAIWAN.) 
(HLW) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Fears that Taiwan's governing Nationalist Party may
lose next Saturday's closely fought presidential election surged
through the Taipei stock market Monday, causing its largest
single-day point loss in its history and the largest percentage
decline in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Taipei's main stock index plummeted 617 points, or 6.6 percent,
to 8,811.95 in a panicky session described as driven almost
entirely by politics. Analysts said investors were worried that a
victory by the Democratic Progressive Party candidate, Chen
Shui-bian, would inflame relations between Taiwan and China.
</P>
<P>
   China has sharply criticized Chen for advocating independence
for Taiwan, which it views as a renegade province. Chen's party
formally favors an independent Taiwan, though he has pledged not to
declare independence if elected.
</P>
<P>
   The three main candidates to succeed President Lee Teng-hui _
Chen, Vice President Lien Chan of the Nationalist Party, and James
Soong, an independent _ are running neck and neck in the most
competitive presidential race ever seen here. But Chen seems to be
gaining momentum at the expense of Lien.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's law bans the publication of opinion polls in the final
two weeks of the campaign, though, which means that statistical
predictions have been replaced by anecdotal evidence, hunches, and
pure speculation.
</P>
<P>
   Chen received endorsements over the weekend from three
influential corporate leaders and one of Taiwan's most eminent
academics, Lee Yuan-tseh. Lee, a Nobel-Prize-winning chemist,
offered to resign as president of a top research institute to serve
as an adviser to Chen.
</P>
<P>
   Chen also drew an estimated 400,000 people to a rally in
Kao-hsiung, a southern port city that is a stronghold of the
Democratic Progressive Party. The rally, the largest and most
raucous of the campaign so far, impressed political oddsmakers with
its organization and fervor.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Chen Shui-bian wins the election, there is likely to be a
period of volatility because of the uncertainty about Taiwan's
policies toward China,'' said Dong Tao, a regional analyst at
Credit Suisse First Boston. ``There would also be uncertainty about
how to deal with the Nationalist Party.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in Taipei last week, Chen contended that the
Nationalist Party was playing the ``China terror card'' _ warning
that a Chen victory would wreak havoc on the stock market and the
economy. Monday, Chen and several market analysts said they believe
that the Nationalists ordered government-related funds to sell
their shares to deepen the market decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is heartbreaking and regrettable to see the Nationalists
ignoring the interests of civilians and stock investors,'' Chen
said at a rally near Taipei.
</P>
<P>
   The Nationalists denied that they orchestrated the selloff. And
they contended that legislators from the Democratic Progressive
Party had held up the approval of a $16.3 billion ``stabilization
fund,'' which the government could have used to protect the market
from just this kind of politically driven panic.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of a gyrating stock market on the vote is
unpredictable, though analysts believe that instability generally
helps the Nationalist Party, since it represents the status-quo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The party is taking a risk here,'' said one market analyst.
``Instead of pushing up the market to please voters, they're
saying, `If you don't vote for us, this is the danger.'''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Whatever Chen's concrete support, there is no question that his
campaign is generating more attention in the closing days than
those of either of his rivals. The endorsements from Lee Yuan-tseh
and the business executives are important because they lend weight
to a candidate whose support is seen as coming mostly from younger
voters and from native Taiwanese, like Chen himself, instead of the
mainlanders who fled to Taiwan after the Communists gained control
of the mainland in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   The three executives _ Stan Shih of Acer Computer, Chang
Rong-far of Evergreen Group, and Hsu Wen-lung of Chi Mei Industry _
are also native Taiwanese. But collectively, they represent the
industrial elite.
</P>
<P>
   They also have close ties to Lee Teng-hui, whom analysts say has
tepid feelings for his vice president, Lien. Though Lee insists he
supports Lien and campaigned for him over the weekend, rumors swept
the market today that the president was about to abandon his deputy
for Chen.
</P>
<P>
   The Nationalist Party has not only lost supporters to Chen.
Several senior party officials have defected to Soong, who was
himself a party heavyweight. One of those officials, Chen Pi, said
in an interview that he could not support Lien because ``his style
is to do little or nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People in Taiwan long for reform,'' said Chen, a former
provincial police chief of Taiwan. ``But Mr. Lien hasn't satisfied
people's expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts said there would be more twists and turns
before March 18. And they cautioned that despite the mood Monday,
the Nationalist Party would have an unrivaled ability to mobilize
voters on election day.

 A MATTER OF HONOR  &HT;     By Michael Taylor 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Standing outside the gates of Fort Benning, Ga., protesting a
U.S. Army school that trains Latin American military officers,
Charles Liteky is a paradox, a man equally respected by many in the
Army he used to be part of and by the demonstrators who surround
him.
</P>
<P>
   Elite Army paratroopers and Navy commandos come out of the Fort
Benning gates from time to time to shake Liteky's hand and talk to
him, to ask him why he has spent years protesting the School of the
Americas. Sometimes they simply want to talk to him about the war
in Vietnam _ in truth, about (begin italics) his (end italics) war
in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Liteky, who is now 69, can lay claim to a situation that, as far
as anyone can tell, applies to only one other person: As an Army
chaplain, Liteky was awarded the Medal of Honor, the nation's
highest decoration for heroism in combat, and less than 20 years
later, he gave it back and renounced all its privileges, including
the lifetime, tax-free pension of $600 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday (Monday, 3/13) the former Catholic priest was
convicted in U.S. District Court in Columbus, Ga., of trespassing
at nearby Fort Benning during two demonstrations last year. He
faces up to one year in prison when he comes up for sentencing in
early April. He is currently free on $20,000 bond.
</P>
<P>
   If he does go to prison, he might well be the only inmate with
the nation's highest military decoration.
</P>
<P>
   In American culture, the Medal of Honor is sacrosanct. Only
3,410 men and women have received it and there are only 150 living
recipients. In the armed services, generals, admirals and colonels
are known to snap to attention when an enlisted man wearing the
medal comes into the room.
</P>
<P>
   When Lyndon Johnson draped the medal around Liteky's neck in
November 1968, he said, ``Son, I'd rather have one of these babies
than be president.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of MEDAL13 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Liteky's road from Army hero to lifelong protester is not as
complicated as it might seem. Whatever drove him to drag 23 men to
safety during a fierce firefight in Bien Hoa province, he says, is
probably what makes him now crusade against the Army training
school, whose graduates, critics say, are responsible for the
massacre of peasants and human rights workers in Central America.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason I do what I do now is basically the same,'' he said
in an interview recently. ``It's to save lives. In the case of the
School of the Americas, it's to stop training the military from the
Third World, who take the training back and employ it in the
oppression of their people.''
</P>
<P>
   In Vietnam, he said, ``the situation was more immediate. People
were getting blown up, shot and killed all around me. I didn't get
hit, and there was nothing for me to do but help them. Some were
dead. One young man died in my arms, breathing his last breath and
just gasping for air. I held him for a bit, then I gave him last
rites. Then I moved on because there were other people crying for
help.''
</P>
<P>
   The Army's official citation says that on Dec. 6, 1967, when
Liteky's company came under intense fire from an enemy battalion,
he crawled through machine-gun fire and dragged his wounded
comrades to the safety of a Medivac helicopter landing zone. At one
point, Liteky tried to lift a seriously wounded soldier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Realizing that the wounded man was too heavy to carry,'' the
citation read, ``(Liteky) rolled on his back, placed the man on his
chest and through sheer determination and fortitude crawled back to
the landing zone using his elbows and heels to push himself along,
pausing for breath momentarily.''
</P>
<P>
   Liteky grew up the son of a career Navy noncommissioned officer
and says, ``I was always very comfortable around service people,
and it was easy for me to go into the service.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, six years after being ordained as a priest, Liteky
answered an Army call for chaplains and was soon on his way to
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 100 percent behind going over there and putting those
Communists in their place,'' he says now. ``I had no problems with
that. I thought I was going there doing God's work.'' He left the
Army in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of MEDAL13 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  In 1975, ``mainly because of celibacy,'' he left the priesthood
and in 1983, married former nun Judy Balch in San Francisco. She
introduced him to refugees from El Salvador, ``teenagers, whose
fathers had been killed and tortured. I didn't believe it, but I
kept going to more and more of these meetings and it became clear
these people weren't blowing in the wind.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1986, Liteky was devoting as much time as possible to
demonstrating against U.S. policy in Central America and the Reagan
administration's support of the Contra rebels in Nicaragua. In July
of that year, he removed his Medal of Honor _ awarded to him under
the name of Angelo J. Liteky _ and placed it and a letter to
President Ronald Reagan at the Vietnam Veterans' wall in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The medal was retrieved by the National Park Service and is now
on display at the National Museum of American History in
Washington. The only other person to return a Medal of Honor was
John J. McGinty III, who renounced it for religious reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Liteky has protested against the School of the
Americas and has been banned from Fort Benning because of the many
times he has invaded the post at the head of a column of
protesters.
</P>
<P>
   So how does Charlie Liteky's life sit with other Medal of Honor
winners?
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look at Liteky, I have respect for the courage of his
views,'' says Paul Bucha, past president of the Congressional Medal
of Honor Society and himself a recipient of the medal for his
heroism as an Army captain in Vietnam. Bucha is now chairman of the
board of Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to be an iconoclast,'' Bucha says. ``It's much
easier to go along. Men like Liteky are people who should force us
to pause and think, they should not be ostracized and criticized.
They are entitled to their views, and perhaps if we listened we'd
be better off.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Liteky, it appears he may be having some effect. In
November, the Army said it would change its School of the Americas
curriculum, making more room for courses on democracy and
international law. And the other day, Major General John Le Moyne,
the post cq &LR; commander at Fort Benning, called up Liteky and
personally invited him to an annual symposium on human rights.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 3 of MEDAL13 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Does Liteky think Le Moyne would have called him if he didn't
have the medal?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I don't think he would have called,'' Liteky says. ``And
yes, I guess I did use the medal consciously. I didn't for a long
time, but I see now that it provides me with a certain
respectability even though I've renounced it.''
</P>
<P>
   Any regrets about giving it back in the first place?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not at all.''

BRADLEY: HIS VOICE WAS WORTH LISTENING TO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Bill Bradley was crushed in the race for the
Democratic nomination. Al Gore won all Democratic primaries and
caucuses, with the coup de grace coming on Super Tuesday this week.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley has nothing to be ashamed of. In fact, he has much
to be proud of.
</P>
<P>
   The pundits will talk in the days ahead of the tactical errors
the former U.S. Senator from New Jersey made, and he did make his
share.
</P>
<P>
   He should have bypassed Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   He shouldn't have invested as much time and money in Washington
state.
</P>
<P>
   He should have gotten tougher sooner and responded more
forcefully to criticism of his proposals.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't act quickly enough when his health became an issue.
</P>
<P>
   He should have been a more animated and spirited speaker and
campaigner.
</P>
<P>
   All true enough, but a campaign is not just about strategy,
pithy sound bites and style. Bradley helped inject thoughtful ideas
worth discussing into the race.
</P>
<P>
   He proposed an assault on children's poverty. Though the
remaining candidates can differ on how this should be accomplished,
this isn't an idea that should die.
</P>
<P>
   He proposed universal health care, forwarding a common sense
approach. Again, we can differ on approaches, but the number of
people without health insurance has long been a national scandal.
</P>
<P>
   He talked seriously about stricter gun control and reminded Gore
of some of his previous softness on the issue of a woman's right to
choose on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley and Gore shared similar views on education, both wanting
to provide more teachers, make preschool available to more, reduce
class size and help more people get to college. But, Bradley
differed in that he viewed continuing education as a life-long
endeavor, proposing to make it accessible at all stages of life,
not just for high school graduates.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's appeal for racial harmony and justice resonated, even
if the topic still causes too many eyes to glaze over.
</P>
<P>
   And, though his talk of ``goodness,'' never caught on, it, too,
is not a topic that should die. Doing the right things, for the
right reasons, is a worthy goal for a country.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley will not release the 412 delegates he did win in the
primaries, ensuring he has a voice at the Democratic Convention.
</P>
<P>
   It's a voice worth listening to. &QL;

MCCAIN: SETBACK OPENS NEW CHALLENGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - In his campaign for the presidency, Arizona Sen. John
McCain once again served his country well.
</P>
<P>
   One valuable service his candidacy appears to have served,
largely unremarked upon, is to finally heal the nation's wounds
over the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   The nation learned about and celebrated a hero from that war.
The nobility of McCain's sacrifice for his country overwhelmed the
dispute over whether the cause was worthy. McCain's manifest and
unaffected love for his country was a reminder and an example to
the rest of us of what is truly important.
</P>
<P>
   Because of McCain's candidacy, American foreign policy in the
future is likely to be much less clouded by the Vietnam War and the
sharp divisions in the country it caused.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's campaign also raised the profile of a fundamentally
important issue: campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Money plays a disproportionate role in choosing our candidates
and influencing public policy. It causes the American people to
feel disaffected from their government.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is right that the stakes are high. If the American people
believe that their democracy is rigged, and increasingly they do,
it will be hard to enlist them in important national issues and
causes.
</P>
<P>
   In his comments announcing that he would no longer be an active
candidate for the Republican nomination for president, McCain
accurately identified how he can best serve his country in the
future: continuing to provide leadership on this issue.
</P>
<P>
   But if McCain is to ultimately succeed and complete his new
mission for his country, he will have to develop and deploy
leadership skills that heretofore have not been conspicuous.
</P>
<P>
   The problem of the influence of money in campaigns isn't simply
a matter of evil, bad guys _ special interests _ who have to be
stopped, and toady politicians who lack McCain's vision and courage
to stand up to them.
</P>
<P>
   The actions of government affect everyone. People, causes, and
organizations have a right to speak about and try to influence
government policy. And people and organizations have a right to
express their views, even during elections, and even if what they
have to say is distasteful.
</P>
<P>
   But voters have a right to know who is speaking, and candidates
need to have the ability to communicate with voters without
depending on, or being drowned out by, special interest money.
</P>
<P>
   If McCain is truly to lead a crusade to reduce the
disproportionate influence of money, and in the process restore
confidence in the integrity and fairness of American democracy, he
will need to listen to his critics rather than simply excoriating
them. And he will have to forge new approaches that bring broader
support than his existing reform proposals, and show greater
respect for the First Amendment rights of others, even those whose
influence McCain deplores.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has shown the leadership of courage. His next challenge
is developing and deploying the leadership skills necessary to
translate vision into policy, to become a consensus builder in
addition to being a critic. &QL;

   TRIBUNE-TIMESMIRROR (Undated) _ The Tribune Co. and Times Mirror
Co., two media companies whose flagship newspapers helped define
the brawling, partisan days of 19th-century journalism, on Monday
announced plans to merge into a media company that would bring
their trademark regionalism to the multimedia world of the 21st
century. If nothing intervenes to disrupt the merger, the new
company, to be called Tribune Co., will own 11 daily newspapers, 22
television stations and four radio stations. Its combined audience
of newspaper subscribers and television viewers would give it a
much greater national profile. But its core strategy would be
regional, with a mandate to deliver news, entertainment and
advertising through print, television and the Internet. By Felicity
Barringer and Laura M. Holson.

debate over genetically modified food is as much about theater as
it is about science. Polls show that few Americans realize that
nearly two-thirds of the products on supermarket shelves contain
ingredients from genetically altered plants. But British tabloids
routinely call such ingredients ``Frankenfood,'' and pollsters say
only 1 percent of Britons think genetically modifying plants has

   JAPAN-RECESSION (Tokyo) _ Defying official optimistic forecasts,
hundreds of billions of dollars worth of government spending and
other financial stimulants, Japan's economy revealed its underlying
vulnerability on Monday in statistics that showed a retreat back
into recession in the final three months of 1999. The Economic
Planning Agency said the gross domestic product, the total output
of goods and services in the world's second-largest economy, fell
1.4 percent in the October-December quarter, for an annual rate of
decline of 5.5 percent. By Stephanie Strom.

SUPER TUESDAY SHOWED CAMPAIGN FLAWS, INSIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT ROBB  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Notes and observations coming out of Super Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
   While John McCain's campaign finance proposal is deeply flawed,
and his rhetoric about it overheated, the campaign success he
enjoyed offers an important insight into the American electorate.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans feel that their government, and the people who
manage it, do not care about them. This is a sentiment that cuts
across the political spectrum, and applies to all levels of
government.
</P>
<P>
   Political professionals tend to discount the power of issues
such as campaign finance reform because they do not show up as
salient in polls. But that is because, for the most part, people
are skeptical about whether a politician can do much to correct
this sense of disassociation with government.
</P>
<P>
   But when it appears that a candidate might, indeed, be able to
do something about it _ McCain, Jesse Ventura _ there is a strong
response.
</P>
<P>
   This will be an important underlying force in American politics
for some time to come.
</P>
<P>
   The chattering class is peddling the notion that George Bush and
Bob Dole lost the presidency because they were too closely
associated with the right wing. For this to be valid, the American
people had to perceive that Bush in '92 and Dole in '96 were more
conservative than Reagan in '80 and '84, and Bush in '88, when he
ran as Reagan's younger brother. Methinks not.
</P>
<P>
   The chattering class also thinks that the strategy that
backfired on McCain, assaulting the Religious Right, will work
wonders for Al Gore. The reality is that most Americans don't find
people who go to church and take their faith seriously all that
deplorable or alarming.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Religious Right is an unsteady part of the
Republican coalition, sometimes difficult to get out. One estimate
is that there was over a 20 percent drop-off in its turnout from
1994, when Republicans took over Congress, to 1998, when they
nearly lost it.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's attacks on Religious Right leaders turned out this vote
for Bush in the primary. Gore may very well do the same thing for
the general election, saving Bush the need to work at it.
</P>
<P>
   The notion that McCain's support came from former Reagan
Democrats, another chattering class superstition, is nonsense.
Reagan Democrats were primarily brought over on social conservative
issues. And many of them were in the South, subsequently became
Republicans, and helped deliver the death blow to McCain's
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   There has probably not been anyone in American political history
less suited to be vice president than John McCain. Can you imagine
him loyally and effectively defending a presidential policy with
which he fundamentally disagrees? I suspect George W. can't either.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be surprised to see both Gore and Bush pick a woman as
their vice presidential nominee. Sen. Dianne Feinstein for Gore, to
lock in California. And Elizabeth Dole for Bush, who is the ideal
vice presidential candidate: widely popular, very articulate, with
few policy ideas of her own.
</P>
<P>
   Gore looked far more presidential in his non-acceptance
acceptance speech Tuesday evening than did Bush, who, while he's
improving, still doesn't quite look ready for prime time.
</P>
<P>
   Bush ought to deflect Gore's call to forgo campaign ads and
debate twice a week by saying: ``If being president requires
spending that much time with Al Gore, it's just not worth it.''
Americans of all political persuasions would nod their heads in
understanding and agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Bush should begin now to mildly express concern about what Alan
Greenspan is doing with the economy. If Greenspan succeeds in
hiking consumer interest rates and talking down the stock market,
it will have broad adverse impacts, including to core Democratic
constituencies, particularly now that nearly half of all American
families own stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton-Gore administration is inextricably linked to
Greenspan, and by acting now Bush can pin to Gore concerns over the
economy that may very well develop over the next eight months. &QL;

Attention graphic editors:
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times News Service is planning an expanded weather
package, with a planned starting date of Monday, March 20, which
will be transmitted on Sunday, March 19. The package, consisting of
a weather map as a graphics file and a text file to accompany the
map, is available to graphics clients of the News Service. The new
map grows to 4 columns in width (52 picas), from 3, and is 6 inches
deep; the old was 4 inches deep. This new size permits the
insertion of cloud cover information and the addition of many new
cities.
</P>
<P>
   The map is available both in color and in black and white.
Because the map is much more detailed, we have devised an entirely
new palette of colors to make it easier to read the added
information. A sample of the new map is available at Wieck,
Newscom, Presslink and AP's GraphicsNet.

FEARED CHECHEN LEADER RADUYEV FALLS INTO RUSSIAN HANDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Stung by recent battlefield losses in separatist
Chechnya, Russian officials claimed a moral victory Monday when
they announced the capture of feared guerrilla leader Salman
Raduyev.
</P>
<P>
   Known for his bravado, fierce anti-Russian rhetoric, and thick
beard and dark sunglasses that hid battle scars, Raduyev is the
first rebel leader Moscow has managed to capture since troops
entered the breakaway region last September. Russia has been eager
to capture him after he led a bold and bloody hostage-taking raid
into Dagestan in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Acting President Vladimir V. Putin announced that Raduyev was
captured on Sunday in Chechnya and had been brought to Moscow to
stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Public Television showed footage of Raduyev's
interrogation. Dazed and clean-shaven, he looked a far cry from the
guerrilla commander who for years has struck fear into the hearts
of many Russians.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the most odious bandit leaders,'' Putin said at
a televised meeting with his top ministers. ``Now he's in prison,
and that's where he belongs. I would like to think that this is
only the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   But analysts said Raduyev's capture, while perhaps a
badly-needed morale boost for Russian forces, is meaningless in
military terms. Russian troops, they said, are in for a long
guerrilla war from the separatists.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a publicity coup for Putin but little more,'' said
Pavel Felgenhauer, a Moscow-based military analyst. ``The capture
of one warlord will have very little effect,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Military leaders said last month that Russian forces were firmly
in control of the rebel region. The ``active phase'' of the war was
over, they said, and troops were mopping up small groups of
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   But over the past week, Chechen fighters have inflicted heavy
losses on Russian forces with a series of lightning strikes in
areas Moscow has long claimed to control. Military officials said
156 servicemen died in combat over the past week.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting continued Monday in the southern Chechen town of
Komsomolskoye, which the rebels captured from Russian forces a week
ago. Military officials said that up to 1,500 rebels were hiding in
the town.
</P>
<P>
   News agencies quoted Interior Minister Vladimir Rushailo as
denying earlier reports that the commander of those guerrillas,
Ruslan Gelayev, had escaped from the village.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military said on Sunday that a group of rebels led
by Shamil Basayev and Khattab had evaded a blockade near the
villages of Ulus-Kert and Selmentausen in the Argun gorge. Rushailo
also said that Basayev and Khattab were hiding in Chechnya's
southern mountains.
</P>
<P>
   In televised comments, Nikolai Patrushev, head of Russia's
Federal Security Service, said Raduyev was captured in the Chechen
town of Novogrozninsky. Patrushev said that no shots were fired
when Raduyev and three accomplices were captured early Sunday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first he was shocked. He didn't answer questions,''
Patrushev said of Raduyev.
</P>
<P>
   Raduyev is the son-in-law of Dzhokar Dudayev, the Chechen
president who first led the region's bloody campaign for
independence from Russia. Dudayev was killed in a June 1996 rocket
attack.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1996, during the last Chechen war, Raduyev led a
bloody raid on the town of Kizlyar in neighboring Dagestan, where
he took thousands of hostages. The attack left scores dead and
Raduyev released the hostages and retreated back into Chechnya
after a weeklong standoff with Russian troops.
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, he was shot in the head and seriously wounded
during an attack by Russian forces. Raduyev reportedly lost an eye
and later underwent plastic surgery.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Kizlyar raid, Raduyev has claimed
responsibility for masterminding the bombing of a railway station
in the Russian city Pyatigorsk, and for a 1998 assassination
attempt against Georgia's President Eduard Shevardnadze.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Public Television reported that he will be charged with
terrorism and faces 50 years in prison if convicted.

TRIBUNE-TIMES MIRROR MERGER POSES PROS AND CONS FOR AD AGENCIES 
</HEADLINE>
 (Advertising Column; with TRIBUNE-TIMESMIRROR) 
(nk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As Madison Avenue assesses the merger announced
Monday between the Tribune Co. and the Times Mirror Co., the
opinions reflect a belief in the power of consolidation along with
a skepticism about whether the benefits will be as extensive as
they are being billed.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition of Times Mirror by Tribune for about $6.45
billion is indicative of the creation of a new type of media and
entertainment conglomerate that combines disparate properties to
offer marketers additional opportunities to buy commercial time and
advertising space in the form of what are known as cross-media
packages. Among examples are the amalgamations of America Online
and Time Warner; Walt Disney and Capital Cities/ABC; CBS, Infinity
Broadcasting, King World Productions and Viacom; and Clear Channel
Communications with AMFM Inc. and SFX Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Those conglomerates also hope to increase revenue by stepping up
the cross-promotional campaigns they sponsor among their
operations, which range from Web sites to television and radio
stations and networks to print media like magazines and newspapers
to entertainment properties like film studios, sports teams and TV
program syndicators.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see only more consolidation, which clearly has pros and cons
for advertising agencies,'' said Ellen Oppenheim, media director at
the New York office of FCB Worldwide, part of True North
Communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the degree you want to make multimedia deals, there's more
to play with,'' Oppenheim said. ``But to the degree there's less
competition, and higher pricing, it's not a pretty thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The increased costs stem from efforts to portray cross-media
packages as larger than the sum of their parts and therefore more
valuable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our experience is that mergers are great, but they end up
costing us more money,'' Carla Loffredo said, laughing. She is
senior partner and director for brand communications at the New
York office of J. Walter Thompson, part of the WPP Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you buy all the pieces of a pie, the cost should be less,''
she added. ``But they believe the value of the whole pie is so much
greater than the individual pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Loffredo said, the deal makes sense from a strategic
point of view, which is for media-entertainment conglomerates ``to
be a hundred miles deep in key markets where you offer
multicommunication channels to reach consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The deep penetration in those critical markets'' like
metropolitan Chicago, Los Angeles and New York, she added, is
intended to ``surround consumers by different points of contact.''
</P>
<P>
   The primary sales pitch for the new Tribune, which is to absorb
the variegated Times Mirror properties, is likely to be rooted in
the local orientation of newspapers like The Chicago Tribune, The
Los Angeles Times, Newsday and The Orlando Sentinel in Florida as
well as broadcasters like WGN radio and TV in Chicago, WTIC-TV in
Hartford and KSWB-TV in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The merged Tribune will be the largest multimedia company in
four of the nation's five most populous states: California, New
York, Illinois and Florida. And in the fifth, Texas, the company
owns two major market TV stations, KDAF-TV in Dallas and KHWB-TV in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to take the strongest brands the company has and
surround each one with multimedia ventures,'' said Rishad
Tobaccowala, president at Starcom IP, the interactive unit of the
media services agency Starcom Worldwide, part of the Leo Group unit
of BDM Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disney had ESPN, the cable network, which is being expanded to
a magazine, radio, the Internet, even bars,'' he added. ``That
allows your strongest products to become even stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are questions about how broad a scope the merged
Tribune can have when its strengths lie in local and regional
properties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, all these media companies are working to vertically
integrate content on a national scale,'' said Richard Notarianni,
media planning director at the New York office of DDB Worldwide,
part of the Omnicom Group. ``But there's still a schism between
their national efforts and Main Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Chicago, The Trib speaks with a Chicago accent,'' he added.
``I'm not sure it'll help to bring a Left Coast and Right Coast
feel to that.''
</P>
<P>
   That point about the company's newspapers, which will increase
to 11 from four after the deal, is important to agencies. They have
long shied from spending national ad dollars for clients in
newspapers, preferring media like television and magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers ``have been trying to crack that nut for years,''
said Roberta Garfinkle, senior vice president and print media
director at the New York office of McCann-Erickson Worldwide
Advertising, ``and still nobody has come up with a way to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks good on paper and it sounds good,'' she added, ``but
you've got to have the children learn to play nicely together.''
McCann is part of the McCann-Erickson World Group unit of the
Interpublic Group of Companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newspapers are learning through the Newspaper National Network
that there's a lot of money out there,'' said Steven Greenberger,
senior vice president and director for print media at Grey
Advertising in New York, referring to a sales program coordinated
by the Newspaper Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they've got to make life simpler for the advertising
agencies by packaging themselves more neatly and easily,'' he
added. ``Times Mirror alone hasn't been able to do it and Tribune
alone hasn't been able to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   If the merged company can accomplish that, ``it can attract more
national advertising,'' Greenberger said, and perhaps even provide
``an example of how newspaper networks can become the next big
media opportunity for national advertisers.''
</P>
<P>
   If that fails, well, Tribune can always offer prospective
advertisers some Chicago Cubs tickets for the World Series.

 &HT;    `New economy' seen as moral wasteland
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The ``new economy'' is the hottest thing on Wall
Street, but it's also a moral never-never land, Fortune (March 27)
says in a cover story on the ethics of highflying dot-com
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Fortune argues that today's Internet boom is much like earlier
periods of economic upheaval, when people get the sense that ``the
old rules _ and the old ethics _ no longer apply.''
</P>
<P>
   Common infractions cited by Fortune include companies that steal
one another's intellectual property, cheat employees out of
promised stock options, intercept private e-mail and engage in
``sleight of hand'' accounting that pulls revenue ``out of thin
air.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Taken together, they present not only a portrait of an
industry awash in greed, but also governed by an inverted dynamic,
born of a stock market gone mad,'' Fortune says.
</P>
<P>
   A MATTER OF TIMING
</P>
<P>
   Facing the tightest labor markets in 30 years and demand that
won't quit, U.S. corporations have made a bad situation manageable
by pouring money into technology in a bid to reduce the need for
workers, Business Week (March 20) reports.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, says former Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Alice M.
Rivlin, ``we have this tight labor market just at the moment when
we have a huge explosion in technological answers to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Investment in technology is behind the huge rise in
productivity, the magazine says, and goes a long way toward
explaining why the economy continues to grow so rapidly without
inciting wage inflation.
</P>
<P>
   END OF AN ERA
</P>
<P>
   The Economist (March 17) pays homage to a disappearing
institution _ the pinball machine, a victim of high-tech video
games that offer cinematic realism and thrills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pinball virtually created the games arcade, capturing the
quarters of a generation of flipper jockeys in the 1950s and
1960s,'' says the magazine. ``And, rather like the Wurlitzer
jukebox and the 1967 Thunderbird, the pinball showpieces of that
era were masterpieces of electromechanical achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   But today's youngsters, raised on PlayStations and 3-D virtual
combat, no longer feel like leaning over a glass cabinet and
batting around a metal ball.
</P>
<P>
   With sales slumping and losses mounting, WMS Industries, the
industry leader, stopped making the machines in November.
</P>
<P>
   This year the company's latest, greatest pinball machines will
be sold _ or junked.
</P>
<P>
   WORTH MENTIONING ...
</P>
<P>
   _ Harry West has preached regional urban planning for three
decades as chief of the Atlanta Regional Commission.
</P>
<P>
   He warns in Georgia Trend (March) that metro Atlanta's economy
will start to slip if regional planning isn't adopted.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mutual Funds (April) offers a package of articles to help
investors use the Internet, complete with a guide to computer
hardware, personal finance software and Web sites with databanks
useful for financial planning.

ROBB-COLUMN (Phoenix) - Notes and observations coming out of Super
Tuesday, including: There has probably not been anyone in American
political history less suited to be vice president than John
McCain. Can you imagine him loyally and effectively defending a
presidential policy with which he fundamentally disagrees? I
suspect George W. can't either. By ROBERT ROBB. Column moved in the
``K'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
EDIT-MCCAIN (Phoenix) - John McCain's campaign raised the profile
of a fundamentally important issue: campaign finance reform. In his
comments announcing that he would no longer be an active candidate
for the Republican nomination for president, McCain accurately
identified how he can best serve his country in the future:
continuing to provide leadership on this issue. But if McCain is to
ultimately succeed and complete his new mission for his country, he
will have to develop and deploy leadership skills that heretofore
have not been conspicuous. Story moved in the `K` category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
EDIT-BRADLEY (Phoenix) - The pundits will talk in the days ahead of
the tactical errors Bill Bradley made, and he did make his share.
But a campaign is not just about strategy, pithy sound bites and
style. Bradley helped inject thoughtful ideas worth discussing into
the race. Story moved in the `K` category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MONTINI-COLUMN _ If this were one of those Mafia movies Americans
like so much, we'd have reached the point where Don Corleone pulls
us aside and whispers in our ear in Italian, ``No fare lo
stupido.'' Don't be stupid. The saga of Salvatore ``Sammy the
Bull'' Gravano, currently playing on TV sets throughout Arizona and
the U.S., should not be confused with ``The Godfather'' or
``Goodfellas'' or ``Scarface'' or ``Casino,'' or with an episode of
``The Sopranos,'' for which Gravano the real killer was asked to
appear as a pretend killer. By E.J. MONTINI. Story will move in the
``A'' and ``K'' categories. &QL; 
 &QL; 
TV-GOODY-BEACH (Undated) - Babes in bikinis, tasteless humor,
Howard Stern as executive producer _ a combo like that should have
every 15-year-old boy in America (and everyone who thinks like one)
salivating. So why won't they be laughing at the new FX series `Son
of the Beach`? Simple. It's not very funny. By BILL GOODYKOONTZ.
Story will move in the ``E'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
DINOSAURS (Undated) _ Dinosaurs, dead for millions of years, keep
evolving. A look at changing fashions in paleontology, based on new
book ``Walking With Dinosaurs.'' By RICHARD NILSEN. Story will move
in the ``E'' and ``L'' categories. &QL;

   PHILADELPHIA _ During the first half of the championship game of
the Atlantic 10 men's basketball tournament Saturday night, Temple,
which had not won the title since 1990, left little doubt as to
whether its drought would last another year.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the first half was drawing to a close, about the
only thing in doubt was whether St. Bonaventure would manage double
figures before halftime. St. Bonaventure guards David
Messiah-Capers and Tim Winn answered that question when they hit
back-to-back 3-pointers to make the score 34-12 with 3 minutes 33
seconds remaining. Temple then took a 37-12 lead into the locker
room.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some sloppy play in the second half, Temple (26-5)
rolled to a 65-44 victory over St. Bonaventure (21-9) to win the
conference tournament at the First Union Spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't talk to them much like I really do and make them
nervous,'' Temple Coach John Chaney said. ``I let them stay out
there for 30 minutes and warm up and I didn't talk to them that
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Chaney is onto something heading into the National
Collegiate Athletic Association tournament next week.
</P>
<P>
   Temple, ranked No. 6 in the nation, could be a No. 1-seeded team
in the national tournament, but Chaney said he was not worried
about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we've earned one of 64,'' he said. ``I would much
rather play a top team and lose and come back home. I'm not
interested in playing a lowly team. I'm not concerned about seeds.
I'm not even sure how it works. Maybe being in a region where you
don't run into Duke is where you want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The way Temple came out in the first half Saturday, it appears
the Owls are ready for almost anything. Entering this game, St.
Bonaventure had won seven of its last eight games. It held Dayton
to 36 percent shooting from the field in the semifinal game here
Friday night. Saturday night it was a different story. The Bonnies
were completely steamrolled by Temple. Temple's defense held St.
Bonaventure to just 17.9 percent shooting from the field in the
first half. The 12-point total was a record low for an Atlantic 10
championship game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Temple was outstanding tonight,'' St. Bonaventure
Coach Jim Baron said. ``They played like a Final Four team. They're
terrific. They have so many guys who can step up, particularly on
the perimeter, and they're tough inside. It seems like they've been
waiting for this one for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Owls jumped out to a 23-2 lead before St. Bonaventure could
break a sweat. Quincy Wadley, who was the tournament's most
valuable player, had 11 points at the midway point of the first
half. He finished the game with 16 points and was 4 of 5 from
3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good feeling as a shooter knowing I have teammates
around me who will get me the ball when I'm shooting like that,''
Wadley said. ``I know any time I find a crack and get open that
Pepe will get me the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepe Sanchez is Temple's point guard. He had six assists and did
a good job of breaking down St. Bonaventure's press when the
Bonnies tried to slow down Temple's offense. It didn't help. The
Owls shot 50 percent from the field in the first half (46.9 percent
for the game) and pulled down 31 defensive rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   St. Bonaventure center Caswell Cyrus, who averages 12.5 points
and 6.3 rebounds a game, was limited because of a stomach virus.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could barely walk this morning,'' Winn said. ``I didn't
even think he could play.''
</P>
<P>
   Cyrus played 30 minutes, but he was not a force inside. He was 1
of 6 from the field and had just three rebounds. Maybe if Cyrus had
been healthy, things would have been different in the one-sided
first half.
</P>
<P>
   St. Bonaventure managed to climb back into the game in the
second half, pulling to within 50-36 on a 3-point basket by J.R.
Bremer with 6:08 to play. But that was as close as the Bonnies got.
</P>
<P>
   The game that Temple played against St. Bonaventure will give
some teams in the NCAA tournament something to think about wherever
the Owls are seeded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we played to the best of our ability,'' Wadley said.
``If we're granted the No. 1 seed, so be it. Our objective is to
put ourselves in the best position, and that would be the No. 1
seed.''

 &HT;    Boca Raton, Fla.: 'A great place to be a rich crook'
 &HT;    By Scott Hiaasen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Five years ago, Daniel Porush sat atop
an empire built on deceit.
</P>
<P>
   Porush was president of Stratton Oakmont Inc., one of the most
profitable _ and notorious _ boiler-room operations in the nation.
Working for him were nearly 200 stockbrokers and salesmen who
specialized in luring unwary investors into risky ventures with
promises of quick riches.
</P>
<P>
   When it all came crashing down _ after Stratton Oakmont was
kicked out of the securities industry and a federal grand jury in
New York began to look at the company's activities _ Porush, 42,
migrated to one of the few places where a boiler-room millionaire
can feel right at home: Boca Raton.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the gates of the country-club communities around Boca,
you can find many people like Porush, cold-calling impresarios who
now live in sunny affluence despite being mired in scores of
lawsuits and legal claims.
</P>
<P>
   For example, there's Brian Scanlon, an ex-Stratton broker whose
own company, Harriman Group Inc., was ordered last year to pay $90
million to the Securities and Exchange Commission; there's James
Villa, former head of H.J. Meyers &AMP; Co., a Rochester, N.Y.,
brokerage that collapsed under the weight of investigations and
customer complaints before being expelled from the business last
year; and there's Elliot Loewenstern, another Stratton alum, who
with his partner agreed to repay $6 million to customers at his
Fort Lauderdale-based brokerage.
</P>
<P>
   The federal regulators who pursue boiler-room brokerages and try
to recover their illegal profits say the money trail often leads
them to South Florida. Its appeal, they say, goes beyond the warm
climate; they believe the state's famously generous property laws
also make Florida a popular destination. The state constitution
protects a home of just about any value from being taken through
the courts, and certain investments are typically shielded from
creditors in bankruptcy proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great place to be a rich crook,'' said Alistaire
Bambach, a lawyer with the SEC, which fined Stratton Oakmont $2.5
million in 1994. ``It is not a coincidence that these people set
themselves up in a state where the (property) exemptions are very,
very liberal.''
</P>
<P>
   And where's a better place to settle down than Boca Raton, a
town known nationally as a bastion of telemarketing scams and
white-collar crime, a place so choked with boiler rooms that
regulators once dubbed a stretch of Federal Highway the ``Maggot
Mile''?
</P>
<P>
   HOW BOILER ROOMS WORK
</P>
<P>
   Places like Stratton make their money by manipulating stock
prices at the expense of their customers, exploiting their greed.
Stratton's approach was not particularly new or inventive. But
Stratton did it better, for longer, than most.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stratton came at a time when the regulators were just starting
to tighten up,'' said Barry Goldsmith, vice president of
enforcement for the National Association of Securities Dealers,
which regulates stockbrokers. ``They were around a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   The salesmen _ boiler rooms are dominated by young men _ usually
work from scripts, encouraging unsuspecting customers to invest in
obscure stocks with promises that they will double in value within
weeks. They exaggerate the stock's worth and sometimes lie about
the company's products. (In the worst cases, the company exists
only on paper.) They also apply pressure, suggesting they have
inside information that must be acted on swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   At the boiler rooms, the employees can be under just as much
pressure to make sales. For example, managers at H.J. Meyers &AMP; Co.
hazed their low-performing brokers, forcing them to trudge in a
circle around the office while co-workers pelted them with office
supplies, according to a lawsuit against the brokerage. The ritual
was called the ``walk of shame.''
</P>
<P>
   Customers are left unaware of such antics; they deal with their
brokers almost exclusively over the phone.
</P>
<P>
   What the customers also don't know is that the brokerage usually
issues the stocks it sells, or owns most of them. By promoting
sales of ``house stocks,'' the brokers boost the stock price; then
the brokerage sells its shares at the inflated value, making a
handsome profit while its customers are left with worthless
portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   These ``pump and dump'' schemes proliferated with the long bull
market; securities regulators estimate that they cost consumers
around $2 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Stratton Oakmont's record
</P>
<P>
   Stratton Oakmont joined the securities industry in 1989 and
quickly earned a reputation as one of the industry's worst. Its
motto: ``Never hang up the phone until the customer buys or dies.''
</P>
<P>
   Twelve times the company was disciplined by the NASD. In 1992,
the SEC sued Stratton Oakmont over its sales tactics. Company
Chairman Jordan Belfort agreed to a ban from the stock industry in
1994 _ placing Daniel Porush solely in charge.
</P>
<P>
   Within seven months of taking over, Porush paid himself $3
million in salary and bonuses, according to the trustee overseeing
Stratton's assets in bankruptcy court. He also set up a $180
million golden parachute for Belfort. It was the start of what's
been described in a lawsuit filed by the trustee as the systematic
looting of Stratton Oakmont's accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Property records indicate Porush and his wife, Nancy, first came
to this area in 1995, when they paid $600,000 for a Palm Beach
condominium. They also owned two homes on Long Island in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, the NASD accused Porush and others at
Stratton of illegally manipulating stocks. By December 1996,
Stratton was kicked out of the business, and Porush along with it.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, hordes of customers were complaining that they
were duped by their brokers, or their orders to sell the sinking
house stocks were ignored. When the company filed for bankruptcy in
January 1997, 455 customers had accused Stratton of fraud, claiming
losses of more than $40 million, according to the trustee's suit.
Porush, as president, was named in many of the complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Porush and his lawyers would not comment for this story.
</P>
<P>
   Porush moved to Palm Beach County for good in early 1998. He and
his wife separated, but she soon followed him to Boca. He found
himself in familiar company.
</P>
<P>
   One former Stratton salesman, Scott Forman, also moved to Boca
in May 1998; another, Ira Boshnack, lived in Coral Springs since at
least 1997. One of Stratton's top men, Howard Gelfand, lived in
Aventura in Miami-Dade County, and, briefly in 1997, Delray Beach,
before moving back to New York. Since 1994, Stratton partner Jordan
Shamah owned a house in Boca where a relative lived; when a bank
tried to foreclose on the mortgage last April, Shamah sold it to
the wife of yet another Stratton alum, Irving Stitsky.
</P>
<P>
   (Shamah, Stitsky and two other Stratton graduates were indicted
in New York in August on charges stemming from an Internet
stock-promotion scheme.)
</P>
<P>
   THE TACTICS SPREAD
</P>
<P>
   With the closing of Stratton in 1996, the NASD investigated more
than 30 of its brokers for possible sanctions. Many paid fines or
were suspended, and a few were banned. But many more left Stratton
to join other brokerages that used the same tactics _ the ``sons
and daughters of Stratton,'' as Goldsmith, the NASD vice president,
calls them.
</P>
<P>
   One such company was Biltmore Securities, a Fort
Lauderdale-based brokerage taken over by two brokers, Elliot
Loewenstern and Richard Bronson, who left Stratton in 1992. The
pair maintained a close relationship with their former employer:
they hired at least 22 people from Stratton, NASD records show, and
Biltmore took over Stratton's Maryland office.
</P>
<P>
   Another was the Harriman Group Inc., or HGI, of Jericho, N.Y. In
the early 1990s, two former Stratton brokers, Mark Hanna and Brian
Scanlon, took a controlling interest in the company and, according
to regulators, adopted many of Stratton's methods.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to keep track of brokers from troubled dealers like
Stratton, the NASD maintains a hit list: If several brokers from a
company on the list end up at a new office, that office's phone
calls must be taped for investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Stratton, Biltmore and HGI all made the list.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the family tree, you will find a lot of people
who learned the trade at Stratton Oakmont,'' Goldsmith said.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC first charged Biltmore with securities violations in
1993; in a settlement two years later, the company paid $1 million
and Loewenstern and Bronson agreed to one-year suspensions. Last
year, after the NASD also complained about Biltmore's tactics,
Bronson and Loewenstern agreed to leave the industry for good,
though they admitted no wrongdoing. Loewenstern, who lives in Boca
Raton, is now developing real estate; Bronson owns a trendy Miami
Beach fashion magazine.
</P>
<P>
   HGI was charged in 1997 with making $16 million in illegal
profits by trading in restricted stocks with another company,
Maidstone Financial Inc. Both companies were kicked out of the NASD
as a result, and the SEC is now seeking $90 million from HGI for
illegal profits.
</P>
<P>
   WHO OWNS THE HOME?
</P>
<P>
   The brokers at these two companies learned more than just sales
tactics from Stratton: When they got into trouble, they too came to
Palm Beach County. Two months after leaving HGI, Scanlon, 33, and
his wife bought a house in Boca Raton for $928,000, and at least
two other HGI brokers also came down. Maidstone's president, Stuart
Litman _ who was banned from the business and fined $100,000 _
moved into a house right around the corner from the Scanlons,
though he and his wife later moved back to New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Scanlons, however, stayed in the area. In 1998, they moved
into a bigger house in the Royal Palm Yacht and Country Club in
Boca Raton. Five months later _ on the day an NASD hearing on
complaints against him was to begin _ Scanlon filed for Chapter 7
bankruptcy, seeking to erase his debts. He has listed only $10,237
in assets and $8 million in debts, including claims from 18
customers who say they were swindled by HGI.
</P>
<P>
   If Scanlon has no money, he's certainly surrounded by it. His
wife, Suzanne Davis, is listed on the property deed as the owner of
their $1.69 million house, though both of them are responsible for
the $1 million mortgage, county records show. Scanlon's $650,000
settlement with the NASD _ money intended for ex-customers _ was
paid by his mother-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   The trustee overseeing the bankruptcy claims Scanlon tried to
distance himself from his assets by transferring money to his wife,
giving her more than $3 million in the two years before he declared
bankruptcy. In court papers, Davis said she handled the couple's
financial matters, and that she has always had her own money and
property.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bakst, a lawyer for the trustee, said a settlement of
the bankruptcy claims is being discussed. Through his lawyer,
Scanlon declined to comment for this story.
</P>
<P>
   The holding of assets by a spouse is common among local
boiler-room veterans: Stuart Litman's wife, Nancy, held the deed
and mortgage to their house, and she held the titles to their boat
and other watercrafts; former Stratton manager Irving Stitsky is
named on the mortgage of a house, but not on the deed. And Nancy
Porush, not her husband, Daniel, was on the deed to their $1.4
million home in Boca's Woodfield Country Club, which has since been
sold.
</P>
<P>
   These methods can shield property because, under Florida law,
the assets of one spouse usually can't be taken to pay the debts of
the other. Even if property has been transferred from one spouse to
another, it can be hard for creditors to challenge in court,
particularly if they must show it was a deliberate attempt to keep
money away from creditors, said Bakst.
</P>
<P>
   TROUBLES GROWING
</P>
<P>
   For Daniel Porush, at least, Florida has not been much of a
refuge. In 1998, he was indicted in New York for fraud, money
laundering and other crimes. He now faces prison after pleading
guilty to manipulating several stocks. He also agreed to turn over
about $6 million, including the Boca house that was in his wife's
name; officials say that money, along with another $9 million from
Belfort, the former company chairman, is probably the last, best
chance for Stratton customers to recover any of their losses.
</P>
<P>
   But the lawsuits continue to pile up. The trustee in charge of
liquidating Stratton Oakmont's assets filed a $54 million suit
against Porush, his wife, Belfort and Belfort's family. During just
the past two years, arbitrators have found Porush liable to
Stratton customers for more than $23 million in damages.
</P>
<P>
   Three of those customers dragged Porush into bankruptcy court in
West Palm Beach, where they're seeking more than $12 million. At a
hearing in the case last week, Porush refused to answer questions
about his finances, invoking his right not to incriminate himself
under the Fifth Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of his boiler-room brethren, Porush has kept a
relatively low profile in South Florida. He's living in Woodfield
Country Club (not far from his old house), and he's working at a
collectibles business in Pompano Beach, making $78,000 a year.

POLLUTION TAKES TOLL ON CLOUDS AND RAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
(mk) 
 By WILLIAM K. STEVENS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The microscopic particles of atmospheric dust, sea salt and
smoke known as aerosols are meteorological and climatic
will-o'-the-wisps _ now here, now not, materializing somewhat
randomly in a given parcel of air and then disappearing in a few
days. But they are essential to the formation of clouds and the
production of rain and snow, and they also have a considerable
cooling influence on the earth's temperature.
</P>
<P>
   The evanescent character of aerosols has made it especially
difficult for scientists to pin down their effects on weather and
climate. The task has been complicated further by industrial
pollution, a relatively new source of aerosols with shifting
distribution patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Now researchers have turned up evidence that seems to confirm a
longtime suspicion: that the flood of aerosols loosed by urban and
industrial pollution suppresses rainfall and snowfall downwind of
the pollution source. In the process, clouds become brighter,
reflecting more sunlight. They may also stay around longer, and the
combined effect is to exert extra cooling on localities and regions
underneath those particular clouds.
</P>
<P>
   The extra particles cast aloft by the modern industrial economy
prevent cloud moisture from condensing into water droplets large
enough to fall to the ground before evaporating, according to a
study by Dr. Daniel Rosenfeld, a cloud physicist at the Hebrew
University of Jerusalem. The study appears in the current issue of
the journal Science.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenfeld examined precipitation patterns discerned by
instruments aboard an earth satellite launched in late 1997 to
measure global rainfall. He found that in ``pollution tracks''
downwind of pollution sources like cities, power plants, lead
smelters and oil refineries, virtually all precipitation was shut
off because the clouds in those atmospheric swaths were composed of
abnormally small water droplets.
</P>
<P>
   In order for raindrops to form, there must be some nucleus on
which atmospheric water vapor can condense. Aerosols provide the
nuclei. The resulting droplets of condensation create clouds. When
enough of the droplets collide and coalesce _ it takes about a
million of them _ a precipitation-sized drop of water forms and
falls to earth.
</P>
<P>
   But when the atmosphere is flooded with extra aerosols produced
by industries and cities, there are many more nuclei on which
moisture can condense. Consequently, the droplets are smaller and
never become heavy enough to fall to earth.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the new study ``indicate that human activity may
be altering clouds and natural precipitation on a global scale,''
Rosenfeld wrote in Science.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, measurements of smokestack emissions from ships at
sea, taken by satellites and airplanes, provided the first evidence
that aerosols could change cloud structure by redistributing water
onto a larger number of smaller droplets. Presumably, scientists
thought, the same thing might happen on land. But in many
industrial areas, aerosols from air pollution are so pervasive that
it was difficult to discern clearly their effect on precipitation.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenfeld selected study sites where pollution tracks were
somewhat isolated in a broader region of less polluted air, and
thus stood out clearly. These included sites in Canada, Turkey and
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The results showed for the first time that downwind of pollution
sources, clouds are brighter, said Dr. Owen B. Toon, an atmospheric
scientist at the University of Colorado at Boulder, who wrote a
commentary on the findings in Science. The clouds were brighter, he
said, because the increased number of droplets, though smaller,
reflected more sunlight, cooling the area under the clouds.
</P>
<P>
   In those bright cloud plumes, said Toon, ``there's no rainfall,
whereas the clouds surrounding the plume are raining. People had
thought this might happen, but there was no clear evidence of it
happening before.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the clouds do not produce as much rain, he said, they
probably persist longer; until a large-scale atmospheric system
like a cold front moves them out, they continue to cool the earth
beneath.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how widespread the pollution-induced precipitation
reduction and the cooling effects are, Toon said. Many scientists
believe that to some extent, the cooling effect of industrial
aerosols counteracts whatever global warming is being produced by
heat-trapping waste industrial gases like carbon dioxide. But they
have found it difficult to establish the magnitude of the aerosol
cooling.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that the amount of pollution-generated aerosols in
the atmosphere varies from time to time and place to place; since
they fall out of the atmosphere in days or weeks at most, their
effect is regional, spotty and short-lived.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts believe that aerosol-producing pollution is
lessening in industrialized countries as they place controls on
emissions, and that in North America and Europe it may therefore
become less important as an influence on climate and weather.
Meanwhile, this sort of pollution is believed to be increasing
rapidly across Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The net global effect of aerosols on both precipitation and
temperature is thus a shifting target for scientists. Toon, along
with many other experts, says he believes that over the next few
decades, as controls are placed on pollution by aerosols, their
diminishing climatic effects will be overshadowed by the warming
effect of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases: While aerosols
disappear from the atmosphere quickly once controls are placed on
them, greenhouse gases persist for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   The climatic role of both aerosols and clouds may become
markedly clearer in the next few years, said Toon, as new earth
satellites designed to measure them are launched. The first such
satellite, called Terra, went into orbit last December and should
begin collecting data in the next few months.

POPE WILL VISIT TWO COMPETING SITES OF THE BAPTISM OF JESUS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Treading carefully among competing interests on his
pilgrimage to the Holy Land next week, Pope John Paul II is adding
a visit to a traditional site of Jesus' baptism in a West Bank area
under Israeli military control, Israeli officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The March 22 trip to the site on the Jordan River near
Palestinian-ruled Jericho has been termed a private visit that will
be brief _ about 15 minutes _ and without television cameras,
officials said. The pope will be flown there by helicopter from
Jerusalem before proceeding to Bethlehem, which is under
Palestinian control, they added.
</P>
<P>
   Like other stops on the pope's six-day visit to Israel and the
Palestinian-ruled areas, the trip to the baptismal site is a
delicate matter, laden with significance for the Palestinians,
Israel and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months Jordan has been promoting a rival baptismal
site on its eastern bank of the Jordan River. The pope plans to go
to the Jordanian site immediately before his arrival in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   At the Vatican last month, Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader,
urged that the pope extend his visit to Palestinian-ruled areas to
include Jericho and its adjacent baptismal site. But the baptismal
site remains under Israeli control, and it is unclear whether there
will be any official Palestinian presence there. There is no plan
for the pope to go to Jericho itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The visit will be under Israeli supervision and control,''
said Aviv Shiron, the Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman. Yet
Arafat evidently hopes that the pope's visit will prove a magnet
for pilgrims in years to come, when the area might be transferred
to Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
   The West Bank site has been revered for centuries by some
Christian denominations as the place where Jesus was baptized by
John the Baptist at the beginning of his public ministry. Several
Catholic and Orthodox churches and monasteries were built in the
area, dating to the Byzantine period.
</P>
<P>
   After Israel captured the site in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, it
declared it a closed military area along the border between the
West Bank and Jordan. But under interim accords with the
Palestinians, Israel agreed to annual pilgrimages there by
Palestinians under their own flag. And since January, Israel has
opened the area to visits by foreign pilgrims.
</P>
<P>
   Both Israel and the Palestinians have a common interest in
promoting the area as a pilgrimage site to offset efforts by Jordan
to draw pilgrims to its competing site on a tributary across the
river. The Israelis are planning to refurbish the West Bank site,
whose churches and monasteries have crumbled during more than 30
years of neglect behind mines and barbed wire.
</P>
<P>
   The Jordanian site is about a mile east of the West Bank site,
at Wadi Kharrar, where there are also remains of an ancient church.
Citing a New Testament verse locating John the Baptist east of the
Jordan, Jordanian officials successfully lobbied for the pope to
visit Wadi Kharrar, in the hope that this would draw new
generations of pilgrims there in the future.

`CRIME STORIES': GIVE ME YOUR MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Broadcast notes appear at end of review. Time, channel are
for New York area. Check local listings.) 
(DW) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the pre-Giuliani era, before street crime was
abolished, some blocks along Broadway were home to operators of a
diversion known as three-card monte or follow the queen. The
enterprise required only a bottom-side-up cardboard box, three bent
playing cards and a few accomplices and visiting suckers. The
venturesome tourist or atypical New Yorker with more cash than
sense was challenged to place a bet on which of the three cards
placed face down on the box was the queen. No one, except a shill,
ever came away a winner.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first of Tuesday night's ``Rip-Offs and Scams''
explored by Ricky Jay, a chronicler of conjuring, and other experts
on how even New Yorkers can be gulled by sleight-of-hand artists
and other people with more talent than scruples. Jay demonstrates
convincingly and entertainingly that his hand is a lot faster than
your eye. He advises that if you're looking for a square deal from
a street gang, with its implicit threat of muscle, forget it.
</P>
<P>
   The hour also offers examples of pickpocket tactics, like the
``bump and stall,'' in which a band of villains distracts a victim
as a pocket is being emptied or a purse is lifted. Then there are
those popular county-fair games that defy victory, whether they
involve knocking down milk bottles or scoring baskets. (The bottles
may have lead bottoms that resist falling; the baskets may have
bent rims.) The lesson here is ``Play to play, not to win.'' Since
the prizes tend to be worthless to boot, it sounds like good
advice.
</P>
<P>
   A less common example of human fallibility, one must hope, is
the ``sweetheart scam,'' in which a lovelorn target is wooed and
won by a professed lover, who then runs through the beloved's bank
account. One woman reports that she lost more than $30,000 to the
man to whom she had already lost her heart. I'm afraid she seemed
excessively dim, like the customers for people who claim to tell
fortunes or possess other psychic powers. ``I'm feeling your
aura,'' one says, which is awfully personal.
</P>
<P>
   Other temptations to be avoided are greed (don't believe a
telephone caller's announcement that you've won a million dollars)
and sympathy (don't swallow heartbreaking pleas for financial
assistance without checking on the auspices). Also beware of the
Internet. The elderly and the lonely seem to be especially
vulnerable to plausible pitches, but a little stupidity doesn't
help.

HEIRS REGAIN A PAINTING TAKEN BY THE NAZIS IN 1938 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SARAH LYALL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ A painting that was left behind by a Jewish woman
fleeing Vienna during World War II, taken by the Nazis and held for
most of the intervening years in storage at a museum in Munich was
returned Monday to the heirs of the original owner.
</P>
<P>
   The return of the work, ``The Three Stages of Life'' (1898), a
triptych by Count Leopold von Kalckreuth, part of a traveling show
at the Royal Academy of Arts here called ``1900: Art at the
Crossroads,'' is the first restitution of a painting on view in a
British institution, said Anne Webber, co-chairwoman of the
Commission for Looted Art in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this sets an important precedent for all museums
holding looted work,'' Webber said at a news conference here.
``These are not just important objects but family treasures with
huge symbolic and emotional meaning.''
</P>
<P>
   The question of how to return the tens of thousands of works
confiscated outright by the Third Reich or seized as spoils of the
Second World War has bedeviled institutions throughout Europe as
the decades have slipped by and the original owners have grown
infirm and died off. Recently a number of British museums and
galleries listed some 300 works with murky provenances that they
said may have been looted by the Nazis and appealed to the public
for help in determining where the works had been during the war.
</P>
<P>
   In this case the work's owner, Elizabeth Glanville, died in 1983
after years of trying to recover it. As documentation she offered a
photograph of the work on the wall of her apartment in Vienna,
which she fled in 1938 with her husband and children.
</P>
<P>
   The painting has been on loan to the Royal Academy from the
Bavarian State Collections, which bought it from a private Viennese
collection in 1942. New research by the Bavarian State Collections
in Munich and the Commission for Looted Art in Europe showed that
the work had been taken illegally by the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   Glanville's children, Ernest Glanville, 75, and Marietta
Glanville, 70, were on hand Monday for a reunion with the painting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's joy is tinged with regret that my mother is not
here,'' said Marietta Glanville, who said she remembered the
painting, showing a woman in youth, in the prime of life and in old
age, from the time it dominated the dining room of her childhood
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has meant a lot to us,'' she said. ``It is an icon of our
childhood, and has great sentimental value, in that it was given to
my mother as a wedding present from our grandparents.''
</P>
<P>
   The picture is to remain on view here until April 3, when it is
to be transferred to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York.
In September it is to be returned to the Glanvilles.

M-CLASS TAKES OFF FOR MERCEDES-BENZ  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SHANNON THOMASON   
 The Tuscaloosa (Ala.) News   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCE, Ala. _ Sales of the Mercedes-Benz M-Class in North
America are up nearly 43 percent from last year, but officials here
at the company's only American plant have taken the demand in
stride.
</P>
<P>
   For the fourth consecutive month, the M-Class has been the
top-seller for Mercedes-Benz USA Inc., said Mercedes spokesman
Austin Dare.
</P>
<P>
   The M-Class recorded its highest February sales ever, with 4,605
vehicles sold, according to figures released by the company. That
represents almost one-third of the total 15,546 new vehicles sold
by the company in North America last month.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,900 employees at the Vance plant are keeping up with the
consumer craving for the M-Class, Dare said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, 77,692 M-Classes were built in Vance; 68,732 were built
there in 1998. Although Dare said he could not predict how many
will be built this year, he did say that the company anticipates an
increase in production.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're expecting to realize growth this year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The car is also manufactured in Austria. The Steyr-Daimler-Puch
plant in Graz is producing as many as 30,000 of the vehicles a year
to meet European demand.
</P>
<P>
   February's total Mercedes vehicle sales in North America show a
26 percent increase over February 1999's sales record of 12,257.
This was the 10th consecutive month Mercedes posted year-over-year
sales gains, according to the company.
</P>

REAL CAMPAIGN REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Campaign finance reform has quickly emerged as the first big
issue separating George W. Bush and Al Gore in the general
election. This focus is itself cause to celebrate _ for a moment.
</P>
<P>
   The opportunity for real reform will be lost just as quickly if
the candidates continue to use the issue for political advantage
rather than for constructive change. The issue must produce bricks
to strengthen our most precious democratic institution, not
brickbats to be hurled between the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Both have plenty to prove. Gore has a record of support for
various improvements, including early advocacy for public
financing, but he and President Clinton have achieved nothing
substantial, even when Democrats controlled Congress. Gore's own
fund-raising lapses, some of which he now acknowledges were
mistakes, raise a suspicion that Gore's sudden emphasis on reform
is essentially a defensive move. What Gore needs to do now is to go
well beyond support for the McCain-Feingold bill and put out a
comprehensive plan of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Bush clearly likes the current system, which has served him
well. The changes he advocated in South Carolina were minimal _
barring soft money from corporations and unions, but not from
individuals, and requiring instant disclosure. However, thousands
of John McCain voters are looking for a home. And as more stories
circulate about the cushy and sometimes lucrative appointments that
have gone to some of his big contributors in Texas, Bush may feel
the need to embrace more reform.
</P>
<P>
   The leading advocates are pleased with the new spotlight on
campaign finance, but rightly want more substance. ``I believe in
conversion,'' says Ellen Miller of Public Campaign, but ``whether
Gore is credible or not depends on what he comes up with.'' And
Scott Harshbarger of Common Cause says Gore must ``show how he's
different from Clinton _ will he make any kind of a fight for it?''
Both dismiss Bush's recent proposal, Miller calling it ``deform.''
</P>
<P>
   Millions of Americans believe that Washington is lubricated by
big money to the detriment of average citizens. Gore and Bush have
a chance to change that.

CHANDLERS SACRIFICED LONG-TERM GAIN, ALL TO AVOID TAXES
</HEADLINE>
   (Market Place Column; with TRIBUNE-TIMESMIRROR) 
(nk) 
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Chandler family built the Los Angeles Times and Times
Mirror, and in the end they sold the company out from under the
manager they had hired to run it.
</P>
<P>
   While the planned sale to the Tribune Co. will be a windfall for
Times Mirror shareholders, the Chandlers would have enjoyed a far
bigger gain had they not engaged in three separate transactions
with the company over the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   Those transactions, criticized at the time because they gave the
family deals not available to ordinary shareholders, were designed
to maximize current income for the Chandler family while minimizing
the family's tax bill and allowing it to diversify its investments.
In that, they succeeded. But the cost to the family was a real one.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the Tribune transaction, the Chandlers appear to have
negotiated a deal that will protect them from paying taxes _ but
will give them a lower price for their stock than will be available
to public shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, the transactions appear to have provided short-term
benefits to the Chandlers at the expense of their long-term
financial interests _ at least in hindsight now that the takeover
is going to occur.
</P>
<P>
   None of which is to say the Chandlers are going to suffer. The
Chandler family trusts now own 14.5 million shares of Times Mirror
stock, which will be exchanged under terms of the takeover for
36.25 million shares of Tribune Company stock, worth $1.1 billion
at Monday's closing market price. They also have substantial other
investments, thanks to the transactions with Times Mirror, that are
worth hundreds of millions more.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's merger agreement was negotiated in large part by
Chandler family interests, with Mark Willes, the chief executive of
the company, effectively left on the sidelines. It appears that he
will be out of work after the merger is completed, although he will
get a severance package. Although the Chandlers own a minority of
the stock, they control the company because their shares have
super-voting rights.
</P>
<P>
   But back in 1994, before the blizzard of deals began, the
Chandler family trusts owned 39.4 million shares. Had they simply
held on to them, they would have received less income in the
intervening years but probably would be wealthier now, after the
Tribune takeover. Monday, Times Mirror stock rose $37.6875 to
$85.625.
</P>
<P>
   The first deal, announced in 1994 and completed in the spring of
1995, came when Times Mirror needed to reduce the generous dividend
it had been paying. The quarterly dividend was cut from 27 cents a
share to 6 cents. Such a cut was potentially devastating to some
members of the extended Chandler family, whose dividend income was
about $42.5 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   The solution was to give the Chandler family trust a new issue
of preferred stock, paying $33 million a year in dividends. Their
income was preserved.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary shareholders did not get the preferred. But they did
get shares in Cox Communications, which bought the cable operations
of Times Mirror in a related transaction. The Cox shares they got
were then worth about $10 a Times Mirror share. Now they are worth
about $52, although they have never paid dividends. The value of
the preferred stock the Chandlers took instead of the Cox shares
has not risen, although the dividends have continued to be paid.
</P>
<P>
   The second transaction came in 1997. Then the Chandler family
and Times Mirror engaged in an unusual deal in which the family
effectively traded part of its common and preferred stock holdings
in Times Mirror for a diversified stock and bond portfolio and a
stake in real estate that had been owned by Times Mirror, and which
Times Mirror then leased back. The deal was structured in a way
that let the family avoid capital gains taxes on the stock that was
traded for the other assets.
</P>
<P>
   To evaluate that deal completely would require knowledge of how
the cash in the deal did after it was invested _ information that
is not public information. Times Mirror stock had performed poorly
since that transaction _ on Friday it closed just below the 1997
level _ but it soared Monday on the takeover news. Although the
Chandlers had higher current income than they would have had if
they had not done the transaction, it is probable that they would
have done better overall if they had kept the shares to be tendered
in the current takeover.
</P>
<P>
   The third transaction came last September. The structure of that
deal was similar to the 1997 one, with the Chandlers effectively
trading another large block of Times Mirror stock for the income
from other assets, in this case securities issued by real estate
investment trusts and other investments to be made with cash
contributed by Times Mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, evaluating that deal is impossible without
information on the investments made with the cash put in by Times
Mirror. Some of the money went into a venture capital fund that has
made a number of Internet investments, whose value will become
clear only with time. But, once again, Times Mirror stock is up
more than 40 percent since then, thanks entirely to the takeover,
and it is unlikely that the other investments, as a group, have
done as well.
</P>
<P>
   In the transaction announced Monday, the Tribune Company agreed
to pay up to $95 a share for 41 percent of the outstanding Times
Mirror shares, and to exchange 2.5 Tribune shares for the remaining
shares.
</P>
<P>
   Tribune stock fell $6.375 to $30.8125 Monday, indicating the
value of the stock portion of the deal is $77.03 per Times Mirror
share. Unless Tribune stock rallies sharply, most shareholders will
opt to take as much cash as they can. But the Chandlers agreed to
exchange their shares for stock. That leaves more cash for other
shareholders, but assures that the Chandlers will not have to pay
capital gains taxes on the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the Chandlers have managed to do a deal that will
not bring a tax bill to the family. But they are doing so in a way
that leaves them with less value than they might have received if
taxes were not so feared.

A LIFESAVER TAKES A LIFE  
 A TICKLING TUMOR  
 IRREGULAR HEARTBEAT  
 BAD CREDIT  
 ILLITERACY 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) (DW) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When a heart attack victim is rushed to the emergency room,
chances are that among the array of treatments doctors administer
will be one of the drugs known as clot-busters. But in many of
those cases, because doctors have to make crucial dosage decisions
on the fly, the drugs may be doing more harm than good, a new study
finds.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Brigham and Women's Hospital, the Harvard
affiliate, found that as many 16 percent of the 260,000 patients
treated each year with the drugs are given improper doses, which
can result in complications that include death.
</P>
<P>
   The risk was especially high for women. Over all, the mortality
rate for patients given incorrect drug treatment was twice as high.
</P>
<P>
   But they also found that newer versions of the drugs, called
thrombolytic agents, which are given not through transfusion but
with two simple injections, have a far lower error rate, 5 percent
or lower, said Dr. Christopher P. Cannon, the author of the study.
The findings were presented last weekend to a gathering of the
American College of Cardiology.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, Cannon said, lies not so much in the older forms of
the drugs, which have been credited with saving many lives, as with
the setting in which they have to be administered. With heart
attacks, emergency room doctors need to act quickly to remove the
blockage that is causing the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sooner you open up the artery, the less complicated the
heart attack is and the lower the death rate,'' Cannon said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the older clot-busters require doctors to factor in weight _
a frequent source of dosage errors, the study said _ and to make
decisions about how long to continue the transfusions and at what
rate. Too little of the drug, and the blockage may not disappear;
too much and the patient could have complications from bleeding,
including stroke.
 &QL; 
WHEN AN IRREGULAR BEAT SPELLS TROUBLE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A common heart condition, irregular heartbeat, which under
normal conditions poses little problem, may have more serious
consequences if a heart attack strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have found that people who have atrial fibrillation,
as an irregular heartbeat is known, have higher rates of death and
disability when they have heart attacks. The findings were reported
in a recent issue of Circulation.
</P>
<P>
   The study involved 106,780 people 65 or older who had heart
attacks, 22 percent of whom were found to have had irregular
heartbeats.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers said they were surprised at the rate of atrial
fibrillation, which they said appeared to put patients at increased
risk for stroke, congestive heart failure or a second heart attack.
They also needed to stay in the hospital longer. About half the
patients studied who had irregular heartbeats had the conditions
before their heart attacks. The rest developed them afterward.
A TICKLING TUMOR AND AN URGE TO LAUGH &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Neurologists are reporting several cases in which small,
tumorlike masses can cause people to feel as though they have to
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   The patients, whose conditions were described in a recent issue
of the journal Neurology, said that the sensation was not
unpleasant, but that it could be unnerving. One 24-year-old woman
described the feeling as being ``like a tickling in my head'' that
lasted 10 to 15 seconds and occurred 10 times a day. A 25-year-old
man said he would suppress the urge to laugh unless it appeared
appropriate to his surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   The condition is caused by a noncancerous mass called a
hypothalamic hamartoma. The lesion also caused the patients to have
mild epileptic seizures. The seizures can usually be controlled
with medication; the laugh cannot.
</P>
<P>
   Patients with larger hamartomas often have more serious
symptoms, including changes in mental ability and behavioral
problems. While a patient who reports an urge to laugh might well
not be taken seriously by a doctor, the study said it could be a
sign of a small lesion.
</P>
<P>
   It said these patients should be given MRI scans, which should
be thoroughly scrutinized, since the growths are so small.
</P>
<P>
   RESEARCHERS LINK BAD DEBT TO BAD HEALTH &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is no secret that serious credit card debt is bad for one's
financial health, but it could also be bad for physical health.
</P>
<P>
   Sociologists writing in the journal Social Science &AMP; Medicine
say they have found evidence that people who owe money on their
credit cards tend to be in poorer health.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is part of the dark side of the economic boom,'' said Dr.
Paul J. Lavrakas, director of the Center for Survey Research at
Ohio State University.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers conducted telephone surveys of about 1,000 Ohioans
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The people surveyed were asked about subjects like the amount
they owed on credit cards, the number of credit cards they used,
whether they were in default and how their debts compared with
their incomes.
</P>
<P>
   Then they were asked some standard questions used to measure
stress and health, including how much they worried about their
debt, how much they weighed and how well they could perform simple
tasks like walking up stairs or carrying groceries.
</P>
<P>
   Although not all their theories were borne out, the researchers
said they had found significantly more health problems reported
among those with the worst debt-income ratio.
</P>
<P>
   For doctors trying to assess a patient's overall health,
Lavrakas said, the findings suggest that they consider asking about
debt.
</P>
<P>
   Credit card companies, he said, should consider changing ``the
ease with which they're making and aggressively going after
opportunities to let people put themselves in debt.''
</P>
<P>
   TACKLING THE PROBLEMS OF HEALTH ILLITERACY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On paper, the instructions for someone facing a barium enema
exam are not very complicated: follow the diet guidelines and take
the medicine to help empty the lower intestine. The procedure is
straightforward.
</P>
<P>
   But for many patients, doctors say, the first hurdle is not the
enema itself but the written instructions, which many people cannot
fully understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not aware how large this problem was when we started
looking at it,'' said Dr. William H. Mahood, a gastroenterologist
and the president of the American Medical Foundation, which has
just begun a program to try to counter what it calls health
illiteracy.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation, the philanthropic arm of the American Medical
Association, has raised $350,000 so far to develop ways to make
sure that patients who cannot read, or who read poorly, clearly
understand how to use the drugs they are prescribed or the
treatments they are being given.
</P>
<P>
   Foundation officials cited a recent study finding that 27
percent of English-speaking patients at a public hospital could not
read their appointment slips and that 42 percent did not understand
all the details on their prescription bottles.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors also pointed to a 1992 national adult literacy study
that found that 21 percent of Americans adults could not read the
front page of the newspaper, and that 48 percent had trouble
reading a bus schedule.

   TRIBUNE-NEWMEDIA (Chicago) _ Here in Chicago, the Tribune Co.
has been quietly transforming itself in recent years into what top
executives say is a new media company, which is funneling old media
content and ideas into television, cable, radio and internet
ventures. Before the deal, it had more than 16 television stations,
reaching more than a third of U.S. households. There were four
radio stations, an entertainment unit, a venture capital arm, and
an educational publishing unit. The company was an early investor
in America Online and Yahoo, and owns a 25 percent stake in the WB
television network and a 29 percent stake in cable television's
Food Network. By David Barboza.

   LOS ANGELES _ Question: The owner of the company brings his dog
to work, and I've always been afraid of dogs. The owner
half-jokingly says that his dog is the best judge of people, and
since the dog snarls at me, I must have some kind of problem. How
does this sound to you? G.B.
</P>
<P>
   A: There are increasing numbers of pets at work these days,
including dogs, cats, birds, and bunnies, and concern about a
manager showing favoritism toward a pet has taken on a whole new
meaning. Either way, no matter what kind of pet may be in the
company menagerie, it should not be snarling at anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Pets in the work environment have been linked to reduced stress
and tension, along with an increased sense of family atmosphere,
but this is not the case when such pets view various employees as
possible intruders or biscuits. Although the owner may claim that
if his pet is snarling at you, the problem must be you, the real
problem is the pet and the owner.
</P>
<P>
   If the owner enjoys seeing employees squirm in the presence of
his pet, then the owner as well as his pet could use some obedience
training. The snarling pet may be a funny joke for him, but there
is not much laughter when increases in tension cause an accident,
when communication lines are blocked because employees fear going
into the owner's office, or when an employee contacts an attorney
because poochie's bite was worse than its bark.
</P>
<P>
   When you need to meet with the owner, ask him to please put the
dog on a leash, let it go for a walk, have it fetch the paper, or
have it occupied or restrained in some other way. This should not
create a problem, but if it does, then perhaps the whole company is
going to the dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When I joined this company, I was told that there would be
many opportunities for training. So far, the three programs that I
was supposed to attend were canceled at the last minute without any
explanation, and none have been rescheduled. My manager told me
that more will be on the way, but that was two months ago and there
have been none. Any suggestions? T.C.
</P>
<P>
   A: Sometimes people who put on training programs need training
in employee communication, motivation, and follow-up. There may be
some good reasons for canceling a training program, but there are
no good reasons for doing so without any explanation. Managerial
silence in this type of situation actually speaks loudly in terms
of the company's commitment not only to employee education, but to
the employees themselves.
</P>
<P>
   You should meet with the individual who handles the training
programs, express your disappointment over the cancellations, and
ask if there are plans to reschedule. Your meeting should provide
you with a better understanding of the company's commitments and
objectives in the training area, along with the training
opportunities available to you.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it is important to remember that there are
countless classes and programs offered in local colleges,
universities, and online. Although it is disheartening if your
company does not keep its commitment to education, the most
important commitment to education is the one you make to yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am not sure how to deal with a manager who gives too much
recognition. Every time any of us do anything, he pours lavish
praise upon us. This is getting to be a distraction and even a
joke, and several of us are wondering if we should say something.
E.W.
</P>
<P>
   A: Excessive positive feedback can be as uplifting and
motivational as background noise. However, of all the problems that
one can face in the workplace, excessive thanks is one of the least
problematic.
</P>
<P>
   Some managers operate under the erroneous assumption that if
some recognition is a powerful motivator, then constant recognition
should be the ultimate motivator. Although some employees may in
fact react positively to your manager's feedback style, the most
effective managers understand the importance of varying their
managerial styles to fit the needs and motivations of their
employees. And, many remember from introductory psychology that
intermittent reinforcement is far more motivational than constant
reinforcement. There is no (ital) one size fits (end ital)
managerial style, but that is what your manager has adopted.
</P>
<P>
   Since this matter has the potential to interfere with
communication, respect, and performance in the department, you
should discuss it with your manager. You are not coming at him with
criticism, but rather with some thoughts about the ways to improve
departmental operations. This type of feedback is very valuable,
and certainly worthy of some recognition. It will be quite
revealing to see if he provides it.

PUSHING THE LIMITS OF SCIENCE, AND OF PUBLIC RELATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Science Times)  
(Lawrence M. Krauss is head of the physics department at Case
Western Reserve University and the author of ``The Physics of Star
Trek.'') 
(ms) 
 By LAWRENCE M. KRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few months ago, an e-mail message reached my desk from an
Energy Department official saying that so many calls had been
placed to the White House about a news item on the Web that plans
were under way to brief the president.
</P>
<P>
   This is perhaps not out of the ordinary. But what makes the
story unusual is the subject of the article.
</P>
<P>
   An online news network reported that a ``world-destroying black
hole'' might be formed in experiments about to begin at the
Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island. This is probably the
first time ever that anyone even considered briefing a president
about a black hole.
</P>
<P>
   The uproar began as a result of a letter to Scientific American
suggesting that Brookhaven physicists, in an effort to smash heavy
nuclei with sufficient energy to make them momentarily merge into a
kind of ``quark soup,'' might accidentally create a black hole that
would swallow the entire Earth. It sounds like the stuff of science
fiction.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that the real goals of the experiment can also be
made to sound like science fiction. In an understandable effort to
raise interest in their program, Brookhaven officials, like those
at other accelerator laboratories, had announced that they were
attempting to reproduce the conditions of the earliest moments of
the Big Bang, the vast explosion that created our entire visible
universe. This is scary stuff. No wonder someone got concerned.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with taking this literally, of course, is that the
scale is all wrong. The collision between a pair of gold nuclei is
a whopper on a subatomic scale. But the total amount of energy in
the collision is sufficient to heat up a teaspoon of water by about
1 millionth of a degree. This emergency would have to be multiplied
by some incredible new chain reaction even to be noticeable without
sophisticated measuring apparatus.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, in the earliest moments of the Big Bang there was
more energy stored in a region the size of an atom than the Sun
will emit in its entire lifetime. Perhaps more important, cosmic
rays from space have been bombarding nuclei on Earth for billions
of years with more energy than would be deposited in the Brookhaven
collisions. The fact that we are still here is pretty good evidence
that Brookhaven is not likely to destroy the world.
</P>
<P>
   The intentions of the Brookhaven press office were good, of
course. The reasoning, I am assuming, was that to interest the
public, the program had to sound ``sexy.'' There is a discouraging
trend of late, however, that promotes hype in science. Unless
scientific ideas or discovery are earth shattering _ if not
literally, then figuratively _ then they don't seem to be
newsworthy.
</P>
<P>
   The problem here is that most developments in science, including
the most important ones, are usually incremental. Rarely does a
single result really ``revolutionize'' a field, even though we read
this over and over when discoveries are described.
</P>
<P>
   The same day the Internet story surfaced, a prime-time
television program was broadcast on, of all things, string theory.
This highly mathematical area of particle physics is being
developed in the hope that some day it will explain the nature of
all the known forces.
</P>
<P>
   On the program, I heard that protons are made of quarks, which
has been experimentally verified. But in the same breath I was told
that quarks are made of strings, a statement that has no basis in
fact. I also was surprised to learn that if we could actually
discover strings, we might open doors to interstellar travel and
perhaps even time travel.
</P>
<P>
   Now, string theory may have the potential to enhance our picture
of reality. But it hasn't. This doesn't diminish its interest for
physicists, but it is premature to hail it in public. It has been
around for almost 20 years, but it has yet to address or resolve a
single observational issue associated with the physical universe.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a very impressive record when contrasted with major
theoretical developments of this century _ general relativity and
quantum mechanics, for example, which were developed to address
observational issues, and whose predictions met the test of
experiment before being lionized.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately the biggest danger in trumpeting theories prematurely
is that most theories, regardless of their potential or beauty,
turn out to be wrong. If we wish science to remain more credible to
the public than pseudoscience, we have to be very careful about the
claims we make.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to popularize science and not fall prey to the
tendency to hype. I readily admit my own guilt, having recently
learned the hard way how overstating the case may backfire. After
writing in a book about the remote theoretical possibility of warp
drive _ something that might be possible in principle, but most
likely never in practice _ I saw some of my hype used on the one
hand in ill-advised proposals by NASA engineers to try to design
warp drives now, and on the other by people who argue that aliens
must be using warp drives to come here to abduct Earthlings.
</P>
<P>
   But avoiding hype in science is more important than ever,
because it is clear that many in the public cannot distinguish
claims of scientists from those of pseudoscientists.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics speak for themselves. A recent Gallup poll
indicated that 47 percent of American adults believed humans came
into existence 10,000 years ago, in spite of evidence to the
contrary.
</P>
<P>
   The recent school board ruling in Kansas, removing almost any
mention of evolution in the state's required curriculum,
demonstrates that even elected officials, who may provide money for
science or education, don't really have a good handle on what makes
science tick.
</P>
<P>
   Baby steps may not make headlines, but, usually, carry the day
eventually. Our modern technology is testament to their power. We
shouldn't need the hype. At the same time, the public should be
warned that the same rules apply to science news as any to other
news. Most often, a little common sense, and a dose of skepticism,
can separate the wheat from the chaff.

THE CITY THEN, NOW AND FOREVER ON FILE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By RALPH BLUMENTHAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Smile, New York. You're getting your picture taken.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; All &LR;  New York.
</P>
<P>
   In an ambitious effort to expand an already vast photo archive
showing practically every street in the five boroughs as long ago
as the 1870s, the New York Public Library is preparing to repeat
the process to match many of the 54,000 old views with contemporary
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps 30,000 of the existing images now part of the library's
new Milstein history division in the Humanities and Social Sciences
Library at Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street are the work of an
enigmatic and unsung shutterbug named Percy Loomis Sperr. Though
often on crutches after a bout of childhood meningitis that killed
his sister and brother, he roamed the city from the 1920s to the
'40s snapping street scenes of haunting ordinariness, if not
banality, as Official Photographer for the City of New York _
whatever that meant. The updated portrait of New York would to some
extent retrace his footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are incredible times of real estate development, and the
beginning of the century is a wonderful time to capture what is
there,'' said William D. Walker, the public library's Andrew W.
Mellon director of research libraries.
</P>
<P>
   Although the library has yet to raise the projected $750,000
budget, Walker voiced confidence in an interview that the project
would go forward next year, with 14 photographers working as long
as two years. The results would be digitized for easy computer
access by preservationists, planners, builders, writers and
moviemakers. Many of the original pictures, to which the library
holds the rights, will also be digitized as part of a library-wide
effort to record its holdings on computer, Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   Paul LeClerc, president of the library, called the project an
``ingenious'' one that would expand the library's role from
repository and preserver of history to generator of new
information.
</P>
<P>
   The effort grows out of the library's new Irma and Paul Milstein
Division of United States History, Local History and Genealogy,
which opened in January in a restored suite on its first floor
overlooking Bryant Park. The renamed section, created with a $5
million gift from the Milsteins, a family of developers and
philanthropists, brings together microfilm and other research
materials long scattered in other parts of the library and a
specialized staff to handle public inquiries, particularly on
genealogical research, which draws about half the visitors to the
division.
</P>
<P>
   In a private dedication ceremony on Jan. 23, LeClerc and the
library's chairman, Samuel C. Butler, said the gift would secure
one of the library's prized collections. Mike Wallace, co-author of
the voluminous history ``Gotham,'' which made extensive use of the
library's local history archives, said, ``I'm suffused with joy
each time I walk into this treasure house.''
</P>
<P>
   Abby S. Milstein, a lawyer, a trustee of the library and a
daughter-in-law of the donors, said in a statement this week that
the gift sought to convey the family's ``deep appreciation for the
New York Public Library as a source of knowledge which is freely
available to all.'' Paul and Irma Milstein, she said, ``shared the
library's vision of a beautiful space where all users can encounter
great intellectual treasures and examine the record of our shared
and personal histories.''
</P>
<P>
   The archive of 54,000 photographs in the library's local history
collection has long been known to scholars, researchers and even
filmmakers, who have used the prints to create authentic sets for
movies like ``The Godfather'' and ``The Great Gatsby.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What people don't know,'' said Ruth Carr, chief of the
Milstein division, ``is that it's so large because of the work that
Percy Loomis Sperr did.''
</P>
<P>
   Sperr, who once wrote ``I am not much of a camera fan'' but saw
himself rather as a storyteller of ``the tale of the City of New
York,'' died in 1964 at 75.
</P>
<P>
   His New York is a city of horse-drawn milk wagons and brooding
mansions, snack bar shacks and clamorous shipping docks, fleeting
men in straw hats, strangely empty streets and demolition sites
destined for skyscrapers like the Woolworth Building.
</P>
<P>
   Organized in file folders by street numbers and names with the
date and a description of each view noted on the back, the photos
play tricks with memory and landscape. A long-vanished movie house
playing a Rin Tin Tin film juts from 74th Street at First Avenue in
Manhattan. A hulking fortress _ once the Jewish Memorial Hospital _
rises out of the forested hills of Inwood Park at Dyckman Street
near the Hudson River, where ferries plied the waters to Fort Lee,
N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The library will not try to reshoot all 54,000 old sites or even
all of the 30,000 Sperr locations, officials said. Rather it will
concentrate on places, particularly in Manhattan but in the other
boroughs as well, where there has been dramatic change.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Despite Sperr's extensive work for the library, little is known
about him, Carr said. A manuscript article by A.J. Peluso Jr. based
on archives from Staten Island and other Sperr haunts says that he
was born in Columbus, Ohio, in 1889, graduated from Oberlin College
in 1912 and migrated to New York around 1924, hoping to find work
as a writer and to illustrate his writings with his photographs.
But picture-taking soon took precedence.
</P>
<P>
   He was often asked, he wrote in 1934, ``Is that all you do, just
go around taking pictures?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' he would answer. ``Taking a few thousand pictures a
year and selling enough of them to pay most of the expense does not
leave much time for anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said: ``My own interest is rather in the story than in
the picture. It is the picture which tells the story. As literally
as possible, I would use the `universal language' and `say it with
photographs.' The story which interests me is one which lends
itself to unlimited photography _ the tale of the City of New
York.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow _ it was never clear how, Peluso wrote _ Sperr became
known as Official Photographer of the City of New York and recorded
major groundbreakings, demolitions and civic ceremonies. Those
photos are plainly documentary, without notable artistic
flourishes.
</P>
<P>
   World War II limited his access to the waterfront, and his
picture-taking declined. A 1943 letter in the library files states:
``Percy Sperr came to 204 last week and announced that he had gone
into the secondhand book and print business on a small scale,
specializing in material pertaining to New York. He has an office
on Staten Island, near his home.''
</P>
<P>
   He opened a used-book store and sold poetry and old comic books,
three for a dime. He admitted occasionally drifting off to sleep,
``which isn't good for business.''
</P>
<P>
   But his business card still listed his wares: ``A growing
collection of over 30,000 views of New York Harbor; ships, old and
modern; skylines, dock scenes, harbor craft, sunsets, bridges,
naval vessels, New York City, all five boroughs; street scenes,
skyscrapers, old houses, foreign quarters, pushcarts, farms, old
New York scenes.''

   TRIBUNE-TIMESMIRROR (Undated) _ The Tribune Co. and Times Mirror
Co., two media companies whose flagship newspapers helped define
the brawling, partisan days of 19th century journalism, on Monday
announced plans to merge into a media company that would bring
their trademark regionalism to the multimedia world of the 21st
century. If nothing intervenes to disrupt the merger, the new
company, to be called Tribune Co., will own 11 daily newspapers, 22
television stations and four radio stations. But its core strategy
would be regional, with a mandate to deliver news, entertainment
and advertising through print, television and the Internet. By

   TRIBUNE-NEW-MEDIA (Chicago) _ Here in Chicago, the Tribune Co.
has been quietly transforming itself in recent years into what top
executives say is a new media company, which is funneling old media
content and ideas into television, cable, radio and internet
ventures. Before the deal, it had more than 16 television stations,
reaching more than a third of U.S. households. There were four
radio stations, an entertainment unit, a venture capital arm and an
educational publishing unit. The company was an early investor in
America Online and Yahoo, and owns a 25 percent stake in the WB

Times Mirror spelled nothing but bad news for Tribune shareholders
on Monday. Already battered on fears that the newspaper industry is
headed for lower earnings growth, Tribune fell more than 17
percent. But some media investors and analysts said the sharp drop
in Tribune stock puzzled them. If approved, the deal will give
Tribune both a newspaper and a television station in the three
largest advertising markets in the United States -- New York, Los
Angeles, and Chicago. That combination should be attractive to
advertisers and give Tribune a head start in the furious
competition to build local-interest Web sites. By Alex Berenson.

`BASIL STREET BLUES': THE FATHER AND MOTHER OF THE BOY GROWN UP 
</HEADLINE>
  (Publication notes at end of review) 
(DW) 
 By RICHARD EDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The grandparents' household where young Michael Holroyd lodged
after his parents' divorce was quarrelsome to the point of
hysteria. The parrot in their conservatory repeated the finely
accented British howls and shrieks.
</P>
<P>
   Michael took quiet refuge at the town library, where he read
biographies: Hesketh Pearson on Wilde and Hazlitt, Hugh Kingsmill
on Dickens and Samuel Johnson. They allowed the boy, whose present
was bewilderingly chaotic, ``to find out what was going to happen
next in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a fair description of what Holroyd would come to write:
vividly narrative biographies of Lytton Strachey, Augustus John and
George Bernard Shaw. The impressive detail and agile reflection
rarely choke the flow of what would happen next. Biography as
resurrection, not the lavish 800-page interments conducted by quite
a few recent behemoths. (I did think that the Shaw was long, worked
rather conspicuously at resuscitating and answered more questions
than the Recording Angel itself might want to ask.)
</P>
<P>
   The soul of a biography should be not what do I (plus index
cards) know, but what don't I know? Holroyd's new book, ``Basil
Street Blues'' makes a wonderfully illuminating use of `I don't
know'.
</P>
<P>
   It is not his most finished work _ it hardly could be _ but it
may be his most remarkable. It is the biographer's equivalent of
``Physician heal thyself.'' Cursing the dawn church bells, the
French round demands: ``When will they toll the bell-ringer's
death?'' When will the biographer turn his questions on himself?
``My identity was shaped by what I wrote, though this identity was
concealed behind the people I wrote about,'' Holroyd tells us. No
longer. This biography of his parents and family barely conceals an
autobiography. If it is hard to strip yourself naked, try lace
pajamas, extensively ripped. What Holroyd knows about his parents
has gaping holes in it. Instead of patching, he asks, What do I see
through them? He peers in and out, interrogating his materials and
himself as he interrogates them. His double journey through his
parents' lives and his own lacks the safety of a destination or a
conclusion but it is more revealing for it.
</P>
<P>
   Basil Holroyd and Ulla Knutsson-Hall were two parts that never
made one parental whole. He was an English eccentric and she a
Swedish one, each of an opposite type. Basil, in a line of
dwindling fortunes (his grandfather was a major general, his father
a gentlemanly and inefficient businessman), carried faith in a
rational center to daffy extremes. He was a King Canute standing
firmly on the shores of practicality and repeatedly getting washed
away.
</P>
<P>
   Over his 80-year-life he embarked upon one plausibly argued
scheme after the other, none of which worked out. After a spell in
his own father's failing business he rolled up large orders selling
concrete structures for a company unable to produce them. He went
into carbon paper, then building lumber. He wrote five unpublished
novels and collaborated with Michael _ still looking for his own
literary path _ on a history of the world in hexameters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave the impression of someone who had overshot success and
landed somewhere else,'' his son writes of a father who to the end
figured in his own mind as a fount of sober paternal instruction.
</P>
<P>
   Ulla, from a powerful and aristocratic Stockholm family, emitted
no shred of instruction other than, perhaps, to be happy and keep
fed. Her eccentricity was free-form without the slightest nodding
reference to a center. Sailing to England at 18, ostensibly to
study English but mostly to have fun, she was captivated by an
unstoppable talker buzzing about the captain's table. Basil got her
to marry him. They did have fun in London for a while; then when
the war began and Michael was 4, Basil took them to live with his
parents in the country. ``Disaster!'' Ulla wrote in a retrospective
note. ``END really of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it was the end of a detour. Beautiful and
sought-after, she worked for a while as a model while taking up
with several wealthy protectors, two of whom she married and
divorced. It was not the money she was after but the pleasure:
travel, parties, good hotels, nice things. There was an innocence;
she dug virtually no gold out of her consorts. This not impractical
grasshopper ended, nevertheless, as hard up as Basil the wildly
impractical ant.
</P>
<P>
   He, too, was divorced three times. It took five marriages for
them to produce one child, Holroyd reflects: himself. Through the
turbulence and in no way reducing it we get remarkably limpid
portraits of Ulla, Basil and the son who searches their lives.
</P>
<P>
   There is Michael as life-preserving mouse, skittering about his
grandparents' sinking ship. It is the shipwreck of old age,
finally, portrayed with comedy and a splinter of anguish. There are
his school days at Eton (who would have thought a fresh account
could still be made?), his splendidly thoughtful discussion of a
biographer's ethics _ brought to ground dealing with his own family
_ and his patient, wryly painful care of his parents in their
declining days.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of their lives, Holroyd asked Ulla and Basil to
write what they could remember of their lives, offering to pay them
for ``research.'' His mother took the money blithely; his father
refused it. ``He wanted to give money and receive praise; he found
it impossible to receive money and give praise.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 70s this painfully prickly man would visit his crippled
sister weekly to fix meals she didn't like and offer advice she
liked less. ``Unfortunately, to help people, he had to make sure
that they were worse off than he was. This was increasingly
difficult. He was so impoverished now that being the target of his
help became a peculiarly depressing experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Holroyd does not force or inflate his search through memory. His
speculative urgency _ who were these parents and who am I? _
recognizes the limits of answers. He possesses emotional elegance.
His sentences possess clean lines and a shapely balance. Difficult
and elusive, Basil and Ulla make movingly human claims upon their
son and through him upon us.

THE `HOT SPOT' APPROACH TO SAVING SPECIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Science Times)  
(ms) 
 By WILLIAM K. STEVENS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For many conservationists, prospects for maintaining the earth's
biological diversity are dim at best.
</P>
<P>
   People and their activities are forcing plants and animals into
extinction at 100 to 1,000 times the natural rate.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, once ecosystems lose key species, they are not likely
to recover their full function and biotic variety in less than
about 10 million years, according to a new analysis by Dr. James W.
Kirchner, an earth scientist at the University of California at
Berkeley, and Dr. Anne Weil, a vertebrate paleontologist at Duke
University. The scientists, who based their conclusion on studies
of fossils, reported their findings in the current issue of the
journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
   But other scientists say that there may be a practical way to
stem the tide of extinction markedly, by concentrating conservation
efforts and funds on a relatively small number of highly vulnerable
``hot spots'' that each contain a large concentration of species
found nowhere else.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that there are species hot spots is not new; it was
proposed some years ago by Dr. Norman Myers, an ecologist based at
Oxford University's Green College in England. But now, in recent
study published in Nature, he and four colleagues have tried to
delineate the hot spots more precisely. The results are delineated
on the map above.
</P>
<P>
   Hot spots were defined in the study as places having the
greatest concentration of what are called endemic species _ those
found nowhere else _ while at the same time experiencing
exceptional loss of habitat.
</P>
<P>
   Loss of endemic species accounts for most modern-day
extinctions, and the hot spots therefore constitute ``the front
line in the battle to save biodiversity,'' said Dr. Russell A.
Mittermeier, the president of Conservation International, a
conservation group that advocates the hot spot approach.
Mittermeier was one of Myers' co-authors.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis found that as many as 44 percent of all species of
vascular plants and 35 percent of major vertebrate species lived in
25 hot spots comprising just 1.4 percent of all the land on earth,
predominantly tropical forests.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, the researchers wrote, open the way for ``a
`silver bullet' strategy on the part of conservation planners.''
The researchers said that about 40 percent of the land involved was
already under protection, and that $500 million over the next five
years _ about twice the cost of a single Mars pathfinder mission _
``could go far toward safeguarding the hot spots.'' That, Dr.
Mittermeier said, is an achievable goal.
</P>
<P>
   The hot spot strategy, he said, ``makes the biodiversity crisis
a bit more manageable,'' and so it ``makes sense to concentrate a
significant portion of our resources and effort on these areas.
Conversely, if we let the hot spots degrade further, we're going to
lose a large proportion of global biodiversity regardless of how
successful we are elsewhere.'' The study assumes that protecting
plants and vertebrates will also protect the majority of
invertebrate species like insects, which account for at least 95
percent of all species.
</P>
<P>
   Some studies have shown that the richness of one group of
species cannot necessarily be predicted from the richness of
another. But if the researchers have captured 30 percent to 50
percent of all plant and large animal species in their hot spot
analysis, ``it means they're probably going to capture pretty much
30 to 50 percent of everything,'' said Dr. Stuart Pimm, an
ecologist at Columbia University, who wrote a commentary on the
Myers paper in Nature.
</P>
<P>
   The study was done with ``extraordinary care and numeric
detail,'' he said, adding that the result is ``one of the most
remarkably optimistic statements about biodiversity that we have
ever seen.''

<P>
   MIAMI _ The Miami Dolphins' millionaire quarterback was beloved
for his heart-squeezing comeback drives, for his quick release and
his perfect, arching spiral, and for his toughness, for playing
with a battered body that seemed as if it would fall to pieces if
he untied all the knee braces, ankle splints and rib protectors he
wore into battle.
</P>
<P>
   But what Mike Vogt, a fan, will miss most is the feeling that,
every time he saw the famous Dan Marino at work, he was seeing a
boy at play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what we all loved about him was he had this boyish
joy,'' said Vogt, after he learned Monday that the National
Football League's record-shattering passer and South Florida's most
famous sports celebrity had finally, officially retired. ``We all
felt that.''
</P>
<P>
   Marino would smile and even hop in the air like a little boy
when he completed a long pass, and would pout and fret, his face a
bright, shining red, when he was intercepted or a receiver dropped
the ball, recalled the Dolphin fans who were really, at heart,
Marino fans.
</P>
<P>
   It was as if, depending on the situation, he was always on the
verge of either snatching up the ball and going home, or
celebrating with a glass of chocolate milk.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he'd throw the ball, he'd just grin like a 10-year-old
would,'' said Vogt, a computer programmer in Boca Raton who has
been a Marino fan for all of his 17 years as a Dolphin. ``He was
magic.''
</P>
<P>
   Marino, who threw the football down field, with varying results,
more times than anyone in professional football ever has, will not
throw for the Dolphins _ or for anyone else _ ever again. And in
South Florida, even though his retirement had been rumored for
months, people who followed Miami football reacted with a mix of
gloom and relief.
</P>
<P>
   After a disappointing year in which he played injured and played
as a mortal, not the superstar who built a legend, he chose to
retire at age 38 rather than attempt a comeback with the Dolphins
or another team. He watched a young, strong backup win games in his
place, and it became clear that the future did not include him here
in the city that worshiped him, at least not in an aqua-and-orange
uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sundays will not be the same,'' said Richard Molinary, a
customer service representative who works in Hollywood, north of
Miami in Broward County.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be like something's not quite right,'' said Molinary,
who has a fame of his own in Florida sports circles as the
often-photographed ``Miami Fanatic,'' because he paints his face in
Dolphin colors and wears a Dolphins towel like a cape. ``I started
my career when he started his, in 1983, so I've watched him game
after game for all these years. They've been some of the best years
of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Molinary and other fans winced as injuries to Marino's knees and
ankles took their toll, as their hero took the field in football
cleats that were so built-up and padded that they looked more like
the boots worn by Frankenstein's monster. At times, it seemed like
Marino was so tightly bound and strapped that the only thing that
really moved was his arm.
</P>
<P>
   It does not matter to people who loved him that Marino's last
game was a 62-7 playoff loss at Jacksonville. ``He is the Babe Ruth
of football,'' Molinary said, standing outside the Dolphins'
training camp in Davie Monday, as inside, Marino announced his
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Marino did not cry; he just seemed as if someone had let all the
air out of him, even as the Dolphins' owner, H. Wayne Huizenga,
told him he would have a statue erected of Marino outside Pro
Player Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to miss Sunday afternoons,'' Marino said.
</P>
<P>
   Marino became a superstar when Miami was a greatly different
city, when English, not Spanish, was still the principal language
and the region had only the Dolphins _ there was no professional
basketball, hockey or baseball in Miami then.
</P>
<P>
   Now Miami is generally regarded as the financial, cultural and
entertainment capital of Latin America, where international soccer
crowds fill the Orange Bowl. In downtown Miami, where the
storefront signs are mostly in Spanish and the pedestrians, many of
them new Americans, talk of everything but football, Marino's
retirement was barely noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could care less about football or Dan Marino,'' said Lydia
Martin, speaking in Spanish at a courtyard restaurant in downtown
Miami. ``They make him sound like he's God.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make a difference in my personal life,'' said
Martin, who was born in Colombia and has been living in Miami for
three years.
</P>
<P>
   While his retirement was covered by Spanish-language television,
radio and newspapers, Marino's fan base has mostly moved north to
Broward and Palm Beach counties, along with most of the region's
Anglos. Even the Dolphins' stadium itself has moved north, from the
Orange Bowl in downtown Miami to up near the Broward line.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's part of the old Miami,'' said Tony Segreto, an anchor for
WTVJ, the NBC affiliate in Miami, and co-host of Marino's
television show. But, said Segreto, he also drew many new fans from
the new Miami, in the way only a superstar athlete could. ``I don't
think an athlete can ever have the same impact on this town.''
</P>
<P>
   After every famous athlete's retirement, fans and media exhaust
superlatives in creating their legend. But in Miami, say longtime
fans and friends, Marino will be remembered almost as much for what
he did not do as for what he did.
</P>
<P>
   He never won a Super Bowl, ``the burning desire, what I played
for,'' said Marino, who lost his one chance in a 1985 loss to Joe
Montana and the San Francisco 49ers, 38-16.
</P>
<P>
   But, unlike so many sports superstars of the past decade, he
never embarrassed himself in the community he represented. He was
never arrested driving drunk, doing or buying cocaine, soliciting a
prostitute, resisting arrest at a wild party or become entangled in
a nasty paternity suit, said fans. ``He's the kind you want to
emulate,'' said Kenny Dorsey, the freshman starting quarterback at
the University of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of making headlines with the police, Marino made them by
adopting a Chinese baby, Niki Lin, with his wife, Claire, rescuing
the child from an orphanage. He spent and raised millions for
charities. In 1992 he established the Dan Marino Foundation to
benefit children's charities, and did television commercials with
his autistic son, Michael, to help raise money.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's become more than just the guy who throws the ball,'' said
Jimmy Cefalo, who played football with the Dolphins and Marino as a
wide receiver.
</P>
<P>
   His former coach, Don Shula, summed up his quarterback's time in
Miami this way:
</P>
<P>
   ``You just want to applaud.''  &QL;

 By CHARLES NOBLES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVIE, Fla. _ As Dan Marino gave his farewell speech Sunday
after 17 years as the Miami Dolphins quarterback and the National
Football League's most dominant career passing record-holder, he
tried to avoid making eye contact with his wife, Claire, who sat
sobbing nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept telling Claire that I can't cry during this thing,''
Marino said after formally announcing his retirement at the
Dolphins' training facility at Nova Southeastern University. ``I
felt many a time like crying, but I was able to hold back. Tried to
make a few jokes and keep it loose.''
</P>
<P>
   Marino, whose NFL career records include most touchdown passes
(420), most passing yards (61,361) and most completions (4,967),
said he decided to bring his playing career to a close at age 38
mostly because of his health. He has had six knee operations,
ruptured an Achilles' tendon and last season suffered a scary neck
injury that sidelined him for five games.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are physical limitations I would have had to deal
with,'' he said. ``It kept coming back to how my legs felt during
last season going through the neck injury and not knowing whether I
was going to be able to throw the football.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Dolphins indicated by their long, awkward silence that
their interest in Marino had waned, he was temporarily invigorated
by an offer from the Minnesota Vikings. Coach Dennis Green was so
interested in Marino that he offered to let him fly home after
every Sunday game and not return until Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Marino said he had gone through a number of emotional swings
before deciding last Thursday morning to retire. ``There were times
I told Claire we were going and two hours later I'd say, `No, I
don't think I can go,''' he said. ``It is the toughest thing I had
to deal with professionally in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   A source close to Marino said that if the Dolphins had shown as
much enthusiasm for his continuing to play as the Vikings had, he
would likely still be a Dolphin. ``He probably would have gone to
training camp, to see how he felt physically, and then take it from
there,'' the source said.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins have been widely perceived by their fans as
bungling the handling of Marino's status, and hundreds of fans
showed up to give No. 13 a raucous sendoff.
</P>
<P>
   The team's owner, H. Wayne Huizenga, tried to defuse some of the
tension by making several announcements: retiring Marino's No. 13
jersey; saying that a statue of Marino would be placed at Pro
Player Stadium next to one of Don Shula, the Hall of Fame coach;
naming a street near the stadium after Marino, and saying he would
install Marino into the Dolphins' Ring of Honor at their first home
game next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``To put it simply, Danny, nobody did it better than you; you
are the greatest quarterback ever,'' Huizenga said before the pair
hugged.
</P>
<P>
   Shula attended Monday's announcement, as did former Dolphins
Mark Clayton, Dwight Stephenson, Jimmy Cefalo, Kim Bokamper and Joe
Rose. Jimmy Johnson, the recently retired Dolphins coach, was
conspicuously absent, and his successor, Dave Wannstedt, stayed in
the background and left quickly afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between Johnson and Marino became particularly
acrimonious last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would just have to say that our relationship was up and down
at times,'' Marino said. ``We had some great, great days together
and some fun times. And times I wasn't very happy here while he was
coaching, and that is just being honest.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose, a former tight end who became a local television
broadcaster, caught the first touchdown of Marino's NFL career in
1983 against the Raiders, after the rookie from Pittsburgh relieved
David Woodley. But Rose, Marino's roommate on the road,
particularly recalled an occasion when they woke up in Baltimore on
game day to find it snowing hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looks like a four-touchdown day,'' Rose quoted Marino as
saying. ``I said, `You've got to be kidding me.' But that was just
the kind of confidence he had. And he went out and had a great
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Clayton, who teamed with Mark Duper to catch 1,030 of Marino's
passes for 16,743 yards and 134 touchdowns, said they used to kid
the quarterback that they were saving his reputation with acrobatic
catches taken from defenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd tell him that he'd be nothing without us,'' Clayton said.
``He'd dispute that. He'd say, `No, no, no. You didn't make me. I
make you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Clayton said that he and Duper became so comfortable with Marino
that sometimes the quarterback would abandon the usual play calls.
``He'd just say, `Get open, the ball's coming to you,' '' Clayton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Marino was the last of five quarterbacks taken in the first
round in 1983. But that 27th pick soon had Shula's eyes bulging.
Marino passed for a league-record 48 touchdowns in 1984, then had
44 two seasons later, making him the only player in NFL history to
throw at least 40 touchdown passes twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never felt you were out of a ball game with Dan Marino as
your quarterback,'' Shula said. ``Today is the celebration of a
great career _ an unmatched career, really.''

 &HT;    Reports may spell future for interest rate hike

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Wall Street braced today for the first of a series of
economic reports that may add impetus to another interest rate
increase, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   The government's February retail sales report is expected to be
a strong 1.1 percent, and even a brisk 0.6 percent without auto
sales. The January increase was 0.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That would be a negative for stocks if it is perceived as
additional ammunition for the Federal Reserve to raise interest
rates again when it meets March 21.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has indicated that the
Fed is particularly concerned about consumer spending, and will
raise rates until economic activity slows to a less inflationary
pace. The Fed has raised rates four times since last June.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's market was mixed, opening with widespread losses
following news that Japan's economy had dropped back into a
recession. The 2.8 percent drop in Japan's Nikkei stock average
triggered selling in Asia and Europe before U.S. markets opened.
</P>
<P>
   But the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average rallied during
the day as investors shopped for bargains among recently hard-hit
consumer stocks, including Procter &AMP; Gamble.
</P>
<P>
   The technology-loaded Nasdaq composite fell 2.8 percent,
however, as investors converted last week's technology gains into
profits. The Nasdaq topped 5,000 last week for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead, Prudential Securities analyst Michelle Girard
said both producer (Thursday) and consumer (Friday) price indexes
for February ``will be boosted by a rise in food and gasoline
prices.''

 &HT;    Bush, Gore to wage war for dwing states
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ While Texans vote in today's ex-post-facto
presidential primaries, the men who already have sewn up the
nominations are looking toward the key states that could determine
November's winner.
</P>
<P>
   Most national polls show a tight race between Republican Gov.
George W. Bush and Democratic Vice President Al Gore. But those
surveys are measuring numbers that do not count.
</P>
<P>
   Come November, all that matters are electoral votes. It's a
50-state presidential battle that could be decided by swing states
that have swung Democratic in recent White House races.
</P>
<P>
   The targeted key states include California, Ohio, Michigan,
Missouri and Pennsylvania, which offer a total of 127 electoral
votes. All five went Democratic in 1992 and 1996 after siding with
the GOP in 1984 and 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Four of those states already have held primaries, complete with
exit polls that offer a glimpse of what's going in voters' minds.
So far, the numbers show ups and downs for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Voters in another potential swing state, Florida, head to the
polls for primaries today. Also on today's primary schedule are
Louisiana, Tennessee, Oklahoma and Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   On the GOP side, 341 delegates are available today, more than
enough for Bush to top the 1,034 needed to clinch the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, 566 delegates will be awarded today and
Gore could top the 2,170 needed for nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The races ended last week when Democrat Bill Bradley and
Republican John McCain gave up the chase. Former Ambassador Alan
Keyes remains in the GOP battle, but has collected only a handful
of delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Texas voters today also will be picking nominees for the U.S.
Senate, two Railroad Commission seats, several statewide
judgeships, half the state Senate, the entire Texas House, the
30-member congressional delegation and local posts.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP ballot also includes a non-binding question on whether
student-initiated prayer should be allowed at school sporting
events.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush and Gore, the focus is beyond the primary season that
ends June 6. Both sides are working to put together the 270
electoral votes needed.
</P>
<P>
   The battle starts with an assumption that Bush should carry the
19 states (with 159 electoral votes) that unsuccessful GOP nominee
Bob Dole got in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent polls around the nation show Bush leading in
states with 284 electoral votes. Gore leads in states with 193.
</P>
<P>
   California, with 54 electoral votes, is the big prize. Electoral
College math says Gore cannot win without carrying California. Bush
can, though the task becomes more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Bush believes a high-tech core in Silicon Valley, combined with
a chance to do better among Hispanics than Republicans ever have,
can add up to a November victory in California.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Gore went head-to-head, sort of, in last Tuesday's
California primary. In the nonpartisan ``beauty contest'' open to
all voters, Gore collected 2.3 million votes (35 percent of those
cast) to Bush's 1.9 million (28 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Republicans might be able to crunch that into a victory by
figuring that the 1.6 million (23 percent) Californians who voted
for McCain are likely to be Bush backers in November.
</P>
<P>
   But a Monday missive from Mississippi shows how that could be
faulty math. Jim Bass, former Mississippi director of the McCain
campaign, is endorsing Gore as the candidate ``more in line with
the values and priorities'' of McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls from California also offered a glimpse of potential
November problems for Bush. Sixty-five percent of the voters said
abortion should be legal ``always'' or in ``most cases.'' Bush
believes abortion should be legal only in cases involving rape,
incest or a threat to the mother's life.
</P>
<P>
   Another potential November factor is that 54 percent of the
California voters who said abortion ``always'' should be legal
voted for McCain, which means, on that issue, they are more likely
to back Gore than Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Another indication that California might not be Bush country:
Exit polls showed Gore beating Bush 51 percent to 43 percent in
November. The same polls showed McCain would have beaten Gore by
five points.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls from recent primaries also offer some data about what
might happen in Missouri and Ohio (where Bush and Gore won their
primaries) and Michigan, where Bush lost to McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Among the interesting exit-poll numbers from last Tuesday's
Missouri primaries: Seventeen percent of the GOP voters said they'd
back Gore in a Bush-Gore November battle.
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio, 15 percent of the voters in last week's GOP primary
said they would vote for Gore over Bush in November, a number that
shows the challenge Bush faces in recruiting McCain backers.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan also presents a swing-state problem for Bush. Despite
the backing of Gov. John Engler, Bush was beaten by McCain in
Michigan. Exit polls there showed 31 percent of the Republican
primary voters saying Bush does not know enough to be president.
</P>
<P>
   In Pennsylvania, where Bush is backed by popular Gov. Tom Ridge,
a Keystone Poll in late February showed Bush in a dead heat with
Gore. Pennsylvania's GOP presidential primary is set for April 4.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Big Five swing states, others in the
up-for-grabs category include Illinois and New Jersey.You may

<P>
   When two scientists proposed in a recent book that rape was best
viewed as a sexual act with its roots in evolution, it set off a
squall of protest from feminists and social scientists, won the
researchers appearances on programs such as NBC's ``Dateline,'' and
became the talk of the cocktail party circuit. Even last week the
controversy continued, with the book's authors engaging in a
rancorous exchange over a critical review in the scientific journal
Nature.
</P>
<P>
   But the case put forward by Drs. Randy Thornhill and Craig
Palmer in ``A Natural History of Rape: Biological Bases of Sexual
Coercion,'' published last month by the MIT Press, was not, as some
assumed, a fringe theory developed by a pair of renegade
researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the arguments made by Thornhill and Palmer fit into a
larger theoretical framework, the work of a group of scientists who
have ushered Darwin into new and provocative areas, including
sexual attraction between men and women, parenting, jealousy and
violence, as well as less touchy regions like the learning of
language and the organization of perception.
</P>
<P>
   And while some of these researchers, who call their approach
``evolutionary psychology'' (other scientists view it as only one
way of approaching evolutionary psychology), would quibble with
some of the methods used and conclusions drawn by the authors of
the rape book, most would endorse the larger principles that
underlie the work.
</P>
<P>
   The general notion that much of what humans do today evolved in
the Pleistocene has seeped into popular culture, and some findings
have achieved the status of sound bites: ``Men are polygamous,
women monogamous,'' for example, or ``Women rank wealth and status
higher in selecting a mate; men put a higher priority on
reproductive potential.'' The actor Michael Douglas may have had
such precepts in mind when he was asked in a recent interview about
his engagement to an actress much younger than he. ``It's something
that has existed as long as time,'' he replied. ``As long as
history, there have been older men with younger women.''
</P>
<P>
   The scientists whose work is reflected in such statements,
albeit in oversimplified form, are not just trying to attract
public attention. They are trying to reshape psychology, placing at
its center the question of how the mind was ``designed'' by
evolution millions of years ago to solve specific problems faced by
human ancestors in an environment very different from the modern
world.
</P>
<P>
   In constructing this new psychology, evolutionary psychologists
have crafted a novel approach that differs in crucial respects from
other, more traditional ways of viewing the mind, and from methods
of other evolutionary scientists who study human behavior.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the researchers dispute the view that the human
mind is a ``general purpose computer'' that is programmed by
parents, schools and other cultural influences only after birth.
They see the mind as preprogrammed, made up of specialized
mechanisms _ ``modules'' or ``organs''_ that predispose all human
beings to think and act in certain ways, especially when it comes
to basic endeavors like selecting a mate, fighting off sexual
competitors, or deciding what is safe to eat.
</P>
<P>
   The genes for these complex mental mechanisms, the argument
goes, were passed on through the generations because they were
adaptive, enhancing survival or reproductive success, and
eventually, they spread widely and became standard equipment.
</P>
<P>
   But in the year 2000, such mechanisms may or may not be
adaptive, and may or may not represent aspects of behavior that
society wants to encourage. For example, even if rape was adaptive
in the distant past, a notion that even many of Thornhill and
Palmer's like-minded colleagues think dubious, that would not mean
that it is excusable or should not be heavily punished.
</P>
<P>
   Evolutionary psychologists argue that their job is to approach
the mind as an ancient engineering project, developing and testing
out hypotheses about what ``design problems'' needed solving, and
what universal mental structures might have been designed, by the
pressures to survive and reproduce, to solve them.
</P>
<P>
   Such an approach, they assert, offers a badly needed bridge
between psychology and the natural sciences, and will ultimately
provide a much firmer foundation for the understanding of human
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Psychologists should be interested in evolutionary biology for
the same reason that hikers should be interested in an aerial map
of an unfamiliar territory that they plan to explore on foot,''
wrote Drs. Leda Cosmides, John Tooby and John Barkow in the
introduction to ``The Adapted Mind: Evolutionary Psychology and the
Generation of Culture'' (Oxford, 1992). ``If they look at the map,
they are much less likely to lose their way.''
</P>
<P>
   Cosmides and her husband, Tooby, both professors at the
University of California at Santa Barbara, are widely regarded as
intellectual leaders of the evolutionary psychology school. Joined
by several other scientists, including Dr. Donald Symons, also at
Santa Barbara, and Drs. Margo Wilson and Martin Daly, both of
McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, they hammered out the
basic principles of their approach in the mid-1980s in a series of
meetings at a hotel in Palm Desert, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   In the intervening years, this nucleus has expanded to encompass
a wide variety of researchers in different areas, including Dr.
David M. Buss, a psychologist at the University of Texas, Thornhill
at the University of New Mexico and Dr. Steven Pinker, a
psychologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the
author of ``Words and Rules: The Ingredients of Language'' (Basic
Books, 1999) and ``How The Mind Works,'' (W.W. Norton, 1997).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Evolutionary psychologists have not always carried on their
campaign quietly.
</P>
<P>
   They have issued a noisy assault on the way the social sciences
have done business for the last 50 years, asserting that social
scientists have a collective phobia about possible biological
influences on behavior and an obsession with more ``politically
correct'' environmental explanations. Some researchers have thrust
their work into the spotlight by pursuing topics that seem
guaranteed to push people's emotional buttons, rape being only the
latest example.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, the scientists have gained a reputation for a
self-confidence bordering on arrogance, and a style of scholarly
debate so unapologetic and uncompromising that, as one observer put
it, ``They just make people mad.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps as a result, the scientists' work and occasionally the
scientists themselves have attracted no shortage of criticism, from
social scientists and within evolutionary science itself.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have assailed their scientific methods, suggested that
some work is tinged by sexism, and have disputed most of the major
tenets of the scientists' approach. And some worry that the studies
will be misused by politicians and advocacy groups, who are often
quick to blur the distinction between theory and fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is,'' said Dr. Jerry Coyne, an evolutionary biologist
at the University of Chicago and a co-author of the critical review
of Drs. Thornhill and Palmer's book in Nature, ``that evolutionary
psychology, except for its barest claims, remains highly
controversial, and there are ideological agendas on both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   THE BACKGROUND
</P>
<P>
   A DISTURBING LEGACY OF TWISTING DARWIN
</P>
<P>
   At the most basic level, some critics oppose any effort to link
evolution and human behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a whole bunch of people who think it's dehumanizing
to talk about humans in biological terms,'' said Dr. Robert Boyd,
an evolutionary anthropologist at the University of California at
Los Angeles. ``They think it's just kind of distasteful.''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, people confuse the ``biological'' approach of
evolutionary science, which seeks to understand how genes
contributed to the evolution of humans as a species, with the field
of behavioral genetics, which investigates to what extent heredity
accounts for how traits like shyness or schizophrenia vary from
person to person.
</P>
<P>
   But biology, applied to human behavior, also has a disturbing
history of misuse. College students in introductory courses are
taught the perils of ``social Darwinism,'' a 19th-century theory
that borrowed catch words of evolutionary thinking and twisted them
into a justification for class differences: the struggle for wealth
and power, social Darwinists argued, was a battle for ``survival of
the fittest,'' a term coined by Herbert Spencer, an English
philosopher.
</P>
<P>
   Darwin's theory, stretched and distorted in various ways, was
also called upon by the Nazis as a rationale for genocide, and has
been a staple of forced sterilization campaigns and racist
propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   In the decades after World War II, the record of these abuses
created a distrust of biological explanations for human behavior.
</P>
<P>
   But sensitivity could also turn into virtual censorship, as Dr.
E.O. Wilson, a renowned entomologist at Harvard, discovered after
publishing his now-classic book, ``Sociobiology,'' in 1975. The
book, mostly devoted to a discussion of animal behavior, included a
final chapter extending evolutionary theory into the realm of human
affairs. It was heavily criticized and in 1978, as Wilson began to
speak about his theories at a meeting of the American Association
for the Advancement of Science in Washington, protesters heckled
him and dumped a pitcher of water on his head.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stephen Jay Gould, a paleontologist, and Dr. Richard
Lewontin, a population geneticist, both of Harvard, have been the
most vocal and prolific of sociobiology's critics, writing a famous
1979 paper, ``The Spandrels of San Marco and the Panglossian
Paradigm: A Critique of the Adaptationist Program.''
</P>
<P>
   Gould, in particular, has continued to find fault with the work
of scientists, including evolutionary psychologists, who seek to
explain traits as ``adaptations.'' In fact, he argues, many traits
are not the products of natural selection, favored because they
enhance reproduction or survival, but are simply random byproducts
of other evolutionary developments.
</P>
<P>
   THE ISSUES
</P>
<P>
   CONTROVERSIAL TASK, ABUNDANCE OF CRITICS
</P>
<P>
   Some evolutionary biologists have also historically opposed
applying Darwinian principles to humans, not because they have
moral misgivings about such research, but because they think the
task is simply too complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to determine the evolutionary forces that shaped animal
behavior is hard enough, they argue. But to tease out the legacy of
evolution from the effects of thousands of years of human culture
presents almost insurmountable obstacles, particularly given the
limits on the kinds of experiments that can be done with people.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the last 20 years, advances in genetics and molecular
science have made it impossible to ignore the evidence that biology
has at least some impact on how people behave and have made the
discussion of genetic influences more widely accepted.
</P>
<P>
   And evolutionary scientists, able to go about their work in a
more tolerant climate, have begun to develop a variety of methods
for applying Darwinian principles to humans. Evolutionary
psychology, as defined by Cosmides, Tooby, and others, might
involve laboratory experiments, cross-cultural studies and other
approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers use mathematical models to study foraging and
other behavior in modern hunter-gatherer societies. Still others do
comparative studies, looking for similarities and differences
between humans and animals.
</P>
<P>
   And the Human Behavior and Evolution Society, founded 15 years
ago, counts 1,000 members from a wide variety of disciplines,
including biology, psychology, anthropology, law and medicine, who
study topics as diverse as the way pheromones coordinate female
menstrual cycles and hunting practices among the Ache of Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some evolutionary psychologists feel their arguments for
biology must overcome substantial resistance. ``There is a flagrant
double standard that's applied to the evidence,'' said Buss, whose
latest book, ``The Dangerous Passion'' (Free Press, 2000) deals
with jealousy, and who has recently proposed that human beings may
have a specialized mental module for murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's an evolutionary hypothesis, you have to document
mountains of evidence before anyone will take it seriously, and
even then it will be dismissed,'' Buss said. ``On the contrary, if
you say there is a sex difference and it's all due to media
violence, then the standards are low and everyone accepts it
without any evidence.''

MAYOR'S SUIT CLAIMS WEB LIBEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BENJAMIN WALLACE-WELLS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Elevating a local political feud into a national test case of
truth and the Internet, Mayor John Barrett has sued two political
opponents who created a web site accusing him of being a liar, a
thief, and a child abuser.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett, who has been at the center of North Adams, Mass.
political life for decades, including 17 years at mayor, filed the
suit Monday in Berkshire Superior Court, accusing a North Adams
landlord, John Choquette, and a retired city police detective,
William Davis, of defaming him.
</P>
<P>
   Choquette and Davis say they have evidence to back up their
claims, and that they plan to defend the suit on conventional libel
grounds, where truth is an absolute defense.
</P>
<P>
   But legal specialists say Barrett's suit could take on greater
significance if Choquette and Davis are proven wrong, because
courts have so far been reluctant to rein in debate on the Internet
by holding it to the same standards as newspapers and magazines.
Though words put on line are nominally held to the same libel
standards as traditional print media, specialists say that only a
handful of public figures have even tried to sue Internet operators
for libel.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett wants a stricter application of that standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the government doesn't step in and start protecting the
rights of people to privacy, as much as the Internet has benefited
us, it could also be a very destructive communication network,''
said Barrett.
</P>
<P>
   Legal specialists say the question is intriguing _ whether to
treat the Internet like a publication or like a telephone. Some ask
if it is reasonable to expect website operators to possess the same
legal knowledge as publishers, whose law departments could often
comprise regiments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It poses a very interesting question,'' said Jonathan
Zittrain, executive director of the Berkman Center for the Internet
and Society at Harvard Law School. ``When the barriers to getting
speech out there are so low, do we really expect the law to keep
applying the same standard?''
</P>
<P>
   What is for Zittrain an abstract question of law is a case with
deeply tangible political ramifications for people in North Adams _
a city of 14,000 people where political grievances can swiftly turn
personal.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett has been elected mayor eight times, the last time with
63 percent of the vote. Five years ago, Barrett says, he
antagonized some downtown business owners, spawning an opposition
campaign that eventually included Choquette and Davis. After the
most recent mayoral challenge, by City Councilor John Gwodz, failed
to unseat Barrett, Choquette and Davis took their campaign on line.
</P>
<P>
   Their site, www.northadamsfree.com, which they operate on behalf
of a larger anti-Barrett group calling itself The Guardian Angels,
charges that the mayor got a mortgage on highly favorable terms;
that he drives a car bought with city money that the City Council
never approved; that he forged signatures on city documents; that
he verbally abused his staff; that he has a criminal record; and
that, while a North Adams school teacher, he physically abused
students.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett denies all these allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who maintains all the charges are true, says in a small
city like North Adams, where one political hand can easily wash all
others, the Internet can be the only way for dissident political
views to surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barrett's control of the media is nearly absolute,'' Davis
said. ``If you had a gripe, they ain't gonna print it. What's the
alternative? Not much.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis says the flexible format of the Internet allowed his group
to make a well-documented case that it would not have been able to
present by phoning radio shows or writing letters. The website
relies heavily upon the public record _ including articles from
local newspapers, copies of mortgage certificates, even an
automobile registration card.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to establish credibility, especially with 16 years of
propaganda to go up against,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Choquette, who owns the website, says that the very fact of its
existance is useful to the public, since citizens with complaints
now have a place to air them.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the stuff on the website comes from people who have
seen our website and have written in telling us about their
personal experiences with Barrett,'' Choquette said.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett, for his part, calls Choquette a ``screwball'' and says
all the allegations are demonstrably false.
</P>
<P>
   ``Open up the books _ I've got nothing to hide,'' Barrett said.
``My record speaks for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Barrett's lawyer, Victor Polk, says that the larger point of the
mayor's suit is to ensure that the law can accommodate the
practical challenges posed by the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet makes this kind of defamation so much easier,''
Polk said. ``In the old days you had to have a publisher. What
we've done with a computer is make everyone with a computer a
publisher. While there's good things about that, people sometimes
seem to think they can abuse their rights of free speech.''
</P>
<P>
   At Berkshire Superior Court in Pittsfield, Mass. Monday, a judge
granted Davis and Choquette's lawyer, Robert Isacoff, a week's
extension to give him more time to prepare his case.
</P>
<P>
   While the lawyers in North Adams sweat through their briefs,
however, specialists say the same issues are emerging in other
cases across the country. Most of them are so-called John Doe cases
_ litigants seeking the identities of potential defendants who
often go by chat handles, user names, and other technological
veils.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of this John Doe stuff, there is growing discussion
about whether the rules should be the same'' for Internet
publishers as for traditional publishers, said Christopher Hansen,
a senior counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union. ``It's
almost surely the case that the rules will be at least as
protective. There is some possibility that some additional
protections could be recognized.''
</P>
<P>
   One obstacle to cases, however, is the Supreme Court rule that
criticism of public figures deserves less scrutiny than that of
private figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The upshot is that public figures very rarely sue over libel,
because their chances of winning are so low,'' Zittrain said.
``They have to prove, essentially, not only that the person
attacking them was factually wrong, but also that he had compelling
reasons to know that he was factually wrong, and he went ahead with
the attack anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barrett says while this may be a fair standard for
traditional media, the Internet has changed the profile of the
publisher, so that the law can now be twisted to permit reckless
attacks, pressed onto the Internet without fact-checking.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got the so-called scholars out there saying it's
difficult to prove libel,'' Barrett said. ``But in this case he
said I was convicted of a crime and I haven't been. He said I'm a
pedophile, which I'm not. He said I was fired from Green Mountain
racetrack, and I wasn't. He said I settled a suit with a city
councilor in 1984, and that was another mayor. I don't think this
is going to be difficult to prove.''
</P>
<P>
   Cases like Barrett's are pending around the country. Specialists
point to a Pennsylvania judge's suit against a website accusing her
of corruption, and a California police officer's suit against a
site accusing him of various abuses.
</P>
<P>
   In five years, Zittrain says, the precedents from these cases
may put Internet libel questions in a new light. But for now, they
need to be trudged through, case by case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sifting out people who are John Hinckley from people who are
Thomas Paine is the trick,'' Zittrain said. ``And there's no easy
way to do that, particularly when the act of suing them may run
them out of business.''

 UNDATED: any evidence.''

<P>
   THE REAL QUESTION
</P>
<P>
   NOT A SIMPLE MATTER OF NATURE/NURTURE
</P>
<P>
   The nature/nurture dichotomy, however, is in many ways spurious.
No evolutionary scientist would dispute that culture is a powerful
influence, or that environmental forces shape behavior. Darwin
himself was in a sense a ``nurturist'': it was the environment,
after all, with all of its threats, possibilities and
complications, that in his theory ultimately determined which
traits were ``successful'' and passed on to future generations, and
which were not.
</P>
<P>
   A more sophisticated debate, and one central to many of the most
knowledgeable critiques of evolutionary psychology, revolves around
more subtle distinctions, like the timing of evolutionary change,
the criteria used to decide whether something is an adaptation.
Then there is the question of the relative balance of culture and
genes in determining how humans behave.
</P>
<P>
   Cosmides and Tooby argue that the complex mechanisms, or
``design features,'' that they believe make up the structure of the
human mind evolved over millions of years, as combinations of genes
proved successful at reproducing themselves, and gradually spread
through the species, eventually becoming universal.
</P>
<P>
   Because of this, they assert, it makes little sense to study
traits that vary from group to group, or society to society. Humans
are basically all the same, they argue, with only a `'dusting'' of
difference. Nor, they say, is it worthwhile to ask whether a
particular behavior is adaptive _ in the sense of producing more
offspring _ in the modern world. Doing so, they say, can lead
scientists wildly astray.
</P>
<P>
   In an example given by Cosmides, a scientist might argue that
smoking cigarettes is ``adaptive'' for teen-age girls because it
causes boys to think they are cool. The boys are then more likely
to choose them as sexual partners.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, researchers should ask what purpose behavior might have
served during the period in which it evolved, a time evolutionary
psychologists refer to as the Environment of Evolutionary
Adaptedness and sometimes pinpoint in the Pleistocene Era, when
human ancestors lived in hunter-gatherer groups.
</P>
<P>
   In the modern world, Cosmides, Tooby and others argue, humans
are not ``fitness maximizers,'' continually strategizing to make
the most of their chances at reproduction and survival.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, they are ``adaptation executors,'' carrying out programs
written into the mind's machinery long ago. ``The machinery doesn't
know its own programming,'' Cosmides and Tooby are fond of saying.
</P>
<P>
   Other scientists, however, object that this view is much too
narrow, that it requires assumptions that are impossible to test
and ignores the possibility that evolution might in some cases have
proceeded at a faster pace.
</P>
<P>
   They also find the notion of studying only universal traits
perplexing: in studies of animal behavior, a standard procedure is
to study how traits vary in different environmental circumstances
and to explore the effects of different traits on reproduction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a time machine,'' said Dr. Patricia Adair
Gowaty, professor of ecology at the University of Georgia. ``We
don't even know for the Pleistocene what the social and
environmental conditions were. The only evidence we have for these
things is the behavior itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The work of Gowaty, who studies birds, Dr. Sarah Hrdy, a
professor emerita at the University of California at Davis who
studies primates, and other researchers, some of whom study humans,
offers an evolutionary view of male-female relations that differs
sharply from that painted by evolutionary psychologists like Buss.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is frustrating to me,'' Gowaty said, ``when I read
these evolutionary psychologists saying that you can't look at
selective process in real-time environments, because these novel
environments might not be like environments of the past. That might
be so. Then again, that might not be so.''
</P>
<P>
   THE DISSENT
</P>
<P>
   IMPACT OF CULTURE GIVEN A GREATER ROLE
</P>
<P>
   Other critics complain that evolutionary psychologists often
underemphasize the extent to which culture influences human
behavior, and ignore equally plausible cultural explanations for
their data.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Alice Eagly, for example, a social psychologist at
Northwestern University, has been critical of Buss' research
showing that women rank wealth and status higher in choosing a
sexual partner, while men put a higher priority on physical
attractiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't argue that there are no differences between men and
women,'' Eagly said. ``But there remains a big question whether
things as specific as a preference for money are built in
genetically.''
</P>
<P>
   Boyd, of UCLA, also said that culture's impact on behavior was
often underplayed in evolutionary psychologists' work.
</P>
<P>
   While Tooby, Cosmides and others have written extensively about
the ways in which culture might be shaped by the mental mechanisms
humans have evolved, for example, they have spent far less time on
the reverse proposition, that culture itself transmits knowledge
about how to solve problems from generation to generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``From my research perspective,'' Boyd said, ``evolutionary
psychologists place a much smaller emphasis on cultural variation
than I think is empirically going on. I'm inclined to think of
cultures as evolving over fairly long periods of time, accumulating
information, some of it adaptive, some not adaptive. I still take
an evolutionary perspective, but I don't think we have to have it
all coded in the genes.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Cosmides and Tooby respond that theirs is ``the
first intellectual community that does know what to do with
culture,'' and that can truly address the way biology and culture
interact in creating human societies.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Tooby said, he entered graduate school in anthropology
at Harvard in part because ``I was interested in cracking the
problem of culture, in what was the underlying mechanism.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the word ``mechanism,'' is in itself controversial. The
notion that the mind is specialized may considered gospel by the
``Santa Barbara Church,'' as one scientist jokingly referred to
Tooby, Cosmides and their colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   But many researchers remain skeptical that the same
specialization that has been demonstrated for some brain functions
_ vision, for example _ holds when it comes to complex patterns of
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd, for example, said: ``I am convinced that we don't
understand the brain well enough to make these assumptions. I've
read the two sides of this argument, and it seems to me that it's
an open question.''
</P>
<P>
   THE FUTURE
</P>
<P>
   A YOUNG FIELD STILL TAKING SHAPE
</P>
<P>
   Many scientific disciplines are riddled with internal
disagreements. Physicists fight about why particles have different
masses. Climatologists do battle over global warming.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the intensity of emotion that infuses any discussion of
evolutionary psychology is unusual, even among scientists.
</P>
<P>
   In part, the reason may be that the star actors in this
scientific drama are human beings, and the question at issue is the
nature of being human.
</P>
<P>
   Tooby says he sometimes worries ``that evolutionary psychology
will die because of sociological reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost all that anyone has heard about evolutionary psychology
has to do with sex and violence,'' he said. ``But there is insight
to be found for hundreds of really critical topics.''
</P>
<P>
   Other evolutionary scientists who study human behavior say they,
too, are worried: they worry that the controversy is dividing
researchers who should be working together, and that the work of a
relatively small group of scholars is inviting a hostility that the
field _ just recovering from two decades of embattled debate _
hardly needs.
</P>
<P>
   The antidote to such fears, many say, is the faith that
constructive scientific argument often leads to greater knowledge,
and the belief that, for a field still in its infancy, patience is
a virtue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we really know how to do evolutionary psychology
yet,'' said Dr. Randolph Nesse, director of the Evolution and Human
Adaptation Program at the Institute for Social Research at the
University of Michigan. ``I think we have great trouble formulating
our hypotheses, and even more trouble figuring out how to test
them. We know we have a powerful principle, that will eventually
provide a foundation for a deeper and richer psychology. But we
have a lot of work to do.''

ASIAN EEL CONFOUNDS SCIENTISTS WHO TRY TO BAR IT FROM EVERGLADES 
</HEADLINE>

 By TOM BAYLES   
 Herald-Tribune (Sarasota, Fla.)   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARASOTA, Fla. _ A yard-long, gender-bending eel from somewhere
near Vietnam is the latest exotic creature to threaten the
Everglades National Park. And it's really, really hungry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very voracious predator,'' said Sue Perry, an
Everglades fishery biologist. ``It eats lots of other organisms,
and the area of the park it is likely to enter is very similar to
its habitat in Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of the eels were discovered in December in a canal
near Homestead, within slithering distance of the park's boundary.
If they make it into the wide expanse of the Everglades, the
aggressive and highly territorial eels could crowd out bass and
other native fish and gorge on crayfish, worms and frogs.
</P>
<P>
   The Everglades has been under attack by foreign species for
years; Florida is the port of entry for most shipments of live
animals and plants coming into the country. The 1.4 million-acre
reserve is now a virtual exotic nursery and pet shop.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists suspect that the first eels were either exotic pets
dumped in the canal or creatures put there to start a makeshift
farm. Some people consider the olive-brown eel quite tasty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We began doing field research on them trying to find some
chink in their armor or some weakness we could exploit to control
or eliminate them,'' said Leo Nico, a U.S. Geological Survey
biologist. ``But most of what we've learned about them shows us
that they are less likely to be controlled.''
</P>
<P>
   At least 30 foreign fish species have invaded Florida, but most
are limited to specific habitats like a canal or pond.
</P>
<P>
   The eels' mobility and love of marshes mean that ``potentially,
given decades, these eels could invade large portions of the
U.S.,'' Nico said.
</P>
<P>
   Simply removing the creatures from the canal is not as easy as
it sounds.
</P>
<P>
   The eel doesn't seem affected by the most common fish-killing
poison, and a stronger agent such as cyanide can't be used because
the canal is connected to the Floridan aquifer, the source of water
for millions of people. Using chemicals to deplete the oxygen in
the canal's water won't kill the eels because they breathe air like
a dolphin.
</P>
<P>
   Divers can't pick the eels out by hand because they hide in
limestone crevices. Draining the ditch won't work either, because
the eels can burrow into the ground and hibernate for months. The
concussion from a dynamite blast can kill fish by collapsing
pockets of air in their bodies, but the eels don't have any air
pockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're brainstorming constantly trying to figure it out,'' said
John Curnutt, a biologist with the U.S. Geological Survey's Florida
Caribbean Science Center in Miami. ``This is the time. If you want
to control an exotic species, you jump on it before the population
gets too big.''
</P>
<P>
   A genetically different but similar-looking Asian eel was first
discovered in 1995 in a nature center's pond in Georgia. The pond
was isolated, so scientists didn't become especially alarmed until
two years later, when the eel showed up in water-filled ditches
north of Palmetto and in a canal near Pro Player Stadium in North
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The highly adaptable creatures can survive in nearly any
freshwater habitat with a few inches of water. Because the eels
breathe air, they can survive long dry spells. They can also
survive long periods without food.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not much is known about the way they work,'' Curnutt said.
</P>
<P>
   Curnutt said the eels are born female, but some change sex as
they mature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them switch over to being males as they get quite
large,'' he said. ``You never find a small male, but some of the
big ones are male.''
</P>
<P>
   Other foreign animals already lurking in the Everglades include
rhesus and macaque monkeys, feral pigs, fire ants and Asian tiger
mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   Among the non-native plants that have popped up in the park are
the melaleuca tree, first introduced into the region in 1906 as an
ornamental plant; Brazilian pepper; Australian pine; Chinese
tallow; skunk vine; air potato; and tropical soda apple.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists hope that an event that could cause flooding, such as
a hurricane that might make the canal become a temporary part of
the Everglades, does not hit before they figure out how to stop the
exotic crawler.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to try to think like an eel,'' Curnutt said.
</P>
<P>
   Nico is less optimistic about keeping the eels out of the
Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are not there now,'' he said, ``they probably will be
within a year or two.''

AETNA SHARES DECLINE 9 PERCENT AFTER BID IS REJECTED 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Disappointed investors drove shares of Aetna Inc.
down $5.25 Monday, or 9 percent, to $50.75, after Aetna rejected an
offer to hold discussions on a tentative takeover bid valued at $70
a share by Wellpoint Health Networks and the ING Group of insurance
and financial services companies.
</P>
<P>
   William H. Donaldson, chief executive of Aetna, said there would
be antitrust and other problems in combining with Wellpoint which,
he said, is ``a much smaller'' health insurer than Aetna. He
insisted that his team, which plans to split Aetna into two
independent companies, could do a better job than Wellpoint and ING
of reviving Aetna's stock price.
</P>
<P>
   Wellpoint, based in Thousand Oaks, Calif., covers 7.3 million
health care subscribers, 70 percent of them in California. Aetna,
the nation's largest health insurer, has 22 million members
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ING, a huge Dutch company, said Monday it was still interested
in buying the nonhealth business of Aetna, which has also attracted
other potential bidders. Wellpoint bowed out, saying it was
disappointed by the rejection.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with analysts, Donaldson put rough price
tags on some of his plans. He said Aetna hoped to sell some
international units for $500 million to $1.5 billion. Aetna has 35
overseas units in 17 countries, including joint ventures in Mexico
and Brazil that it has hinted might be sold.
</P>
<P>
   Leo Cooperman, chairman of Omega Advisers, a money management
firm, urged the company to go further and sell assets worth $3.5
billion. Cooperman wants the money returned to shareholders in a
stock buyback at $70 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson said that tax rules would limit a stock buyback.
Aetna's plan to spin off independent health and financial services
companies to shareholders on a tax-free basis could become taxable
if company stock was also repurchased, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson also said he expected cost-cutting measures to save
$100 million to $150 million before taxes this year. Some of the
savings would come from a hiring freeze. He said Aetna loses 16
percent of its 48,000 employees through attrition each year, and
many would not be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   He added that other savings might come from shutting some
unprofitable Medicare health maintenance organizations. Aetna
Medicare HMOs have 700,000 members, including 177,000 in New York
and New Jersey.

MEDIA POWERHOUSE SEEN IN TRIBUNE-TIMES MIRROR DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It may not quite rival the Time Warner-America Online megamerger
in buzz and bucks, but the Tribune Co.'s stunning $8 billion
proposed acquisition of Times Mirror Co. will create a powerhouse
``old media'' empire anchored in New York, Los Angeles, and
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we've created the premier multimedia company in
America,'' said Tribune Co. chairman John Madigan, who will head up
the new company, in a conference call with reporters Monday.
``What's important here is that we'll have a major presence in the
three largest markets in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The surprise agreement, reached over the weekend, landed like a
bombshell in the media world, reinforcing the idea that bigger is
better and that almost every news outlet is theoretically in play.
The agreement sent Times Mirror stock climbing nearly 80 percent to
$85.625 Monday while Tribune Co. shares dropped nearly 20 percent
to $30.8125.
</P>
<P>
   ``Media companies believe they cannot stand alone,'' said media
critic Jon Katz. ``They're all trying to build up as much
synergistic muscle in new and old media as they can . . . I think
the biggest ethic here is size.''
</P>
<P>
   The new entity, which is still subject to shareholder approval,
will own 11 daily newspapers _ including the Los Angeles Times,
Newsday, the Chicago Tribune, and The Hartford (Conn.) Courant _
and 22 television stations, including WGN-TV in Chicago, WPIX-TV in
New York, KTLA-TV in Los Angeles, and WLVI-TV in Boston. With a
combined circulation of 3.6 million, the new Tribune company will
rank third among newspaper publishers. Having amassed a total of 80
Pulitzer prizes, it also can boast of uniting trusted journalistic
brands.
</P>
<P>
   Tribune Co. officials also stressed the burgeoning online giant
being created, noting that the combined Interent operations attract
an estimated 3.4 million unique monthly visitors and are expected
to earn roughly $55 million in 2000 revenues.
</P>
<P>
   For now, however, much of the attention is focused on the
potentially powerful pairing of Times Mirror newspapers with
Tribune Co. TV stations in the same markets. And among those
leading the cheers is John Sturm, president of the Newspaper
Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   The deal proves, ``that newspapers are still a very viable part
of the landscape,'' Sturm said. He was also heartened by the sale's
creation of three new newspaper-television combinations in New
York, Los Angeles, and Hartford, since his association has been
lobbying the Federal Communications Commission to drop its ban on
one company owning a broadcast and newspaper outlet in the same
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marketplace has now run right past the FCC and the
antiquated rule it has,'' he says. Tribune Co. officials stated
their belief that FCC policy allows them to maintain the new
broadcast-print combinations until the TV licenses come up for
renewal later this decade.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the Tribune Co. _ which already owned four
newspapers, 22 TV stations, two cable stations and the Chicago Cubs
_ has solid reasons for moving on Times Mirror. The company now
becomes a multimedia player in Los Angeles and New York, where it
once owned the New York Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   Tribune Publishing president Jack Fuller acknowledged that
``we're very excited about getting back into the metropolitan
market there. New York is a great place to be in journalism and
we're glad to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're buying an incredible franchise'' in the Los Angeles
Times and Newsday, added Tom Rosenstiel, director of the Project
for Excellence in Journalism. ``So you take instant content, the
possibility of convergence, and these incredible assets'' for a
``pittance compared to the Time Warner-AOL deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The motives may have been simpler at Times Mirror, which owns
the Times, Newsday, the Courant, The Sun in Baltimore, several
smaller papers, and a number of magazines. After several tumultuous
years under the leadership of CEO Mark Willes, the owners may have
been happy to ``get rid of Willes and cash out at a high level,''
said Rosenstiel.
</P>
<P>
   News of the Times sale saddened the paper's former publisher,
David Laventhol. ``From the community standpoint, I think it's a
real loss,'' he said. ``I spent 30 years with the Times and you
hate to see it vanish in the mist.'' But, he said, ``the Tribune
people are competent, straightforward people.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are differences in the two corporate cultures. When
Willes arrived at Times Mirror, he shored up investor confidence
with a series of cost-cutting measures. In recent years, however,
he became a lightning rod for controversy by talking about tearing
down the ``wall'' between business and editorial operations. Last
year, the Times _ which has a longstanding reputation as one of the
nation's best and most ambitious papers _ became embroiled in an
ethical nightmare when it shared advertising profits with the
Staples Center sports arena. According to a story in Monday's
Times, Willes, who was ``totally surprised'' when he first learned
of the merger negotiations a few weeks ago, does not plan on
staying on with the newly merged company.
</P>
<P>
   The Tribune Co., which has made Fortune's list of ``most admired
companies,'' is a centrally managed operation known for its
corporate efficiencies. On roughly the same 1999 revenue as Times
Mirror, the Tribune Company enjoyed a much larger margin, with a
net income of $1.48 billion that includes a one-time return of $1
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The company has turned the Chicago Tribune newsroom into a
``newsbucket'' of synergy, utilizing its radio station, TV station,
and cable outlet to deliver the Tribune brand in a variety of
modes. While the paper is respected, it is seen in some quarters as
a journalistic underachiever.
</P>
<P>
   Fuller was careful to insist that the company wouldn't take ``a
cookie-cutter approach,'' toward its new properties. But he did vow
to look ``for operational efficiencies'' to boost the Times Mirror
profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   Tribune officials downplayed the significance of the 20-day
period in which additional bidders could try to better their offer
for Times Mirror. Yet, as Madigan himself indicated, this is the
kind of merger that is likely to become more commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if other people look at the future of the business the
way we have, they'll see consolidation will come in this world
where the media has fragmented significantly,'' he said. ``I would
see definitely, further consolidation in the newspaper industry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I sometimes think we're going to end up with one media company
that's going to run everything,'' added Katz, who decries the
growing conglomerates. ``Let's get it over with.''

MEDIA POWERHOUSE SEEN IN TRIBUNE-TIMES MIRROR DEAL

<P>
   It may not quite rival the Time Warner-America Online megamerger
in buzz and bucks, but the Tribune Co.'s stunning $8 billion
proposed acquisition of Times Mirror Co. will create a powerhouse
``old media'' empire anchored in New York, Los Angeles, and
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we've created the premier multimedia company in
America,'' said Tribune Co. chairman John Madigan, who will head up
the new company, in a conference call with reporters Monday.
``What's important here is that we'll have a major presence in the
three largest markets in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The surprise agreement, reached over the weekend, landed like a
bombshell in the media world, reinforcing the idea that bigger is
better and that almost every news outlet is theoretically in play.
The agreement sent Times Mirror stock climbing nearly 80 percent to
$85.625 Monday while Tribune Co. shares dropped nearly 20 percent
to $30.8125.
</P>
<P>
   ``Media companies believe they cannot stand alone,'' said media
critic Jon Katz. ``They're all trying to build up as much
synergistic muscle in new and old media as they can . . . I think
the biggest ethic here is size.''
</P>
<P>
   The new entity, which is still subject to shareholder approval,
will own 11 daily newspapers _ including the Los Angeles Times,
Newsday, the Chicago Tribune, and The Hartford (Conn.) Courant _
and 22 television stations, including WGN-TV in Chicago, WPIX-TV in
New York, KTLA-TV in Los Angeles, and WLVI-TV in Boston. With a
combined circulation of 3.6 million, the new Tribune company will
rank third among newspaper publishers. Having amassed a total of 80
Pulitzer prizes, it also can boast of uniting trusted journalistic
brands.
</P>
<P>
   Tribune Co. officials also stressed the burgeoning online giant
being created, noting that the combined Interent operations attract
an estimated 3.4 million unique monthly visitors and are expected
to earn roughly $55 million in 2000 revenues.
</P>
<P>
   For now, however, much of the attention is focused on the
potentially powerful pairing of Times Mirror newspapers with
Tribune Co. TV stations in the same markets. And among those
leading the cheers is John Sturm, president of the Newspaper
Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   The deal proves, ``that newspapers are still a very viable part
of the landscape,'' Sturm said. He was also heartened by the sale's
creation of three new newspaper-television combinations in New
York, Los Angeles, and Hartford, since his association has been
lobbying the Federal Communications Commission to drop its ban on
one company owning a broadcast and newspaper outlet in the same
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marketplace has now run right past the FCC and the
antiquated rule it has,'' he says. Tribune Co. officials stated
their belief that FCC policy allows them to maintain the new
broadcast-print combinations until the TV licenses come up for
renewal later this decade.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the Tribune Co. _ which already owned four
newspapers, 22 TV stations, two cable stations and the Chicago Cubs
_ has solid reasons for moving on Times Mirror. The company now
becomes a multimedia player in Los Angeles and New York, where it
once owned the New York Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   Tribune Publishing president Jack Fuller acknowledged that
``we're very excited about getting back into the metropolitan
market there. New York is a great place to be in journalism and
we're glad to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're buying an incredible franchise'' in the Los Angeles
Times and Newsday, added Tom Rosenstiel, director of the Project
for Excellence in Journalism. ``So you take instant content, the
possibility of convergence, and these incredible assets'' for a
``pittance compared to the Time Warner-AOL deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The motives may have been simpler at Times Mirror, which owns
the Times, Newsday, the Courant, The Sun in Baltimore, several
smaller papers, and a number of magazines. After several tumultuous
years under the leadership of CEO Mark Willes, the owners may have
been happy to ``get rid of Willes and cash out at a high level,''
said Rosenstiel.
</P>
<P>
   News of the Times sale saddened the paper's former publisher,
David Laventhol. ``From the community standpoint, I think it's a
real loss,'' he said. ``I spent 30 years with the Times and you
hate to see it vanish in the mist.'' But, he said, ``the Tribune
people are competent, straightforward people.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are differences in the two corporate cultures. When
Willes arrived at Times Mirror, he shored up investor confidence
with a series of cost-cutting measures. In recent years, however,
he became a lightning rod for controversy by talking about tearing
down the ``wall'' between business and editorial operations. Last
year, the Times _ which has a longstanding reputation as one of the
nation's best and most ambitious papers _ became embroiled in an
ethical nightmare when it shared advertising profits with the
Staples Center sports arena. According to a story in Monday's
Times, Willes, who was ``totally surprised'' when he first learned
of the merger negotiations a few weeks ago, does not plan on
staying on with the newly merged company.
</P>
<P>
   The Tribune Co., which has made Fortune's list of ``most admired
companies,'' is a centrally managed operation known for its
corporate efficiencies. On roughly the same 1999 revenue as Times
Mirror, the Tribune Company enjoyed a much larger margin, with a
net income of $1.48 billion that includes a one-time return of $1
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The company has turned the Chicago Tribune newsroom into a
``newsbucket'' of synergy, utilizing its radio station, TV station,
and cable outlet to deliver the Tribune brand in a variety of
modes. While the paper is respected, it is seen in some quarters as
a journalistic underachiever.
</P>
<P>
   Fuller was careful to insist that the company wouldn't take ``a
cookie-cutter approach,'' toward its new properties. But he did vow
to look ``for operational efficiencies'' to boost the Times Mirror
profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   Tribune officials downplayed the significance of the 20-day
period in which additional bidders could try to better their offer
for Times Mirror. Yet, as Madigan himself indicated, this is the
kind of merger that is likely to become more commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if other people look at the future of the business the
way we have, they'll see consolidation will come in this world
where the media has fragmented significantly,'' he said. ``I would
see definitely, further consolidation in the newspaper industry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I sometimes think we're going to end up with one media company
that's going to run everything,'' added Katz, who decries the
growing conglomerates. ``Let's get it over with.''

 &HT;    `Old media' companies merge, blending newspaper, broadcast
assets
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ First we had the blockbuster marriage made in new
media heaven, with America Online asking the hand of Time Warner.
On Monday, in a realignment of old media, Tribune Co. of Chicago
agreed to a $6.38 billion merger with Times Mirror Co., the biggest
newspaper deal in years.
</P>
<P>
   The deal brings together a host of broadcast stations, including
WATL in Atlanta, and the Chicago Cubs. The deal creates the third
largest newspaper company in the United States, ending 100 years of
independence by the Los Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
   If successful, the merged company would have its headquarters in
Chicago, headed by John Madigan, chairman of the Tribune Co.
</P>
<P>
   While the proposed merger sent a buzz through the media
community, Wall Street was not won immediately, with Tribune stock
plunging.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the transaction, shareholders of Los
Angeles-based Times Mirror would have a choice of taking $95 per
share from Tribune Co. or exchanging each of their Times Mirror
shares for 2.5 shares of Tribune stock.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative merger, though small by comparison, comes on the
heels of the massive, pending $163-billion merger of American
Online and Times Warner, and is another apparent step in the
consolidation and realignment of media.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been some troubling developments in the newspaper
business in recent weeks,'' said Jay Smith, president of Cox
Newspapers, parent of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and other
newspapers. ``But I see as positive the move by Tribune Co., a very
smart media company, to invest in publishing through its purchase
of Times Mirror.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said that diversified media organizations like Cox
Enterprises are, in effect, a model for long-term growth, bridging
the ``old media'' of newspapers as primary news gatherers, and the
``new media'' distribution of information over the air, through
cables and on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Along with its newspaper division, Cox Enterprises owns cable
television systems and high speed data delivery; radio and
television stations; and a growing interactive media service.
</P>
<P>
   Though players in the same business, Tribune Media and Times
Mirror differ in many ways.
</P>
<P>
   The Tribune firm owns the venerable Chicago Tribune,
Sun-Sentinel of South Florida, Orlando Sentinel and Daily Press of
Hampton Road, Va. It will bolster its print reach through by Times
Mirror holdings that include the Los Angeles Times, Newsday of Long
Island, the Sun of Baltimore and Hartford Courant _ each dominant
in their primary markets.
</P>
<P>
   The Tribune also owns the Cubs and 22 television stations, which
could present some regulatory difficulty. Companies are foreclosed
from owning print media and broadcast stations in the same markets.
However, federal law provides that conflicting properties are not
required to be disposed for a year or until broadcast licenses
expire.
</P>
<P>
   The Tribune television stations cover many major markets,
including Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Boston,
Houston, Seattle, Denver and San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its stable of major newspapers, Times Mirror also
publishes a wide array of magazines including Field &AMP; Stream,
Popular Science, Golf Magazine, Yachting, Skiing and others.
</P>
<P>
   The Chandler family has withdrawn from direct daily control of
the Los Angeles Times operation, with control going to Chairman
Mark Willes since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The Willes regime has increased the profitability of the
newspaper handsomely, but has stirred newsroom and industry debate
with its strategy of breaking down barriers between the news
operation and the business and advertising side.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters and editors have acted with suspicion at the blocks
that traditionally have prevented advertisers from trying to
influence news coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The new era of cooperation was dealt a blow recently when it was
disclosed that the newspaper privately entered a revenue sharing
agreement with the new Staple entertainment center. The disclosure
damaged the newspaper's credibility and drew criticism from the
Chandler family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am encouraged by aspects of the proposed merger,'' said
James Naughton, president of the Poynter Institute, a newspaper
training and think tank in St. Petersburg, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was concerned at the sale of all its domestic
newspapers by Thomson Newspapers and a sell-off of some small
papers by others, which he saw as possible evidence of sliding
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the Tribune Company has acted positively by extending its
reach through the merger and creating better synergy between its
assets and the new print outlets.''

 &HT;    TBS starts two buildings to renew Atlanta ties
 &HT;    By Tony Wilbert
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Turner Broadcasting System planted more Atlanta roots
Monday when Ted Turner said Time Warner has no plans to relocate
its subsidiary to New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York? It's bad enough to go up and visit,'' Turner said as
TBS began construction on two buildings at its Techwood campus.
</P>
<P>
   The Time Warner vice chairman said the company has exerted no
pressure on TBS to move its executives to Columbus Centre, a huge
real estate project in New York where Time Warner is planning a new
world headquarters. ``No way,'' he said of being forced to move
TBS. ``No way.''
</P>
<P>
   Columbus Centre will house the headquarters of AOL Time Warner,
the new company that will be formed by the merger of America Online
and Time Warner, a Time Warner spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Since TBS merged with Time Warner in 1996, the company has
invested in several Atlanta projects, including Turner Field,
Philips Arena, the renovation of CNN Center and expansion of the
Techwood campus, TBS Chairman and Chief Executive Terry McGuirk
said. ``We've done so much investing in this city. It's another
statement of the vitality this merger (brings) to Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   With its commitment to the new buildings at Techwood, TBS has
invested more than $600 million in capital projects in Atlanta
since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The two new facilities will total 330,000 square feet at the
20-year-old Techwood campus. The 185,000-square-foot network
operations building will support the Turner Entertainment Group.
The 145,000-square-foot administrative building will accommodate
TBS' rapid growth. An underground parking garage also will be part
of the $160 million project.
</P>
<P>
   TBS currently has 1,500 employees at its 35-acre Techwood
campus, where it has about 350,000 square feet of office space. The
company expects to have 2,200 employees at the site by the time the
two new buildings open in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   McGuirk said some of the new businesses created by AOL Time
Warner will be in Atlanta. ``Atlanta is a beneficiary. Turner
Broadcasting is a beneficiary,'' he said.

A FILM BOOM RATTLES SOUTH KOREA'S VIEW OF ITSELF 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ It has never taken much to get the
nationalist juices flowing in this country, where even driving a
foreign-made car is seen by some motorists as nearly tantamount to
treason.
</P>
<P>
   So when the government announced the easing of quotas limiting
the screening of foreign films here in 1999, the instinctive
response of the South Korean film industry was to put together a
campaign of demonstrations against the impending flood of Hollywood
imports.
</P>
<P>
   But if South Korea witnessed a predictable flourish of street
protests over the lifting of quotas, what then ensued was far less
expected and far more interesting: a boom in popular and
groundbreaking Korean films.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, South Korean filmmakers are filling the seats of the
country's movie houses with a bumper crop of thematically
provocative films. And where Korean movies once seemed quaint or
artistically static, many of the best recent features have been
made with the kind of production values more typically associated
with Hollywood or Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Swiri,'' a tingling espionage tale, has surpassed ``Titanic''
as the biggest box office earner ever in South Korea. What is more,
the movie has won major commercial exposure for Korean film in
foreign markets, doing well throughout much of the Far East. When
it was released in Japan recently it burst out of the gate, winning
the top ranking at the box office in its first week in the
theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Swiri'' exemplifies the new Korean filmmaking not only in its
commercial success, its Hollywood-like action scenes and strong
script, but also because of its willingness to take on themes that
only recently were forbidden.
</P>
<P>
   The plot revolves around the romantic relationship of a South
Korean intelligence agent and a seemingly innocuous female office
worker who _ unbeknownst to him almost until the guns-blazing end _
is a North Korean mole. The female lead, moreover, is at the heart
of a diabolical terrorist plot by renegade northern agents bent on
bringing about a war to reunify the divided peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   Stories of tangled allegiances like these were systematically
banned in South Korea before President Kim Dae-jung began his
so-called sunshine policy of constructive engagement with the
hardline communist government to the north. Sympathetic treatments
of northerners are as rare as direct peace talks between the
estranged countries. And even Kim was recently taken to task by the
opposition for having called his North Korean counterpart a
``serious'' leader.
</P>
<P>
   But that didn't stop the director, Kang Jae-kyu, from giving a
human side even to ``Swiri's'' North Korean villains. ``Young drunk
kids here, yelling in the streets,'' says the leader of the North
Korean infiltrators in a taunting and pitiful telephone call to his
pursuers from downtown Seoul. ``While people in the North are
starving to death, people here have waste building up in their
bellies.''
</P>
<P>
   Kang said: ``The theme of my film is not ideology, which remains
really controversial in Korea. I just wanted to depict something
the way it is. North Koreans are human beings, from the very same
race that we are. I wanted to understand the characters in terms of
who they are and what they are and not simply treat them as the
enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Kang's movie is among the first in a rush of titles dealing with
the face-off between North and South Korea. Others include ``The
Spy,'' a humorous tale about a northern agent who is so clueless
that the police won't believe he is really a spy, and ``Phantom,
the Submarine,'' another thriller.
</P>
<P>
   The Cold War may have faded from Western movie screens, but it
is still a grim reality here, never far from daily life. And the
best of these new films have not only had to struggle with taboos,
but also avoid scaring _ or boring _ away moviegoers with themes
that bring people depressingly back to earth.
</P>
<P>
   ```Swiri' succeeded ultimately because it is good
entertainment,'' said Jae Hyung-jang, 47, who teaches film at
Dongkuk University in Seoul. ``It is an embrace of the Hollywood
style, in terms of dynamic directing, tight plots and, most of all,
suspense.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest success among recent Korean films was
``Lies,'' a film that instantly became controversial because of its
abundant and provocative use of sex. ``Lies'' has been a box-office
hit, although it suffered initially from government attempts at
censorship and black market sales of the film on video.
</P>
<P>
   In matters of public morality and social mores, Confucian South
Korea easily ranks among the most conservative industrialized
societies in the world. And in both his subject matter and his
cinematography, Jang Sun-woo, the movie's director, delivers what
can only be called a withering attack on this world.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a novel that was once banned here and whose author was
jailed, ``Lies'' is the story of an obsessive, sadomasochistic love
affair that develops between an 18-year-old high school girl and a
famous 38-year-old sculptor whose wife is away studying in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the 115-minute film is consumed by the increasingly
unconventional sex between the two, including intense beatings that
the man, named J, administers to the young woman, named Y.
</P>
<P>
   Jang said that the sex in the movie was ultimately meant to be
boring and that the couple's pursuit of erotic pleasure was
intended as an illustration of the emptiness of upper-middle class
life in Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The extensive nudity and profanity alone would themselves make
this an unusual and daring film for South Korea. But subtly,
cumulatively rather than by preaching, the movie makes many other
points that few Korean movies have ever made so forcefully.
</P>
<P>
   Those issues range from the growing phenomenon of adult sex with
school-age girls, to the compulsive industriousness of Koreans, to
the systematic subordination of women to men through Korea's
codified, honorific-filled language. Two images that seem to have
brought pangs of conscience were early scenes that showed Y in her
school uniform casually talking about sex with an adult and later
scenes when she drops the use of humble speech to address her lover
and finally assumes the sadist's role.
</P>
<P>
   Some people reduce the film to its sexual content, buying
underground copies because of it or condemning it and urging that
the film be banned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cultural changes we are undergoing here in Korea are like
a runaway train,'' said Kuk Won-shin, a professor of philosophy at
Chongshin University who leads a citizen's group that urged the
banning of ``Lies.'' ``The core of this movie is cultural guerrilla
warfare,'' he said. ``You have two sides lined up at the front, and
this movie is trying to create a new front, way off in the
distance. We must somehow bring things back in line.''
</P>
<P>
   Comments like these bring a smile of satisfaction from Jang, who
replied: ``This movie can be compared to salt. For some living
things it is a tonic or a preservative. For others, it is a
poison.''

BARBARA COONEY, 83; WROTE AND ILLUSTRATED BOOKS FOR CHILDREN

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Barbara Cooney of Damariscotta, Maine, an author and illustrator
of more than 100 children's books, died Friday in Maine Medical
Center in Portland. She was 83.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Cooney won many awards for her work. In 1959, she was
awarded the Caldecott Medal for children's book illustration for
``The Chanticleer and the Fox, '' a retelling of Chaucer's
cautionary tale about the rooster who bests his wily friend. She
won a second Caldecott Medal in 1980 for her illustrations of
Donald Hall's poem, ``Ox-Cart man.'' She won the American Book
Award for children's literature in 1982 for ``Miss Rumphius,'' the
story of an elderly woman who scattered lupine seeds wherever she
walked to make the world more beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   In a story published in The Boston Globe on Sept. 14, 1986, Miss
Cooney explained: ``In the beginning was the word. That is the most
important thing to remember. It isn't your pictures. It is what is
said. It's like a string of beads: if you don't have the string it
won't hang together.''
</P>
<P>
   She was born in Room 1127 of the Hotel Bossert in Brooklyn,
N.Y., which was built by her maternal grandfather. She was raised
on Long Island and spent summers in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Smith College, she studied at the Art
Students League in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked to read,'' she said in 1986, ``so I thought it would
be perfect to do book illustrations. I never thought of it as a
secondary art. Many people do, of course, because it is
reproduction. But when you stop and think about it, when you think
of all the people who illustrated the Bible and all those people
who illustrated Homer, all those vase painters and so forth, I
really do think it is an art. You have the capacity to reach so
many, many people.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Cooney served in the Women's Army Corps during World War
II. She was discharged for ``the convenience of the government,''
according to her discharge papers, when she became pregnant with
her first child.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1997, Miss Cooney gave $550,000 to the Damariscotta
Library, to be used in part to raise money for a new library on the
condition that it remain downtown. ``Libraries are the custodians
of civilization,'' she said, later increasing her gift by $300,000.
Groundbreaking for the new library is next month.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, she was declared a ``living treasure of the State of
Maine'' by Governor Angus King.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barbara's death is a tremendous loss to the literary community
and to the people of Maine,'' King said Monday. ``As the father of
five children, I consider myself a connoisseur of children's books
and I would put `Miss Rumphius' in the stratosphere of the top five
children's books, which would include `Where the Wild Things Are,'
`Goodnight Moon' and anything involving Curious George.''
</P>
<P>
   She leaves her husband, Charles Talbot Porter; two daughters,
Gretel Porter of Freeport, Maine, and Phoebe Porter of Conway,
Mass.; two sons, Barnaby Porter of Damariscotta and Charles T.
Porter Jr. of Puerto Williams, Chile; two brothers, Daniel Cooney
of Darien, Conn., and David Cooney of Arlington Heights, Ill.;
three grandchildren, and a great-grandchild.

ARIZONA PARKS WORKER FIRED AFTER GLOBE PUBLISHES COMMENTARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arizona state park officials fired an employee last week after
he wrote an opinion piece for the Boston Globe criticizing the
artificiality of a popular new state park.
</P>
<P>
   Parks director Kenneth Travous said the article brought
``discredit and embarrassment to the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for a Washington employee whistleblower group are
challenging the dismissal of Matt Chew, charging that Arizona has
violated his right to free speech. Before this incident, Chew had
favorable job reviews for seven years at the parks department, the
attorneys said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite appearances to the contrary, Arizona state employees
remain American citizens,'' said Jeff Ruch, director of Public
Employees for Environmental Responsibility, which is defending
Chew. ``Bureaucratic tin despots like Ken Travous cannot run a
gulag Arizona where dissidents are summarily exiled.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Bilbrey, a spokeswoman for the department, declined to
comment because she said Chew's firing is a personnel matter.
</P>
<P>
   In Chew's piece, which appeared in the Globe's Focus section
Feb. 6, he criticized the Kartchner Caverns State Park, a cave
filled with bats where scheduled tours are sold out into the
spring. Chew said the parks department had to ``civilize'' the cave
to allow the public in, making entrances easier and adding lights
to eliminate the pitch blackness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took something unimaginable and reduced it to what we could
imagine, the predictable product of an unremarkable mindset,'' said
Chew, the natural areas program coordinator and planner for Arizona
State Parks.
</P>
<P>
   But Travous said that Chew should not have identified himself in
the article as a parks employee and said he misused the state
computer system in e-mailing it to the Globe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your misconduct also wrongfully sought to bring discredit and
embarrassment to the state,'' wrote Travous in a Feb. 24 letter
informing Chew that he was fired.
</P>
<P>
   Chew denies that he did anything wrong by disclosing his title
in the article, which Globe policy requires, or that he misused the
state computer system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a constitutional right to express my opinion and I did
not intend, nor do I believe my essay does, bring any discredit on
the state or the people who work for it,'' he said.

TEEN AUDIENCE DISSATISFIED WITH BUSH `CIRCUMLOCUTION' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT AND ANN SCALES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   METAIRIE, La. _ Blaming ``dark dungeons of evil on the
Internet'' in part for school shootings, George W. Bush Monday told
a high school crowd that parents need to pay close attention to
their children's hobbies to help curb youth violence.
</P>
<P>
   Then Bush took some punches himself.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving tepid applause from a diverse crowd at the Grace
King High School outside New Orleans, Bush was confronted by
several teenagers about his views on gay marriage, single mothers
and rumors of his own drug use. And it did not take long for the
Texas governor to make it clear he was irritated, by the last
topic, at least.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a game in politics that says, `Let's float a rumor and
force somebody to talk about it.' And I'm not playing the game,''
Bush said. ``I've been investigated, they've had reporters all over
my background.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``You can draw any conclusion you want, but what you
cannot draw is the conclusion that I have not brought honor and
respect when given the highest office in my state.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's remark did not satisfy the questioner, 17-year-old Glenn
Dyer, a high school senior who wanted to know the difference
between President Clinton's parsing of the word ``is'' and Bush's
refusal to say flat-out that he had never done drugs. Nor did Bush
entirely please another student, 16-year-old Juan Espinoza. When he
asked Bush why he opposed gay marriage, Bush replied: ``Because I
believe that marriage is between a man and a woman.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a thing for circumlocution,'' the high school junior
said afterward. ``He had a few good points. But overall, he just
managed to avoid questions by repeating the same answers in
different ways.''
</P>
<P>
   The teenagers' queries, while hardly new, represent the
challenge Bush faces now that he is preparing for the general
election: getting out his message, as opposed to simply reacting to
controversial questions, chiefly those posed by Vice President Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, as in recent days, Bush's message was simple: He thinks
that Gore is a shameless politician.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy will say anything to get elected,'' Bush said,
repeating his mantra of late. With Senate majority leader Trent
Lott by his side, Bush stood in front of a mural of the US Capitol
in a high school classroom in Mississippi and fielded questions
about Gore's claim that he is a champion of campaign finance
reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Vice President Gore stands up and says all of a sudden
he's a campaign funding reform advocate, after having gone to a
Buddhist temple a couple of years ago, I'm not going to let that
pass by,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, meanwhile, spent part of the day campaigning in Miami at a
hospital that treats gunshot victims, where he inserted himself
into the war of words between Clinton and Wayne LaPierre, executive
director of the National Rifle Association, over gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Gore called comments by LaPierre that Clinton was willing to
``accept a certain level of killing'' in this country to further
his and Gore's political agenda ``shocking,'' and asked LaPierre to
apologize for his remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that Mr. LaPierre's comment reveals a kind of
sickness at the very heart of the NRA,'' Gore said at the
University of Miami's Jackson Memorial Medical Center. ``I call
upon him to apologize for those comments to the people of this
country and to join the vast majority of Americans in supporting
mandatory child safety trigger locks and other common sense
restrictions to get guns out of the hands of people who shouldn't
have them.''
</P>
<P>
   LaPierre and Clinton traded charges on Sunday on ABC's ``This
Week,'' when LaPierre attributed Clinton's renewed focus on guns to
his interest in getting Gore elected. ``The pollsters and
consultants are telling them, scare suburban women,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore shot back that LaPierre's comment was a ``sick way'' of
looking at the issue of gun control. When asked about the exchange,
Bush declined to ask LaPierre to apologize. But he did say he
regretted the name-calling.
</P>
<P>
   And earlier in the day, when asked what he would do about the
high number of school shootings, Bush said that ``first of all,''
he believed law-abiding citizens should be allowed to protect
themselves. He also said he supported some restrictions, such as
instant background checks.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's a larger issue at hand, and that's for mothers and
dads to pay attention to their children,'' Bush said. ``When kids
get caught in these dark dungeons of evil on the Internet, somebody
needs to know how to help.''

 &HT;    Aetna action brings relief to some
 &HT;    By Andy Miller
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Aetna's rejection of a $10 billion buyout offer by
WellPoint Health Networks and a second company should ease some
sudden jitters for investors and shareholders in Blue Cross and
Blue Shield of Georgia's parent company.
</P>
<P>
   The bid for Aetna, launched in late February, had appeared to
imperil WellPoint's pending $500 million acquisition of Cerulean,
parent of Blue Cross.
</P>
<P>
   State or federal regulators could have decided not to let
California-based WellPoint hold both Blue Cross' and Aetna's
memberships in Georgia. Together, they could encompass more than 50
percent of metro Atlanta's managed care enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   If the WellPoint purchase of Blue Cross of Georgia goes through,
several groups stand to benefit, including Cerulean shareholders,
private investors, a health care foundation, and more than 250 Blue
Cross employees.
</P>
<P>
   That deal has been delayed for months by a legal question of
determining the number of Cerulean shareholders. State Insurance
Commissioner John Oxendine also must approve the WellPoint
acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   WellPoint and Cerulean remain ''firmly committed'' to closing
their transaction as soon as possible, Charlie Harman, a company
vice president, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   WellPoint and a unit of Dutch-based ING Group offered $44 in
cash and $26 in WellPoint common stock for each share of Aetna. ING
Group, a financial services company, owns Life of Georgia, an
Atlanta-based life insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   While rejecting the offer, Aetna said Sunday it will split into
separate financial services and health care businesses, each
publicly traded. Aetna said it will also likely sell off parts of
its international business.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna's shares fell $5.25 Monday to $50.75 in New York Stock
Exchange trading.
</P>
<P>
   Still, analyst Kenneth Abramowitz of Sanford C. Bernstein
predicted Aetna will be worth more, by the end of the year, than
the $70 per-share offer.
</P>
<P>
   Abramowitz added that splitting the company into two ``generally
leads to a rejuvenation of both companies.''
</P>
<P>
   But analyst Edmund Kroll of SG Cowen &AMP; Co. noted that there were
not many details available about Aetna's restructuring plan.
``Investors are showing their skepticism,'' said Kroll, though he
added the split could end up benefiting Aetna. ``It would separate
the financial services from the taint of the HMO business,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hartford-based Aetna's shares had plummeted for about a year
before the news surfaced of WellPoint's acquisition bid.
</P>
<P>
   While saying it's open to other ``responsible'' offers, Aetna
announced plans to sell up to $1.5 billion in international assets,
to consider spinning off an Internet site and related businesses,
and to cut costs by $100 million to $150 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking at all our options, this is the best way to maximize
our assets,'' said William Donaldson, Aetna's chairman and chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna will study ways to improve the operations of its health
insurance unit, whose struggles with higher costs have depressed
the share price, Donaldson told investors during a conference call.
``Everything is on the table,'' said Donaldson. He replaced Richard
Huber, Aetna's chairman and chief executive, who resigned last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Other problems for Aetna include class-action litigation and
frayed relations with physicians and hospitals, including in metro
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson said the offer from WellPoint and ING was too low and
brought problems with integration. ``There were problems in the
areas of legality and antitrust as well as the problem of a
competitor coming in and looking at our books,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna's board was also concerned because WellPoint, while well
managed, doesn't have enough experience outside its home base of
California, Donaldson said.
</P>
<P>
   Wellpoint, which said it is ``disappointed'' by Aetna's
decision, added in a statement that it continues to believe that
the offer represents ''outstanding value for Aetna's
shareholders.'' ING said it's still interested in a transaction
with Aetna.
</P>
<P>
   The WellPoint-Blue Cross of Georgia acquisition, if completed,
would lead to:
</P>
<P>
   _ Thousands of Blue Cross policyholders who own Cerulean shares
getting cash and/or shares of stock in WellPoint.
</P>
<P>
   _ A group of private investors, who sank about $50 million into
Cerulean, netting a profit of $60 million in WellPoint stock.
</P>
<P>
   _ About 280 Blue Cross employees sharing a total of $28 million
in incentive bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   _ The endowment of a new nonprofit health care foundation with
$80 million in cash and WellPoint stock.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Cross shareholder issue will be addressed next week by
a three-judge panel of the Georgia Court of Appeals.

 &HT;    Lewis limo riders want immunity before talking
 &HT;    By Bill Torpy
 &HT;    and Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ At least two passengers in the limousine with pro
football star Ray Lewis during a Buckhead stabbing incident are
refusing to talk to prosecutors unless they are given immunity,
their attorneys said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The reluctance of the witnesses to talk _ and others are
apparently seeking similar deals _ displays the difficulty
prosecutors face in building a solid case against Lewis in the
stabbing murders, their attorneys say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It tells me they indicted (Lewis) too quickly,'' said Atlanta
attorney Bruce Morris, who also is seeking an immunity deal for his
client Kwame King, a friend of Lewis who was in the limousine in
the early morning hours of Jan. 31. Morris said King has not yet
talked to police or prosecutors, although he has spoken with Lewis'
defense team.
</P>
<P>
   King fears being charged with a crime if his account of the
scene does not fit the prosecution's theory, Morris said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the prosecution expects a certain statement''
supporting the prosecution, said Morris. ``Then they are
disappointed and question the veracity of that statement. My client
has no wish for that to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris said prosecutors have assured him that King is not a
suspect. ``But I want that in writing'' before he talks, Morris
said. Witnesses don't have to talk to police but can be forced to
testify at trial. However, lawyers always want to know what a
witness will say before he takes the stand.
</P>
<P>
   Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard declined to comment,
citing a gag order.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, 24, an All Pro linebacker, was indicted Feb. 11 on murder
and assault charges in the stabbing deaths of Jacinth Baker, 21,
and Richard Lollar, 24, both of Decatur. Two of Lewis'
acquaintances, Reginald Oakley, 31, of Baltimore and Joseph
Sweeting, 31, of Miami also were charged with murder. Trial is set
for May 15.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, out on $1 million bail, has been working out at the
Baltimore Ravens' training complex near Baltimore. His two
co-defendants remain jailed.
</P>
<P>
   Fulton County prosecutors gave immunity 10 days ago to Jessica
Robertson, a woman who was with Lewis in the limousine and later in
his hotel room. She turned over nine garment bags of Lewis'
clothing, which is being tested for blood. She was also the first
of about 10 passengers in the limo to talk with prosecutors. (Lewis
talked briefly with police the day of the killings.) She named the
other passengers, some of whom have hired lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors felt ``let down'' by what Robertson told them, said
Atlanta attorney Dwight Thomas, who represents another passenger in
the vehicle. ``They didn't hear what they wanted to hear,'' said
Thomas, who claims his client, an unidentified Texas law student,
had a better vantage point of the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said his client, who was in Atlanta Monday, was
``spooked'' when Fulton County district attorney's investigators
and Houston homicide detectives went to his client's mother's home
this weekend, Thomas said. Thomas said investigators showed the
woman pictures of the dead men lying in the street and the made
``questionable representations'' to her, telling the woman her son
doesn't need an attorney to talk to them.
</P>
<P>
   The incident only fueled fears that prosecutors may charge him
with a crime, Thomas said. Prosecutors are reluctant to give
immunity to any other witnesses, especially to men who were in the
vehicle that night because they don't know what involvement those
other passengers may have had in the deadly fight. ``It's
(prosecutors') theory the males are somewhat involved,'' he said.
``But with that in the back of their minds, I don't want my client
talking without (immunity).''

feminists and social scientists. But the case put forward was not,
as some assumed, a fringe theory developed by a pair of renegade
researchers. Rather, the arguments fit into a larger theoretical
framework, the work of a group of scientists who have ushered
Darwin into new and provocative areas. By Erica Goode. (The story

OSCAR NOMINEES SERVE UP HUMILITY AT LUNCH
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   All together everybody, and say it with feeling: ``This is not a
competition!''
</P>
<P>
   If it was uttered once, it was uttered 50 times by Oscar
nominees attending the Academy Award nominees' luncheon Monday at
the Beverly Hilton. Practically every question with the word
``competition'' elicited the same reply with varying degrees of
testiness: ``I don't look at this as a competition.''
</P>
<P>
   So said ``The Insider'' director Michael Mann and ``The Sixth
Sense's'' 11-year-old best supporting actor nominee Haley Joel
Osment (who, one reporter noted, must be ``11 years old going on
50.'')
</P>
<P>
   It was actor Kevin Spacey who deflected the awards hype with the
most eloquence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those of us who have been doing this long enough know to focus
on the process and on the work,'' said Spacey, a past Oscar winner
and a nominee for ``American Beauty. ``Then the movie opens, and it
gets to this point and there's this unnatural pitting of us against
each other. We don't feel that. I don't feel that at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The only predictions were by nominees who expected to lose. Best
actress nominee Julianne Moore said she had ``no expectation of
winning'' the Oscar. ``It will be Hilary (Swank) or Annette
(Bening), don't you think?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And best-song nominees Trey Parker and Marc Shaiman don't expect
their racey tune, ``Blame Canada,'' from ``South Park: Bigger,
Longer and Uncut'' to win. But whatever else happens on March 26,
Parker is hoping he won't lose to singer Phil Collins, a best-song
nominee for ``You'll Be in My Heart'' from ``Tarzan.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was suggested that Collins might actually be inside at
the luncheon Parker was attending, Parker replied, ``So what. He
can only weigh about a buck fifty.''
</P>
<P>
   Nominees said such Oscar-related festivities were opportunities
to get together with fellow performers. After following best-actor
nominee Russell Crowe to the podium, fellow Aussie Toni Collette
was asked about Crowe, with whom she worked in the 1992 film ``The
Efficiency Expert.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember getting drunk with him and him having to clean up
my vomit,'' Colette said with a big laugh.
</P>
<P>
   In a year with so many nominated films being inspired by actual
events, Swank (of ``Boys Don't Cry'') and ``The Insider's'' Mann
both discussed the themes of their nominated films and the
real-life characters who served as the films' inspirations: Brandon
Teena and Jeffrey Wigand. But when the discussion turned to
concerns over historical accuracy, Denzel Washington _ who played
Rubin ``Hurricane'' Carter in ``The Hurricane'' _ parried the
question.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm up for best performance by an actor,'' said Washington.
``Rubin was 5-foot-8, 160 pounds; I'm 6-foot-1, 200 pounds, so I
guess I shouldn't play the part because I'm not the accurate
actor.''

<P>
   DAVIE, Fla. _ As Dan Marino gave his farewell speech Sunday
after 17 years as the Miami Dolphins quarterback and the National
Football League's most dominant career passing record-holder, he
tried to avoid making eye contact with his wife, Claire, who sat
sobbing nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept telling Claire that I can't cry during this thing,''
Marino said after formally announcing his retirement at the
Dolphins' training facility at Nova Southeastern University. ``I
felt many a time like crying, but I was able to hold back. Tried to
make a few jokes and keep it loose.''
</P>
<P>
   Marino, whose NFL career records include most touchdown passes
(420), most passing yards (61,361) and most completions (4,967),
said he decided to bring his playing career to a close at age 38
mostly because of his health. He has had six knee operations,
ruptured an Achilles' tendon and last season suffered a scary neck
injury that sidelined him for five games.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are physical limitations I would have had to deal
with,'' he said. ``It kept coming back to how my legs felt during
last season going through the neck injury and not knowing whether I
was going to be able to throw the football.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Dolphins indicated by their long, awkward silence that
their interest in Marino had waned, he was temporarily invigorated
by an offer from the Minnesota Vikings. Coach Dennis Green was so
interested in Marino that he offered to let him fly home after
every Sunday game and not return until Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Marino said he had gone through a number of emotional swings
before deciding last Thursday morning to retire. ``There were times
I told Claire we were going and two hours later I'd say, `No, I
don't think I can go,''' he said. ``It is the toughest thing I had
to deal with professionally in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   A source close to Marino said that if the Dolphins had shown as
much enthusiasm for his continuing to play as the Vikings had, he
would likely still be a Dolphin. ``He probably would have gone to
training camp, to see how he felt physically, and then take it from
there,'' the source said.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins have been widely perceived by their fans as
bungling the handling of Marino's status, and hundreds of fans
showed up to give No. 13 a raucous sendoff.
</P>
<P>
   The team's owner, H. Wayne Huizenga, tried to defuse some of the
tension by making several announcements: retiring Marino's No. 13
jersey; saying that a statue of Marino would be placed at Pro
Player Stadium next to one of Don Shula, the Hall of Fame coach;
naming a street near the stadium after Marino, and saying he would
install Marino into the Dolphins' Ring of Honor at their first home
game next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``To put it simply, Danny, nobody did it better than you; you
are the greatest quarterback ever,'' Huizenga said before the pair
hugged.
</P>
<P>
   Shula attended Monday's announcement, as did former Dolphins
Mark Clayton, Dwight Stephenson, Jimmy Cefalo, Kim Bokamper and Joe
Rose. Jimmy Johnson, the recently retired Dolphins coach, was
conspicuously absent, and his successor, Dave Wannstedt, stayed in
the background and left quickly afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between Johnson and Marino became particularly
acrimonious last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would just have to say that our relationship was up and down
at times,'' Marino said. ``We had some great, great days together
and some fun times. And times I wasn't very happy here while he was
coaching, and that is just being honest.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose, a former tight end who became a local television
broadcaster, caught the first touchdown of Marino's NFL career in
1983 against the Raiders, after the rookie from Pittsburgh relieved
David Woodley. But Rose, Marino's roommate on the road,
particularly recalled an occasion when they woke up in Baltimore on
game day to find it snowing hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looks like a four-touchdown day,'' Rose quoted Marino as
saying. ``I said, `You've got to be kidding me.' But that was just
the kind of confidence he had. And he went out and had a great
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Clayton, who teamed with Mark Duper to catch 1,030 of Marino's
passes for 16,743 yards and 134 touchdowns, said they used to kid
the quarterback that they were saving his reputation with acrobatic
catches taken from defenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd tell him that he'd be nothing without us,'' Clayton said.
``He'd dispute that. He'd say, `No, no, no. You didn't make me. I
make you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Clayton said that he and Duper became so comfortable with Marino
that sometimes the quarterback would abandon the usual play calls.
``He'd just say, `Get open, the ball's coming to you,' '' Clayton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Marino was the last of five quarterbacks taken in the first
round in 1983. But that 27th pick soon had Shula's eyes bulging.
Marino passed for a league-record 48 touchdowns in 1984, then had
44 two seasons later, making him the only player in NFL history to
throw at least 40 touchdown passes twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never felt you were out of a ball game with Dan Marino as
your quarterback,'' Shula said. ``Today is the celebration of a
great career _ an unmatched career, really.''

SOUTH FLORIDA FANS RECALL MARINO'S BOYISH EXUBERANCE

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The Miami Dolphins' millionaire quarterback was beloved
for his heart-squeezing comeback drives, for his quick release and
his perfect, arching spiral, and for his toughness, for playing
with a battered body that seemed as if it would fall to pieces if
he untied all the knee braces, ankle splints and rib protectors he
wore into battle.
</P>
<P>
   But what Mike Vogt, a fan, will miss most is the feeling that,
every time he saw the famous Dan Marino at work, he was seeing a
boy at play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what we all loved about him was he had this boyish
joy,'' said Vogt, after he learned Monday that the National
Football League's record-shattering passer and South Florida's most
famous sports celebrity had finally, officially retired. ``We all
felt that.''
</P>
<P>
   Marino would smile and even hop in the air like a little boy
when he completed a long pass, and would pout and fret, his face a
bright, shining red, when he was intercepted or a receiver dropped
the ball, recalled the Dolphin fans who were really, at heart,
Marino fans.
</P>
<P>
   It was as if, depending on the situation, he was always on the
verge of either snatching up the ball and going home, or
celebrating with a glass of chocolate milk.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he'd throw the ball, he'd just grin like a 10-year-old
would,'' said Vogt, a computer programmer in Boca Raton who has
been a Marino fan for all of his 17 years as a Dolphin. ``He was
magic.''
</P>
<P>
   Marino, who threw the football down field, with varying results,
more times than anyone in professional football ever has, will not
throw for the Dolphins _ or for anyone else _ ever again. And in
South Florida, even though his retirement had been rumored for
months, people who followed Miami football reacted with a mix of
gloom and relief.
</P>
<P>
   After a disappointing year in which he played injured and played
as a mortal, not the superstar who built a legend, he chose to
retire at age 38 rather than attempt a comeback with the Dolphins
or another team. He watched a young, strong backup win games in his
place, and it became clear that the future did not include him here
in the city that worshiped him, at least not in an aqua-and-orange
uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sundays will not be the same,'' said Richard Molinary, a
customer service representative who works in Hollywood, north of
Miami in Broward County.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be like something's not quite right,'' said Molinary,
who has a fame of his own in Florida sports circles as the
often-photographed ``Miami Fanatic,'' because he paints his face in
Dolphin colors and wears a Dolphins towel like a cape. ``I started
my career when he started his, in 1983, so I've watched him game
after game for all these years. They've been some of the best years
of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Molinary and other fans winced as injuries to Marino's knees and
ankles took their toll, as their hero took the field in football
cleats that were so built-up and padded that they looked more like
the boots worn by Frankenstein's monster. At times, it seemed like
Marino was so tightly bound and strapped that the only thing that
really moved was his arm.
</P>
<P>
   It does not matter to people who loved him that Marino's last
game was a 62-7 playoff loss at Jacksonville. ``He is the Babe Ruth
of football,'' Molinary said, standing outside the Dolphins'
training camp in Davie Monday, as inside, Marino announced his
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Marino did not cry; he just seemed as if someone had let all the
air out of him, even as the Dolphins' owner, H. Wayne Huizenga,
told him he would have a statue erected of Marino outside Pro
Player Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to miss Sunday afternoons,'' Marino said.
</P>
<P>
   Marino became a superstar when Miami was a greatly different
city, when English, not Spanish, was still the principal language
and the region had only the Dolphins _ there was no professional
basketball, hockey or baseball in Miami then.
</P>
<P>
   Now Miami is generally regarded as the financial, cultural and
entertainment capital of Latin America, where international soccer
crowds fill the Orange Bowl. In downtown Miami, where the
storefront signs are mostly in Spanish and the pedestrians, many of
them new Americans, talk of everything but football, Marino's
retirement was barely noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could care less about football or Dan Marino,'' said Lydia
Martin, speaking in Spanish at a courtyard restaurant in downtown
Miami. ``They make him sound like he's God.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make a difference in my personal life,'' said
Martin, who was born in Colombia and has been living in Miami for
three years.
</P>
<P>
   While his retirement was covered by Spanish-language television,
radio and newspapers, Marino's fan base has mostly moved north to
Broward and Palm Beach counties, along with most of the region's
Anglos. Even the Dolphins' stadium itself has moved north, from the
Orange Bowl in downtown Miami to up near the Broward line.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's part of the old Miami,'' said Tony Segreto, an anchor for
WTVJ, the NBC affiliate in Miami, and co-host of Marino's
television show. But, said Segreto, he also drew many new fans from
the new Miami, in the way only a superstar athlete could. ``I don't
think an athlete can ever have the same impact on this town.''
</P>
<P>
   After every famous athlete's retirement, fans and media exhaust
superlatives in creating their legend. But in Miami, say longtime
fans and friends, Marino will be remembered almost as much for what
he did not do as for what he did.
</P>
<P>
   He never won a Super Bowl, ``the burning desire, what I played
for,'' said Marino, who lost his one chance in a 1985 loss to Joe
Montana and the San Francisco 49ers, 38-16.
</P>
<P>
   But, unlike so many sports superstars of the past decade, he
never embarrassed himself in the community he represented. He was
never arrested driving drunk, doing or buying cocaine, soliciting a
prostitute, resisting arrest at a wild party or become entangled in
a nasty paternity suit, said fans. ``He's the kind you want to
emulate,'' said Kenny Dorsey, the freshman starting quarterback at
the University of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of making headlines with the police, Marino made them by
adopting a Chinese baby, Niki Lin, with his wife, Claire, rescuing
the child from an orphanage. He spent and raised millions for
charities. In 1992 he established the Dan Marino Foundation to
benefit children's charities, and did television commercials with
his autistic son, Michael, to help raise money.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's become more than just the guy who throws the ball,'' said
Jimmy Cefalo, who played football with the Dolphins and Marino as a
wide receiver.
</P>
<P>
   His former coach, Don Shula, summed up his quarterback's time in
Miami this way:
</P>
<P>
   ``You just want to applaud.''  &QL;

<P>
   SAGAMIHARA CITY, Japan _ Little known to its inhabitants, who
include a sprinkling of Chinese and Southeast Asians, this
otherwise unremarkable town an hour outside Tokyo could soon be
known as a forerunner of Japan's 21st century immigration boom.
</P>
<P>
   Shrinking faster than any other nation, this country's
population is projected to decline by 17 percent during the next
half century. By 2050 the population will dwindle to 105 million
from 127 million now, according to U.N. estimates. To maintain a
steady population, on average, Japanese women would have to give
birth to 2.08 children. But in Japan, by 1998, the last year for
which such information is available, the childbearing average stood
at 1.38 per woman. What is worse, the rapid aging of Japan's people
will further accelerate the population decline as there will be
fewer women of childbearing age.
</P>
<P>
   Government experts, demographers and economists say that as
Japan loses people _ and workers _ the only way for it to maintain
its lofty living standards is to quickly begin accepting immigrants
in far greater numbers and to abandon the age-old comfort of its
near-uniform ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has gone one step further, pointing out that
Japan, which has the lowest percentage of immigrants and expatriate
workers of any advanced industrialized nation, would need to take
in 600,000 immigrants a year just to maintain its present work
force. Already, industries like elderly care, hospital work and the
lowest-paying farming and manufacturing jobs are struggling to find
enough workers to keep up with demand.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Japan's coming demographic crisis, which will affect
everything from financing pensions for the world's oldest
population to supplying workers to crucial manufacturing
industries, any discussion of remedies quickly collides with a
deep-seated social resistance to accepting outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   Sagamihara and the surrounding area came by its immigrant
population through an accident of history, and not as a result of
any repopulation drive. The city was selected two decades ago as
one of the relocation centers for about 10,000 people from
Southeast Asia who were brought to Japan in an extremely rare bid
by this country to absorb part of the region's swelling pool of
refugees. Life in places like this may differ little from the rest
of Japan, but nonetheless, as many as 80 percent of the respondents
in a recent national poll said they opposed allowing any more
immigrants into the country.
</P>
<P>
   Most invoked Japan's historically high unemployment rate in
opposing more immigrants. But experts say there is far more at work
in the rejection _ above all, a tradition of insularity that openly
regards most foreigners, particularly fellow Asians, with disdain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We face tremendous handicaps to internationalize our
country,'' said Masakazu Yamazaki, a playwright from Osaka
University who is a member of a commission recently appointed by
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi to identify national priorities for the
21st century. ``Japanese are not confident about opening up, but
this is because of historical factors. Japan was effectively closed
up until the 1970s or 1980s.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan was, in fact, an officially closed country between 1639
and 1854, with no immigration or foreign travel allowed, on penalty
of death. Since then, the country has scarcely opened. The largest
influx of foreigners was the arrival of thousands of Koreans
brought to Japan to work or fight on its behalf during Japan's
35-year annexation of Korea early in this century. And even after
several generations here, these Koreans have never been truly
accepted into Japanese society. In 1998, the latest year for which
information is available, 1.1 million foreigners were registered
with the government as residents of Japan. Another 270,000 are
estimated to be living here without proper visas.
</P>
<P>
   Yamazaki's panel was created largely because of government alarm
over the implications of Japan's expected population decline, and
worries that Japan's largely homogeneous, monolingual population is
ill prepared to face the challenges of globalization. Even before
the panel's conclusions were published in January, the Justice
Ministry began to formulate new, slightly looser rules governing
what types of jobs foreigners should be allowed to have in Japan.
In an unprecedented pronouncement, the ministry urged Japanese to
``aggressively carry out the smooth acceptance'' of foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many acknowledge, any plans for increasing the number of
foreigners runs up against the harsh realities of a culture that is
fearful, suspicious and often even openly contemptuous of
outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, lock companies appeal to racial fear in advertisements
that bluntly link crime to foreigners. Most real estate companies
openly refuse to take foreign clients. Banks often refuse to lend
to foreigners. And many places of entertainment, from pachinko
parlors and bars to hot baths, maintain a Japanese-only policy.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese disdain for others is directed most strongly at other
Asians, who would be the most logical source of future immigration.
But even the cautious recommendation of increased ``intellectual
immigration'' made recently by the prime minister's panel already
faces serious resistance.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, the prime minister, Yasuhiro Nakasone, set a national
goal for Japan to draw 100,000 foreign university students to the
country annually by the year 2000. But with its reputation as a
relatively unwelcoming place for foreigners _ particularly other
Asians _ the number of exchange students has stagnated around
50,000 since 1993. Foreigners who study in the United States, or
other Western countries, often do so with the desire, or at least
option in mind, of eventually working in the country. Japan's
immigration laws make naturalization almost impossible, and
rigorous work-permit laws and rules governing residency are meant
to discourage prolonged stays.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, foreign faculty members here have often found
themselves subject to discrimination, typically denied equal pay or
tenure and other benefits on the same basis as their Japanese
counterparts. In one recent, widely discussed case, Gwendolyn
Gallagher, a foreign professor who is married to a Japanese and has
lived here for 14 years, was dismissed from Asahikawa University
with the sole explanation that the school needed ``fresh
foreigners.'' To the shock of many foreign academics here, the
dismissal was upheld in court.
</P>
<P>
   In cases like these, many who favor increased immigration say
that the government has often set nice-sounding goals, but has
failed to lead.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese are taught as children that when they find something of
value that has been lost, they should seek to return it. But moral
lessons about discrimination are totally absent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japanese are very interested in racial discrimination in other
countries, but they behave as if they are not aware of the
phenomenon in their own country,'' said Hiroshi Tanaka, a professor
of sociology at Hitotsubashi University in Tokyo. ``Now that we
have these problems in our country we need to have regulation. We
need leadership on this issue, but the basic premise of the
government is that Japanese do not accept foreigners.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Here in Sagamihara, in contrast to most of Japan, where
foreigners are few and far between, Asian immigrants represent an
appreciable minority. In Sagamihara City's schools, about 3 percent
of the students nowadays come from countries including Laos or
Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   At the Oshima Elementary School in Sagamihara, a small number of
Chinese, Laotian and Cambodian children blend into their classrooms
so well that a visitor would be unable to point most of them out.
Such scenes make up a sort of best-case fantasy of Japanese who
realize that their country will have to open up to outsiders: As
long as the change is imperceptible, the nuisance will be
tolerable.
</P>
<P>
   But like the country in general, the school makes almost no
concessions to the foreigners who attend it. What is done to help
them depends largely on a few volunteers, and on the goodwill of
the administrators and teachers here.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike an American school, say, in New York or Los Angeles,
there is no special program of second-language instruction, or
special learning classes. There are no social workers to ease the
adjustment of families, and as the academics become increasingly
rigorous in middle school and beyond, few immigrant children are
able to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what has happened to the kids who came in the
early years, but I have heard that some of them have had hard
lives,'' said the school's principal, Tadashi Shinoda. ``It seems
that some of their families have collapsed.''
</P>
<P>
   If mixing is free and easy at the youngest ages, by the time
immigrants reach the age to attend the high school next door, they
find that their young Japanese classmates have frequently absorbed
the hostility to foreigners that is characteristic of their elders
and often express it cruelly.
</P>
<P>
   Korean immigrants to Japan have long known the phenomenon of
taunting and hazing by their school-aged Japanese peers. In this
school district, now it is the turn of the Cambodians and other
Southeast Asians who began arriving here in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had one girl who was looked down upon by schoolmates,'' said
Masahisa Minato, a teacher who recently wrote a study about the
challenges of absorbing foreign students. ``She was told, `You
should go back to your home,' and `You are too black.' Through this
experience, she lost her desire to study.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that kind of condition exists all over Japan, even in
elementary school,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Such attitudes have led many Japanese who advocate greater
openness toward foreigners to feel pessimistic about the future.
Even if Japan faces labor shortages in the near future, they say,
there is little to suggest that hostility toward outsiders will
soon fade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japanese society still has fantasies about our pure blood, and
about the ability of Japanese people to understand each other
better than others,'' said Katsuo Yoshinari, head of the Asian
People's Friendship Society. ``Even if the government or the
business community accepts more foreigners, without much more
effort on our side, these feelings of rejection toward foreigners
will remain strong.''

 &HT;    Rapper may have been shooters' aim
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One of the people shot in a stretch limousine in the
parking lot of an apartment complex Sunday morning may have been
mistaken for local rapper Shawntae Harris _ known as Da Brat _
police and one of the limo's passengers said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the nine passengers in the black Toyota limousine were
shot by two men just outside Harris' town house in Buckhead,
Atlanta's upscale residential area and entertainment district.
Investigators said the shooters may have mistaken the ambushed
vehicle for one Harris rents occasionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not ruling anything out at this time,'' said Sgt. Rick
Chambers. ``The shooters may or may not have been after Harris.
This happened in her apartment complex and the limousine looks like
one she rents.''
</P>
<P>
   Retaliation against Harris also has not been ruled out as a
motive for the shooting, Chambers said.
</P>
<P>
   On the night of March 7, Harris and another woman alledgedly
were involved in a fight inside the Chili Pepper nightclub in
Buckhead. Rezue Robateue said Harris struck her across the eye with
a .22-caliber gun after a companion of Harris' told Robateue to
leave the club's VIP lounge, said Robateue's attorney, Jim Lewis.
Harris' attorney, B.J. Bernstein, said her client is innocent and
has no connection to Robateue, described by Lewis as an aspiring
rapper.
</P>
<P>
   Police at the Sunday shooting scene said one of the limousine
passengers said the incident may have been retaliation for the
Chili Pepper brawl.
</P>
<P>
   One of the passengers in the limousine said the vehicle entered
the Post Chastain complex about 3:40 a.m. Sunday to drop off
another member of the party who lives there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no idea Da Brat also lived there,'' said Carmille
Plummer. ``We had gone to a birthday party and we were going back
home dropping off people at their apartments. When we all got back
into the limo and started to drive off, we were about to turn
around in the parking lot when we were confronted by two men who
got in front of the limo and just started shooting at us.''
</P>
<P>
   Plummer said she is not sure whether the two men followed the
limousine inside the gated complex or were already waiting in the
parking lot facing Harris' building. They shot at the vehicle 13
times, striking chauffeur Rodney Kemp and passengers Steve Bennet,
Fray Gordon, Sonya Kelley and Pamela Johnson. Only Bennet had been
released from Grady Memorial Hospital by Monday afternoon,
investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Originally police said the shooters left the complex in a
late-model Ford Thunderbird. But Monday, Chambers said it's not
clear what kind of car the men were driving.
</P>
<P>
   The incident has prompted management at Post Chastain to beef up
security, said Michelle Toups, vice president of Atlanta-based Post
Properties.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein and Harris' publicist, Tresa Sanders, said Harris is
in Cancun filming a video and is staying abreast of developments in
the shooting case.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is not getting the news in Mexico, but we're talking to
her regularly,'' Bernstein said. ``She is innocent of the charges
filed against her in last Tuesday's incident, but if this
(shooting) is retaliation against her, then it just shows the
instability of the people who were involved in that fight and are
accusing her.''

COMMENTARY: A CASE FOR JANET RENO
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By GAIL COLLINS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's becoming increasingly clear that Al Gore came within an
inch of acquiring his own personal special prosecutor last year.
But Attorney General Janet Reno wimped out at the last minute,
ignoring the pleas of her own assistants.
</P>
<P>
   Thank God for Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   She has not been one of your all-time great attorneys general.
In the future, America may best remember Reno as the picture on the
wall of Director Skinner's office in ``The X-Files.'' Still, she's
a grown-up serving in an administration full of adolescent
personalities, and the most adult decision of her life was to say
no when she was asked to sic a special prosecutor on the vice
president at a time when the president himself was already well on
his way to impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore has a lot to answer for when it comes to the way he
scrounged money for the 1996 Democratic campaign, particularly the
fact that he seemed to like it. ``Is it possible to do a
reallocation for me to take more of the events and the calls?'' he
asked during a White House strategy meeting. Our Al, always with
his hand up. Will the kid never stop volunteering?
</P>
<P>
   Come November, people are going to have to think very hard about
whether they want a president who enjoys calling up rich people and
asking them for money. We've survived one chief executive with
unseemly ideas of what constitutes a good time, but this may be
going too far.
</P>
<P>
   However, Gore got into trouble with the Justice Department over
something far more specific, and far less disturbing. He made
fund-raising calls from his White House office. There's an old law
barring federal employees from soliciting campaign contributions in
federal buildings. Nobody's sure if it applies to the vice
president, but if Gore had gone outdoors and used the family cell
phone, we would not be having this conversation.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general decided this wasn't a job for a special
prosecutor. But like everything involving the law and this
benighted administration, things got more complicated. Reno had
relied on assurances that the vice president was raising ``soft
money'' for the Democratic Party, not ``hard money'' for the
Clinton-Gore campaign. It turned out that wasn't true.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he didn't realize any of the money he was collecting
had gone to his own campaign. But then a memo surfaced. He said he
hadn't read it. It turned out he had attended a meeting where the
subject came up. He said he wasn't listening. Leon Panetta told
investigators the vice president had looked pretty attentive to
him. Gore said he had been drinking a lot of iced tea and therefore
might have been answering a call of nature when the incriminating
discussion took place.
</P>
<P>
   People, you are also going to have to decide whether you want a
president who has to go to the bathroom just when the most critical
moment of a meeting occurs. But when you pare down the legal issue
Reno was considering, it was whether somebody lied about something
that was peripheral to the original issue, which wasn't all that
big a deal to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's real offense wasn't picking up the wrong phone, but
allowing his office to become mired in sleazy fund-raising ventures
that he should have kept at arm's length out of a simple sense of
propriety. He isn't off the hook for that. The Republicans are
already preparing the ads. This fall you'll see so many pictures of
the vice president making nice with donation-bundling Buddhists,
you'll think it's a new TV series. There'll be endless tapes of him
trying to weasel out of the phone call thing by babbling about
``controlling legal authority.'' He understands how much trouble
he's in _ witness his sudden re-emergence as a born-again reformer,
the Saul of Tarsus for campaign finance.
</P>
<P>
   If the ethical slovenliness of the Clinton administration costs
him the presidency, the Democrats will have learned a lesson. If he
wins, perhaps the Republicans will wonder if they made a mistake
nominating a guy who's deep in the money pit himself.
</P>
<P>
   Not the most attractive choice the American voters have ever
faced, but when we make it, we won't have to wait for a special
prosecutor to tell us whether or not it was OK. Thank you, Janet
Reno. We owe you one.

 &HT;    Millwood quickly becomes a mainstay of Braves staff
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRADENTON, Fla. _ No one is ever going to accuse Kevin Millwood
of being in a hurry. The native of Bessemer City, N.C., walks
slowly, talks slowly and doesn't seem to be fazed by much.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's your basic laid-back country boy,'' said Chipper Jones,
who should know. ``Everything's in slow motion for him. He's just
one of those guys who gets really focused really fast when it's
time to pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to pitching, Millwood has been in fast-forward
ever since he stepped on a major-league mound. This spring is no
exception.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two seasons, Millwood has gone from fifth to fourth
and now third in the Braves rotation. The most recent move came a
week ago with word that John Smoltz would miss the season because
of a torn elbow ligament.
</P>
<P>
   But before he gets ahead of himself, Millwood, coming off his
first All-Star Game appearance and the best season on the Braves'
vaunted pitching staff, just hopes that not much changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole goal this year is the same as it was last year,''
Millwood said. ``I just want to give us a chance to win every time
I pitch. If I do that, then the numbers are going to come. That's
not something I really have to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   Going to the All-Star Game ``in my second full season is pretty
special,'' he said, ``but I don't want the first one to be my last
one. I can't have a lack of concentration and think I've got this
game whipped. When you think you're bigger than the game, then one
year or another it's going to jump up and bite you, so I'm just
trying to stay on an even keel and keep working hard and try to
make myself better every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Just three springs ago the name Millwood didn't register with
Bobby Cox. Then, on a rainy day in West Palm Beach, Fla., Cox
wandered into the indoor batting cages to watch some of the younger
pitchers in camp. He saw Millwood, then a 22-year-old minor-league
pitcher who never had thrown above the A level. Cox immediately was
impressed and began talking him up. Millwood was in Atlanta by the
middle of that season.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 1997, Millwood was the Braves' fifth starter. And
unlike the steady stream of arms to follow Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine
and Smoltz in recent years, he has stuck around.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stays under control. He doesn't get rattled,'' Cox said.
``He's the same all the time. Great makeup. Great disposition.
Great competitor. He's a nice kid, but he'll compete with
anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Millwood broke into the starting rotation for good Aug.
30, 1997, he has won 38 games and posted a 3.28 ERA. He has 35
victories in his first two full seasons. Smoltz won 26 his first
two full seasons, Maddux 24 and Glavine 21.
</P>
<P>
   Last year was different, though. Millwood had won 17 games in
1998 despite a 4.08 ERA. Last year, he won 18 with a 2.68 ERA. He
flirted with three no-hitters, held opponents to a
major-league-leading .202 batting average and finished second to Cy
Young winner Randy Johnson (2.48) among the National League ERA
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The difference in the two years?
</P>
<P>
   ``Experience, innings,'' Maddux said. ``Spend more time doing
it, learning what restaurants to go to on the road, how to get to
the parks, how to pitch hitters better.... He knows how to use his
pitches to take advantage of his stuff, where a lot of guys
don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Millwood was the best Braves starter for long stretches last
season. He also pulled the Braves even in their best-of-five
Division Series against the Astros with a one-hitter in Game 2, the
first postseason appearance of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux had success early, but not that much that early.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants so bad to do so good to get his piece of the pie,''
Maddux said. ``That's a great motivating tool. Once you get your
piece, you get to look for other reasons to stay motivated. He'll
find some. Pride is a big, big motivator.''
</P>
<P>
   Millwood will make a modest $420,000 this season in the final
year before he is eligible for salary arbitration. Then, he will
command millions.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it will change him much.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not reading every paper he can get his hands on or
staying up late to see SportsCenter 10 times,'' Maddux said. ``He
takes things in stride.''
</P>
<P>
   Not content just to repeat what he did last year, Millwood spent
the offseason trying to improve his change-up, a pitch he has not
used to get outs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still learning, still trying to make myself better,''
Millwood said. ``I'm not saying I'm going to lead the league in
batting-average-against again, but I think I have a pretty good
chance at having another good year.''
</P>
<P>
   About the only place Millwood has lagged behind his fellow
starters is on the golf course. He's not as attached to golf as his
fellow starters, and apparently it shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terrible,'' Maddux said. ``Quit snap-hooking. Ever try a fade
once in a while? You make adjustments on the mound, why can't he do
it on the course? I'm tired of trying to find his balls.''

 (FOR RELEASE MON., MARCH 21, 2000) 
 (EXCERPTED FROM PREVENTION) 
 (Includes electronic art.) 
 By DR. MARK S. LACHS with PAMELA BOYER 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Often our parenting responsibilities extend beyond our children
to include our elderly parents. The following reader wondered what
could be done to help an elderly parent's recovery following
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: My dad had elective hernia repair and became quite
confused following the surgery. This lasted for several days and
was quite alarming. Why did he react this way, and could we have
prevented it?
</P>
<P>
   ANSWER: The story you tell is both common and upsetting. The
older parent is admitted to the hospital for a seemingly minor
medical procedure that goes off without a hitch. Then, a day or two
later, he becomes confused and agitated. He may have hallucinations
or be unable to have a normal conversation from start to finish.
And often, just when it seems that things are starting to improve a
bit, the process begins again.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned family members will justifiably ask the doctor
``What's happening?'' and may not get a satisfactory answer.
Perhaps a CT or MRI of the head is performed, which reveals no
stroke or other abnormality. This is, of course, reassuring, but it
doesn't resolve the basic question: What's going on?
</P>
<P>
   Your dad was likely suffering from what geriatricians call acute
confusional state (ACS) or delirium. You might be surprised to
learn that when older adults are admitted to the hospital for any
reason and are carefully followed and assessed for delirium, as
many as half may show some manifestations of it.
</P>
<P>
   We don't know exactly what causes delirium, but we have some
ideas. Do you remember learning that we never use the majority of
our brain cells? Gerontologists call this extra capacity
physiologic reserve _ extra fuel, which in this case is brainpower.
We don't need it unless we are ``taxed'' or stressed in some
unusual way and forced to reach into our bank of extra brainpower
to keep functioning.
</P>
<P>
   Acute illness or surgery is such a stress. In addition to
surgery, there may be other hospital-related stresses on the older
person, such as postoperative fever, blood imbalances in
electrolytes and minerals, steep disruption and medications given
in the hospital _ such as those intended to aid with anesthesia.
</P>
<P>
   Younger people may tolerate these incursions just fine. But the
normal aging process is associated with a loss of physiologic
reserve, meaning that there's less extra brainpower to tap during
stressful situations such as surgery or acute medical illness. The
result is delirium. The good news is that there are ways to
minimize its duration and impact.
 &UR; PUTTING AN END TO THE CONFUSION &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The first step in diagnosing and treating delirium should be
taken by the doctor. He needs to identify and treat all the medical
factors that could influence a person's mental state. These include
any medications being taken (patients with delirium should have
their medicines carefully reviewed), common infections in older
people such as those types seen in the lungs or urine, and all
blood abnormalities such as remarkably high or low blood sugar. And
aggressively treating other discomforts such as pain and fever can
also help to reduce the stress.
</P>
<P>
   Once all medical problems are either ruled out or treated,
there's an important role for the family: assisting the nursing
staff. Using clearly visible clocks and calendars to orient the
person as to the date and time can help restore the sleep/wake
cycle. Often, hospitalized patients are awakened throughout the
night for other procedures or because a roommate is ill and needs
attention. These alterations in the biological clock can contribute
to disorientation.
</P>
<P>
   Many geriatric inpatient units also encourage family members to
bring familiar possessions from home, such as a photograph or
favorite pair of pajamas. Familiar items and surroundings may help
to orient the older person. You should be aware that low-grade
delirium can persist for many weeks after hospital discharge,
though the familiarity of home tends to have a beneficial
influence.
</P>
<P>
   Persistent confusion at home, however, requires further
evaluation by a physician skilled in geriatric medicine to make
sure that something else isn't at the root of the problem.
 &UR; OPTIONAL SIDEBAR: DELIRIUM VERSUS DEMENTIA &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Delirium has several features that can help the doctor
differentiate it from dementia or other neurological illnesses.
First, it usually has an abrupt onset, such as when the older
person developed a fever or got a medication he could not tolerate.
This is in contrast to Alzheimer's disease, which typically runs a
slow course.
</P>
<P>
   Be careful, however: Patients with Alzheimer's are at higher
risk for delirium when they are hospitalized. (It's possible to
have both.) Once it starts, delirium tends to manifest itself in
certain ways. Inattention _ the inability to focus on a particular
task at hand _ may be prominent. Thus, patients may be unable to
focus on a logical thread of conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Another feature of delirium is a waxing and waning course. Just
when it seems that they've snapped out of it, they revert to
confused behavior. As a general rule, patients with delirium don't
have what neurologists call focal neurological findings (e.g.,
weakness on one side of the body, one pupil that's dilated more
than the other), which are more common with conditions such as
stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Quick tip: A family photo placed within easy sight may help to
orient and relax the older person.  &QL;

 (EXCERPTED FROM PREVENTION)

 By MICHELE STANTEN 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Achy shoulders can make everything more difficult, from grocery
shopping to putting on a coat. Two of the most common causes are
poor posture and weak muscles. Sitting or walking with your head
forward and shoulders rounded can put stress on muscles and tendons
whenever you lift your arms, says Jeffrey Young, MD, a psychiatrist
at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York City. Practice
pinching your shoulder blades together when you're sitting and
standing.
</P>
<P>
   It's also important to strengthen the often-overlooked muscles
in the back of your shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``You tend to focus on your chest and biceps because you can see
them, but then the muscles in the back can become weak,'' Young
says.
 &UR; BEST EXERCISES TO DO &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Do eight to 10 repetitions of each exercise, two or three days a
week, unless otherwise noted.
</P>
<P>
   Modified bent-over row: Bend at your hips, and place your right
hand on a chair or bench. Keep your back flat. Holding a dumbbell
in your left hand, let your left arm hang straight. Slowly lift the
weight by squeezing your shoulder blades together. Hold, then
slowly lower. Repeat on the right side.
</P>
<P>
   Pushup plus: Do a pushup, either on your knees or toes. At the
top of the move, when your arms are extended, lift yourself up a
bit more by rounding your upper back. Hold, then slowly lower. If
you have trouble doing the pushup, you can do the ``plus'' portion
by itself while lying flat on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Reverse fly: Holding a dumbbell in each hand, lie face-down on
the floor with a pillow under your chest. Start with your arms out
to the sides. Squeeze your shoulder blades and slowly lift your
arms a few inches off the floor. Hold, then slowly lower.
</P>
<P>
   Shoulder stretch: Standing against a wall or lying on your back,
bring your right arm across your chest. With your left hand, grab
your right elbow and slowly pull your right arm until you feel a
gentle stretch in your shoulder. Hold for about 20 seconds. Do it
three or four times, then repeat using the opposite arm.
</P>
<P>
   Shrug: Stand with your feet about shoulder-width apart, holding
dumbbells at your sides. Without moving your arms, lift your
shoulders toward your ears. Hold, then slowly lower.
</P>
<P>
   Prayer stretch: Kneeling in front of a chair, place your elbows
on the seat with your palms together. Slowly sit back toward your
heels, dropping your chest below the seat and allowing your head to
bow forward until you feel a gentle stretch under your shoulder
blades. Hold for about 20 seconds. Do it three or four times.
 &UR; EXERCISE WITH CAUTION &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The lateral raise is a great shoulder strengthener, but doing it
incorrectly can do more harm than good. Do the exercise with your
arms bent at 90-degree angles to take stress off your shoulders. To
avoid pinching the tendons, never lift your arms above your
shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Another exercise that requires extra care with technique is the
bench press. Don't let your elbows drop below the bench when
lowering the weight. If it still bothers your shoulders despite
this precaution, try it with the dumbbells parallel to each other,
and be sure that your elbows are pointing toward your feet.
 &UR; WORST EXERCISES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Avoid at all costs: Overhead press, overhead triceps extension,
upright row, behind-the-neck lat pulldown and dip. &QL;

 BEST VITAMIN C SKIN CARE  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the correct amounts and in the right formulation, vitamin C
(ascorbic acid) can stimulate collagen and elastin production,
firming skin and eliminating fine lines and wrinkles. The
antioxidant powerhouse also lightens skin, reducing blemishes and
brown spots and protects against future sun damage. Unfortunately,
vitamin C is often no longer active in skin care products by the
time you get them home _ or may not have been present in an
effective formula to begin with. But new research has found the
formula for stable, effective vitamin C _ and cosmetics companies
are taking note.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent Duke University Medical Center study, researchers at
the Durham, N.C., school found that vitamin C is best absorbed into
the skin when delivered in a 20 percent concentration of L-ascorbic
acid at a low pH. Based on this research, at least one company has
already revised its vitamin C formula. SkinCeuticals' new Primacy
Serum 20. For availability, call (800) 811-1660. While other
companies are bound to do likewise, check products carefully for
L-ascorbic acid concentration and pH levels.
</P>
<P>
   Do not assume that a higher concentration of L-ascorbic acid is
better. The Duke study found that 25 percent and 30 percent
solutions were significantly less effective.
 &UR; SKIP BOTOX BARGAINS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cut-rate anti-wrinkle therapy can mean complications. Bargain
prices for Botox _ the injectable substance used to smooth out
wrinkles by relaxing, or paralyzing, specific facial muscles _ are
heavily advertised these days. But when you see a $99 special on
this treatment (typically costing $400 to $500), odds are that
you're not getting a bargain, explains Ronald Moy, MD, associate
clinical professor at the University of California in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Botox, which is distributed to medical professionals in powder
form, is normally diluted with saline solution, yielding enough to
treat two or three patients. But some doctors have been adding more
saline and stretching the same amount to treat up to 10 patients.
Although the immediate results may look fine, you'll need a new
injection every 3 weeks _ instead of the standard 3 to 6 months _
to maintain the improvement.
</P>
<P>
   This practice may also increase the chance of complications.
</P>
<P>
   ``By putting a large watery volume into a very small muscle,
there could be a greater risk of spreading the solution and
paralyzing nearby muscles that you don't want affected, which could
cause a droopy eyelid or brow,'' Moy says. ``A smaller volume of
Botox at a higher concentration is more precise.''
</P>
<P>
   Avoid being misled. Ask your doctor how much Botox he is
injecting per area. Most doctors charge by the Botox unit. For best
results, use these guidelines: 15 units for the forehead, 10 to 20
units for frown lines, 6 to 10 units for crow's-feet and 1 to 2
units for mouth wrinkles.
</P>
<P>
   At full strength, Botox is safe, with only a 1 percent chance of
serious side effects.
 &UR; CLICK HERE TO END WORLD HUNGER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You can help fight world hunger every time you're online. At
www.thehungersite.com, one click of the mouse donates a serving of
food to starving nations _ at no cost to you. Corporate sponsors
provide the food in exchange for free advertising. Since its
start-up last June, the site has sent the United Nation's World
Food Program enough money to purchase more than 34 million servings
of dietary staples. Bookmark The Hunger Site, and make your clicks
count.
 &UR; EXERCISE IS AS GOOD AS DRUGS FOR DEPRESSION &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   People who exercise are less likely to be depressed. Now a new
study shows that walking or jogging for 30 minutes, three times a
week, can actually treat major depression just as well as
medication.
</P>
<P>
   When 156 depressed people, average age 57, were treated with
antidepressants, exercise, or a combination of both, they all had
similar results. After 16 weeks of treatment, 60 percent to 70
percent of each group were no longer clinically depressed. One
difference: The people taking medication got quicker results.
</P>
<P>
   But about one-third of people with depression don't respond to
drugs, says study author James Blumenthal, PhD, a psychologist at
Duke University Medical Center in Durham, N.C. For these people _
and others who want to avoid the side effects of medication or who
want a more natural approach _ exercise is a viable option. As
always, check with your doctor before you stop taking any
medication and before beginning a vigorous exercise program. &QL;

 (EXCERPTED FROM PREVENTION) 
 (Includes electronic art.) 
 By DR. MARY JANE MINKIN with TOBY HANLON 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Several friends are warning me that I'll probably get depressed
when I reach menopause, like they did. I know about the hot
flashes, but is depression part of this mid-life surprise package
too?
</P>
<P>
   One of the old wives' tales surrounding menopause is that it
inevitably leads to depression. Let me reassure you, however, that
the majority of women do not become depressed at menopause. In
fact, many women feel happier and more fulfilled at this time of
their life than at any other.
</P>
<P>
   But enough women complain about feeling ``not themselves'' or
depressed during this time that some researchers have begun to look
at whether or not there's a connection between the hormone estrogen
and mood changes at menopause.
 &UR; WHAT'S THE ESTROGEN CONNECTION? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fluctuating estrogen levels may play a role in the mood changes
that some women report at menopause. They may even make certain
women more susceptible to depression at this time.
</P>
<P>
   Although this relationship isn't completely understood, there is
evidence to suggest that estrogen may have a direct or indirect
effect on increasing certain chemicals or neurotransmitters in the
brain that are known to regulate mood and cognitive function.
</P>
<P>
   Some studies have shown that giving estrogen to women during
perimenopause _ the transition to menopause during which menstrual
periods become irregular and hot flashes may start _ has helped
reduce their symptoms of depression. Other studies have suggested
that estrogen improves mood in postmenopausal women who feel
depressed.
</P>
<P>
   Women are more likely than men to become depressed during their
lifetime, leading some researchers to suggest that women are more
vulnerable because of their hormones. Premenstrual syndrome and
postpartum depression are examples of how hormonal changes can
affect mood. Much more research needs to be done to confirm a
hormonal basis for depression in women.
 &UR; GET THE RIGHT DIAGNOSIS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When a menopausal patient comes to me complaining of depression,
it would be equally tragic for me to chalk it up to rapidly
changing hormone levels and prescribe estrogen as it would be to
treat it with an antidepressant. Treatment must be tailored to the
individual by trying to attribute the depression to the most likely
cause. The following are some of the common causes.
</P>
<P>
   Untreated hot flashes and night sweats can lead to
sleeplessness, which results in irritability, depression and loss
of an overall sense of well-being.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trying estrogen replacement for a month or two will often
solve the problem of sleep deprivation and restore a sense of
well-being in postmenopausal women,'' says Neill Epperson, MD,
assistant professor of psychiatry at Yale University School of
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Exercise has well-known, positive effects on mood and can even
help reduce hot flashes and improve sleep.
</P>
<P>
   An underactive thyroid, or hypothyroidism, can cause feelings of
depression. A simple blood test for thyroid-stimulating hormone can
tell me if this is the problem. If it is, it can be easily
corrected by putting the patient on thyroid medication.
</P>
<P>
   Certain medications for hypertension can make a person feel
depressed. If you've recently started taking a beta blocker, speak
with your doctor about switching to a different medication or
altering the dose. Stressful life events, whether coping with aging
parents, kids going off to school, career changes, divorce or
financial problems, often hit at mid-life. Any one of these factors
can be stressful, and more than one would put a crimp in even the
happiest outlook.
</P>
<P>
   ``People often have very good reasons to feel depressed, and
therapy and/or anti-depressive medication can help them cope,''
Epperson says.
</P>
<P>
   Clinically significant depression goes beyond the normal
feelings of sadness to include persistent low mood and energy
level, decreased appetite, changes in sleep patterns, and anxiety.
It's important for a physician to recognize the signs, because
clinical depression is best treated with a combination of
psychotherapy and medication _ not with estrogen.
</P>
<P>
   Women with a history of depression seem to be particularly
susceptible to another depression at menopause.
</P>
<P>
   Quick Tip: Strength training is equally as effective as aerobic
exercise in relieving depression. &QL; 
 &UR; Dr. Minkin is a board-certified obstetrician/gynecologist in New
Haven, Conn., clinical professor at Yale University School of
Medicine, and coauthor of ``What Every Woman Needs to Know about
Menopause'' (Yale University Press, 1996).

<TEXT>
<P>
   Some natural remedies can ease the pain of arthritis. Others
just ease the money out of your wallet. Here's what you need to
know to be a wise _ and safe _ consumer.
</P>
<P>
   Shark cartilage. Glucosamine. Chondroitin. You've undoubtedly
heard of them. They're all touted to help _ if not ``cure'' _
arthritis. But do they work? Some do, some don't.
</P>
<P>
   Americans spend an estimated $10 billion a year on unproven _
and ineffective _ arthritis remedies. This guide will help you
choose the right natural remedy to ease your pain _ and at the
right price too. Here is an overview of supplements, what they
claim to do, any proof related thereto, suggested use and cost.
 &UR; GLUCOSAMINE SULFATE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Claim: Glucosamine, a natural substance, furnishes the building
blocks that our bodies use to make and repair cartilage.
</P>
<P>
   Proof: Some recent well-done research shows that glucosamine
soothes knee pain as well as ibuprofen does, but without the side
effects.
</P>
<P>
   Suggested Dose: 1,500 milligrams (mg) a day in two or three
doses.
</P>
<P>
   Some Prices We Found: GNC: Thirty 600-mg capsules, $7.99.
Nature's Bounty: Thirty 500-mg capsules, $10.89
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CHONDROITIN SULFATE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Claim: Experts think that chondroitin, which exists naturally in
cartilage, may make tissue more flexible and protect it from
harmful chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   Proof: Some studies show that chondroitin stops joint
degeneration, improves joint function and eases pain. But evidence
is stronger for glucosamine.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Claim: The combined effects of these supplements may help ease
osteoarthritis (OA) symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Proof: A recent study showed that after eight weeks of taking
both supplements (Cosamin), men with OA reported less knee pain.
</P>
<P>
   Suggested Dose: 500 mg of glucosamine and 400 mg of chondroitin
in three doses. It may take up to eight weeks to see improvement.

</P>
<P>
   Some Prices We Found: GNC: Thirty 200-mg tablets, $39.99. Nature
Made: Twenty 200-mg tablets, $21.99.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FISH OIL &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Claim: The omega-3 fatty acids in fish oil _ eicosapentaenoic
acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) _ may ease rheumatoid
arthritis (RA) symptoms by providing anti-inflammatory building
blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Proof: Many studies have shown that fish oil helps the
inflammation and accompanying pain of RA. It may reduce the need
for NSAIDs such as ibuprofen.
</P>
<P>
   Suggested Dose: 3 grams (g) or 3,000 mg a day total of EPA/DHA.
Good food sources are cold-water fish such as sardines, salmon,
tuna and mackerel. Try to eat them two or three times a week.
</P>
<P>
   Some Prices We Found: Nature's Way: Max EPA, 100 capsules (120
mg DHA and 180 mg EPA each), $10.39. Twinlab: Twin EPA Extra
Strength, 60 capsules (240 mg DHA and 600 mg EPA each), $27.95.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GLA (GAMMA LINOLENIC ACID) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Claim: The body converts these omega-6 fatty acids into
anti-inflammatory compounds.
</P>
<P>
   Proof: Studies show that GLA can reduce the tenderness, morning
stiffness and inflammation of RA. It may reduce the need for NSAIDs
such as ibuprofen.
</P>
<P>
   Suggested Dose: 1,800 mg a day. GLA is available in evening
primrose oil (may counteract the effects of anticonvulsant drugs),
borage oil and black currant seed oil.
</P>
<P>
   Some Prices We Found: Twinlab: Ultra GLA 300, Thirty 300-mg
softgels, $11.89.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GREEN TEA &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Claim: Polyphenols in green tea have been shown to reduce
inflammation, a symptom of RA.
</P>
<P>
   Proof: Mice given green tea extract had much lower rates of
arthritis than mice not given the extract. Human studies are
needed, but green tea is safe, so it may be worth a try.
</P>
<P>
   Suggested Dose: 3 to 4 cups a day (equivalent of 600 to 800 mg
of polyphenols). It's also available in decaffeinated and flavored
forms and capsules. If you buy decaffeinated tea, it must be
decaffeinated using water and carbon dioxide, a process called
effervescence, in order to retain the polyphenols. If the label
doesn't tell you, contact the manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Some Prices We Found: GNC: Star GLA Omega-3 Gamma-Linolenic
Acid, Sixty 200-mg softgel capsules, $29.99. Alvita: Green Tea bulk

<P>
   Proof: Some studies show that taking type II collagen orally can
reduce the pain and inflammation of RA.
</P>
<P>
   Suggested Dose: 500 micrograms (mcg) or less. NSAIDs may block
the absorption of type II collagen; talk to your doctor before
using.
</P>
<P>
   Some Prices We Found: Twinlab: Maxilife chicken collagen, 60
pills, $25.95.
 &UR; OPTIONAL SIDEBAR: SAVE YOUR MONEY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The pain and chronic nature of arthritis force some people to
try almost anything for relief, even unproven _ or downright
harmful _ remedies. When in doubt, ask your doctor for guidance. In
the meantime, here are a few products that have not been proven to
relieve arthritis _ though some have benefits for other conditions:
</P>
<P>
   _ Copper bracelets: There's no scientific evidence to back up
copper's antiarthritis claims.
</P>
<P>
   _ Shark cartilage: Although advertised to help ease
osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis symptoms, there is no
scientifically accepted evidence that shark cartilage works for
arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   _ Alfalfa: Used for years as a folk remedy for arthritis, no
studies show that it's effective.
</P>
<P>
   _ DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide): A byproduct of wood processing,
DMSO is said to ease pain and improve flexibility in people with
arthritis. But many versions on the market aren't suitable for
humans. They're chemically impure and potentially harmful.
</P>
<P>
   _ Maybe MSM? There is some anecdotal evidence that MSM (methyl
sulfonyl methane) may help alleviate arthritis pain. So far, no
published studies have shown that it's effective for treating
arthritis. But if you haven't had success with any of the proven
arthritis remedies, it's probably safe to try MSM to see if it
helps you.
 &UR; OPTIONAL SIDEBAR: SHOP SMART &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With so many arthritis supplements on the market, it's hard to
know what to buy and what to avoid. Our 10-point checklist will
help.
</P>
<P>
   1. Make sure that the product label lists the amount of the
active ingredient it contains.
</P>
<P>
   2. Choose products from large companies _ they value their
reputations.
</P>
<P>
   3. Buy supplements at stores you trust.
</P>
<P>
   4. Avoid products using words such as ``scientific
breakthrough'' or ``miracle cure.''
</P>
<P>
   5. Beware of products that claim to cure all types of arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   6. Remember: If a product sounds too good to be true, it
probably is.
</P>
<P>
   7. Always talk to your doctor before taking any supplement for
arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   8. Continue taking your current medication until you've gotten
your doctor's OK to try something new.
</P>
<P>
   9. Bear in mind that ``natural'' doesn't necessarily mean safe.
</P>
<P>
   10. If you already take an arthritis supplement, mention it to
your doctor.
 &UR; OPTIONAL SIDEBAR: ANTIOXIDANTS FOR ARTHRITIS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Need another reason to get your five-a-day? Some studies have
shown that the antioxidants found in fruits and vegetables may
protect joints _ especially the knee _ from the ravages of
osteoarthritis (OA). Here are a few of the studies' findings:
</P>
<P>
   _ People with high intakes of vitamin C and beta-carotene had a
reduced risk of knee pain and disease progression.
</P>
<P>
   _ Certain antioxidants (including lutein and lycopene, among
others) were associated with lower risk of knee OA.
</P>
<P>
   _ Vitamin E eased arthritis pain better than a placebo or
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
</P>
<P>
   To be sure that you're getting enough beta-carotene, lutein,
lycopene and vitamin C, eat lots of carrots, sweet potatoes,
broccoli, spinach, tomato sauce and tomato juice, oranges,
kiwifruit and strawberries. (Prevention now recommends nine veggies
a day for disease protection.)
</P>
<P>
   To get the amount of vitamin E that most experts advise, you'll
need a vitamin E supplement containing 400 international units.
Since OA progression was three times higher in people with low
levels of vitamin D, it's best to take a multivitamin/mineral
supplement with 100 percent of the daily value for D.

 (FOR RELEASE MON., MARCH 13, 2000) 
 (EXCERPTED FROM PREVENTION) 
 (Includes electronic art.) 
 By SARAH ROBERTSON 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week we talked about that elusive force of determination,
willpower, which, believe it or not, is not the answer to your
losing weight!
</P>
<P>
   Gary McClain, a psychologist and co-author of ``The Complete
Idiot's Guide to Breaking Bad Habits'' (Macmillan, 1998), says
``weight loss is not about gritting your teeth and saying 'no.'''
We discussed four of the most common stumbling blocks to weight
loss _ and their easy, proven solutions. Consider the final three
no-willpower tools when you find yourself having a hard time saying
no to your favorite indulgences.
 &UR; LOW-FAT COOKIES ARE MY DOWNFALL &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; Not Needed: Willpower &QL; 
 &UR; Needed: Flavor &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you can satisfy a craving with a low-fat product _ meaning
that you can control your portions _ that helps you to cut calories
effortlessly. But be careful: If a low-fat product isn't as
satisfying as the regular version, you may eat more to compensate _
as if you'll find what you really wanted at the bottom of the box.
</P>
<P>
   Flavor plays a big part in why some low-fat foods satisfy you
while others don't. In a taste test at the University of Missouri
in Columbia, participants liked the low-fat and regular chocolate
ice creams equally, but they didn't like the low-fat vanilla as
much as the regular vanilla. Many compounds combine to ``carry''
chocolate flavor, so it's easier to mask any alterations that occur
when the fat is reduced, explains Ingolf Gruen, assistant professor
of food chemistry and expert on the study.
</P>
<P>
   Lovers of dark chocolate, especially, will find this a
satisfying switch: ``We found that the low-fat chocolate ice creams
had more of the bitter or semisweet aspects of the chocolate
flavor,'' Gruen says.
</P>
<P>
   Vanilla has one chemical compound responsible for flavor,
whereas chocolate has many, so vanilla doesn't mask fat reduction
as well. Bottom line: You're less likely to be satisfied by a
low-fat version. If vanilla ice cream or another vanilla-flavored
food is your must-have indulgence, for the sake of your
satisfaction _ and, ultimately, your weight _ you may want to treat
yourself to the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor is personal preference. Some people prefer the
taste of low-fat foods that make up for a less-than-creamy texture
with an extra burst of flavor, Gruen says. So a normal-size portion
of those foods will satisfy them.
 &UR; COUNTING CALORIES IS NO FUN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; Not Needed: Willpower &QL; 
 &UR; Needed: Movement &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Being active boosts your calorie bum so you don't have to obsess
about every bite you take. Exercise can also keep your appetite in
check _ naturally. You can literally walk away from cravings.
</P>
<P>
   To make exercise a natural part of your day, use other
commitments or tasks as a way of getting and staying active.
Setting up a tennis date with your best friend _ instead of a lunch
date _ works as well for keeping the two of you in touch, but now
exercise is part of the habit too.
</P>
<P>
   Busy with kids? Don't just babysit _ play with them. Set out on
your next trail walk in search of beautiful views and fresh air.
Try to combine multiple benefits in one activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coaching your daughter's soccer-team allows you to spend time
with your child, serve your community, socialize, have fun _ and
exercise too,'' explains James Prochaska, a psychologist at the
University of Rhode Island in Kingston.
</P>
<P>
   Appreciate how your body moves _ how it feels to whirl your legs
on a bicycle, for example. Rhythmic activities such as walking and
dancing can also ease you into a stress-relieving meditation or the
pleasure of ``flowing'' energy. When you're doing activities that
you love, exercise becomes automatic.
 &UR; ONCE I SLIP, I JUST GIVE UP TOTALLY &QL; 
 &UR; Not Needed: Willpower &QL; 
 &UR; Needed: Rebounding &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When you've eaten the Chex mix, the nachos and the brownies at a
party, the tendency is to throw in the towel. But temptations and
setbacks are a normal part of weight loss. It's what you do
afterward that determines how quickly you get back on track.
</P>
<P>
   First, think back to what stimulated you to overeat. Then ask
yourself what that pepperoni pizza represented. If it was comfort
food because you were feeling overwhelmed at work, talk about it
with someone instead. And if you back up another step before the
episode occurred _ before whatever triggered your overindulgence _
you'll discover the situation that caused the trigger itself to
emerge.
</P>
<P>
   For example: You ate the pizza because you were frustrated and
angry. You were frustrated and angry because you had to stay late
at the office and miss your workout. You had to stay late because
your boss overwhelmed you with requests. But you let yourself get
overwhelmed because you didn't want to say no, even though you were
already doing as much work as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might see that you're actually setting yourself up for
those slips,'' McClain says.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've thought it through, you can discuss your
responsibilities and career goals with your boss _ not with the
pizza. Choose a relationship with people over a relationship with
food, and you won't be dialing for takeout after hours. You'll be
heading home, relishing a job well done that day.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to manage slip-ups: Become a matter-of-degree (MAT)
thinker. In a different study led by Smith, those who learned MAT
thinking reported significantly fewer problems with overeating than
did rigid, all-or-nothing thinkers.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works: If a MAT thinker eats a small plateful of
nachos at a party, she'll quantify it by actually attaching a
number to it, such as 200 calories.
</P>
<P>
   ''And that is exactly all she really had,'' Smith says.
</P>
<P>
   She then accommodates it by cutting back on her drinks for the
evening or walking an extra 20 minutes over each of the next two
days. If you slip up by skipping your regular evening walking
routine for a week employ some of these strategies: Substitute an
apple and string cheese for a less-than-healthy snack or fit in a
few extra lunchtime strolls or early-morning swims. And examine why
you missed your after-work exercise in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe your schedule has changed and now your son needs a ride to
karate lessons in the evenings. In that case, a midday walk or
before-work swim would fit better into your life and keep you
committed to your exercise routine. By using these seven
no-willpower tools, you can build yourself a pleasurable, powerful
life _ and it won't take an ounce of willpower to get there. &QL;

COMMENTARY: FLYING ELEPHANTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A broker friend of mine who specializes in trading Internet
stocks called me the other day and left a two-word message on my
answering machine: ``Panic buying.''
</P>
<P>
   He was trying to describe the frenzy that was going on around
him on the trading floor, and the only two words he could come up
with were ``panic buying'' _ moms and pops calling and asking to
buy any Internet stock. Now my friend is a believer in the Internet
space _ ``I've taken the Kool-Aid,'' he regularly warns me. And he
knows that the stocks he's trading are volatile: ``I sell rocket
fuel,'' he avers. ``You want regular stocks, I'm not your guy.''
</P>
<P>
   But even my friend finds the current Internet stock frenzy
troubling, because never have more people been investing in more
stocks of companies about which they don't have a clue _ not a
clue. People who two months ago thought B-2-B stood for ``Bed and
Breakfast'' now can't get enough of B-2-B (business-to-business)
Internet stocks. Clearly the Internet is for real. Clearly it will
produce some new companies of great value. But clearly many others
won't make it. Which means there is something inherently dangerous
about so many people taking their money out of traditional stocks
they know and panic-buying stocks they don't have a clue about.
</P>
<P>
   The best description I've seen of today's rocket-fuel Nasdaq
comes from Rick Barry, whose respected Black Bear Fund has
regularly made money both buying and holding tech stocks and
shorting them. These days, short-selling tech stocks is one of the
most dangerous things you can do, but it tells you a lot about the
zaniness of the market.
</P>
<P>
   You make money short-selling by carefully studying companies,
finding out which ones are flawed, phony or overpriced, and then
shorting their stocks, which means betting that they will go down,
not up. But what happens when you are in a market when everything
seems to go up _ even the junk?
</P>
<P>
   ``My business depends on people calling garbage garbage and good
things good,'' said Barry. ``But we now have a market in which
people are calling garbage good. No consideration is being given to
value. Instead of trading pieces of businesses, we are now trading
pieces of paper.''
</P>
<P>
   In a wickedly funny letter to his shareholders, Barry explained
the bizarre world he is now investing in, where elephants seem to
fly. Certain tech stocks his firm has shorted _ because they have
no fundamentals or earnings prospects and are simply hyped by
analysts and bankers _ go up in price as they rack up losses,
thanks to panic buying. Meanwhile, the non-tech value stocks he
bought, in order to hold, go down in price the more they rack up
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's review,'' said Barry. ``Our shorts go up when there is
bad news, and our non-technology longs go down when there is good
news. Are you still with us?''
</P>
<P>
   Barry compared this upside-down world to Groucho Marx's old TV
quiz show ``You Bet Your Life.'' Before the show started
contestants were kept in a booth offstage, while a ``secret word''
was revealed to the audience. When the contestants then came on
stage, if one of them uttered the secret word a duck would come
down from the ceiling and the contestant was awarded $100.
</P>
<P>
   Barry said when he watches shows like CNBC's ``Squawk Box,'' he
is struck by the parallel. Tech execs are interviewed about their
companies. When one of them utters the secret words _ ``genomics''
or ``business-to-business e-commerce'' or ``Linux-based software''
_ their stock prices soar within minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such positive reinforcement causes contestants [on CBNC) to
say the secret words early and often,'' said Barry. ``And sure
enough, the duck comes down and $100,000 bills are passed out to
both the executive and the audience in the form of rising stock
prices. Part of the fun is to watch the short-seller's reaction as
he realizes that it is his money that contestants and viewers are
winning. Occasionally, short-sellers are allowed on the air to
offer their view, but they are often treated the same as carnival
clowns at a dunk tank.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone is going to get hurt here. In the long run, notes Barry,
those who make money in markets are those who pay attention to the
price paid for each idea _ buying ideas that are undervalued and
selling ideas that are overvalued. Panic buyers beware: Elephants
don't fly.

 &HT;    Emotional welcome awaits Elliott
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Sean Elliott asked a friend the other day if his
comeback tonight will be a circus. The answer is yes.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott's parents, Robert and Odiemae, his brothers, Bobby and
Noel, other relatives, friends, his doctors and fans will be in the
Alamodome tonight when the Spurs forward makes a historic comeback
eight months after having a failing kidney replaced with one
donated by Noel.
</P>
<P>
   That the Atlanta Hawks also will be in attendance is merely
prerequisite for the event: It requires a lamb.
</P>
<P>
   With upwards of 25,000 cheering, Elliott will enter tonight's
game mid-to-late first quarter or the start of the second quarter.
Throat lumps will swell and tears will run like the rain-swollen
San Antonio River. Elliott is a well-liked athlete, and videotape
of him smiling wanly from a wheelchair is as fresh inthe memory as
his winning 3-pointer in a Western Conference finals playoff game
with Portland in June.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks' Jim Jackson was a Portland player then. ``Playing
against him in that series,'' Jackson said, ``you never knew there
was anything wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   This season, the Spurs miss him. If the season ended today they
would be no better than the No. 4 seed in the West as they set out
to defend their NBA title.
</P>
<P>
   ``An incredible up and a down,'' David Robinson said about the
dizzying spin last summer from championship celebration to harsh
medical reality. ``After we won, we were at the top of the world.
The next week, I'm in the hospital, standing by his bed, praying
with him. That's a tough situation. It puts things back in
perspective. Your life is pretty important compared to some of the
other things. There's no question (we miss him).''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott, 32, feels no pain from the surgery. The only reminder
is that he must take medication twice daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm under 10 pills a day,'' he said, smiling. ``At first, it
was 30 a day.''
</P>
<P>
   He was asked recently why he would test medical boundaries by
returning for an 11th season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cheryl Miller (of Turner Sports) asked me that,'' Elliott
said. ``And I said, `What would your brother (Indiana's Reggie
Miller) do?' She didn't say another word. She just looked at me and
goes, `OK.'''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott had kidney problems as a younger adult. They worsened
last winter when much of his renal function was lost. Without a
transplant, doctors said, he would need constant dialysis
treatment. Noel Elliott agreed to be his donor, and they went to
surgery in August. Elliott battled pneumonia, and his strength was
slow to return. But he finally was able to start practicing in
January.
</P>
<P>
   The reason he can play is that the new kidney was inserted
behind his pelvic bone so that it has a much stronger natural
shield than his abdomen would afford. He has signed a waiver of
responsibility for the Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'm the world's most famous organ donor now,'' Noel
Elliott, a stock clerk, said, grinning.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it wasn't for Noel,'' Sean Elliott said, ``I wouldn't be
doing this. I might still be on dialysis, waiting for a donor.''
</P>
<P>
   As for all the fuss, don't worry about Elliott. He knows what
he's doing. ``My heart rate is going to get up, and my kidney is
going to regulate the composition of my blood and the waste in my
blood. When you run, it probably puts stress on a lot of your major
organs. But at the same time, exercise is good for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking for perspective, Elliott said, ``It's not a heart
transplant.''

<P>
   Two of the nation's four largest newspaper companies, the
Tribune Co. and Times Mirror Co., which both built around
newspapers that helped define the brawling, partisan days of 19th
century journalism, Monday announced plans to combine, giving the
merged company a broader base from which to compete in the
fast-changing media world of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Their idea is to create a network of regional media hubs where
advertisers are matched with audiences through newspapers,
television broadcasts and Internet sites. The new company would
seek to replicate in cities like New York and Los Angeles the
Tribune's success in offering many kinds of media to the Chicago
market.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which will retain the Tribune Co. name, will own 11
daily newspapers, 22 television stations and four radio stations.
The company's newspapers would have a combined circulation of 3.6
million copies, ranking third among newspaper companies after
Gannett and Knight Ridder. Tribune's television stations reach 38.4
million households.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed merger of the two companies, whose stocks had been
trading near their 52-week low, was greeted with deep skepticism by
investors; Tribune Co.'s stock, which had closed Friday at $37.875,
fell swiftly to $27.75 as trading opened, and closed at $30.75,
down 26.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The deal announced Monday ends 119 years of ownership of the Los
Angeles Times by the Otis and Chandler families. In effect, the
Tribune's corporate heirs of Robert McCormick and James Patterson,
whose pugnacious conservatism often enraged their barrel-chested
union town of Chicago, are buying out and the corporate heirs of
Gen. Harrison Gray Otis and Harry Chandler, who used The Los
Angeles Times as a political hammer, helping fashion the southern
California desert into the nation's second-largest city.
</P>
<P>
   Tribune's offer of $6.45 billion in the stock and cash deal _
not including the assumption of $1.8 billion of Times Mirror debt _
also puts an abrupt end to the mercurial five-year stewardship of
the Times Mirror chairman, Mark H. Willes. A former cereal company
executive, he brought an almost religious fervor to his quest to
streamline the company, challenging the newspaper industry to
reinvent itself, increase its audience, and toss out its
shibboleths _ notably the historic separation of the news and
business divisions.
</P>
<P>
   The essential details of the deal were arranged by members of
the Chandler family, without Willes' knowledge, according to both
Willes and Thomas Unterman, the former chief financial officer of
Times Mirror who was a primary adviser to the Chandler family
trusts.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Friday's closing stock prices, the offer for Times
Mirror consists of $3.79 billion in common stock and $2.66 billion
in cash. The cash represents a tender for about 28 million shares
at $95 per share, The remaining 40.8 million shares would be
exchanged, with Tribune offering 2.5 shares for each share of Times
Mirror.

<P>
   SAN ANTONIO, Texas _ There was the kidney transplant recipient
who was kicked by a horse. Another who was gored by handlebars in a
motorcycle wreck. Several high school basketball players.
</P>
<P>
   They took their shots. Their kidneys survived.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Sean Elliott will add one more person to the list: himself.
Sometime after 7:30 p.m. today, when San Antonio faces Atlanta in
the Alamodome, the Spurs forward will become the first athlete in
professional sports to return from a kidney transplant.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll look back at this 20 years from now and it will be no
big deal,'' Elliott, 32, said after his workout Monday. ``Somebody
has to go first.''
</P>
<P>
   His cautious coach, Gregg Popovich, tried to erect ``every
roadblock I can think of.'' Teammates wished him a great life _
away from basketball. But Elliott, who underwent the transplant
last Aug. 16, listened to his own voice and to his doctors. After
all, if a transplant recipient can fall on the handlebars of a
motorcycle without suffering damage to his new kidney, well,
Elliott figures an NBA forward should do just fine. Danger? What
danger?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of faith in my doctors,'' Elliott said. ``They've
done hundreds of these. I don't think about it at all, not even one
second.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott, who returned to practice on Feb. 2, has since convinced
even the most skeptical and concerned Spurs that he is ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's worked very hard and has earned and deserves this
opportunity,'' said Popovich, who will restrict Elliott to 10 to 12
minutes a game at the beginning. ``He's ready to go. Sean's doing
something that's pretty heroic and pretty amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Said teammate and longtime friend Steve Kerr, ``We're so used to
having him around that we take it for granted. We don't even think
about it anymore. That's the way he wants it. From day one his
resolve was so strong. He was driven every day. He didn't miss a
day coming here to work out. In my mind, he's already won. But he's
not satisfied yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Far from that, Elliott wants to again be a highly competitive
player, an inspiration such as Lance Armstrong, winner of the 1999
Tour de France after beating testicular cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``By going out and playing, I can wipe away a lot of
misconceptions people have,'' Elliott said. ``I'm not coming back
just for me, but for people who had transplants like this, to give
them hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I'll be the guru, the Dalai Lama of kidney
transplants.''
</P>
<P>
   As Elliott was finishing his workout on Monday, he received a
big hug from former Spurs owner Red McCombs, who was visiting
practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a story of the medical greatness we have in this country,
which not only allows a guy to live but allows a guy to participate
in one of the most grueling games there is,'' McCombs said. ``When
you put it all together, it ends up being a story of heart, rather
than a story of kidney, because Sean has got the heart of a lion.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the kidney, the risk is small, said Dr. Francis Wright,
who performed the surgery at Methodist Specialty and Transplant
Hospital in San Antonio with a kidney from Elliott's brother, Noel,
33. Wright said approximately 1,500 kidney transplants have been
performed at his hospital in the last 15 years and none of the
former patients have since suffered serious trauma.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're moving into uncharted waters in terms of professional
basketball, but it's not that difficult a decision,'' Wright said.
``It's not something I lose sleep over. Probably if he were a
football player, I might be less encouraging for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright said the kidney is well protected, tucked behind Sean's
pelvic bone on the right side, providing more protection than would
the abdomen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The questions are about stamina, whether he has lost a step,
things like that,'' Wright said. ``He played under more stressful
conditions last year.''
</P>
<P>
   1993: the diagnosis
</P>
<P>
   Elliott first learned in 1993 that he had focal segmental
glomerular sclerosis, a disease that prevents the kidneys from
properly filtering waste from the blood. His condition deteriorated
last March.
</P>
<P>
   Despite health problems, Elliott remained the Spurs' best
defender on the perimeter, a physically taxing role. One day he
walked _ tightroped, really _ into the national spotlight,
converting an off-balance three-point basket from barely inside the
right sideline to beat Portland in game two of the Western
Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks later, the Spurs had their first NBA championship,
but Elliott's joy was soon tempered when he was told a transplant
was necessary. His mother, Odiemae, was a suitable match. Noel was
a better one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very glad for that,'' said Noel, a stock clerk for an
aerospace company in Tucson, Ariz., the family's hometown. ``She's
62. She doesn't need that kind of trauma.''
</P>
<P>
   When Sean told his brother it was time for a transplant, Noel
responded ``Where do I go? When do I have to be there?''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Noel wasn't a little scared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course there is apprehension when you have surgery,'' Noel
said. ``There's always the worst-case scenario.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But he never hesitated,'' said Noel's wife, Kathy. ``They have
such a great family.''
</P>
<P>
   Sean expects his parents, divorced years ago, to attend the game
tonight. So will Noel, Kathy and Sean's other brother. Sean and
Noel have always been close.
</P>
<P>
   ``They grew up like twins,'' Odiemae said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a lot closer now,'' Sean said. ``I have one of his
organs in me.''
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't the first time Noel, older by 15 months, rescued his
little brother. When they took Odiemae's car for a joy ride and
14-year-old Sean scraped the side against the carport, Noel allowed
his mother to believe he was the driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't fool me,'' Odiemae recalls. ``I just picked my
battles.''
</P>
<P>
   She certainly could have found one when Sean announced his
intention to play basketball again. Instead she prays for his
health.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, it's a little fearful for me,'' Odiemae said. ``But he
went in for the surgery with the idea he was going to play again.
I'm not cavalier about it, but you can get run over crossing the
street. (The kidney) is safe unless someone tries to hurt him. I
don't think he'll be on the ground letting someone step on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Odiemae, a retired critical care nurse who worked in a hospital
at which transplants are performed, said she is aware of what could
have gone wrong well before Sean attempted his comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Last year an estimated 12,000 people nationwide received kidney
transplants, but Odiemae said, ``There's never a surgery that's
routine.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why Odiemae looked so relieved when after her sons came
out of surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the outside, she was just fine before the surgery,'' Kathy
Elliott said. ``Later she let us know she had been a nervous
wreck.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the surgery was complete _ six hours for Noel and 3 1/2 for
Sean _ there were moments of levity. Serious occasions can produce
good comedy, or at least gallows humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The morning after surgery, Sean walked out of intensive care
holding his catheter bag,'' Noel said. ``With this voice real gruff
from anesthesia he says, `I brought margaritas.'''
</P>
<P>
   `Mother hen'
</P>
<P>
   Sean Elliott's comeback has been difficult, sometimes
unbearable. A few times he slipped on to the court while the Spurs
practiced and Popovich was looking in another direction, only to be
ordered off or dragged away by an assistant coach or someone from
the training staff. The team was willing to pay Sean his entire
$6.2 million salary to not play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I seem like a mother hen, but if you had a son in this
position, you would want me to be protective,'' Popovich has said.
``I care about Sean. Am I ridiculously cautious? Sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Popovich says, ``We know he's getting in better shape all
the time. The only thing we don't know is how long he can play.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how far Elliott has progressed. In late November, he was
running the Alamodome stairs, and he had forgotten his doctor's
advice to keep himself hydrated. Near the top, Elliott doubled over
with pain in his abdomen. He began to vomit. He ended up back in
the hospital hooked up to an IV for several hours.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks later, right before Christmas, Elliott returned to
the hospital with a bad case of the flu, his immune system weakened
by anti-transplant rejection drugs. He considered postponing his
comeback. But by early January, Elliott felt better, and on Jan.
20, Wright cleared him for practice. On Feb. 2, Elliott was on the
court in full-scale practice for the first time since last June.
Before returning, he signed several waivers releasing the Spurs
from liability.
</P>
<P>
   Though teammates such as Kerr and Avery Johnson had said they
would be happy if Elliott lived a healthy life without basketball,
the players welcomed him back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking at Sean in awe,'' David Robinson said. ``It's not
like he's doing it for the money. He's hanging in there, coming
back from life-threatening surgery, and he just wants to be on the
floor. Every time I see that kind of passion, it gives me energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven months earlier, Noel said that all he really wanted in
return for his kidney was a book contract and tickets for the
resumption of his brother's career. The book has yet to
materialize. As for the ticket request, Kathy Elliott recalls
people politely indulging her husband's confidence that Sean would
return.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone said, `We'll see,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And now Sean Elliott intends to show them.

WITH US DEADLINE NEAR, `BIG DIG' FINANCING PLAN LACKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Facing a federal deadline Wednesday, Massachusetts
officials have yet to agree on a financing plan to pay for a $1.4
billion cost overrun for the Central Artery project.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Paul Cellucci, who met with U.S. Transportation
Secretary Rodney Slater last week, said he will present federal
officials with a bill he proposed a month ago, which calls for
covering the shortfall mostly through state borrowing.
</P>
<P>
   However, lawmakers have all but dismissed that bill, and federal
sources say the dispute over how to finance the project could
further erode the state's credibility in Washington at a crucial
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got to have a plan that's do-able,'' said US Rep. J.
Joseph Moakley, who met with Cellucci, Slater, and US Sen. Edward
M. Kennedy over the issue in Washington last week. ``He can't say
this is the way I'd like to do it. It won't sell.''
</P>
<P>
   On Beacon Hill, lawmakers are still conducting hearings on the
Big Dig's funding crisis and have no plans to hammer out an
agreement with Cellucci by Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the House and Senate leaders have already torn
apart the governor's plan, ``which is based on certain assumptions
that are imploding,'' one legislative source said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Those assumptions include: That the overrun will not exceed $1.4
billion and that part of a project insurance plan can be cashed to
generate $150 million.
</P>
<P>
   State officials had pledged to have a funding plan in place by
Wednesday to help restore confidence among federal officials that
Massachusetts can continue to support the highway project as it
nears its final phase, and prevent the disruption of federal
funding.
</P>
<P>
   But there appears to be a strong dispute about what is required
of the state.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Moakley, a federal transportation source told the
Globe that Cellucci was instructed during a meeting with Slater
last week to produce a plan that has won the support of legislative
leaders, not simply a proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Secretary Slater told Governor Cellucci that the date for a
new finacial plan was non-negotiable,'' the source said. ``We're
expecting a plan. One that's feasible.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, in a statement released Monday, Federal Highway
Administrator Kenneth Wykle indicated that Washington authorities
are expecting ``a revised finance plan that is due to FHWA on March
15.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cellucci has a different view and said Slater will be
satisfied with a completed plan by the end of March. That's when a
team of federal auditors is expected to release its own report on
the Big Dig's financial condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the one who met with him,'' the governor said of Slater.
``He told me he recognizes that the Legislature will act. He says
it's not something we should take a lot of time at. But he does not
expect the Legislature to act before they complete their hearings
and before they've had the benefit of the federal audit. Why would
we do the audit and not wait for its results?''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Slater knows that the House and Senate oppose his plan,
Cellucci said, ``I told him the Legislature might have a different
idea. I said I felt we would be able to close the gap. I have no
pride of authorship.''
</P>
<P>
   Whoever is correct, it is clear leaders on Beacon Hill are far
from consensus. In response to Cellucci's plan, the House and
Senate have each floated financing proposals, starkly different
from the governor's.
</P>
<P>
   The House's plan would generate $750 million -- or half the
overrun -- to keep construction underway through 2001. The House
calls for the Turnpike to contribute $200 million and for the sale
of $600 million in state bonds, which would be repaid by revenues
from driver's license fees. Those fees were scheduled to be phased
out, and $200 million in cash reserves from the Turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate plan calls for devoting this year's state budget
surplus, which could top $700 million, to the project. The proposal
also calls for the Turnpike, which oversees the Big Dig, to
contribute between $200 million and $350 million in cash while the
Massachusetts Port Authority would kick in more than $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   There are other signals that compromise may not come easily or
soon.
</P>
<P>
   The question of how to pay for the Central Artery shortfall has
become entangled in the dispute over Cellucci's income tax cut
ballot initiative, which would cost over $1 billion and Senate
President Thomas F. Birmingham sharply opposes.
</P>
<P>
   And federal and state officials met with the Metropolitan Area
Planning Council, which oversees road and bridge projects in
eastern Massachusetts, and assured the agency it could also
scrutinize the governor's financing plan to make sure it did not
imperil municipal transportation projects.

THE BALLAD OF RONAN TYNAN, A TENOR'S TRIUMPH

 By DAN BARRY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He walks onstage with the slight sway of a metronome
and gives a mischievous grin made all the more impish by his
fullback's frame. When he finally stops before the microphone,
there comes a vague sense that a very public mistake is about to
occur, that your man has somehow passed through the wrong door.
</P>
<P>
   Then Ronan Tynan sings.
</P>
<P>
   Through his clear tenor voice, tired Irish ballads ache with the
passion of their ancient birth: dirty Dublin streets echo with
Molly Malone's haunting cry; Danny Boy's snow-hushed valley becomes
as sacred as a church. All the while Tynan's large hands beckon the
audience to draw near and listen to his gift.
</P>
<P>
   These days that gift is for the taking. Tynan is one of the
three Irish tenors, along with Anthony Kearns and Finbar Wright,
now making the St. Patrick's Day rounds in American concert halls
and on public television. The trio has become an unlikely musical
phenomenon, resurrecting Irish parlor songs and adding luster to
ballads more often heard in smoke-choked pubs.
</P>
<P>
   But the most unlikely element is Tynan himself, for reasons he
grudgingly acknowledges carry the glow of inspiration. He was born
with a congenital condition that required him to wear bulky leg
braces into early adulthood. At 20 he chose to have both legs
amputated below the knees in favor of prostheses. He became a
dominant athlete in international competitions for the disabled, an
accomplished horseman and a doctor specializing in sports medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Then at 30 the determined Tynan decided to have a go at singing,
the way others breezily take on golf or stamp collecting. Before
long he had won several competitions, including Ireland's
prestigious John McCormack Cup for tenors. Now, nine years later,
the horses are in the paddock, the practice is on hold, and Tynan
is singing for a living with a child's glee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a very happy man, extremely so,'' he says. ``I get up in
the morning, and once I can get into these legs, man, I'm in
business.''
</P>
<P>
   The story of Ronan Tynan is now part of modern Irish lore. He
grew up on a dairy farm in County Kilkenny, in southeastern
Ireland, where his father's scratchy 78s filled the house with the
disembodied voices of Nelson Eddy, Jussi Bjorling and especially
Mario Lanza. There was McCormack, yes, but those recordings were
comparatively poor. So a farm boy grounded by heavy blocks for
shoes soared to the sounds of ``The Student Prince'' and ``Rose
Marie.''
</P>
<P>
   That boy's determination hardened as his condition worsened. By
age 14 he was traveling by himself to have his legs checked
periodically at a London hospital. He moved from cantering on
ponies to full-fledged steeplechases. When sudden pain roared
through his legs and up his back, he would grit his teeth and wait
for the paralysis to pass.
</P>
<P>
   When he was 19 and a student at University College in Dublin,
Tynan made another trip to London. This time two consultants
decidedly lacking in warmth informed him he had but one solution:
bilateral amputation. Tynan's mother, Therese, did not want to
entertain the thought; his beloved father, Edmond, said the
decision was Ronan's own but softly advised, ``If you have them
amputated, you can't ever have them put back.''
</P>
<P>
   His father ``couldn't see the outcome,'' Tynan said gently. But
the farmer's son could; he felt he had no choice. The devices he
was wearing at the time _ leather boots with thick steel bars and
rivets that cut into the bottoms of his feet _ kept breaking. He
saw artificial limbs as the tools to a certain freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks after the procedure, Tynan was pre-fitted with
prostheses. He instantly began to wonder whether women would still
find him attractive. So, against medical advice and common sense,
he shoved some foam into his pants legs, affixed artificial limbs
to still-raw sutures, and went dancing that night.
</P>
<P>
   The sutures ruptured overnight, a considerable amount of blood
was lost, and Tynan spent the next eight months in a wheelchair.
``I paid for that big time,'' he said. But the incident seems to
reflect an inner strength that often tests the borders of
recklessness; soon he was applying ethyl alcohol spirits to his
stumps, a trick he said he learned from toughening up the hides of
horses.
</P>
<P>
   Edmond Tynan, dead now two years, remains central to his son's
stories. ``And I remember coming back to him,'' Tynan recalled, the
reference to ``him'' a given. ``And when he saw me without the
sticks, and when he saw me progressing from the wheelchair to the
limbs, he said to me, `You know, you were right.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I said: `Yeah, I think I was. But who was to know?'''
</P>
<P>
   By now Tynan had developed a mind-set: ``No reverse. Forward.''
Sometimes he colorfully describes how he wanted to show up those
who had doubted, pitied or vexed him. That attitude steeled him to
the obvious discomfort his presence caused some classmates and
spurred him on to exceed _ not merely meet _ the minimum
requirements for his physical education classes. The international
athletic awards he subsequently earned are many; suffice to say
that he became one of the best collegiate shot put throwers in all
of Ireland, able-bodied or not.
</P>
<P>
   One day while he was singing ``Ave Maria'' with Pavarotti on his
car's radio, Tynan's voice abruptly changed. The sweet sounds of a
boy now carried a man's resonance. He was 22, he said, ``and after
that I wouldn't shut up.''
</P>
<P>
   He went to pubs, especially a place called Dirty Nelly's in
Limerick, and sang for pints of beer for himself and his friends.
He sang happy songs, sad songs, songs about oppression and songs
just heard on the BBC. He sang ``Rose Marie,'' and he sang rugby
rhymes. He took familiar songs and laced them with naughty words of
his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``The voice had the ability to draw attention,'' he said. ``And
I hadn't a clue.''
</P>
<P>
   The competitive drive forged by his childhood condition had not
subsided. Tynan studied under Veronica Dunne, a well-known Irish
vocal coach, then entered a national singing festival in Dublin.
With friends from medical school cheering him on as though they
were at a football match, he recalled, he won the prize for tenor.
He and his mates drank that night from the John McCormack cup.
</P>
<P>
   He spent the next few years experiencing triumph and humility in
the reserved world of classical music. He showed up for an
international singing competition in France without formal attire,
borrowed a suit from a doorman and won the overall male award. He
sang in a performance of Bizet's ``Jolie Fille de Perth,'' but his
French mispronunciations turned the mundane into the salacious. In
Ireland he appeared in Puccini's ``Madama Butterfly,'' a
performance he freely admits was awful.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, Tynan continued to study and to seek his proper
voice. After a disastrous flirtation with becoming a ``big voice''
tenor _ an Irish Pavarotti _ he finally found his niche as a lyric
tenor, straddling that world between light opera and popular
standards. He said he had not forgotten the imploring words of his
father: Sing what people want to hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be a smart direction for him to go in,'' advised
Brian Kellow, the executive editor of Opera News. Kellow said that
while Tynan did not seem to be the next McCormack, ``he does have a
very sweet voice, and people like it.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing Tynan's solo engagement at a Manhattan nightclub in
December, Stephen Holden of The New York Times praised the Tynan
package of voice and earnestness: ``The performances convey a
purity untainted by sanctimony.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways Tynan seems beyond fretting about critical reviews
or his place in music. About the only critique he does not want to
hear is that he sings like an angel.
</P>
<P>
   ``People tend to put me on this pedestal,'' he said. ``They feel
that `oh, he's this, or he's that.' But I'm absolutely no different
than you. I have the same bad thoughts that everybody else has.''
</P>
<P>
   Then as if to underscore the point he responded irreverently to
a question about his height. ``I'm 6-foot-4,'' he said. ``But
that's adjustable.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CAN END HERE.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   If his musical career were to end today, he said, he would be
more than satisfied with his medical practice, his horses, his
story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very content with Ronan Tynan,'' he said. ``He's an OK
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   A glimpse of how he feels can be seen on the videotape,
frequently broadcast on public television, of the Irish tenors'
performance last month in Belfast. As his colleague Kearns sings a
ditty called ``Phil the Fluther's Ball,'' Ronan Tynan performs a
sure-footed dance of joy.

CD NOW AND COLUMBIA HOUSE DROP MERGER PLANS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The online retailer CDNow and the direct-mail music giant
Columbia House announced Monday that their planned merger had
collapsed for financial reasons, leaving both companies scrambling
to find new strategic partners in the rapidly evolving market for
recorded music.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Olim, president and chief executive of CDNow, said the
companies last week determined the merger no longer made financial
sense. He said Columbia House had too little cash flow and too much
debt to finance the growth of a loss-laden Internet startup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their financial position had weakened sufficiently that it was
insufficient for us to achieve our objective,'' Olim said.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, however, it is online sales of CD's by CDNow,
Amazon.com and other online retailers that are in part responsible
for Columbia House's weakened financial position.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Flanders, chief executive of Columbia House, which is
owned 50-50 by Sony Corp. and Time Warner, said he did not dispute
Olim's analysis. But he said the larger problem for Columbia House
was that regulatory hurdles were slowing down the merger and
Columbia could not afford to wait to put its catalog of music
online.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to move our business online,'' Flanders said. ``We
have strategic partnerships that were being delayed because of the
merger.''
</P>
<P>
   Columbia House said it now plans to invest $51 million in CDNow,
which would represent about 15 percent of equity, the parties said.
At the same time, Olim said CDNow had committed itself to a ``new
operating plan'' _ aimed at drastically reducing its costs _ to try
to attract a new partner.
</P>
<P>
   Announced last July, the merger envisioned creating a new public
company to capitalize on the Internet savvy of CDNow and on
Columbia House's broad reach in selling low-cost music by direct
mail. CDNow would have owned 26 percent of the joint venture, with
Sony and Time Warner splitting the other 74 percent.
</P>
<P>
   However, the deal came at a tumultuous time for both companies,
amidst the light-speed change in the Internet industry. A prime
example is Time Warner's deal to merge with America Online, which
will give Time Warner a huge new online outlet for its labels.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Columbia House, with annual revenue around $1.4
billion, has long been a significant source of cash flow for Sony
and Time Warner. Its However, the company and the direct-mail music
business in general ``has come under significant pressure'' in the
last year, said Ken Cassar, an analyst with Jupiter Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Cassar said the business had relied heavily on people ordering
compact discs to replace their old albums and cassette tapes, but
that such sales were becoming less lucrative because many people
had already replaced their collections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still a positive business, but not as positive as it once
was,'' he said. ``My guess is Sony and Time Warner don't want
`Internet return, Internet risk.' They want Columbia House's good
old cash.''
</P>
<P>
   In February, Columbia House announced a reorganization aimed at
moving the business online and decreasing the expense of sending
voluminous catalogs every several weeks to its 16 million members,
Flanders said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, CDNow is looking for a way to turn a profit in the
commodity music business. The company is one of the top music
retailers on the Net, with $53 million in sales in the fourth
quarter, which ended Dec. 31. But in the same period it had $34.5
million in operating losses.
</P>
<P>
   As is typical in the Internet industry, where companies spend
large sums on marketing to build a brand, CDNow spent $26 million
in the fourth quarter on marketing, roughly 50 cents of every
dollar in sales.
</P>
<P>
   But Olim said Monday that the company planned to reduce
marketing costs to $15 million a quarter. In particular, he said,
the company will offer fewer discount coupons.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said CDNow would try increasing its efforts to gain
customers through its affiliate program. That entails getting
referrals to CDNow from several hundred thousand sites on the Net.
</P>
<P>
   But Olim said the company, and its investors, should expect to
see a reduction in revenues in the short term. He said it was still
too early to estimate how much the drop would be.
</P>
<P>
   He said he felt CDNow's brand name was now recognized enough to
be able to shift costs away from marketing.

EUROPEAN PROTESTS AGAINST GENETICALLY MODIFIED CROPS ARE BECOMING
MORE ANIMATED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: France, Britain, Switzerland)  (js) 
 By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE HAGUE, Netherlands _ At the big conference on genetically
modified food here in January, the discussion among 300
participants in the hall was serious science _ intelligent, earnest
and a bit dull.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, things were livelier. Two protesters dressed as
headless chickens strutted. A gorilla wailed over his pox-speckled
bananas, and a mutant apple in a radiation suit passed out
leaflets. The demonstrators played a tape of bubbling cauldrons and
vile belches, and the perfect fillip was the stench that hung in
the air _ which was not even their idea, just dumb luck that a
sewer crew was working nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the television cameras lingered on the protesters,
who numbered fewer than 20.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, the debate over genetically modified food is as much
about passion as it is about science. British newspapers routinely
call ingredients from genetically altered plants Frankenfood, and
pollsters say just 1 percent of Britons think that genetically
modifying plants have any value at all. Environmental advocates in
Europe have destroyed fields of test plants.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, in the United States such ingredients have entered
into nearly two-thirds of the products on supermarket shelves, a
trend that has come to the attention of few Americans.
</P>
<P>
   For Europeans, ``It's not at the level of a rational discussion
any more,'' said Francois Perroud, a spokesman for Nestle, the
world's biggest food company, which is based in Switzerland. Nestle
has stopped buying any grain from genetically altered seed for its
European operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's become a battle of doctrines, of religious beliefs, of
inanities,'' Perroud said. ``But unfortunately more and more
retailers have jumped on the bandwagon and banished these products
from their shelves.''
</P>
<P>
   Legally, the European Union requires labels on any food with 1
percent or more of genetically modified ingredients. Planting,
importing or selling any genetically altered seeds or foods has
virtually stopped, because farmers will not plant the seeds,
consumers will not buy the foods and stores decline to stock them.
Regulators have approved no new seed strains for nearly two years.
</P>
<P>
   Total U.S. corn and soybean exports slipped briefly, but U.S.
farmers are undeterred. Early indications this year from seed
companies are that they are not significantly cutting back on the
seeds, because big food processors have agreed to buy modified
grains and keep them separate from traditional ones.
</P>
<P>
   The focus of the fury is a technology that borrows a genetic
code from plants or animals and transfers it to a plant. Modified
seeds, for instance, can produce their own pesticides, reducing the
amount used in the fields. The seeds are now used throughout North
and South America, China and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents concede that no one has ever been harmed by
genetically modified food. But there are questions about
environmental threats. Will genes from herbicide-resistant corn get
into weeds, creating ``superweeds''? Will benign insects like
Monarch butterflies be killed by pollen drifting from bug-killing
corn?
</P>
<P>
   Many Europeans fear the food itself, and some supermarket chains
won't sell it. Those who object to the science argue that enough
research has not been done on the food's long-term safety.
</P>
<P>
   Many factors are at work: a mysterious science that takes place
at the submicroscopic level; jingoism about food; scare campaigns
by environmentalists; arrogant U.S. responses; and one bit of bad
timing when freighters loaded with the 1996 U.S. soybean crop
sailed just as British mad cow disease, which has nothing to do
with genetically modified food, was terrifying Europe.
</P>
<P>
   There is also an anti-U.S. element. Demonstrators' signs often
portray America and its agro-chemical companies as one and the
same, but Guy le Fur, an expert on biotech food at the
Confederation Paysanne, a radical farmers organization that has
destroyed silos full of modified grain, drew a distinction.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that there were European giants in gene-technology,
too, although most of their work is in pharmaceuticals. He added,
``I don't see it as a national issue _ it is colonization by three
or four companies who want total control of what goes onto the
plates of people across the planet and who want to make a lot of
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierre Lellouche, a Gaullist member of the French Parliament's
committee on environmental safety, said there was deep mistrust
specifically of U.S. assurances that the food was safe. ``The
general sense here is that Americans eat garbage food, that they're
fat and they don't know how to eat properly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   U.S. endorsements, he added, were ``like the British beef thing
_ the British government is still screaming that their beef is
perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not European fears will spread to America is unclear.
Biotech seed accounts for 36 percent of America's corn, 55 percent
of its soybeans and 43 percent of its cotton, and some Americans
wonder how dozens of supermarket items, from infant formula to cola
to muffin mix could contain biotech products without their knowing
it.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. seed producers like Monsanto and DuPont's Pioneer Hi-Bred
International are under pressure not just by environmental
activists but by food makers like H.J. Heinz, Gerber and Frito-Lay
that have stopped using biotech ingredients, and by corn farmers
who switched to the seeds and then saw consumer fears shake
European markets.
</P>
<P>
   Grocery Manufacturers of America, the trade group representing
big food-making companies, thinks much of the concern is overblown.
``It's barely a blip on the radar screen,'' said Brian Sansoni, the
group's spokesman. ``It's just not an issue that's front and center
with the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The protests in Europe also stem from lingering cultural
differences in the ways Americans and Europeans look at food.
</P>
<P>
   Since World War II, despite raised eyebrows from the academic
elite, Europeans have eagerly lapped up most U.S. culture, from
blue jeans and computers to movies and music. But, though the older
generation remembers the chewing gum handed out by American G.I.s,
other U.S. culinary innovations, from frosted cereals to
marshmallows, meet with less enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Every traveler knows the strawberries and asparagus in America
look beautiful but have no flavor,'' said Professor Marc van
Montagu, a professor of genetic science at the University of Ghent
in Belgium. ``They're bred for shelf-life.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the European Union bought only about $1 million worth
of U.S. corn, down dramatically from $305 million in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Europe buys about 25 percent of the U.S. soybean crop, worth
about $2.6 billion in good years. Purchases dropped to $1 billion
last year, according the U.S. Agriculture Department. That decrease
largely reflects price-cutting by exporters in Brazil and
Argentina, the American Soybean Association said. Now those prices
are rising.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-biotech movement affected soybeans less because most
imported beans are used to make animal feed and cooking oil. Under
European law, food for animals is not labeled, and because
processed oil contains no DNA, it does not have to be labeled
either.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union is debating making those laws stricter.
</P>
<P>
   While Europeans fear the ``GM'' label, scientists like Chris
Somerville, a Stanford University plant biologist, say that genetic
technology is ``hundreds of times more predictable than traditional
means,'' like cross-breeding plants or mutating seeds with
radiation or heat. The fear of creating unpredictable monsters is
``largely unfounded,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among U.S. shoppers, surveys show they have confidence in the
Food and Drug Administration and Agriculture Department. Europeans,
on the other hand, having faced mad-cow disease and scandals over
dioxin and sewage sludge in animal feed, have no such confidence in
their regulators.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Also, a debate over gene-splicing technology took place in the
United States in the mid-1980s, a decade before seeds were widely
planted. Jeremy Rifkin, an anti-biotech campaigner, raised the
alarm, but it blew over like the population bomb scare of the
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Through a chance meeting in Washington in 1986, Rifkin made a
convert of Benedikt Haerlin, then an official of Germany's Green
Party and now the head of a campaign by Greenpeace, an
environmental protest group, to stop bioengineered food.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a decade later, just as mad-cow disease struck, the first
U.S. crop with some herbicide-resistant soybeans was on its way
across the ocean. Activists still talk about the 1996 crop as if it
was the Normandy invasion. ``Now we had concrete targets,'' said
Mika Railo, a spokesman for Greenpeace. ``We had to hit the ground
running.''
</P>
<P>
   British tabloids leapt into the fray, and soon British companies
were asking U.S. exporters for unmodified grain. Big shippers
initially refused.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, some Americans were insulting. Bill Wadsworth, the
technical manager for Iceland, a British frozen-food and
supermarket chain that is leading the fight against biotech food
there, attended a 1997 meeting of the American Soybean Association
and American farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them our customers wanted choice, and if they would
supply us with one bucket, just one bucket of non-G.M. beans, then
we'd make some product without,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his presence, he said, an association speaker referred to him
as ``a backward European'' and assured the farmers that ``European
objections are irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when I organized a separate chain of supply from
Brazil,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Europeans often see the U.S. government, aggressively free trade
and keen on technology, as a co-conspirator.
</P>
<P>
   Last July, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said the
administration would use all legal remedies to compel Europe to
accept U.S. soybeans and corn even if that meant punitive tariffs.
In the same speech, he conceded for the first time that the
administration wanted long-term studies of the food's safety. He
has since modified that tone considerably.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. resistance to labeling, though, rankles some Europeans, who
say it looks suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   In January in Montreal, 130 countries hammered out the first
international treaty on the issue by agreeing that shipments of
modified grain be labeled. Under the treaty, which 50 nations have
yet to ratify, countries can prohibit imports of a crop deemed a
threat to the environment. The treaty does not deal with the
labeling of consumer packages.
</P>
<P>
   European governments and scientists worry about another form of
backlash. Genetic science is becoming a huge industry. If Europe
gets a reputation for Luddite reactions to new fields, they fear,
it will continue to lose its best scientists and thousands of jobs
to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say we're playing God,'' said Daniel Vasella, the
president of Novartis, a Swiss-based pharmaceutical and biotech
giant. ``But that's what they said about Icarus and flying, or
Prometheus and fire, or Galileo. You put the old order to rest and
you're told you've questioned the rule of God and you will now be
punished like the fall of the tower of Babel.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Haerlin, leader of the Greenpeace campaign, made a strongly
worded speech at The Hague conference. To an audience of
scientists, he said that many scientists were liars and that
``smarter science and smarter scientists'' were needed to improve
organic farming.
</P>
<P>
   He was criticized by an African official of the U.N. Food and
Agricultural Organization, who said ``organic farming is practiced
by 800 million poor people in the world because they can't afford
pesticides and fertilizers _ and it's not working.'' In remarks to
reporters afterward, Haerlin dismissed the importance of saving
African or Asian lives at the risk of spreading a new science he
considered untested.
</P>
<P>
   Greenpeace's position, he said, was that research could go on as
long as no seeds or animals are ever released _ which would make
the research pointless for biotech companies.
</P>
<P>
   Not all Europeans agree. Swiss voters, for example, have twice
rejected by large margins referendums that would have banned all
genetic research or put a 10-year moratorium on field trials or
sales.

CLINTON DENOUNCES GOP ON PRESCRIPTION DRUGS PROPOSAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ President Clinton on Monday denounced proposals by
Republican members of Congress to help elderly people buy
prescription drugs, and he defended his own proposal, saying the
government must subsidize drug coverage for all Medicare
beneficiaries, not just for those who have modest incomes or use
large amounts of medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than noting their similar goals, Clinton emphasized the
differences between his approach and that of Republicans in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans want to give federal grants to the states, to
help low-income elderly people buy prescription drugs. But Clinton
said that approach would ``help only the poorest seniors'' and
would leave people just above the poverty line to fend for
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   That approach is unacceptable, Clinton said. More than half of
all Medicare beneficiaries who lack prescription drug coverage have
incomes more than 50 percent above the official poverty level, he
said. A couple is classified as poor if its annual income,
including Social Security benefits, is less than $11,250.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Clinton rejected a proposal by some Republicans who
want to give tax breaks to elderly people so they can buy private
insurance covering prescription drugs. ``This proposal would
benefit the wealthiest seniors, without providing any help to low-
and middle-income seniors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton came under attack on the issue as Rep. Bill Archer,
the Texas Republican who is chairman of the Ways and Means
Committee, said Monday the president had impeded congressional
efforts to expand Medicare to cover prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``One year ago this week President Clinton blocked a bipartisan
plan to strengthen Medicare and help seniors get the drugs they
need,'' Archer said, referring to the work of a bipartisan
commission on the future of Medicare. Archer said Republicans were
determined to help those who most needed assistance, ``without
bankrupting Medicare or threatening coverage for millions of people
who have prescription drug insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress is considering many proposals to provide Medicare
coverage of prescription drugs, and the issue promises to figure
prominently in the presidential election and in many congressional
races.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare generally does not cover prescription drugs outside the
hospital. But many elderly people have such coverage because they
receive health benefits from former employers or because they buy
private insurance to fill gaps in Medicare, and some of those
Medigap policies pay for prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In a report issued Monday, the White House emphasized the
importance of drug coverage for the elderly. ``Middle-income
beneficiaries without prescription drug coverage purchase 20
percent fewer drugs, but pay about 75 percent more out-of-pocket
than those with drug coverage,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Medigap insurance was no panacea. ``Medigap drug
coverage starts out expensive and then goes through the roof as
seniors get older,'' he said. In Ohio, he said, a 65-year-old
person pays an average of $146 a month for a Medigap policy
covering prescription drugs, while an 80-year-old must pay $230 a
month.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the White House report said, the tax and Medigap
proposals would not achieve significant discounts because they
would not exploit the purchasing power of the federal government.
Under Clinton's proposal, the government would hire private
companies to buy prescription drugs for the elderly and to
negotiate discounts from drug manufacturers and pharmacies.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton insists that government-subsidized drug coverage should
be offered to all 39 million Medicare beneficiaries. But many
Republicans and some Democrats in Congress say the government
should direct its assistance to people who have low incomes or high
drug expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The president's comments on prescription drugs, made before an
audience of elderly people at the Cleveland Public Library, were
squeezed into a day devoted mainly to political fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   On his trip Monday, Clinton raised more than $1.1 million. He
started the day here by speaking to 70 people at a luncheon that
raised $350,000 for the Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee. Clinton then flew to Chicago, where he raised $87,500 at
a reception and $700,000 at a dinner for 28 couples. At the dinner,
arranged by the Democratic National Committee, each couple
contributed $25,000 for the privilege of spending time with the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said the government would pay
much of the cost for the president's trip Monday because it
included an official event, the meeting with Medicare beneficiaries
to discuss prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton unveiled his drug proposal as part of a comprehensive
plan to revamp Medicare on June 29 last year. He has not sent
Congress any legislation to translate his ideas on drug coverage
into reality, despite requests from lawmakers of both parties.
White House officials said Clinton still intended to send draft
legislation to Congress, but they could not say when.
</P>
<P>
   Under Clinton's proposal, the government would pay half of the
drug costs incurred by any Medicare beneficiary who wanted to sign
up for coverage. The maximum federal payment would start at $1,000
a year per beneficiary in 2003 and would rise to $2,500 in 2009.
Beneficiaries would pay monthly premiums, starting at $26 in 2003
and rising to $51 in 2009. The White House says the president's
drug proposal would cost $160 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he was willing to share credit with Republicans.
``Look,'' he said, ``they can name this prescription drug program
after Herbert Hoover, Calvin Coolidge and Warren Harding. It's fine
with me. Put some Republican's name on it. I don't care. Just do
it, because it's the right thing to do for the seniors of this
country.''

<P>
   On days like this, I love my job. Maybe it's because I just did
lunch with Tom Cruise.
</P>
<P>
   OK, it was me and a few hundred others at the 19th annual
Academy Awards nominees' luncheon at the Beverly Hilton Hotel. But
I was the reporter who, by random drawing, was seated with Tom
Cruise, to the envy of every woman in the room.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise, nominated as best supporting actor for ``Magnolia,''
jumped up when Richard Farnsworth ambled by his table, introduced
himself and complimented Farnsworth's work. It's nice to know that
celebrities who leave the star-struck in their wake still are awed
by their own idols.
</P>
<P>
   There was a lot of shop talk, to be sure. At the Cruise table
(or No. 33, for those who sneer at name-dropping), writers talked
computer scripting and designers talked fabric. But it still was a
party.
</P>
<P>
   Director Lasse Hallstrom laughed with ``The Cider House Rules''
writer John Irving, who later was deep in conversation with
director Sam Mendes (``American Beauty'').
</P>
<P>
   Chloe Sevigny (supporting actress, ``Boys Don't Cry'') appeared
ill at ease in the crowded, very chatty room.
</P>
<P>
   Same for Farnsworth (best actor, ``The Straight Story''). The
79-year-old former stuntman stood still in a dense crowd before
lunch was served, clearly wanting to escape it but too polite to
nudge someone aside with a loud ``excuse me.''
</P>
<P>
   If there were an award for best entrance, it would go to Michael
Clarke Duncan (supporting actor, ``The Green Mile''), who bounded
into the luncheon late, just as the nominees were posing for their
``class photo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost my housekeys last night _ I didn't have anyplace to
sleep,'' he explained. ``I'm sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Levy of the motion picture academy followed through with
the punchline: ``This may be the first time we've had a homeless
person at the nominees' luncheon.''
</P>
<P>
   Child actor Haley Joel Osment (supporting actor, ``The Sixth
Sense'') actually skipped across the stage after getting his
nomination certificate.
</P>
<P>
   If Oscar odds were determined by an applause meter at the
luncheon, it would be hard to know where to place bets. Some names
would have moved the needle a little farther to the right (such as
Annette Bening, Cruise, Osment, Farnsworth, Kevin Spacey, Denzel
Washington and Hilary Swank). But mostly there was sincere
congratulatory applause that suggested it really !ital!is an honor
to be nominated.

LEFTIST GROUP TAKES CREDIT FOR MORTAR ATTACK ON TEHRAN SUBURB
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By JOHN F. BURNS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon _ A day after one of Iran's leading democratic
reformers was critically wounded in a shooting on a Tehran street,
the Iranian capital was the scene of another attack on Monday when
several mortar shells were fired into a residential complex
abutting a military base in the capital's northern suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   In messages to news agency offices elsewhere in the Middle East,
a radical leftist group that bases itself in Iraq, the Mujahedeen
Khalq, the People's Holy Warriors, claimed responsibility for the
attack, which wounded two civilians, one of whom, a gardener, was
reported to have lost both his legs. The group said its target was
an adjacent base of the Revolutionary Guards, a powerful military
force that is one of the pillars of Iran's system of Islamic rule.
</P>
<P>
   The leftists' claim of responsibility for the mortar attack
appeared to separate the incident, at least in terms of the likely
perpetrators, from the shooting on Sunday of Saeed Hajjarian, a
47-year-old newspaper publisher and close associate of Iran's
reformist president, Mohammad Khatami. Before Monday's attack, the
Mujahedeen Khalq denied having anything to do with the shooting of
the publisher.
</P>
<P>
   He remained in a coma at Sina hospital in Tehran, on a life
support system, with what one of the doctors involved described as
``irreversible brain damage'' resulting from oxygen starvation in
the immediate aftermath of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   As Iranians absorbed the shock of the two attacks, it became
clear that last month's parliamentary election, far from settling
Iran's political future, has in some ways moved the country into a
still more volatile period. The attack on Hajjarian, in particular,
appeared to have caused deep anxiety among Iran's 65 million
people, whose choices in the parliamentary balloting _ a popular
vote of about 70 percent for reform candidates, resulting in a
sweep of three-quarters of the decided seats in the 290-seat
parliament _ reflected a deep yearning for relief from two decades
of overbearing Islamic rule.
</P>
<P>
   Many Iranians rated the election outcome as potentially the most
important change in the political landscape since the Islamic
revolution that overthrew Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi in 1979, and
saw Hajjarian, who has been one of the reformers' principal
strategists, as a major standard-bearer for their hopes. According
to leading reformers, few men, if any, have had more influence on
the political strategies of Khatami, who won the presidency, an
office with sharply limited powers, in a landslide victory of his
own in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But now, the country faces still more uncertainty. Apart from
what the attack on Hajjarian may say about the willingness of
Islamic hardliners to turn to violence in their bid to hang on to
power, even the election win may mean less than seemed at first.
Last week, a conservative-dominated supervisory body, the Council
of Guardians, threw out the election of three reform candidates who
won seats in provincial cities, without any attempt to justify or
explain the action. Reformers were left to worry that further
disqualifications may follow.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond this, the prospect of a second round of voting on April
21, to settle more than 60 seats that were thrown to run-off
ballots by the first round, and a further period of weeks after
that before the new parliament meets, has left the country facing
an extended period in which both reformers and conservatives have
been left to maneuver and calculate how a new power alignment will
work. Iranian political analysts, in telephone conversations on
Monday, said they viewed the situation as primed for trouble, and
feared that the attacks of the past two days may only be a prelude
to others.
</P>
<P>
   By choosing the aftermath of the attack on Hajjarian to mount an
attack, the analysts said, the Mujahideen Khalq group was not
likely to have been motivated by sympathy for the democratic reform
movement, which it holds in equal contempt to the Islamic
conservatives, seeing both as committed, in different ways, to
upholding the Islamic system that the leftists despise. Rather, the
analysts said, the leftists probably hoped to engender panic and
push Iran closer to a political cataclysm that could open new
opportunities to the leftists.

<P>
   MIAMI _ The Miami Dolphins' millionaire quarterback was beloved
for his heart-squeezing comeback drives, for his quick release and
his perfect, arching spiral, and for his toughness, for playing
with a battered body that seemed as if it would fall to pieces if
he untied all the knee braces, ankle splints and rib protectors he
wore into battle.
</P>
<P>
   But what Mike Vogt, a fan, will miss most is the feeling that,
every time he saw the famous Dan Marino at work, he was seeing a
boy at play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what we all loved about him was he had this boyish
joy,'' said Vogt, after he learned Monday that the National
Football League's record-shattering passer and South Florida's most
famous sports celebrity had finally, officially retired. ``We all
felt that.''
</P>
<P>
   Marino would smile and even hop in the air like a little boy
when he completed a long pass, and would pout and fret, his face a
bright, shining red, when he was intercepted or a receiver dropped
the ball, recalled the Dolphin fans who were really, at heart,
Marino fans.
</P>
<P>
   It was as if, depending on the situation, he was always on the
verge of either snatching up the ball and going home, or
celebrating with a glass of chocolate milk.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he'd throw the ball, he'd just grin like a 10-year-old
would,'' said Vogt, a computer programmer in Boca Raton who has
been a Marino fan for all of his 17 years as a Dolphin. ``He was
magic.''
</P>
<P>
   Marino, who threw the football down field, with varying results,
more times than anyone in professional football ever has, will not
throw for the Dolphins _ or for anyone else _ ever again. And in
South Florida, even though his retirement had been rumored for
months, people who followed Miami football reacted with a mix of
gloom and relief.
</P>
<P>
   After a disappointing year in which he played injured and played
as a mortal, not the superstar who built a legend, he chose to
retire at age 38 rather than attempt a comeback with the Dolphins
or another team. He watched a young, strong backup win games in his
place, and it became clear that the future did not include him here
in the city that worshiped him, at least not in an aqua-and-orange
uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sundays will not be the same,'' said Richard Molinary, a
customer service representative who works in Hollywood, north of
Miami in Broward County.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be like something's not quite right,'' said Molinary,
who has a fame of his own in Florida sports circles as the
often-photographed ``Miami Fanatic,'' because he paints his face in
Dolphin colors and wears a Dolphins towel like a cape. ``I started
my career when he started his, in 1983, so I've watched him game
after game for all these years. They've been some of the best years
of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Molinary and other fans winced as injuries to Marino's knees and
ankles took their toll, as their hero took the field in football
cleats that were so built-up and padded that they looked more like
the boots worn by Frankenstein's monster. At times, it seemed like
Marino was so tightly bound and strapped that the only thing that
really moved was his arm.
</P>
<P>
   It does not matter to people who loved him that Marino's last
game was a 62-7 playoff loss at Jacksonville. ``He is the Babe Ruth
of football,'' Molinary said, standing outside the Dolphins'
training camp in Davie Monday, as inside, Marino announced his
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Marino did not cry; he just seemed as if someone had let all the
air out of him, even as the Dolphins' owner, H. Wayne Huizenga,
told him he would have a statue erected of Marino outside Pro
Player Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to miss Sunday afternoons,'' Marino said.
</P>
<P>
   Marino became a superstar when Miami was a greatly different
city, when English, not Spanish, was still the principal language
and the region had only the Dolphins _ there was no professional
basketball, hockey or baseball in Miami then.
</P>
<P>
   Now Miami is generally regarded as the financial, cultural and
entertainment capital of Latin America, where international soccer
crowds fill the Orange Bowl. In downtown Miami, where the
storefront signs are mostly in Spanish and the pedestrians, many of
them new Americans, talk of everything but football, Marino's
retirement was barely noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could care less about football or Dan Marino,'' said Lydia
Martin, speaking in Spanish at a courtyard restaurant in downtown
Miami. ``They make him sound like he's God.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make a difference in my personal life,'' said
Martin, who was born in Colombia and has been living in Miami for
three years.
</P>
<P>
   While his retirement was covered by Spanish-language television,
radio and newspapers, Marino's fan base has mostly moved north to
Broward and Palm Beach counties, along with most of the region's
Anglos. Even the Dolphins' stadium itself has moved north, from the
Orange Bowl in downtown Miami to up near the Broward line.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's part of the old Miami,'' said Tony Segreto, an anchor for
WTVJ, the NBC affiliate in Miami, and co-host of Marino's
television show. But, said Segreto, he also drew many new fans from
the new Miami, in the way only a superstar athlete could. ``I don't
think an athlete can ever have the same impact on this town.''
</P>
<P>
   After every famous athlete's retirement, fans and media exhaust
superlatives in creating their legend. But in Miami, say longtime
fans and friends, Marino will be remembered almost as much for what
he did not do as for what he did.
</P>
<P>
   He never won a Super Bowl, ``the burning desire, what I played
for,'' said Marino, who lost his one chance in a 1985 loss to Joe
Montana and the San Francisco 49ers, 38-16.
</P>
<P>
   But, unlike so many sports superstars of the past decade, he
never embarrassed himself in the community he represented. He was
never arrested driving drunk, doing or buying cocaine, soliciting a
prostitute, resisting arrest at a wild party or become entangled in
a nasty paternity suit, said fans. ``He's the kind you want to
emulate,'' said Kenny Dorsey, the freshman starting quarterback at
the University of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of making headlines with the police, Marino made them by
adopting a Chinese baby, Niki Lin, with his wife, Claire, rescuing
the child from an orphanage. He spent and raised millions for
charities. In 1992 he established the Dan Marino Foundation to
benefit children's charities, and did television commercials with
his autistic son, Michael, to help raise money.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's become more than just the guy who throws the ball,'' said
Jimmy Cefalo, who played football with the Dolphins and Marino as a
wide receiver.
</P>
<P>
   His former coach, Don Shula, summed up his quarterback's time in
Miami this way:
</P>
<P>
   ``You just want to applaud.''  &QL;

TWO 19TH - CENTURY PUBLISHERS BUILT THEIR PAPERS INTO EMPIRES
</HEADLINE>
  (With TRIBUNE-TIMESMIRROR) 
(nk) 
 By RICK LYMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A strange kind of symmetry marks the histories of
The Los Angeles Times and The Chicago Tribune, major metropolitan
newspapers and regional power-brokers that in the heyday of such
institutions were ruled by strong-willed, conservative publishers.
These men brooked no dissent and played crucial roles in
determining the shape, growth and self-image of their respective
cities.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Robert R. McCormick, the willfully eccentric publisher of
The Tribune, who mounted fierce feuds with luminaries like Franklin
Roosevelt and Henry Luce and whose editorial page was an often
angry voice of conservative Republicanism, was once described as
``one of the greatest minds of the 14th Century.''
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Harrison Gray Otis, a large and often overbearing man who
steered The Los Angeles Times along a similarly conservative path
and who made almost as many enemies as McCormick, passed along the
newspaper to his son, Harry Chandler, and grandson, Norman
Chandler, in an unbroken, century-long chain of right-wing,
Republican domination in Southern California. One political enemy,
Sen. Hiram Johnson, once described Otis as having ``a gangrene
heart and rotting brain, grimacing at every reform, chattering
impotently at all things that are decent.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet McCormick and Otis built immensely influential institutions
that became virtually synonymous with the cities where they rose _
creating visions of those cities that to a large extent endure to
this day.
</P>
<P>
   McCormick saw his beloved ``Chicagoland,'' a term he coined, as
a kind of ultra-normal, common-sense alternative to the excesses of
the East and West coasts. His vision of the Midwest as a place
apart, a calm heartland of bedrock American values, is one that
took root in the 1940s, when the Tribune was said to be the most
widely read newspaper in America.
</P>
<P>
   For Otis and the Chandlers, Southern California was a kind of
real estate paradise, where ordinary, hard-working people could own
their own homes, perhaps with an orange tree or a swimming pool in
the back yard, and the weather was almost always perfect, a kind of
20th Century fulfillment of the American Dream, the nation's just
reward for manifest destiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they are two of a kind,'' said Richard Norton Smith,
director of the Gerald R. Ford Library and Museum in Grand Rapids,
Mich., and author of ``The Colonel: The Life and Legend of Robert
R. McCormick.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Although I don't think the colonel would want to have seen his
Chicagoland sullied by being linked to Los Angeles,'' Smith said.
``He always used to refer to California as the nuttiest state in
the Union, with Wisconsin a close second.''
</P>
<P>
   Both papers also had a similar kind of renaissance in the last
quarter of the 20th century, shedding their hidebound cocoons and
becoming among the best and most respected papers in the country.
The change was particularly striking in The Los Angeles Times, once
widely reviled as the nation's worst (a vote of Washington-based
reporters in 1937 named it the nation's ``least fair and reliable''
publication). Under Otis Chandler, the general's great-grandson,
The Los Angeles Times was transformed in the 1960s and 1970s from a
near-laughingstock into one of the country's two or three best
newspapers, eschewing its long-held conservatism for a more
mainstream and cosmopolitan style.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Powers That Be,'' his 1979 book about the founders of
several media empires, David Halberstam wrote of Otis Chandler that
``no publisher in America improved a paper so quickly and on so
grand a scale.''
</P>
<P>
   Although McCormick was the most colorful and, in the long run,
probably the most influential head of The Chicago Tribune, he was
not its first great publisher. That was Joseph Medill, a Canadian
whose family moved to Ohio in 1832 and who, with his siblings,
bought the local Conshocton Whig and renamed it the Republican. In
1855, after he had founded other Ohio newspapers, including the
Cleveland Leader, Medill bought an interest in the Chicago Tribune,
which had been founded in 1847, and ran it as editor and publisher
from 1874, when he assumed a controlling interest.
</P>
<P>
   It became the most important voice for the abolition of slavery
in the Midwest, and some credit Medill with coming up with the name
for the new political party, the Republicans. In the run-up to the
Civil War, Medill was perhaps the first great champion of Abraham
Lincoln and was instrumental in helping the lawmaker from
Springfield, Ill., become a national political figure dedicated to
preserving the Union.
</P>
<P>
   McCormick, a grandson of Medill, carefully crafted his public
image from the time he took over the Tribune in 1911, becoming
probably the nation's best-known conservative voice for much of the
first half of the century.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really believed, as crackpot as it seems to us today, that
he could influence American foreign policy, that he had a right to
choose who was president,'' Smith said. ``It seems overreaching to
us, but it gave a kind of fierce energy to what he was doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the family that ran The Los Angeles Times, McCormick
created no dynasty, dying childless. But he was an empire-builder,
too, expanding the company's interests to include the New York
Daily News and the Washington-Times Herald.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Times was first published in 1881 and was
gradually taken over during the next five years by Otis, who used
the paper both as a local power base and as a trumpet to sell
sun-starved Easterners on his growing city, a passion that came
easily to the Ohio-born publisher. He despised labor unions and the
Democratic Party, and the feeling was mutual. In 1910, three union
members confessed to setting a bomb at the paper's downtown Los
Angeles headquarters that killed 21 of Otis' employees.
</P>
<P>
   By 1917, when Harry Chandler fully succeeded his father-in-law
as publisher, The Los Angeles Times was the most powerful voice in
Southern California and a political force to be reckoned with.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Both Harry Chandler and his son, Norman Chandler, continued the
paper's bedrock Republicanism and often saw nothing wrong with
letting their political biases bleed over into the news columns. At
times, it was said, the publishers would not allow the names of a
Democratic official or union leader to appear undisparaged in the
newspaper. But the paper grew with the city. In 1922, it opened the
first radio station owned by a newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Under Norman Chandler, who took the reins in 1941, the paper
continued to prosper with the city and, after he handed control of
The Los Angeles Times to his son, Otis, in 1960, Norman Chandler
became the chairman of Times-Mirror, the paper's parent company. In
that capacity, he saw the first stages of corporate expansion that
eventually saw Times-Mirror purchase newspapers like Newsday, The
Dallas Times-Herald (later sold and closed), The Denver Post (also
later sold), The Hartford Courant and The Baltimore Sun.
</P>
<P>
   The first major signs of change in the paper's editorial
direction came soon after Otis Chandler assumed control, when he
published a series of articles critical of the John Birch Society,
a right-wing organization with many adherents among the myriad of
Chandler cousins who shared majority control of the corporation
under the terms of Chandler's will.
</P>
<P>
   After Chandler stepped down as publisher and, later, as chairman
of the Times-Mirror board, his most immediate successors largely
carried on in the tradition that he engendered. But in 1995, at the
urging of the remaining Chandler cousins on the board, among
others, Mark Willes, an executive from General Mills who had no
prior newspaper experience, was brought in as chief executive,
vowing to break down long-standing separations between the paper's
business and editorial sides in an effort to ``reinvent the Los
Angeles Times,'' as he often said.

<P>
   TOKYO _ Defying official optimism, trillions of yen in
government spending and other financial stimulants, Japan's economy
showed its underlying weakness Monday in statistics that indicated
a retreat back into recession during the final three months of
1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese Economic Planning Agency said that the gross
domestic product _the total output of goods and services in the
economy, the world's second- largest _ fell 1.4 percent in the
October-through-December quarter.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second consecutive quarter of economic shrinkage,
following a 1 percent decline from July through September. The
back-to-back quarters of contraction put Japan officially back into
the technical definition of a recession, extending a seesaw pattern
of tentative recovery and pullback.
</P>
<P>
   The October-December decline was the biggest since the economy
fell 2 percent in the spring of 1997 and the third-largest
quarterly decline since the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   There had been some expectations that the October-December
period would show a decline, as the flow of tax money for public
works projects dwindled and consumers curtailed spending. The
government had toned down its optimistic predictions in recent
weeks as evidence grew that growth had stalled.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the magnitude of the decline was worse than even
pessimistic forecasters had predicted.
</P>
<P>
   The data showed that Japan is still facing great obstacles in
recovering from its longest bout of anemic economic performance in
the postwar years. The most vexing obstacle seems to be in
persuading Japanese consumers to spend money. Many have resisted
despite extremely low interest rates and other incentives.
</P>
<P>
   Consumption, which accounts for 60 percent of economic activity
here, fell 1.6 percent last quarter, and housing investment
plummeted 5.8 percent. Winter bonuses that many Japanese households
regard as a critical part of their income shrank, and a
government-sponsored program to encourage home purchases expired.
</P>
<P>
   Economists said the latest quarterly performance probably means
that the economy will not meet the government's target of 0.6
percent growth in the fiscal year that ends on March 31, although
Taichi Sakaiya, the head of the Economic Planning Agency, insisted
that goal could still be achieved. ``We think it is attainable,''
Sakaiya said. ``We expect the economy to move in a fairly bright
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the government was preparing to improve its outlook for
the economy in its monthly report, to be released on Friday, and
might even declare an economic recovery in progress.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than spurring optimism, though, his comments created
suspicion. While most economists are predicting growth this
quarter, the economy would have to expand by 2 percent or more for
the government to achieve its estimate of 0.6 percent annual
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Even optimistic forecasters concede that will be difficult, but
the ruling party is facing an election this year, which puts
pressure on politicians to put forth the most promising picture
possible. But given the broad skepticism about the government's
estimates, investors are likely to regard the next set of numbers
with some doubt. Indeed, the benchmark Nikkei index of 225 issues
fell 2.84 percent Monday, dragging down other Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy responsible for producing the numbers is the same guy
who has a political stake in how it comes out,'' said Robert Alan
Feldman, chief economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in Tokyo.
``Statements like that don't do anything to increase the
credibility of Japanese statistics; in fact, perhaps they work in
the opposite direction.''
</P>
<P>
   As bad as Monday's figures were, they did not completely derail
growth. Japan's economy grew 0.3 percent in 1999, meager indeed but
still a comeback from a 2.8 percent decline in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Jesper Koll, chief economist at Merrill Lynch here, said the
gross domestic product in the first quarter of this year could be
up as much as 6 percent on an annualized basis. He is now
predicting growth of 1.8 percent in the next fiscal year, ending in
March 2001, compared with the government's preliminary projection
of 2 percent growth for that period.
</P>
<P>
   The Economic Planning Agency's data produced conflicting
opinions, a hallmark of forecasting in Japan. ``In my judgment,
this is not a real recession,'' said Masaru Takagi, an economist at
Meiji University. ``It's only a temporary pause in the recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Katz, senior editor of the Oriental Economist, a
newsletter published by Toyo Keizai, which tracks Japanese economic
issues, had the opposite interpretation. ``One year after the
recovery is said to have begun,'' he said, ``we are virtually right
back where we started from. So you have to ask yourself whether
January-through-June wasn't just a pause in a single recession that
started in 1997.''
</P>
<P>
   Katz and some other economists are worried that the performance
of Japan's economy this year will roughly mirror last year's, with
two consecutive quarters of growth followed by two quarters of
decline. ``What this zigzag makes very clear is that when the
government throws money at the economy, it grows, and when it
doesn't throw money at the economy, it ceases to grow,'' Katz said.
``That's been the history of Japan for the past five years.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The government in general, and Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa
in particular, have said they will not need to introduce a
supplemental spending bill this year. A record budget of 85
trillion yen _ $8 trillion at current exchange rates _ was just
passed, one loaded with public works projects, small-business
credit guarantees and programs to stimulate housing investment.
</P>
<P>
   While that set a record, it would represent a decline in public
spending of 4.5 percent from the previous fiscal year _ when
Parliament passed one of the largest supplemental budgets ever _
unless a new supplemental budget is indeed introduced and adopted.
Many economists are already saying that the economy will need
another dollop of spending lest it risk repeating the
two-quarters-of-growth, two-quarters-of-contraction pattern of
1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took a gamble last June, saying they didn't need a
supplemental budget,'' Katz said, ``and then the economy fell off
the table.''
</P>
<P>
   With an election looming, there is likely to be more talk of a
supplemental budget package after the Golden Week holiday in May,
when politicians go back to their home constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   There are some signs emerging, too, that private businesses have
been spending more money, which could diminish the need for further
public spending as an economic stimulant.
</P>
<P>
   Capital investment by businesses rose by an astonishingly robust
4.6 percent in the October-December period, far better than most
economists had anticipated. The sharp rise suggested that
executives are feeling more optimistic about future prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate profit also improved sharply in the fourth quarter of
last year, bounding ahead 41.8 percent on a pretax basis to the
biggest increase in two decades, according to Finance Ministry data
released last week. Earnings of those companies tied to the new
economy _ those specializing in information technology and
telecommunications _ were especially promising.

ALBRIGHT AIDE CAUTIONS BOTH SERBS AND ALBANIANS

   MITROVICA, Kosovo _ James P. Rubin, the State Department
spokesman, urged both Albanian and Serbian leaders in Kosovo Monday
not to play into the hands of President Slobodan Milosevic of
Yugoslavia and to reject extremists who are behind recent violence.
</P>
<P>
   On the second day of his visit to Kosovo, Rubin brought messages
from Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to Serbian opposition
leaders, in particular Bishop Artemije of the Serbian Orthodox
Church in Kosovo, urging him to join Albanians in the Kosovo
governing body set up by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   And at every chance he repeated the message made on his arrival
on Sunday, warning Albanian leaders they must use their positions
to stop the violence against Serbs and other minorities or they
risk losing support of the West.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by the American presidential adviser Christopher
Hill and officials from the United States peacekeeping mission in
Kosovo, Rubin was on an unusual diplomatic tour of his own. He has
played a special role in Kosovo, personally intervening to clinch a
disarmament deal with the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army. Working the
ties formed before and after last year's NATO bombing campaign in
Yugoslavia, and playing on the gratitude many Albanians feel
towards Albright for supporting them during the war, Rubin said he
had come to show Kosovo Albanians that Washington's commitment to
their future remained strong, but should not be taken for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to create coexistence here,'' he said to
journalists in the divided town of Mitrovica, which has been the
scene of repeated violence in recent weeks. ``The message is don't
let extremists ruin this.''
</P>
<P>
   Flying on to Djakovica in western Kosovo, which suffered some of
the worst destruction by Serbian forces last spring, Rubin kept on
with his message. He stood on the steps of a destroyed mosque,
facing a silent line of women protesting the disappearance of their
men at Serbian hands, and he spoke against revenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is to be the end of the cycle of violence, all of you
who live here must find a way not to visit upon the Serbs that
violence that was visited upon you,'' he said.

TRIAL OPENS ON SERB GENERAL ACCUSED IN SREBRENICA MASSACRE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms)

<TEXT>
<P>
   THE HAGUE, Netherlands _ The trial of a Bosnian Serb general
accused of overseeing the largest single massacre of the war in
Bosnia opened here Monday with prosecutors contending that
determined resistance from U.N. peacekeepers might have prevented
the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Rene Ruez, the lead investigator into the killings in 1995
of an estimated 7,000 Bosnian Muslims during and after the fall of
the U.N.-declared safe area of Srebrenica, said that Bosnian Serb
forces at first did not intend to take the town.
</P>
<P>
   But after Gen. Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb commander,
encountered paltry resistance from the Dutch U.N. peacekeepers,
Bosnian Muslims and NATO warplanes defending the town, he drove his
forces forward, the prosecutor contended. He said he based his
statements on Bosnian Serb documents seized in a raid.
</P>
<P>
   The town's fall has been widely blamed on the reluctance of U.N.
commanders to press for NATO air attacks and the failure to provide
enough troops to defend it.
</P>
<P>
   The trial that opened Monday is for Gen. Radislav Krstic, the
second in command in the attack, who has been charged with
genocide, crimes against humanity and violating the laws of war. He
is the only Bosnian Serb arrested for the attack and has pleaded
not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Krstic, 52, swallowed and stared at his hands when pictures of
corpses in mass graves were flashed in the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   He was arrested by American soldiers in 1998. His superior and
the commander of the Srebrenica attack, Mladic, remains at large
and is believed to be in Belgrade under protection of the Yugoslav
president, Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Because Bosnian Serb forces are alleged to have killed nearly
all the men they captured, this case may reflect prosecutors' best
opportunity to win a conviction for genocide in the war in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors have long complained of the slow pace of the
investigation of the killings. Identification of bodies has been
hampered by a lack of resources, and survivors complain that NATO
troops have been slow to arrest suspects.

 &HT;    If we're lucky, we'll be able to sneak a few french fries  
 By DARYL LEASE   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   My experience with political fund-raising is pretty much limited
to diverting milk money from my fourth-grade classmates' pockets
years ago to buy construction paper to make campaign signs for a
school election. But _ call me naive _ some things still seem
elementary when it comes to running for office.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, it seems fair to say that $250 million is a heap
of milk money. That's how much has been spent on the current
presidential campaign thus far. It's a record.
</P>
<P>
   By this point four years ago, the contenders for Bill Clinton's
chair had spent $183 million. At this pace, the only people who
will be able to afford to run in, say, 2020 will be Bill Gates,
Donald Trump and maybe Britney Spears, and if that's not an
argument for campaign finance reform, I don't know what is.
</P>
<P>
   My math has never been terribly good, but according to my
calculations, for $250 million we could hire roughly 4,000 people
to serve the next four years as president at the proposed minimum
wage of $6.15 an hour and still have enough left over to hire Jesse
Helms and Hillary Rodham Clinton to flip burgers.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, at those salaries, we wouldn't be able to attract
presidential candidates who possess a great deal of political
know-how, but at least we'd get leaders who are accustomed to
living on a budget.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect the minimum-wage crowd could pass along a few tips to
George W. Bush on managing money.
</P>
<P>
   Is anybody else a little worried what might happen when this
fellow gets his hands in the national till? I mean, he started out
with a whopping $70 million in his campaign account, enough _ many
people thought _ to blow away his competition in the primaries and
the general election. A few months later, he's down to a piddly few
million and is panhandling his illustrious Pioneers for more.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there's Al Gore, who one day last week challenged
Bush to join him in a moratorium on collecting unregulated ``soft
money'' contributions from corporations, rich people and unions.
The following day, his campaign unveiled a program to immediately
raise $35 million in soft money contributions.
</P>
<P>
   If this keeps up, we may all end up milling around Buddhist
temples, shaking down impoverished monks for milk money.
</P>
<P>
   The two candidates who bowed out last week were, of course, the
chief proponents of campaign finance reform in this year's race.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts are attributing John McCain's loss to, among
other things, his characterizing Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell as
rulers of an evil empire. I don't know how much that hurt him, but
I certainly grew weary of him comparing himself to Luke Skywalker
at every available opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, it's said that the Chewbacca of the campaign, Bill
Bradley, faltered in part because he never really opened up
emotionally to voters. A New York Times story last week cited a
moment, early in the campaign, when Bradley failed to hug his
second-grade music teacher at a campaign rally. Criminy, we've had
a slew of leaders lately, notably Bill Clinton and Newt Gingrich,
who wouldn't stop at a hug. Skip the Leo Buscaglia shtick. I'll
take emotional distance.
</P>
<P>
   From here on out, it looks as if we'll be treated to video
footage and photos of candidates hugging voters. Off camera,
they'll be embracing corporate executives, wealthy Americans and
union leaders.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of last year, the candidates had raised $100 million
in soft money contributions. Before it's all over, they're expected
to collect a half a billion _ and that's on top of run-of-the-mill,
$1,000-donations and hefty supplements from federal election funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be the fund-raising equivalent of Sherman's
march through Georgia,'' Fred Wertheimer, president of the watchdog
group Democracy 21, told The New York Times. ``Donors beware _ they
are coming for you and the sky's the limit.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, no chance whatsoever _ wink, wink _ that
the winner will be beholden to the folks who helped buy his entry
into the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Uh-huh. If I were running either campaign, I'd order up a few
million pounds of construction paper emblazoned with the words,
``Special orders don't upset us.''

MANY IN LOS ANGELES SEE MERGER AS YET ANOTHER BLOW TO CIVIC PRIDE 
</HEADLINE>
 (With TRIBUNE-TIMESMIRROR) 
(nk) 
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The mood here in reaction to the sale of The Los
Angeles Times and its parent company to the Tribune Co. may have
been best summed up by Mark Willes, the company's chairman, when he
left the board meeting that approved the transaction late Sunday
evening.
</P>
<P>
   Willes burst into tears and wept openly, according to several
people who saw him.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of the paper and its parent, the Times Mirror Co.,
would make Willes an immensely wealthy man. And it would earn tens
of thousands of dollars, in some instances more, for each of the
reporters, editors and many other employees of the Times Mirror Co.
who hold stock and stock options.
</P>
<P>
   But for many people in this city, both in The Los Angeles Times
newsroom and outside, the deal felt humiliating, they said, like
something precious had been stolen away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a tragedy,'' said Antonio Villaraigosa, the
speaker of the state Assembly and a candidate for mayor of Los
Angeles, who has had his differences with the newspaper. ``Even
when you don't agree with their coverage or their editorials,
they've been a booster to the city, just like the Tribune has been
in Chicago. Will the new owner share that tradition?''
</P>
<P>
   Many people said they believed the Tribune Co., based in
Chicago, would give The Times great autonomy, as promised, and that
the newspaper would remain the most influential publication in
America's second largest city. Yet many also said the sale was a
blow to something intangible but powerful, if badly battered: civic
pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a feeling that yesterday, a part of this city's soul
was The Los Angeles Times,'' said Geoffrey Cowan, dean of the
Annenberg School of Communications at the University of Southern
California. ``I'm not sure how much that is true tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``There is a loss of identity.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly painful was the fact that the sale was one in a
string of events that have left many people here feeling
diminished. In recent years, Los Angeles has lost its professional
football teams. All its major banks have been bought by outsiders.
And nearly all the big corporations have moved or been sold. On the
occasion of the millennium celebrations, every major city in the
world was represented with some spectacular event _ except for
sputtering Los Angeles, which has no Times Square or Eiffel Tower,
or even a geographic center to focus and display civic enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   The mixed responses of the city's largest ethnic community,
Hispanics, was characterized by Linda Griego, a former deputy
mayor. ``There has been a feeling that the paper has not been real
balanced in covering our community, although it has been
improving,'' Griego said. ``It still has a ways to go. But from
what I've seen the Tribune does a good job on these things in
Chicago, so maybe this will bring some positives. Overall, though,
this still feels like an institution that doesn't belong to us
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Within the newsroom, reactions varied. Many people expressed
anger that the Chandler family, which has controlled the company
for decades, had sold the company to an outsider, in spite of
reassurances in recent years that it never would. But some people
expressed relief that the company would now be controlled by
newspaper experts, rather than the marketing people with no
journalism experience, like Willes, that the family had recruited
in an effort to boost the stock price.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chandler family long ago lost interest in running a
newspaper and they're just interested in the profits,'' said Ken
Reich, a columnist who has worked at The Los Angeles Times for 35
years. ``Under the circumstances, selling to the Tribune is better
than selling to Fox or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Reporters and editors in the Times newsroom received memos from
top company officials Monday and were called to meetings to explain
the deal _ although some said many questions, about job cuts,
benefits and the like, went unanswered. Several people said a great
deal of anger was being directed at the Chandler family, which,
according to Willes, sold the company without even informing him
until the discussions were well advanced.
</P>
<P>
   In his memo to employees, Willes pointedly noted that the
transaction had been initiated by the Chandler Trusts, which hold
the family's majority voting interest, and he had said earlier that
he only found out about the deal 10 days ago.
</P>
<P>
   Kathryn Downing, whose term as publisher has been marred by a
bitter dispute over her decision to allow a sports arena to share
in the profits of a section devoted to the arena's opening, is
expected to earn millions of dollars for her brief tenure. But she
appeared to anticipate the criticism in the newsroom by stating in
her memo, ``I feel great sadness at the ending of the Times Mirror
Co. and its great presence in Los Angeles.''

MAINE MULLS MEDICAL USE FOR ITS SEIZED MARIJUANA 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Maine _ Breaking new ground in the national campaign to
legalize the medical use of marijuana, the sheriff of Maine's most
populous county recommended to lawmakers Monday that marijuana
confiscated during drug arrests be doled out to patients.
</P>
<P>
   Such a system, Sheriff Mark N. Dion of Cumberland County told
legislators, would mean that patients would not have to violate
laws against buying marijuana and ``become criminals in order to
survive their illness.''
</P>
<P>
   Dion spoke at a hearing on a bill that highlighted the
increasingly common confusion and contradictions that ensue when a
state passes a referendum approving the use of marijuana for
patients with cancer, AIDS and certain other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, the Hawaii Legislature and voters in eight states have
passed such ballot measures, all in the West except Maine, which
passed its Maine Medical Marijuana Initiative last November by a
vote of 61 percent to 39 percent. The law exempted patients from
state laws against the personal use of marijuana and said they
could grow up to six plants to supply themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But the initiative could not exempt patients from federal laws,
nor could it help those who could not grow plants themselves and
must buy marijuana from suppliers who were, by definition,
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   So Maine, like other states, has found itself facing a knotty
question: voters have said they wanted medical marijuana available,
but how could it be legally distributed?
</P>
<P>
   One answer is the bill examined Monday by the Legislature's
Joint Committee on Health and Human Services, which sets a national
precedent by proposing that the state take a step beyond the
approval of medical marijuana and actually supply it.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would create a system for registering patients whose
doctors had affirmed that they had a condition that might be
alleviated by marijuana, and it would have the Maine Drug
Enforcement Agency provide them with confiscated supplies. Maine's
woods tend to attract marijuana growers, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's sponsor, Sen. Anne Rand, argued that such a system
would help law enforcement officers, who could better distinguish
who was a legitimate possessor of marijuana and who was not, and
might even discourage Mainers from growing more marijuana
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But committee members raised several questions and objections,
including concerns that confiscated marijuana could be contaminated
or laced with harder drugs, and the state would thus find itself in
the position of distributing harmful substances to vulnerable
patients.
</P>
<P>
   They also worried that such a distribution system might incur
the wrath of the federal government, which might then cut off
millions of dollars in grants to Maine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do have a real fear of the feds coming down on us and
mucking up the works,'' Rep. Lois Snowe-Mello said.
</P>
<P>
   Dion said he worried about the federal authorities too, but that
he believed retaliation was unlikely, and, in any case, he added,
``Shall we as a sovereign state be held hostage by the federal
government simply because we intend to treat our sick and
afflicted?''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, supporters of the bill said, other states that have
begun implementing medical marijuana laws have not incurred
retaliatory cuts from federal authorities, though none have the
kind of distribution system Maine is proposing.
</P>
<P>
   As for the possibility of contamination, supporters of the bill
said buyers faced that threat now, and the new arrangement would
not increase it. Sheriff Dion also suggested that the supply for
patients could come from confiscated plants rather than dried
stashes of marijuana, thus assuring that it had not been laced with
any harder drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law is only as complex and out of reach as we make it,''
Dion said. ``This is not really rocket science.''
</P>
<P>
   But legal questions do remain. An assistant attorney general,
James M. Cameron, said his office supported the plan to register
patients, but opposed a distribution system that would ``make
dedicated police officers criminals under federal law.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee is scheduled to discuss the bill further on
Thursday, and could choose to vote then. Rep. Thomas Kane, the
House chairman, said that given the voters' clear will as expressed
in the initiative, ``We can't let it die.''
</P>
<P>
   Dion's support for the bill _ and his earlier support for last
year's medical marijuana initiative _ put him in what he cheerily
called a ``pretty small fraternity,'' with a two or three
California colleagues, of law enforcement officials who publicly
support such a change in drug laws.
</P>
<P>
   But he believes, he said, that being a ``police service
professional'' means more than enforcing the law; it means, too,
that he should ``advocate for social justice when the law fails to
meet the needs of its citizens.''

CHINA AND TAIWAN SIGNED SECRET NUCLEAR WASTE DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also TAIWAN-MARKET) 
(js) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ While they traded verbal hostilities this winter over
Taiwan's political status, Taiwan and mainland China secretly
agreed to pursue a surprising multi-billion dollar deal in which
more than 200,000 drums of radioactive wastes from Taiwan's nuclear
power plants would be disposed of on the mainland in return for
money and technical aid to the mainland's nuclear power industry.
</P>
<P>
   In Hong Kong in mid-January, executives of the government-owned
nuclear power companies of China and Taiwan signed a letter of
intent to explore such a deal, Taiwan officials confirmed Monday.
</P>
<P>
   No contract has been signed, the officials stressed, and the
talks have been on hold during recent weeks of heightened tensions
as Taiwan's March 18 presidential election approaches. But
officials of Taiwan Power Co., known as Taipower, which has
fruitlessly searched for a resting place for its accumulating
mountains of nuclear waste, said they hope talks can resume this
spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope we can eventually arrive at some sort of commercial
arrangement with the mainland,'' said Huang Hui-yu, a spokeswoman
for Taipower, in a telephone interview Monday. ``We have indicated
our willingness to offer certain forms of technical assistance for
their nuclear plants, and they indicated a possible willingness to
help in handling our waste material.''
</P>
<P>
   The secret talks, details of which were leaked over the weekend
in Taiwan, are surprising because China angrily broke off political
dialogue last summer over President Lee Teng-hui's assertions of
Taiwan's independent status. Political and economic officials in
both Taipei and Beijing refused to comment Monday on the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Such a deal would represent a major reversal in Taiwan's
official policy of restraining commercial ties with the mainland _
a possible sign of how desperate officials are to find a solution
to the nuclear waste problem, but possibly also a recognition that,
because of pressure from Taiwanese industries and from China, the
restrictive policy is likely to be eased in the coming year anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The discussions have not been announced in China, and a decision
to allow the import of radioactive waste to the mainland for the
first time seems certain to be controversial. But if the quid pro
quo were an end to Taiwanese policies curbing direct trade and
investment across the straits, Beijing leaders may feel it is worth
the heat. The deal could also be portrayed as a generous act to
help Taiwan, which Beijing considers a breakaway region of China
rather than a foreign country.
</P>
<P>
   In Beijing Monday, officials of China Nuclear Energy Industry
Corp., the negotiating partner, were unavailable for comment.
Taiwanese officials did not say where in China the nuclear waste
might be buried.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed deal involves low-level wastes, such as power-plant
equipment that has become radioactive, and not spent nuclear fuel
rods that could possibly be reprocessed into bomb-grade materials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disposing of it is not an extremely high technical problem,''
Huang of Taipower said. Still, Taiwan has been unable to find
anywhere in its own limited territory to store the waste
permanently.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Deepening its economic ties with the island has been a prime
goal of the Beijing government, which believes this would bind
Taiwan more deeply to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
   The secret discussions were first revealed in Taiwan over the
weekend by Lee Ao, a minor presidential candidate from the New
Party, who apparently hoped to embarrass the government of Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan had first discussed such an exchange with Beijing as
early as 1994, officials have since disclosed, but the talks
stopped when political tensions rose and Lee tried to dampen the
burgeoning cross-straits commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Under Lee, Taiwanese companies must obtain special permission to
make major investments on the mainland and are forbidden from
investing in ``strategic'' projects like electric power plants.
Direct shipment and communications across the strait are not
permitted, though trade going indirectly, as through Hong Kong, has
surged.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan now has some 170,000 barrels of radioactive waste, nearly
100,000 barrels of it on Orchid Island off Taiwan's southeastern
coast, where protesting residents have forced a halt to shipments,
and the rest piling up at the three operating nuclear power plants.
</P>
<P>
   Nuclear power provides one-fifth of Taiwan's electricity.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Taipower announced an agreement to pay North Korea to
take the waste, but after concerns were raised by South Korea, the
United States and environmental groups and the North Koreans became
uncooperative, Taiwan's government decided against it.
</P>
<P>
   Another plan, to build an undersea repository off the Wuchiu
Islands in the Taiwan Strait, has provoked local protests, and
China has reportedly objected to construction of large shipping
facilities that could have military uses so close to its coastline.

 &HT;    Woman says she now fears rapper
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A woman who tangled with rapper Da Brat at a Buckhead
nightclub had nothing to do with a shooting outside the singer's
Buckhead townhouse, her attorney said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``My client was horrified when she heard about this,'' attorney
Jim Lewis said of his client Rezue Robateue. ``She does not condone
this kind of behavior and she was very afraid after she learned
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Police say the shooting may be connected to a fight between
Robateue and rapper Shawntae Harris at the Chili Pepper nightclub
in Buckhead last week. Both women were charged as a result of the
brawl: Harris with battery, Rezue with midsdemeanor simple battery.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said Robateue, a wannabe rapper, once idolized Harris. Now
she fears her, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rezue is lying low right now,'' Lewis said. ``She left town
because she fears she might be a target and because she thinks Da
Brat might be upset with her. She also wants to recover from her
injuries until she appears in court.''
</P>
<P>
   Robateue was hurt last Tuesday night at the Chili Pepper
nightclub when she and Harris brawled, police said. Lewis said
Harris was angered when Robateue was disrespectful to Harris'
female companion, a slight blonde woman.
</P>
<P>
   Harris was accused of striking Robateue across the eye with an
object _ possibly a shot glass or a .22 caliber handgun, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta detectives say the shooting at Harris' apartment complex
Sunday morning may have been in retaliation for the fight at Chili
Pepper. A black limousine was riddled with bullets in the parking
lot just outside Harris' townhouse. The rapper is known to rent
limousines regularly. Investigators have not ruled out that Harris
may have been the intended target of two hit men who somehow drove
into the gated community at the 4100 block of Roswell Road. The
passengers inside the limousine that was hit do not know Harris,
police said Monday, and could be the victims of mistaken identity.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-year-old Robateue is a New York native who moved to
Atlanta five years ago. She lives in the city with relatives and is
an aspiring rapper and musician who frequents the Buckhead
nightclub scene, Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My client is trying to be a musician,'' Lewis said, ``but
she's really more a club patron. I know she is trying to work in
the music industry. She is trying to make a CD.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris' publicist, Tresa Sanders, who also is the publicist for
So So Def Records in Atlanta, the company that discovered Harris,
said she has never heard of Robateue.

 &HT;    Gore back in Florida for rally tonight
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Vice President Al Gore, making second campaign visit to
the Sunshine State in less than two weeks, on Monday once again
pushed his plans for extending health care to poor children,
protecting Medicare, making prescription drugs easier to obtain for
the elderly and passing a patient's bill of rights so medical
decisions are made by patients and doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Heading home to Carthage, Tenn., Gore said he would vote in the
primary there today, have breakfast with his mother, meet with his
staff in Nashville and then come back to Florida for a primary
night rally at high school in Tallahassee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Florida is very much in play,'' said U.S. Sen. Bob Graham,
D-Miami Lakes. ``I think there is a very realistic chance that
Democrats can win this state.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats are suggesting that if Gore wants to all but
guarantee a November victory here, he should choose Graham to be
his running mate. Asked if he is interested in the job, Graham said
only that he is ``happy to serve the people of Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the first time that Graham has been on the list of
possible running mates. In 1992, he was a finalist until Bill
Clinton settled on Gore.

COOL YOUR JETS, NASA, TWO REVIEW PANELS URGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By WARREN E. LEARY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Recent failures in two Mars missions suggest that
NASA is pushing too hard to do more with less money, and
jeopardizing success by paying inadequate attention to risks, two
review panels said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   NASA's recent philosophy of conducting more ``faster, better,
cheaper'' space missions instead of a few large ones appears sound
and should continue to be a part of planning, experts on the panels
said. However, they said, this approach has limits and many
projects need to be more closely managed to assure success.
</P>
<P>
   In its second report to the agency, the review board that
examined the failure of the Mars Climate Orbiter mission last year
said that lessons learned from that mishap and other failures with
the quicker, cheaper approach indicated there may have been too
much emphasis on cutting costs and doing missions quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The success of `faster, better, cheaper' is tempered by the
fact that some projects and programs have put too much emphasis on
cost and schedule reduction,'' said the panel, the Mars Climate
Orbiter Mishap Investigation Board, a group of NASA experts led by
Arthur G. Stephenson, director of the Marshall Space Flight Center
in Alabama. ``At the same time, they have failed to instill
sufficient rigor in risk management throughout the mission life
cycle. These actions have increased risk to an unacceptable level
on these projects.''
</P>
<P>
   This group issued a report last November that said the Climate
Orbiter perished when it flew too close to Mars on Sept. 23 because
the spacecraft contractor and NASA engineers had failed to catch
errors in converting from English to metric measurements. After the
initial report, in which the panel blamed poor communications and
teamwork for the failure, the group was charged to look at similar
projects to see if the same problems existed.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate report, also released Monday, Tony Spear, a
retired NASA project manager who supervised one of the greatest
successes of the new approach, called for training better, more
experienced managers who are willing to say when a mission cannot
be done properly under certain schedule and cost restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Spear, who managed 1997's Mars Pathfinder mission, which put a
rock-sniffing rover named Sojourner on the planet's surface, said
early faster, better, cheaper missions had a realistic scope for
the schedule and money they had to work with. Now, he said,
planners are trying to do too much by mounting unusually
challenging missions within arbitrary schedule and cost caps.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge bar was raised too high for some of the
second-generation missions,'' he wrote in his report. ``The cost
cap challenges were made too great, along with a mix of unstable
funding and escalating requirements.''
</P>
<P>
   Spear said he had interviewed hundreds of people inside and
outside NASA, and no one felt the space agency should retreat from
the faster, better, cheaper approach if it was to remain viable.
NASA should slow the planning and implementation of these smaller
projects, he said, and install ``better reality checks'' on the
feasibility of doing certain missions with the money allowed.
</P>
<P>
   In a few years, NASA has moved from having a few missions to
other planets and other solar systems to having many in various
stages of planning and operation, Spear said. This has diluted
management attention across many missions and not allowed time to
develop experienced project managers, engineers and others with
expertise, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Climate Orbiter investigations board recommended that NASA
adopt a new component to the faster, better, cheaper paradigm
called ``Mission Success First.'' Under this approach, the costs
and requirements of mission success should be studied independently
of other factors, and NASA should consider not financing or
canceling projects that are inadequately financed to overcome risks
to success, it said.
</P>
<P>
   Projects should not only pay more attention to risk assessment,
it said, but also be better designed to provide engineering data to
understand mission failures so subsequent missions do not repeat
them. The Mars Polar Lander, for example, disappeared without a
trace last Dec. 3 as it was beginning its computer-controlled
descent, and engineers still have no clue as to what went wrong.

 &HT;    Parties say primary system needs overhaul
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   They are among the least-populated states in the nation, yet
once again Iowa and New Hampshire have had more to say about the
next president than every state in the South except South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Florida Republicans and Democrats agree on little, but as voters
go to the polls today for a largely ceremonial presidential vote,
leaders of both parties say the nation's primary system must
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this serves the interests of the nation well,''
says U.S. Sen. Bob Graham, D-Miami. ``Too few voters have a voice
and it has happened so fast that I don't think voters have enough
time to get to know and evaluate the candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   As governor from 1979 to 1987, Graham tried to change the
system. He worked with other Southern governors to form the
original Super Tuesday. The idea was for a southern regional
primary on the second Tuesday of March that would force the
candidates to spend a lot time here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had hoped that it would spark a national movement toward
regional primaries,'' said Graham. ``But the desire of states to
get in as early in the process as possible has overwhelmed that.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's primary lineup became a free-for-all with states
battling for position up until the last moment. No one fights
harder to be first than New Hampshire, which has a state law that
requires its primary to be seven days before any other primary.
</P>
<P>
   Many states resent it and a few always try to get in front of
New Hampshire, but then always back down. Graham says improving the
primary system is so important that he would just go ahead and let
Iowa and New Hampshire remain alone and then go into a series of
regional primaries that are from two to four weeks apart.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee is looking to make a change at
this year's convention. Al Cardenas, a member of the committee and
chairman of the Florida GOP, said there is a move to divide the
nation into five, 10-state primaries. There would be a primary a
month for five months. The key to this plan is that the states
would be divided by population with the 10 smallest states going
first and the 10 largest states going last.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not part of the decision-making process and that needs
to be changed,'' said Cardenas. ``I think there is an understanding
even in Iowa and New Hampshire that we can't continue to leave the
majority of the voters out of the decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the National Association of Secretaries of State
approved a plan that would create four regional primaries _ East,
South, Midwest and West. The first would be in March, the last in
June. The Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary would remain in
February. Every four years the regional primaries would be rotated
so that each region would have a chance to go first.
</P>
<P>
   If some system agreeable to everyone isn't approved by the
political parties and state legislatures, the primary system is
only going to get worse, says Cardenas.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Florida lawmakers are working on a bill that would move
the Sunshine State's primary to the last Tuesday in January _
making it before New Hampshire.

MACK ROBINSON, 85, SECOND TO OWENS AT BERLIN OLYMPICS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mack Robinson, who was a silver medalist in the 1936 Berlin
Olympics but would be overshadowed by the track great Jesse Owens
and by his younger brother, the pioneering baseball Hall of Famer
Jackie Robinson, died Sunday at a hospital in Pasadena, Calif. He
was 85.
</P>
<P>
   He was one of America's best sprinters of the 1930s, but Matthew
Mack Robinson hardly seemed destined for athletic feats.
</P>
<P>
   While Robinson was in high school in Pasadena, wrote David
Wallechinsky, the Olympic historian, ``coaches did not consider him
athletic material and made his mother sign a statement absolving
them of blame if his heart was damaged.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when he showed formidable talents while in junior college,
it seemed that Robinson would not even make it to the trials for
the 1936 U.S. Olympic track team.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one paid an athlete's way in those days,'' Robinson once
recalled. ``The trials were in New York, and Pasadena Junior
College didn't have any money to send me. And I didn't have a dime
to make a trip like that on my own.''
</P>
<P>
   He got there because Pasadena businessmen raised $150 each for
him and a teammate.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson qualified for the Olympic team and, in Berlin, he ran
second in the 200 meters to Owens, finishing in 21.1 seconds as
Owens ran an Olympic-record 20.7 seconds for one of his four gold
medals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesse got the coaching, I didn't,'' he said long afterward.
``I saw his television program, about his return to Berlin. He said
that he and the coaches had studied the styles of every runner.
That was true. They studied me, too.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Olympics, Robinson ran in the same spikes he wore all
season in junior college.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not too bad to be second best in the world at what you're
doing, no matter what it is,'' he said of his Olympic silver medal.
``It means that only one other person in the world was better than
you. That makes you better than an awful lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Robinson returned to Pasadena after the Olympics, he
felt unappreciated.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anybody in Pasadena was proud for me, other than my family
and close friends,'' he said, ``they never showed it. I was totally
ignored. The only time I was noticed when somebody asked me during
an assembly at school if I'd race against a horse.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1937, he set a national junior-college record of 25 feet 5{
inches in the long jump (later broken by his brother Jackie) and he
won national collegiate and Amateur Athletic Union track titles at
the University of Oregon in 1938.
</P>
<P>
   He quit Oregon in his senior year to return home and support his
family. Back in Pasadena, wearing his Olympic sweatshirt with a big
USA on the front, he pushed a broom sweeping downtown streets.
</P>
<P>
   But when a judge ordered public pools in Pasadena opened to
blacks, the city retaliated by firing all black workers, including
Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   He later worked in a variety of jobs for the city of Pasadena
and did volunteer work with youth organizations.
</P>
<P>
   He was not forgotten. In the opening ceremony of the 1984
Olympics, the giant Olympic flag was carried into the Los Angeles
Memorial Coliseum by six gold medal winners, the grandson of one
(Bill Thorpe Jr., grandson of Jim Thorpe) and Mack Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   His affection for Jackie Robinson, his younger brother by four
years, was strong, and he felt that not enough has been done to
preserve the memory of Jackie, who broke the major leagues' color
barrier in 1947 with the Brooklyn Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no one more competitive than Jackie,'' he said. ``No
one could tell him he couldn't do something he wanted to do. No man
was more appropriate for the tough assignment he received.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also felt that his identity had been lost because of
Jackie's achievements. ``I am getting awfully tired of being
referred to just as Jackie Robinson's brother,'' he once said.
</P>
<P>
   But the brothers, natives of Cairo, Ga., were honored together
by their adopted hometown when the Pasadena Robinson Memorial was
dedicated in 1997 in Centennial Plaza, across from City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Mack Robinson is survived by his wife, Delano, and their three
sons and three daughters; a son and a daughter from previous
marriages; 25 grandchildren and 8 great-grandchildren. &QL;

   AUGUSTA, Maine _ Breaking new ground in the national campaign to
legalize the medical use of marijuana, the sheriff of Maine's most
populous county recommended to lawmakers Monday that marijuana
confiscated during drug arrests be doled out to patients.
</P>
<P>
   Such a system, Sheriff Mark N. Dion of Cumberland County told
legislators, would mean that patients would not have to violate
laws against buying marijuana and ``become criminals in order to
survive their illness.''
</P>
<P>
   Dion spoke at a hearing on a bill that highlighted the
increasingly common confusion and contradictions that ensue when a
state passes a referendum approving the use of marijuana for
patients with cancer, AIDS and certain other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, the Hawaii Legislature and voters in eight states have
passed such ballot measures, all in the West except Maine, which
passed its Maine Medical Marijuana Initiative last November by a
vote of 61 percent to 39 percent. The law exempted patients from
state laws against the personal use of marijuana and said they
could grow up to six plants to supply themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But the initiative could not exempt patients from federal laws,
nor could it help those who could not grow plants themselves and
must buy marijuana from suppliers who were, by definition,
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   So Maine, like other states, has found itself facing a knotty
question: voters have said they wanted medical marijuana available,
but how could it be legally distributed?
</P>
<P>
   One answer is the bill examined Monday by the Legislature's
Joint Committee on Health and Human Services, which sets a national
precedent by proposing that the state take a step beyond the
approval of medical marijuana and actually supply it.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would create a system for registering patients whose
doctors had affirmed that they had a condition that might be
alleviated by marijuana, and it would have the Maine Drug
Enforcement Agency provide them with confiscated supplies. Maine's
woods tend to attract marijuana growers, officials say.

   PENSACOLA, Fla. _ When Gov. Jeb Bush initiated the nation's
boldest voucher experiment last year, it was clear that its fate
would depend on two things: the progress of the students using
taxpayer money for private-school tuition, and the impact on the
struggling schools they left behind.
</P>
<P>
   In their Roman Catholic school plaids and pleats, the voucher
children stand as symbols of the program's promise: One
fourth-grade boy has finally learned to read, and a third-grader is
mastering cursive writing; their parents consider the vouchers a
blessing.
</P>
<P>
   But in the debate roiling American cities over whether vouchers
are the greatest threat to public schools or the best hope to solve
the problems that plague them, the more vexing issues arise at two
elementary schools here in an impoverished corner of the Florida
Panhandle.
</P>
<P>
   Florida is the first state to grant vouchers to students whose
schools fail standardized tests and it will probably soon have the
nation's largest program. It is the model for a national program
proposed by Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the likely Republican
presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   The two schools here, A.A. Dixon and Spencer Bibbs, were the
first in the state to lose students to vouchers when the law took
effect last summer because so many of their pupils performed so
poorly on the tests two years running. While it may take several
years to gauge the program's success, its impact is already
apparent at the two schools, nestled in two of the state's poorest
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   With grants from the district and the state, the schools have
hired more teachers, reducing class size, stretched the school year
by 30 days and added afternoon tutoring.
</P>
<P>
   They have also shriveled the curriculum, stressing subjects that
will help students improve test scores, while shunning science and
social studies _ subjects not covered by the tests. Instead, they
are drilling children on reading, writing, math and, inevitably,
test-taking tips. Field trips have disappeared, replaced by events
like a recent Saturday ``test-taking fair.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're leaving out important parts of the education process,''
lamented Dixon's principal, Judith O. Ladner. ``They're going to
learn what's on a test. But are they going to learn to be able to
cooperate with each other in the business world? Are they going to
be creative thinkers?''
</P>
<P>
   At its core, the question over vouchers is whether a
market-based approach, embraced in so many sectors today, is
appropriate for education. The notion of rating schools based on
the standardized test scores of students is sweeping the nation as
nearly every state strives to hold teachers and principals more
accountable. But beyond providing an escape for children trapped in
failing schools, vouchers may be shifting the student-teacher
relationship in ways that some find troubling.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a low-performing child walks into a classroom,'' said Jim
May, superintendent here in Escambia County, ``instead of being
seen as a challenge, or an opportunity for improvement, for the
first time since I've been in education, teachers are seeing them
as a liability.''
</P>
<P>
   First proposed by the free-marketeer Milton Friedman in 1955,
vouchers have exploded from a pilot program of 300 students in
Milwaukee in 1990, to 63,840 children in 31 states today, most from
low-income families who enter a lottery. That includes 11,538
students, chiefly in Cleveland and Milwaukee, using public money to
attend private schools, and about 70 small programs throughout the
country that are less controversial because they are financed by
philanthropists.
</P>
<P>
   Florida has only 53 students using vouchers for private schools
and another 85 who transferred to higher-performing public ones.
</P>
<P>
   But school grades being released in June could expand the
program to as many as 60,000 students in 78 schools; those schools
received `F's' last year because of poor performances on the
Florida Comprehensive Assessment Tests and their students will be
eligible for vouchers if they are rated `F' a second time.
</P>
<P>
   Though they still touch only a tiny fraction of the nation's 52
million schoolchildren, vouchers are among the most contentious
issues today in cities including New York, and form a key point of
dissension between Bush, the governor of Texas, and Vice President
Al Gore, his expected Democratic opponent.
</P>
<P>
   More than 25 state legislatures are considering voucher plans _
many, like Florida's, linked to standardized test performance _
while constitutional challenges to programs here and in Cleveland
are expected to land before the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The philosophical gap is wide: Opponents fear vouchers will
drain resources from troubled schools, leaving them worse off for
the students who stay. Advocates say that vouchers give poor
children opportunities akin to the affluent and will make weak
schools improve in order to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Research so far has been murky, as partisans pick apart each
others' studies, challenging the results and the methods.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, experts believe that students using vouchers to attend
private schools score slightly higher on math and reading tests
than the students who remain in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   But ``the great question that nobody can really answer,'' said
John F. Witte, a University of Wisconsin political scientist who
has published a book on the Milwaukee voucher program, is, ``Does
it create competition and does it create change?''
</P>
<P>
   Things are certainly different this year at Bibbs and Dixon,
schools where nearly all the students are black and poor enough to
qualify for federal free breakfast and lunch programs.
</P>
<P>
   Hallways at Bibbs are lined with posters of sample answer sheets
for the Florida assessment test, and efforts to redefine the
dreaded ``F'' label: ``We are Fueled, Focused and Fighting.'' At
Dixon, there is a trophy case of prizes _Pokemon toys, a Sony
Playstation, a color television _ for those who score best on the
tests.
</P>
<P>
   Inside every classroom, the mission is clear.
</P>
<P>
   In Vickie Ward's fifth grade, there was an orange FCAT math
workbook on every desk as Ward drilled the students on writing
multidigit numbers in standard form _ numerals _ and word form.
Fifth-grade math scores count toward the school grade.
</P>
<P>
   Rosa Dean's fourth-graders were practicing an FCAT reading
comprehension exercise; their reading scores help determine the
school's rating.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do the process of elimination,'' advises Dean, sounding
like the high-priced test-preparation gurus who coach teenagers for
the College Boards. ``You have four choices; try to get it down to
two choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers at Bibbs and Dixon, and the parents who spurned the
vouchers, blame the F's largely on demographics: Many of their
families are headed by single mothers or grandmothers on welfare
with little education; kindergarteners arrive never having picked
up a book, not knowing the alphabet, in some cases still in
diapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a bicycle, and the man next door has a Cadillac,'' said
Georgia Smith, a kindergarten teacher at Bibbs. ``If you're going
to compare the distance I can travel with the man who has a
Cadillac, well, let me swap vehicles with that man, and then see
how far I can travel.''

 PENSACOLA, Fla.: can travel.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Indeed, across Florida, no school where less than 10 percent of
the students qualify for free lunch scored below a C, and no school
where more than 80 percent of the students qualify scored above a
C.
</P>
<P>
   Many Florida educators want the school grades to take account of
socioeconomics, or focus on a school's improvement from year to
year, rather than judging all schools on the same criteria.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Gallagher, the state's education commissioner and the
architect of the school-grading plan along with the governor, said
improvement will help dictate school grades as soon as the
assessment tests are old enough to track annual progress. But ``our
expectations are the same for a first-grader in Coral Gables as it
is for Bibbs or Dixon,'' he insisted. As for whether test
preparation has squeezed out enrichment programs and even basics
like science, Gallagher is not worried: Nobody can pass the test,
he noted, without reading its directions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't operate in our society if you can't read, write and
do math,'' he said. ``You can operate in our society if you haven't
been on a field trip, if you haven't had any art this year, if you
haven't been to gym, and if you haven't had any science.''
</P>
<P>
   Though parochial students do not take the FCAT, those using
vouchers must. But there is no sign of the test _ no posters in the
hallways, no mention of multiple-choice bubble techniques _ at
Little Flower, one of the five private schools, four of them
Catholic, where former Bibbs and Dixon students have enrolled.
</P>
<P>
   In classrooms arrayed around a central courtyard with a
fountain, fifth- graders are writing persuasive letters, while
first-graders put on a puppet show. In the computer laboratory,
students are compiling databases of the books they have read.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, it was nothing but work sheets,'' said Patricia
White, whose daughter, Katrina English, took a voucher. ``Now,
homework every night, books, essays to write. We just finished a
report with poster board and such _ we didn't even leave the house
last Saturday!''
</P>
<P>
   The voucher students stick out on the playground, a few black
faces in a sea of white, and students at Little Flower see the
program as an opportunity to make friends who listen to different
music. The teachers say they have tweaked the curriculum _ cutting
spelling tests from 20 to 10 words a week for one boy _but that the
acculturation process was little different than with other
public-school transfers.
</P>
<P>
   Many voucher families had always wanted to send their children
to religious school but could not afford it; some were just fed up
with what they saw as behavior problems and low expectations at
Bibbs and Dixon.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Cameron, whose son, Ray, is repeating fourth grade this
year at St. Michael's, called Dixon ``a giant sewer'' where ``the
academic atmosphere is nonexistent.''
</P>
<P>
   White said she volunteered in Katrina's class every day last
year, and saw third-graders still struggling to identify letters;
even if vouchers are ruled illegal, she will keep Katrina in
Catholic school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got cable, it'll go,'' White said. ``The telephone? That's a
luxury. I will get a night job. I'll do what I have to do. She's
getting a better education.''
</P>
<P>
   In this very enthusiasm over the children's progress lies a
potential pitfall.
</P>
<P>
   Whether vouchers are targeted by income, as in Milwaukee or
Cleveland, or by school performance, as here in Florida, they are
typically seized by families with relatively more money and better
educational backgrounds; the most disenfranchised of the
disadvantaged groups stay behind, only making the educational
challenge steeper.
</P>
<P>
   As Bibbs and Dixon struggle to get off the ``F'' list,
principals and teachers are working overtime, and children are
focused as they study in small groups, aided by a huge influx of
volunteers serving as mentors.
</P>
<P>
   Evaluating their effectiveness is tricky. In the writing
laboratory at Bibbs, fourth-graders cheerily chant a rhyme about
adverbs; but they cannot name any. They enthusiastically sing a
song diagramming sentences, but when asked to define a
``predicate,'' one of the items they have just identified, the
children are at a loss.
</P>
<P>
   In Dixon's corridor, a simple sign suggests the complexity of
the challenge: ``Teach half as much, twice as well.''

 &HT;    `Old media' companies merge, blending newspaper, broadcast
assets
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ First we had the blockbuster marriage made in new
media heaven, with America Online asking the hand of Time Warner.
On Monday, in a realignment of old media, Tribune Co. of Chicago
agreed to a $6.38 billion merger with Times Mirror Co., the biggest
newspaper deal in years.
</P>
<P>
   The deal brings together a host of broadcast stations, including
WATL in Atlanta, and the Chicago Cubs. The deal creates the third
largest newspaper company in the United States, ending 100 years of
independence by the Los Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
   If successful, the merged company would have its headquarters in
Chicago, headed by John Madigan, chairman of the Tribune Co.
</P>
<P>
   While the proposed merger sent a buzz through the media
community, Wall Street was not won immediately, with Tribune stock
plunging.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the transaction, shareholders of Los
Angeles-based Times Mirror would have a choice of taking $95 per
share from Tribune Co. or exchanging each of their Times Mirror
shares for 2.5 shares of Tribune stock.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative merger, though small by comparison, comes on the
heels of the massive, pending $163-billion merger of American
Online and Times Warner, and is another apparent step in the
consolidation and realignment of media.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been some troubling developments in the newspaper
business in recent weeks,'' said Jay Smith, president of Cox
Newspapers, parent of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and other
newspapers. ``But I see as positive the move by Tribune Co., a very
smart media company, to invest in publishing through its purchase
of Times Mirror.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said that diversified media organizations like Cox
Enterprises are, in effect, a model for long-term growth, bridging
the ``old media'' of newspapers as primary news gatherers, and the
``new media'' distribution of information over the air, through
cables and on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Along with its newspaper division, Cox Enterprises owns cable
television systems and high speed data delivery; radio and
television stations; and a growing interactive media service.
</P>
<P>
   Though players in the same business, Tribune Media and Times
Mirror differ in many ways.
</P>
<P>
   The Tribune firm owns the venerable Chicago Tribune,
Sun-Sentinel of South Florida, Orlando Sentinel and Daily Press of
Hampton Road, Va. It will bolster its print reach through by Times
Mirror holdings that include the Los Angeles Times, Newsday of Long
Island, the Sun of Baltimore and Hartford Courant _ each dominant
in their primary markets.
</P>
<P>
   The Tribune also owns the Chicago Cubs and 22 television
stations, which could present some regulatory difficulty. Companies
are usually restricted from owning print media and broadcast
stations in the same markets. However, federal law provides that
conflicting properties are not required to be disposed for a year
or until broadcast licenses expire.
</P>
<P>
   The Tribune television stations cover many major markets,
including Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Boston,
Houston, Seattle, Denver and San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its stable of major newspapers, Times Mirror also
publishes a wide array of magazines including Field &AMP; Stream,
Popular Science, Golf Magazine, Yachting, Skiing and others.
</P>
<P>
   The Chandler family has withdrawn from direct daily control of
the Los Angeles Times operation, with control going to Chairman
Mark Willes since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The Willes regime has increased the profitability of the
newspaper handsomely, but has stirred newsroom and industry debate
with its strategy of breaking down barriers between the news
operation and the business and advertising side.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters and editors have acted with suspicion at the blocks
that traditionally have prevented advertisers from trying to
influence news coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The new era of cooperation was dealt a blow recently when it was
disclosed that the newspaper privately entered a revenue sharing
agreement with the new Staple entertainment center. The disclosure
damaged the newspaper's credibility and drew criticism from the
Chandler family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am encouraged by aspects of the proposed merger,'' said
James Naughton, president of the Poynter Institute, a newspaper
training and think tank in St. Petersburg, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was concerned at the sale of all its domestic
newspapers by Thomson Newspapers and a sell-off of some small
papers by others, which he saw as possible evidence of sliding
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the Tribune Company has acted positively by extending its
reach through the merger and creating better synergy between its
assets and the new print outlets.''

CLINTON SAYS HE WILL ACCEPT GERMAN CANDIDATE FOR IMF POST 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER and JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Monday told Germany's
chancellor that he would accept Horst Koehler as the new head of
the International Monetary Fund, ending a heated diplomatic contest
over who would lead the institution that battles global financial
crises.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's apparently reluctant support virtually assures that
Koehler, a former German finance official who is now president of
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, will win the
top post at the fund.
</P>
<P>
   But the huge rift that opened during the selection process _
during which Clinton refused to support Germany's first nominee and
developing nations attempted to install their own candidate _
leaves open many questions about how the much-criticized
institution will change, and the tradition-bound method by which
its leaders are chosen.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews on Monday, senior administration officials who had
been far from enthusiastic about Koehler last week were beginning
to tout his strengths, describing him as ``an important player'' in
the economic unification of Germany and in the creation of the
European Monetary Union.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few weeks ago his name was not even on the short list of
finance ministers, central bankers and European politicians judged
by the U.S. Treasury and European officials to have the political
influence and judgment for the job.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's approval seemed driven more by a sense that Clinton
could not turn down a second German candidate, and one endorsed
directly by the German chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
   Just two weeks ago Clinton rejected the selection of Caio
Koch-Weser, Germany's deputy finance minister. That led one of
Schroeder's top advisers, Michael Steiner, to complain that the
United States ``sees its global role not only in the military area
but also in setting the rules of globalization through the IMF.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, Germany won its struggle. Clinton and Treasury
Secretary Lawrence H. Summers concluded that they could not violate
the 50 year-old, unwritten rule that allows Europe to fill the IMF
post, while the United States appoints the head of the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said Clinton had spoken
to Schroeder on Monday afternoon from Cleveland, where he was
speaking to promote his plan for expanded prescription drug
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president told Chancellor Schroeder that the United States
was prepared to support Mr. Koehler as the new head of the IMF,''
Lockhart said. ``The president and Schroeder agreed that Mr.
Koehler should come to Washington to meet with the IMF board,
particularly with the developing countries,'' Lockhart said. They
also agreed that Koehler ``should retain the talented management
team at the IMF.''
</P>
<P>
   That was thinly-veiled code to suggest that Stanley Fischer, the
No. 2 official of the fund and the man promoted by African and
Middle Eastern nations for the top job, should remain in place.
Fischer, formerly chairman of the economics department at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was the IMF architect of the
bailout of Asia during the economic crisis that began in the summer
of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's decision came only hours after all 15 nations within
the European Union on Monday endorsed Germany's new candidate.

   As the administration has learned repeatedly in the past five
years _ first when the Mexican peso collapsed, then when Asia's
tigers, Russia and Brazil saw their economies implode in quick
succession _ the United States has a huge stake in who heads the
IMF.
</P>
<P>
   In return for providing emergency funds and arranging bailouts,
the fund can command huge changes in a country's economic policies.
Sometimes it is heeded, as it was in the case of Thailand and South
Korea, two of its biggest success stories. Sometimes its
prescriptions touch off riots and political instability; it was
widely criticized for hurting Indonesia's poor while saving the
banks that lent the country money. Without question, the IMF's
prescriptions in Indonesia sped the departure of its longtime
dictator, President Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, however, the fund has met considerable political
resistance and little success. It has repeatedly delayed disbursing
funds until Moscow fulfilled its economic commitments. And Koehler
will find himself maneuvering with Russia's acting president,
Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   That will be an important test because Koehler's current
institution, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development,
watched loan after loan to Russia go bad, and often found itself at
the losing end of negotiations with Russian authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Koehler presided over a large-scale write-off of Russian loans
in 1998 that led to the bank's first-ever yearly loss. But it has
since returned to profitability, and Koehler has sought to refocus
the bank of small-business loans and smaller scale development
projects since then.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Clinton clearly endorsed him before hearing his
views on the IMF's future. In the conversation with Schroeder, one
official said, ``the president said we need to engage about what
his vision will be. And Schroeder said `We'll do it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Koehler, 57, never topped the list of European candidates to
head the IMF. When Michel Camdessus announced his retirement last
fall, Koehler's name was among those briefly floated among European
officials. But Germany decided to push Koch-Weser. One reason was
almost certainly domestic politics: Koch-Weser was chosen
personally by Schroeder to serve as the No. 2 official in the
finance ministry, while Koehler held the same job under Helmut
Kohl, the long-time German chancellor whom Schroeder defeated.
</P>
<P>
   Koehler comes closer to meeting the litmus test the Treasury
Department set for any new IMF director. He has a higher political
stature than Koch-Weser, Clinton administration officials said. He
was the financial point man during the unification of East and West
Germany, overseeing West Germany's program to quickly integrate the
East by unifying the currency on terms favorable to the East and
channeling tens of billion dollars in development aid to help
development in the Eastern half of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Koehler was also the top international official in the German
finance ministry when European countries agreed on the terms of
monetary union in 1992. That showed he had much more experience
than Koch-Weser dealing with currency matters _ a crucial part of
the IMF's duties. Koch-Weser focused almost exclusively in internal
management and poverty relief programs during his 25 years at the
World Bank.

WHITE HOUSE AND CLINTON'S CRITICS FEUD OVER LOST E-MAIL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration and some of its
Republican critics are quarreling over misdirected White House
e-mail messages that were not produced when they were subpoenaed in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy began, congressional investigators believe, when
someone deep inside the White House held down the shift key too
long.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of that simple keystroke error that mislabeled an
e-mail server as ``MAIL2'' instead of ``Mail2,'' two years' worth
of e-mail messages that had been sent to top officials in the White
House from the outside were not properly stored in the
administration's mainframe computer. Even critics of President
Clinton call it ``inadvertent human error.''
</P>
<P>
   But even though it began as an innocent mistake, the glitch took
five months to fix. That meant that when administration officials
sought to dig up that e-mail in 1998 to comply with a variety of
subpoenas, the computer search missed potentially relevant
documents dealing with campaign fund-raising abuses, the Monica
Lewinsky affair and other matters.
</P>
<P>
   Was the e-mail incriminating messages with implications for
central figures in those scandals, or was it just idle thoughts or
random observations from outsiders irrelevant to the matters at
hand? That remains unclear.
</P>
<P>
   But computer specialists who helped set up the White House
computer system say administration officials were slow to fix the
problem. They believe that many of the e-mail messages still exist,
caught up in an electronic limbo. Because of that, the computer
error has surfaced as the latest dispute between the administration
and its fiercest critics, who have been playing cat and mouse for
years over White House records.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., issued a subpoena last week to
determine whether White House officials knew about the computer
problem while he and others were seeking administration e-mail as
part of their investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only conclude that you are personally content with what
is, in effect, a purposeful effort to keep documents from Congress,
the Department of Justice and various independent counsels,''
Burton, chairman of the House Government Reform and Oversight
Committee, wrote last week to Beth Nolan, the White House counsel.
``While it may serve a variety of political interests to do
nothing, it does not serve the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House has confirmed that there was a problem with the
computers but vehemently denies that it intentionally withheld
information from investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Burton has a long history of making partisan allegations that
don't survive the test of time or the facts,'' said a White House
spokesman, Jim Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Making the matter worse are allegations lodged by
Northrop-Grumman employees who were hired by the administration as
consultants to work on the computer system. They say that they
brought the problem to the attention of White House employees in
June 1998, but the problem was not fixed until that November. They
said they were sternly instructed to keep the matter to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Crabtree, the White House's customer-support branch chief,
warned that if they told anyone there would be a jail cell with
their names on it, according to the accounts of three contract
employees. Crabtree, who now works at the Labor Department, did not
return calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Lambuth, one of the contractors, said in papers filed last
week in Federal District Court that she and other contractors used
to meet in a park near the White House and in a nearby Starbucks to
discuss the e-mail matter away from their supervisors. She became
convinced, she said, that the White House took its time in fixing
the problem to keep damaging e-mail under wraps.
</P>
<P>
   Lambuth's sworn statement was part of a lawsuit filed against
the White House by Judicial Watch, a conservative legal
organization that has been strongly critical of Clinton. The suit
concerns the mishandling of FBI files by the Clinton White House.
</P>
<P>
   Concerning the missing e-mail, Lambuth said that one contractor
who inspected some of the communications said they contained
information concerning a variety of Clinton administration
controversies, including the Lewinsky matter and Vice President Al
Gore's involvement in campaign fund-raising activities.
</P>
<P>
   Sheryl L. Hall, a former White House employee who has filed suit
against the White House on another matter, said in court papers
that the number of missing e-mail messages probably exceeded
100,000 and included missives sent to Clinton, Hillary Rodham
Clinton and hundreds of top aides. Hall, who oversaw the computer
contractors, said one person who viewed the e-mail described some
of the messages as ``incriminating.''
</P>
<P>
   She has not named the worker who made that claim. It remains
unclear whether the e-mail messages were comments from members of
the public on news of the day or private communications between
government bureaucrats outside the White House and presidential
aides.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Klayman, who heads Judicial Watch and believes the worst,
called on Robert W. Ray, who took over from Kenneth W. Starr as the
independent counsel investigating the Clinton White House, to delay
issuing any reports until he determined whether he had all the
missing e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Ray's office has acknowledged it is aware of the e-mail dispute
but has given no signs that the matter will slow his investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we are looking into the allegations regarding the
e-mails and we're taking steps to deal with the allegations,'' said
Julie Thomas, associate independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department lawyer, James Gilligan, who appeared in
court last week on behalf of the White House, said in documents
that the administration had not retaliated against any workers or
covered anything up.
</P>
<P>
   He filed papers that called the e-mail matter, which was first
reported in The Washington Times, ``another distraction'' and
another example of Judicial Watch ``chasing the morning
headlines.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The announcement Monday that the Tribune Co. was
acquiring the Times Mirror Co. elicited this response from Esther
H. Dyson, the high-technology pundit: ``So one newspaper buys
another: so what?''
</P>
<P>
   For Dyson, a seer of the new economy, the merger amounted to a
marriage between survivors of a fading world. The parent company of
the Chicago Tribune, which resides in a stately but fortress-like
Gothic tower, is tying the knot with the parent company of the Los
Angeles Times and Newsday, which has been run by a former General
Mills executive, Mark H. Willes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet here in Chicago, the Tribune Co. has been quietly
transforming itself in recent years into what its executives say is
a new media company that funnels old media content into television,
cable, radio and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Before the deal, the Tribune Co. had 22 television stations,
reaching more than a third of U.S. households. There were four
radio stations, an entertainment unit, a venture capital arm, and
an educational publishing unit.
</P>
<P>
   The company was an early investor in America Online and Yahoo,
and owns a 25 percent stake in the WB television network and a 29
percent stake in cable television's Food Network.
</P>
<P>
   Acquiring Times Mirror would add three of the nation's best
known newspapers to that portfolio: Newsday in New York, The Los
Angeles Times and the Baltimore Sun. The Tribune Co.'s
coast-to-coast empire would include a newspaper and television
station in three of the nation's largest markets: New York, Chicago
and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our new company will be the best positioned local market media
company for the future,'' said John W. Madigan, Tribune chairman,
president and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Tribune shares dropped on news of a deal, but the company has
been a winner on Wall Street in recent years, largely because it is
trying to meet the convergence of old media and new media head on,
even if not everyone is noticing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very smart guys up there in Tribune Tower,'' said
Robert A. Davis, a former assistant metro editor at the Chicago
Tribune. ``They look like ram-rod flannel wearing suits, and they
are, but they're smart. There's a long reputation of conservatism,
but these guys are out there rocking 'n' rolling.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal, however, took many here by surprise, even those within
the Tribune organization. The company had been betting heavily on
television and Internet properties, and now, a decade after selling
the New York Daily News, it was buying up huge newspaper properties
in some of the nation's biggest markets.
</P>
<P>
   Tribune executives say the merger fits into their larger scheme,
which is to leverage old media newspapers, with their prized
content, into new media television, cable and internet outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Top executives say that the new company, which will be called
the Tribune Co., will have the clout to sell advertising nationally
for its regional newspapers, television stations and its Internet
outlets. The company would also create cross-marketing agreements
among its properties, and find synergies in a world-class news
gathering force.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more I think about it the more this furthers the path they
began around 1989 to control as much content as humanly possible,''
said Jeff Borden, a reporter at Crain's Chicago Business who has
covered the Tribune company for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   The new media format that the Tribune Co. is championing,
however, is also raising some concerns among journalists who worry
that the quality of newspapers will suffer in a world driven by
profits and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   The Tribune has a reputation not only for being a fierce
cost-cutter and union buster, but for putting greater and greater
emphasis on entertainment and business.
</P>
<P>
   Some reporters and editors in Chicago have complained about the
company's drive to merge its newspaper, television and Internet
properties into one giant media conglomerate where television
reporters share office space with newspaper reporters, story ideas
are shared among once competing papers and bureaus are
consolidated.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the Tribune Media Center houses reporters and
editors from the Chicago Tribune, the Orlando Sentinel and several
television stations; in the Tribune newsroom, CLTV, a local cable
station owned by the company, has set up shop to interview
reporters live.
</P>
<P>
   Others say the Tribune Co. is remaking itself into an
entertainment company. The Tribune's entertainment arm used to
produce Geraldo Rivera's daytime talk show, and these days,
reporters at the Chicago Tribune often joke about how ``Buffy the
Vampire Slayer,'' the popular WB television show that runs on many
of the Tribune stations, fattens their paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in a conference call with reporters, Tribune executives
talked about how their new enterprise would create a platform for
new electronic commerce businesses to be formed by the company,
selling everything from travel destinations to information.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Smith, publisher of the Chicago Tribune, however, says the
company is not surrendering its integrity or chipping away at good
journalism. It is, he says, simply finding new synergies and a new
way to deliver valuable content to readers and consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it's true the Tribune newspaper margins have improved
significantly over the last decade,'' he said. ``But we have more
journalists today than we had a decade ago, and more talented
ones.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no plans to develop a national newspaper, but the
company wants a world-class news gathering organization where
newspaper, television and Internet reporters share information and
real estate, and even cross-over into one another's space.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are issues to work through,'' Smith said. ``Sometimes we
compete, sometimes we cooperate. Sharing news resources across
print and broadcasting helps make our coverage stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the Los Angeles Times was planning a renovation, and
the Tribune Co. had already suggested that its KTLA television
affiliate take a look at the plans to see whether it wanted to
incorporate itself into the Los Angeles newsroom.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts say they were surprised by the deal because
the Tribune Co. had been concentrating on broadcast and Internet
properties, but the Times Mirror newspapers fit nicely into the
company's plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``To draw an analogy, you've got radio and television companies
trying to grab broadcast spectrum, I see this as trying to grab
spectrum,'' said John Morton, who covers the newspaper industry as
an independent analyst. ``They're adding newspapers in major
markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Madigan said Monday that the merger gives the Tribune a ``major
national footprint'' in the United States, because of its powerful
brands in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The new company will have papers with a nationwide circulation
of 3.6 million, and its television stations will reach more than
38.4 million households. On the Internet, it already ranks as one
of the top 20 news and information Web sites, with more than 3.4
million unique visitors each month.
</P>
<P>
   Madigan, who noted the Tribune's early investment in America
Online and its alliance with Time Warner in the WB network,
encouraged comparisons to AOL's acquisition of Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it pushed us along, but it validates a lot of
things we're investing in,'' he said. ``We think that's a wonderful
transaction and both of those companies are great partners of
ours.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has been trying to sell its new media identity to
Wall Street. Its annual report is filled with details about the
company's $250 million in profits from its early investment in
America Online, its investments in other Internet properties such
as iVillage.com and Peapod Inc. The company was an early investor
in a venture to put classified advertising on the Internet, and is
trying to advance interactive and digital television capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not some navel gazing company,'' said Borden at
Crain's Chicago. ``They've bought back 5 million shares of their
own stock this year and they have been very aggressive,
particularly on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to integrating the Times-Mirror newspapers, top
executives say they will use their purchasing might to lower costs,
and they will pool advertising strength to attract national
retailers. No layoffs are planned at any of the major newspapers,
but Smith, the publisher of the Chicago Tribune, said that while
there are no immediate plans to merge bureaus, he did not rule it
out.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Tribune newspapers now operate as a family, with a
good deal of consolidation. ``It's like brothers,'' he said. ``They
can work effectively together to deliver better news.''

 &HT;    Book tracing slave legacy wins award
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``The Hairstons,'' Henry Wiencek's detailed account of
the legacy of one of the South's largest slaveholding families, and
``Motherless Brooklyn,'' Jonathan Lethem's fictional tale of a
detective with Tourette's syndrome, took two of the top honors
Monday night in the National Book Critics Circle Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Other winners, announced at a reception at New York University
Law School, were Jonathan Weiner's ``Time, Love, Memory: A Great
Biologist and His Quest for the Origin of Behavior'' in the general
nonfiction category, Ruth Stone's ``Ordinary Words'' for poetry,
and Jorge Luis Borges' ``Selected Non-Fictions'' for criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Wiencek, whose book won for autobiography/biography, spent years
tracing the branches of the Hairston family tree to gather
anecdotes from both black and white members. Traveling from the
North Carolina plantation of Cooleemee to farms in Virginia and
Mississippi, he pieced together the legacy of slavery and the
history of the Hairstons from all sides.
</P>
<P>
   One story Wiencek heard, for example, involved a slave who
burned a wooden fence to cook a hog for his starving friends. While
the slaves viewed the gesture as an act of compassion, white
Hairstons at the time saw the incident simply as an attempt to
hinder the next day's labor.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Time, Love, Memory,'' Pulitzer Prize-winning author Weiner
takes readers into the world of biologist Seymour Benzer and his
fellow scientists as they search for the genes that determine human
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Other nominees by category:
</P>
<P>
   _ Fiction: A. Manette Ansay, ``Midnight Champagne''; Frederick
Busch, ``The Night Inspector''; J. M. Coetzee, ``Disgrace''; and

MERGER ANNOUNCEMENT IS BAD NEWS FOR TRIBUNE SHAREHOLDERS

 By ALEX BERENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Tribune Co.'s agreement to buy Times Mirror spelled bad news
for Tribune shareholders on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Already battered on fears that earnings growth will slow in the
newspaper industry, Tribune's stock more than 17 percent Monday to
$30.8125, its lowest level in more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   But some big investors and stock analysts said worries that the
$6.45 billion deal would hurt Tribune's profits were overdone. If
the deal is completed, Tribune will have both a newspaper and a
television station in the three largest advertising markets in the
United States _ New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago. Tribune already
owns a newspaper and station in Chicago, as well as the Chicago
Cubs and several other newspapers and television stations
nationwide. Times Mirror publishes the Los Angeles Times and
Newsday, among other papers.
</P>
<P>
   The combination would probably be attractive to advertisers and
give Tribune a head start in the furious competition to build
local-interest Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hinge that turns this deal is the new media potential
threading Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York, three massive local
markets,'' Leland Westerfield, a broadcasting and publishing stock
analyst at PaineWebber. ``Creating a new media network of behemoth
local markets offers tremendous potential to advertisers.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Westerfield said Tribune would be able to sell
advertising across its newspaper and television stations in the
same way that Clear Channel Communications and CBS sell across
their radio stations and billboards. That combination has worked
well for Clear Channel and CBS, two of the best-performing and
highest-valued media companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a brilliant deal,'' said Mario Gabelli, the mutual
fund manager. ``Tribune understands the benefits of cross-ownership
in a market.''
</P>
<P>
   Gabelli said his funds bought 500,000 shares of Times Mirror on
Monday, which he plans to exchange for Tribune shares, as well as a
smaller amount of Tribune shares.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Tribune said they were also surprised by
investors' reaction Monday. ``We expected there would be some
decline in our stock price, but nothing like we have seen today,''
said Donald C. Grenesko, Tribune's chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think there is an overreaction.'' Grenesko said. ``The
multiple we paid is very reasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   Tribune's board has authorized the company to buy back up to
$2.5 billion shares of stock, a hefty amount considering Tribune's
market capitalization is now $7.3 billion. Grenesko said Tribune
might begin those repurchases as early as Monday, although the
company will have to stop any buyback when it begins its tender
offer for Times Mirror shares, probably next week.
</P>
<P>
   Grenesko said he thought investors had misunderstood Tribune's
warning that the merger would cause its reported earnings per share
to drop by 16 percent this year. That is mainly because of the
accounting effects of goodwill, the amount in excess of assets
being paid for Times Mirror and no reflection on Tribune's
operations or cash profits. If goodwill is factored out, the deal
will increase Tribune's cash earnings per share beginning next
year, the company said. Over the long run, the company said the
deal should increase its earnings growth rate by 1 to 2 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with Times Mirror, Tribune has ``better management and
probably better growth,'' said Mark Greenberg of the Invesco
Leisure Fund.
</P>
<P>
   As for the rest of the newspaper industry, Gabelli said he
expected ``a lot of conversations will take place,'' and that more
deals would eventually follow.
</P>
<P>
   Among other media companies, those that own newspapers and
broadcast stations, like Gannett, are more likely to be buyers,
while newspaper-only companies, like Knight-Ridder, are likely
sellers, Mr. Greenberg said. Gannett rose 43.25 cents to $66
Monday, while Knight-Ridder jumped $2.375 to $47.50. Gannett and
Knight-Ridder both declined to comment.

<P>
   The Tribune Co.'s agreement to buy Times Mirror spelled bad news
for Tribune shareholders on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Already battered on fears that earnings growth will slow in the
newspaper industry, Tribune's stock more than 17 percent Monday to
$30.8125, its lowest level in more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   But some big investors and stock analysts said worries that the
$6.45 billion deal would hurt Tribune's profits were overdone. If
the deal is completed, Tribune will have both a newspaper and a
television station in the three largest advertising markets in the
United States _ New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago. Tribune already
owns a newspaper and station in Chicago, as well as the Chicago
Cubs and several other newspapers and television stations
nationwide. Times Mirror publishes the Los Angeles Times and
Newsday, among other papers.
</P>
<P>
   The combination would probably be attractive to advertisers and
give Tribune a head start in the furious competition to build
local-interest Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hinge that turns this deal is the new media potential
threading Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York, three massive local
markets,'' Leland Westerfield, a broadcasting and publishing stock
analyst at PaineWebber. ``Creating a new media network of behemoth
local markets offers tremendous potential to advertisers.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Westerfield said Tribune would be able to sell
advertising across its newspaper and television stations in the
same way that Clear Channel Communications and CBS sell across
their radio stations and billboards. That combination has worked
well for Clear Channel and CBS, two of the best-performing and
highest-valued media companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a brilliant deal,'' said Mario Gabelli, the mutual
fund manager. ``Tribune understands the benefits of cross-ownership
in a market.''
</P>
<P>
   Gabelli said his funds bought 500,000 shares of Times Mirror on
Monday, which he plans to exchange for Tribune shares, as well as a
smaller amount of Tribune shares.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Tribune said they were also surprised by
investors' reaction Monday. ``We expected there would be some
decline in our stock price, but nothing like we have seen today,''
said Donald C. Grenesko, Tribune's chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think there is an overreaction.'' Grenesko said. ``The
multiple we paid is very reasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   Tribune's board has authorized the company to buy back up to
$2.5 billion shares of stock, a hefty amount considering Tribune's
market capitalization is now $7.3 billion. Grenesko said Tribune
might begin those repurchases as early as Monday, although the
company will have to stop any buyback when it begins its tender
offer for Times Mirror shares, probably next week.
</P>
<P>
   Grenesko said he thought investors had misunderstood Tribune's
warning that the merger would cause its reported earnings per share
to drop by 16 percent this year. That is mainly because of the
accounting effects of goodwill, the amount in excess of assets
being paid for Times Mirror and no reflection on Tribune's
operations or cash profits. If goodwill is factored out, the deal
will increase Tribune's cash earnings per share beginning next
year, the company said. Over the long run, the company said the
deal should increase its earnings growth rate by 1 to 2 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>

probably better growth,'' said Mark Greenberg of the Invesco

QUESTIONS ON HOW FUND RAISING FOR MRS. CLINTON AFFECTS PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., N.J., Fla., S.D., Pakistan, India)  (js) 
 By RAYMOND BONNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While President Clinton was engaged in an intense
debate with his advisers about whether to stop in Pakistan during
his upcoming visit to South Asia, a group of Pakistani-Americans in
New York with a keen interest in the decision raised $50,000 for
the Senate campaign of his wife.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing illegal about the Feb. 22 fund-raiser, a
$1,000-a-plate dinner of barbecued chicken kebab, spicy goat curry
and rice at a house on Staten Island. All the donors were U.S.
citizens, the organizers said. And no evidence has emerged that
Hillary Rodham Clinton, who told people at the dinner that she
hoped her husband would visit Pakistan, had influenced her
husband's decision last week to do so. A White House spokesman,
Mike Hammer, said, ``The first lady's views were not part of the
decision-making process.''
</P>
<P>
   But the fund-raiser still illustrates a unique aspect of Mrs.
Clinton's candidacy: While her husband still occupies the White
House, people may seek to influence his policies by making
donations to her Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton spent more than two hours at the fund-raiser, the
organizers said, listening to the concerns of the
Pakistani-Americans, and left before the meal was served. Her hosts
were a group of Pakistani-Americans who wanted to press the case to
the first lady that her husband should visit Pakistan and that his
administration should become engaged in finding a solution to the
war in Kashmir, a territory claimed by both Pakistan and India.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the event's organizers, Suhail Muzaffar, a businessman,
and Asim Malik, a doctor from Long Island, New York, said $50,000
was the minimum amount required before Clinton's aides would add
the event to her schedule. The donors were primarily from the New
York metropolitan area, but some came from New Jersey and Maryland,
Malik said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Mr. Clinton announced that he would stop in Pakistan
for a few hours during his visit to the region, which begins
Saturday. The decision was a difficult call because of the intense
rivalry between India and Pakistan and the strife between the two
nations over Kashmir, among other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's hosts moved the dinner to an earlier date so that
it would take place before the president's trip, organizers said.
The fund-raiser was organized by the Pakistani community on Staten
Island, and the Pakistani-American Physicians Political Action
Committee, or Pak-Pac, as it is known. Her appearance there was
first reported by newspapers in India.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it went very well, in terms of the message and the
timeliness of it, especially in terms of the president's going to
the region,'' Muzaffar said. In her remarks at the event, Muzaffar
recalled Clinton saying, ``I would hope the president would go'' to
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's spokesman, Howard Wolfson, confirmed that remark
and said that she had also told the group that the president wanted
to make the stop in Pakistan. Wolfson also confirmed that the
campaign usually asks for a minimum of $50,000 in exchange for
Clinton's appearance at a fund-raiser. Asked if Clinton had
conveyed the views of the Pakistani-Americans to her husband,
Wolfson said, ``Everyone in the administration, including Hillary
and the president, hoped that he could go, and said that.'' Wolfson
added that Indian-American groups had also contributed to Mrs.
Clinton's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Pakistani leaders on Staten Island were working with
other ethnic leaders in the borough on a fund-raiser for Mrs.
Clinton that would address issues facing a spectrum of immigrants,
including Arabs and Africans, as well as Pakistanis, said Abdul
Rehman, who was a member of the reception committee at the dinner.
But then, with President Clinton's trip to the region approaching,
he said, the visit to Pakistan became a central focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot deny that the fact that she's the president's wife
makes a difference,'' Malik said. ``But also as a woman, she can
feel more pain for the victims of Kashmir, the women and
children,'' he added, explaining why most Pakistani-Americans are
endorsing her.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The presidential trip was not the only reason the Pakistanis
have for backing Clinton's Senate bid, the event's organizers said.
Pakistani taxi drivers and street vendors in New York City are
generally not happy with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, her Republican
opponent, they said. Both the drivers and the vendors have been the
targets of stricter regulations under Giuliani's ``quality of
life'' efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The dinner for Clinton was attended by Lanny J. Davis, who as a
lobbyist for the Pakistani government urged the president to visit
the country, but Davis said he played no role in arranging the
fund-raiser. He called $50,000 a ``minor event'' compared to the
amounts Indian-Americans give to campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who was a special counsel to Mr. Clinton in the aftermath
of the 1996 Democratic fund-raising excesses, vigorously rejected
any suggestion that somehow it might be considered unseemly for the
Pakistani community to raise money for Mrs. Clinton. `` It is no
different from what Jewish, Italian or Irish-Americans do,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Indian-Americans are generally better organized politically than
their Pakistani counterparts, and they lobbied against the visit to
Pakistan. Indian-Americans have given large amounts of campaign
money to a variety of lawmakers. For instance, Frank Pallone, a New
Jersey Democrat who was a founder of the India caucus, one of the
most powerful in Congress, has received tens of thousands of
dollars in campaign contributions from Indian-Americans who live
outside New Jersey. An Indian-American doctor in Florida, Zachariah
Zachariah, raised more than $500,000 from Indian-American doctors
for President Bush in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Indians and Pakistanis have squared off before in Senate
contests, most notably four years ago in South Dakota. The
Pakistani-American community poured money into the campaign of U.S.
Rep. Tim Johnson, a Democrat, in his successful effort to oust Sen.
Larry Pressler, the Republican author of legislation that had cut
off U.S. military aid to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   But full immersion in the U.S. political game is new for most
Pakistani-Americans. ``We have never been part of the political
system,'' said Malik, of Old Westbury, N.Y. ``And very slowly,
we've realized you have to be part of the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Mrs. Clinton could not stay for the fund-raiser's
dinner, she made a good impression on her hosts, Malik said,
telling them that once she was elected they should come to see her.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to do that,'' he said.

   GORE MEETS MAYORS
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore met Monday night in Nashville with 30
mayors from across the country. His campaign is hoping they will
provide a counterweight to the many Republican governors who are
working for Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. The mayors included
Dennis Archer of Detroit, Jerry Brown of Oakland, Calif., Sharpe
James of Newark, Wellington Webb of Denver, Marc Morial of New
Orleans and Thomas M. Menino of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   SHIFTING FROM McCAIN TO GORE
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore's campaign, which has spent the last week
trying to impress Sen. John McCain's voters, announced Monday that
McCain's Mississippi coordinator, Jim Bass, had moved to the Gore
camp. But at Bass' news conference in Jackson Monday, none of the
assembled political reporters had heard of Bass or knew that McCain
had a Mississippi organization. McCain had not visited the state to
campaign for Tuesday's primary, and had not opened a headquarters.
Bass said he had run for a state Senate seat a dozen years ago _ as
a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   NEVADA FOR GORE
</P>
<P>
   Nevada had its Democratic caucuses Sunday and Vice President Al
Gore beat former Sen. Bill Bradley, 92 percent to 8 percent. About
1,025 of Nevada's 377,000 registered Democrats showed up. Under the
state's winner-take-all system, Gore won 29 delegates to the
nominating convention this summer.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH ON DEBATES
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush again rebuffed Vice President Al Gore's
offer to suspend all advertising and hold twice-weekly debates.
``There is going to be ample time to debate,'' Bush said. ``The
best time to debate is when people are paying attention. As much as
we wish, America is now going to go into a little hibernation
period when it comes to politics. They are going to go into the
summer months and go on vacation with their families.''
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON RACE WAS CLOSE
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain fell just short of a moral victory in
Washington state, as election officials announced that he had lost
the overall vote total in the Feb. 29 primary by a fraction of a
percentage point, or 2,302 votes. Gov. George W. Bushwas declared
the top vote-getter, with 402,278 votes, or 30.72 percent, to
399,976, or 30.55 percent for McCain. Vice President Al Gore
received 310,403 votes, or 23.71 percent, to 162,721, or 12.43
percent, for Bill Bradley. The only votes Republicans use for
selecting delegates are those of self-declared Republicans, and
Bush won this tally easily, 284,046 votes to 191,098 for McCain.
The officials said that the final vote would be certified next
week.
</P>
<P>
   SIGHTS SET ON HYDE'S SEAT
</P>
<P>
   Aiming to topple one of the biggest names in Congress, two
relatively unknown Democrats are competing for the nomination to
oppose Rep. Henry Hyde, the Republican who represents an affluent
suburban district west of Chicago. Brent Christensen, a 37-year-old
lawyer, first met Hyde when, as a college student in the 1980s, he
delivered a pizza to the congressman. Christensen won The Chicago
Tribune's endorsement for the Democratic primary over Thomas
Cramer, 52, a business consultant who ran against Hyde two years
ago. Both Democrats have sought to portray Hyde, a strong opponent
of legal abortion, as out of step with a district that they regard
as moderate on social issues. Hyde, who led the House members who
prosecuted President Clinton at his Senate impeachment trial, faces
no opposition in the Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   SENATE CANDIDATE IN JAIL
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Wightman-Cervantes, one of five Democratic challengers for
the seat held by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, was arrested
at his Dallas home on Thursday night and is now serving a 90-day
jail sentence for contempt of court. The sentence, which
Wightman-Cervantes had unsuccessfully appealed to the Texas and
U.S. Supreme Courts, grew out of a longstanding dispute with a
local judge, David Godbey. Though another judge had hinted at a
shorter jail stay if the candidate apologized to Godbey,
Wightman-Cervantes told The Associated Press, ``Never.''

WHITE HOUSE TO PUBLISH ACCORD ON CHINA'S ENTRY INTO WTO 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN with CRAIG S. SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bowing to pressure from Congress, the Clinton
administration plans to release the text of the agreement it
negotiated on China's entry to the World Trade Organization, as
early as Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   That reverses a decision to keep the accord classified until
China completed its talks with other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers demanded that the
administration release the agreement, which has been under wraps
since it was signed in November, because they say Congress cannot
vote on whether to grant China permanent normal trade relations
while the WTO agreement remains secret. As part of that accord, the
administration asked Congress to give up its annual review of
China's trade rights in this country.
</P>
<P>
   The vote on permanent normal trade relations is one of President
Clinton's top foreign policy priorities, administration officials
have said. Clinton argues that it is a strategic imperative to get
China into the World Trade Organization, where it would be subject
to the trading rules that most other nations follow. He has also
said that freer trade supports the drive for economic openness in
the Communist country.
</P>
<P>
   But the agreement has sparked a legislative battle in Congress.
Opponents argue that China does not deserve permanent normal trade
relations because it violates human rights policies and continues
to threaten the use of force against Taiwan, which China regards as
a rebellious province. The Senate appears set to grant normal
trading rights, but the vote in the House is still up for grabs,
congressional leaders and administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are taking away an unreal issue and responding to the
concerns of some members who wanted to see this agreement and share
it,'' said Commerce Secretary Bill Daley, who is leading the
campaign to persuade Congress to grant permanent normal trade
relations. ``We are just going to get it out there and everyone
will see that it confirms what we have been saying _ this is a
great deal for the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure on Congress to vote on the matter also increased
Monday when China vowed to join the trade organization regardless
of what the United States does. If Congress were to deny the
permanent normal trade relations, and China was to join the world
group anyway, Beijing could potentially offer other countries more
access to its market than American companies would get.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, China had indicated it wouldn't join the WTO if it
wasn't freed from the annual review. But, apparently sensing that
such a declaration gave Congress the leeway to deny China the
rights, without incurring any damage to American companies, Beijing
signaled it would pursue entry anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Permanent trade relations affects bilateral ties, said Shi
Guangsheng, China's minister of foreign trade. ``It will be up to
WTO members to decide'' whether China enters the global trade body,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of Congress and executives who have security
clearances have been allowed to view the full text. But the
administration agreed to China's request to delay releasing it to
the general public. That fueled suspicions among some opponents
that the accord was not as favorable to United States interests as
the administration claimed.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the sensitivity of releasing the text, the Clinton
administration enraged China last April when it released onto the
Internet the negotiating text of the trade agreement even after
President Clinton decided not to close the deal at that time. The
administration hoped to try to keep China from backtracking in
negotiations. But the release was seen as a blow to Prime Minister
Zhu Rongji, who came in for heated criticism domestically for
concessions he made.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said they agreed to keep the
agreement secret because China did not want Europe, Mexico and some
20 other countries that had yet to complete their own bilateral
negotiations on China's entry to the trade body to try to one-up
the United States. Administration officials said they also did not
want extended haggling by other countries to delay China's
admission to the trade body.
</P>
<P>
   The administration argues that it has disclosed all the relevant
contents of the agreement. But it has only released the headline
concessions China made, not the full text.
</P>
<P>
   The full text contains 250 pages of detailed legal language on
tariffs, quotas and market access for some 5,000 types of goods and
services, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the highlights, the pact allows foreign companies to own
49 percent of Chinese telecommunications companies once China joins
the WTO, a level rising to 50 percent after two years. Foreign
banks will be allowed to conduct local-currency business with
Chinese enterprises two years after China enters. China will cut
the tariffs it imposes on cars to 25 percent from 80 percent or
higher by 2006.
</P>
<P>
   China also agreed to raise quotas and lower tariffs on wheat,
corn, rice and cotton, products in which the United States is
thought to have a substantial comparative advantage.

ALARM BELLS IN AUSTRIA: WILL TOURISM FALL OFF?  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 19) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria _ In the past, when Austrian students rarely
finished their studies at the university where they started, they
liked to talk of doing the theater semester in Vienna, and the ski
semester in Innsbruck. Indeed, Austria's rich combination of
cultural attractions and outdoor activities has made it a leading
destination not only for students but for millions of foreign
tourists. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So anything that threatens tourism, which by last year was
earning Austria about $14 billion a year, has enormous
reverberations. Alarms began to sound when foreign visitors started
canceling plans after ministers from the anti-immigrant party of
Jorg Haider were included in the governing coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The 14 other nations of the European Union reacted by
downgrading relations with Austria, and the United States and
Israel recalled their ambassadors. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although Haider resigned at the end of February as head of the
Freedom Party, the party's ministers remained in office, and the
resignation did little to change critics' minds about the
government.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Prominent figures like the president of Portugal, Jorge Sampaio,
and the actress Catherine Deneuve refused to attend the elegant
Vienna Opera Ball on March 2; Gerard Mortier, the innovative
Belgian artistic director of the venerable Salzburg Festival, made
noises about resigning before his announced resignation date; and
the Austrian pianist Andras Schiff, who was scheduled to play at
the Vienna Festival this summer, announced his intention of
canceling his Austrian appearances one by one until the political
situation was more to his liking. The rock singer Lou Reed also
canceled an appearance scheduled for later this year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most troubling, major international corporations, big
contributors to Vienna's hotel and convention industry, were said
to be canceling business meetings in Austria. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not that Austrian tourism has been thrown into crisis. Eva
Draxler, spokeswoman for the Vienna Tourist Board, acknowledged
that as of Feb. 21, 20,000 overnight stays in Vienna had been
canceled for this year, and a further 10,000 for the year 2001. But
in a city that boasts 7.6 million hotel bookings in an average
year, that amounted to roughly one-quarter of 1 percent of this
year's total, and one-tenth of 1 percent of next year's. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Salzburg, the shock of the strong international reaction was
quickly softened by Mortier's announcement that he would not be
leaving prematurely after all: a rally in February in Vienna, in
which more than 200,000 Austrians protested the new government, had
obliged him to rethink his departure, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And at least one report of a canceled corporate convention was
premature. In February, Vienna newspapers reported that Novell, the
American software company, had canceled a five-day convention at
the Austria Center convention hall; city officials lamented the
loss of about $5 million. But Novell denied the report, saying that
Vienna was still one of four European cities being considered. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There is disruption,'' Draxler said, ``but not to the extent
we expected.'' In Europe, she said, the strongest reactions were in
Belgium, France and Portugal. Belgian school authorities quickly
ordered school ski trips to Austria canceled, and the foreign
minister, Louis Michel, made his widely quoted statement that it
would be immoral to ski in Austria this winter.
</P>
<P>
   In reaction, the Austrian secretary of state for tourism, Mares
Rossmann, a political ally of Haider's, appealed to Austrians to
boycott Belgian chocolate _ prompting Belgian youths who took part
in the anti-government demonstration in Vienna in February to hand
out chocolates. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some travel agents in the United States and elsewhere have
detected a shift away from Austria. ``Our bookings are a little
more mixed than usual,'' said Julia Ann Liantonio, spokeswoman for
the Euro Lloyd travel agency in New York, which specializes in
trips to Central Europe.
</P>
<P>
   While Austria remains the agency's most popular ski destination,
she said, bookings to Switzerland and Germany are up. But Germany
is drawing more attention than usual this year because of the
Oberammergau Passion Play beginning in May and Expo 2000, beginning
in Hanover in June. ``It could be a coincidence,'' she said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Austrian travel industry is responding. The Vienna Tourist
Board, said Draxler, has written to 4,000 travel agencies
worldwide, assuring them that Vienna is a hospitable place to
visit. American travel agents were invited to a reception at the
Waldorf-Astoria in New York early this month featuring the Vienna
Boys Choir and the Salzburg Puppet Theater.
</P>
<P>
   On its Web site, the board has posted a message saying it is
``quite aware that our country carries the burden of a deplorable
past'' and understands international concern over the makeup of the
new government. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Johannes Davoras, spokesman for Austrian Airlines, said that
despite scattered cancellations, Austrian will expand service to
the United States, inaugurating direct flights from Vienna to
Chicago and Washington next week.

WHITE HOUSE TO PUBLISH ACCORD ON CHINA'S ENTRY INTO WTO 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Subs lede graf to correct time element to Tuesday sted
Wednesday) 
 (sw) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN with CRAIG S. SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bowing to pressure from Congress, the Clinton
administration plans to release the text of the agreement it
negotiated on China's entry to the World Trade Organization, as
early as Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   That reverses a decision to keep the accord classified until
China completed its talks with other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers demanded that the
administration release the agreement, which has been under wraps
since it was signed in November, because they say Congress cannot
vote on whether to grant China permanent normal trade relations
while the WTO agreement remains secret. As part of that accord, the
administration asked Congress to give up its annual review of
China's trade rights in this country.
</P>
<P>
   The vote on permanent normal trade relations is one of President
Clinton's top foreign policy priorities, administration officials
have said. Clinton argues that it is a strategic imperative to get
China into the World Trade Organization, where it would be subject
to the trading rules that most other nations follow. He has also
said that freer trade supports the drive for economic openness in
the Communist country.
</P>
<P>
   But the agreement has sparked a legislative battle in Congress.
Opponents argue that China does not deserve permanent normal trade
relations because it violates human rights policies and continues
to threaten the use of force against Taiwan, which China regards as
a rebellious province. The Senate appears set to grant normal
trading rights, but the vote in the House is still up for grabs,
congressional leaders and administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are taking away an unreal issue and responding to the
concerns of some members who wanted to see this agreement and share
it,'' said Commerce Secretary Bill Daley, who is leading the
campaign to persuade Congress to grant permanent normal trade
relations. ``We are just going to get it out there and everyone
will see that it confirms what we have been saying _ this is a
great deal for the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure on Congress to vote on the matter also increased
Monday when China vowed to join the trade organization regardless
of what the United States does. If Congress were to deny the
permanent normal trade relations, and China was to join the world
group anyway, Beijing could potentially offer other countries more
access to its market than American companies would get.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, China had indicated it wouldn't join the WTO if it
wasn't freed from the annual review. But, apparently sensing that
such a declaration gave Congress the leeway to deny China the
rights, without incurring any damage to American companies, Beijing
signaled it would pursue entry anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Permanent trade relations affects bilateral ties, said Shi
Guangsheng, China's minister of foreign trade. ``It will be up to
WTO members to decide'' whether China enters the global trade body,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of Congress and executives who have security
clearances have been allowed to view the full text. But the
administration agreed to China's request to delay releasing it to
the general public. That fueled suspicions among some opponents
that the accord was not as favorable to United States interests as
the administration claimed.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the sensitivity of releasing the text, the Clinton
administration enraged China last April when it released onto the
Internet the negotiating text of the trade agreement even after
President Clinton decided not to close the deal at that time. The
administration hoped to try to keep China from backtracking in
negotiations. But the release was seen as a blow to Prime Minister
Zhu Rongji, who came in for heated criticism domestically for
concessions he made.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said they agreed to keep the
agreement secret because China did not want Europe, Mexico and some
20 other countries that had yet to complete their own bilateral
negotiations on China's entry to the trade body to try to one-up
the United States. Administration officials said they also did not
want extended haggling by other countries to delay China's
admission to the trade body.
</P>
<P>
   The administration argues that it has disclosed all the relevant
contents of the agreement. But it has only released the headline
concessions China made, not the full text.
</P>
<P>
   The full text contains 250 pages of detailed legal language on
tariffs, quotas and market access for some 5,000 types of goods and
services, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the highlights, the pact allows foreign companies to own
49 percent of Chinese telecommunications companies once China joins
the WTO, a level rising to 50 percent after two years. Foreign
banks will be allowed to conduct local-currency business with
Chinese enterprises two years after China enters. China will cut
the tariffs it imposes on cars to 25 percent from 80 percent or
higher by 2006.
</P>
<P>
   China also agreed to raise quotas and lower tariffs on wheat,
corn, rice and cotton, products in which the United States is
thought to have a substantial comparative advantage.

SPORTS COLUMN: NBA HOISTS A COLOSSAL AIR BALL 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the past few years, there has been the vague sense that the
National Basketball Association had run out of gas.
</P>
<P>
   Now the NBA seems to be confirming it. Not only are television
ratings down, but the league has also revealed its own internal
crisis of confidence with a misguided attempt to force microphones
and cameras on players and coaches who do not want them.
</P>
<P>
   Monday the league announced fines of $100,000 for Seattle and
Toronto because their coaches, Paul Westphal and Butch Carter,
refused to be miked last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's lockout was hardball business. This is blatant
overreaction. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The rebellion by Westphal is stunning. Here is a guy known for
his conservative views, but the league has turned him into a
regular Patrick Henry. On Sunday, Westphal vowed to pay the
$100,000 himself, rather than saddle his owners, saying: ``I follow
my conscience by refusing to do less than my best during the heat
of battle. The league wants me to allow my private strategies,
insights, relationships and speech to be monitored, then eventually
owned by others.''
</P>
<P>
   Westphal does not want some network official dredging up his
conversations with players that hitherto may have overheard by only
a few fans sitting nearby. Who knows, maybe some hustler in the
league would find a way to sell the sound bites over the Internet.
The league says ``trust us,'' but solid citizens like Westphal and
Carter are obviously not convinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I accept a failure of a type,'' said David Stern, the
commissioner, in a telephone interview Monday from Denver, where he
was attending a league marketing meeting but taking time to respond
to the coaches' insurrection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we were all on the same page on this. We are in a
new generation that is used to being interactive. We want our fans
to be as close as the people in the $1,200 seats.''
</P>
<P>
   Russ Granik, the deputy commissioner, noted that since December
the league has been miking coaches and players who volunteered.
Granik also said that the league planned to put a camera in the
locker room at halftime for no more than 15 to 30 seconds ``just to
show the players arriving.''
</P>
<P>
   There is concern among coaches and players, however, that the
league's entertainment division, run by Adam Silver, is gaining
power from the basketball wing. Whether that is true or not, it
isn't hard to imagine the forces of interaction whispering into
Stern's ear: ``Listen, nobody cares about our players. Michael
Jordan doesn't even show up for his new job in Washington. We've
got to do something. Nascar is putting cameras in its stock cars.
Professional wrestling is more popular than we are. We're competing
against lowlifes like Jerry Springer and get-rich-quick quiz shows.
Basketball is boring. We need some buzz.''
</P>
<P>
   For all that, Stern and Granik should have anticipated the
response from their basketball people. Coaches still have the right
to snarl at players, who still have the right to snap right back,
without the league canning sound bites. Stern insisted that coaches
can always turn off the mike ``if they have something they don't
want to get out,'' but it doesn't sound that simple to Carter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent the last two and a half years earning the respect of
the guys in that locker room. I can't afford to lose their
respect,'' Carter said, worrying that some kind of verbal exchange
``could do a ton of damage to a young coach like myself.''
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing wrong with miking a coach or a referee who
wants to be miked. It was fun when that old ham Tommy Lasorda
turned on his clean vocabulary for the viewers, or the hockey
referee Kerry Fraser told a captain that his options were either a
goon or a skater serving a penalty, ``Personally, it's a
no-brainer.'' Granik pointed out that, with all the sensitive
electronic gear at courtside, we already hear plenty. So why pick a
fight with the talent?
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of our coaches are comfortable with being miked,'' said
Michael H. Goldberg, the executive director of the National
Basketball Coaches Association Monday. ``But if a coach honestly
believes his performance is impacted, he shouldn't have to wear a
mike. I'm not sure the owners have thought this through.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, maybe they did. Some of the new owners are instant
millionaires via the Internet, and know there are fortunes to be
made marketing snippets of information and sound and image. Bird
and Magic and Michael don't count anymore. Now the league plans to
continue threatening coaches every Sunday for $100,000 a shot,
essentially screaming to the world, ``It's even worse than you
imagined.'' &QL;

 By FELICITY BARRINGER and LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two of the nation's largest newspaper companies, the Tribune Co.
and Times Mirror Co., both built around newspapers that helped
define the brawling, partisan days of 19th-century journalism,
announced Monday that they would merge. The deal ends 119 years of
ownership of The Los Angeles Times by the Otis and Chandler
families.
</P>
<P>
   The new company would seek to replicate in cities like New York
and Los Angeles the Tribune's success in offering many kinds of
media to the Chicago market. The idea is to create a network of
regional media hubs where advertisers are matched with audiences
through newspapers, television broadcasts and Internet sites.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which will retain the Tribune Co. name, will own 11
daily newspapers, 22 television stations and four radio stations.
The company's newspapers would have a combined circulation of 3.6
million copies, ranking third among newspaper companies after
Gannett and Knight Ridder. Tribune's television stations reach 38.4
million households.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed acquisition of Times Mirror by the Tribune Co. was
greeted with deep skepticism by investors; Tribune shares, which
had closed Friday at $37.875, fell swiftly to $27.75 as trading
opened, and closed at $30.75, down 17 percent. Shares of Times
Mirror soared $37.6875, to close at $85.625.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the Tribune's corporate heirs of Robert McCormick and
James Patterson, whose pugnacious conservatism often enraged their
barrel-chested union town of Chicago, are buying out and the
corporate heirs of Gen. Harrison Gray Otis and Harry Chandler, who
used The Los Angeles Times as a political hammer, helping fashion
the southern California desert into the nation's second-largest
city.
</P>
<P>
   Tribune's offer of $6.45 billion in the stock and cash deal _
not including the assumption of $1.8 billion of Times Mirror debt _
also puts an abrupt end to the mercurial five-year stewardship of
the Times Mirror chairman, Mark H. Willes. A former cereal company
executive, he brought an almost religious fervor to his quest to
streamline the company, challenging the newspaper industry to
reinvent itself, increase its audience, and toss out its
shibboleths _ notably the historic separation of the news and
business divisions.
</P>
<P>
   The essential details of the deal were arranged by members of
the Chandler family, without Willes' knowledge, according to both
Willes and Thomas Unterman, the former chief financial officer of
Times Mirror who was a primary adviser to the Chandler family
trusts.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts dismissed the flight from Tribune stock as a
short-sighted reaction, particularly considering the success the
company has achieved in its hometown. Peter P. Appert, an analyst
at Deutsche Bank, said ``the 30-percent-plus profit margins it has
had in Chicago demonstrate the leverage that can be achieved owning
both broadcast and a major newspaper in one market. This gives it
the same potential in Los Angeles and New York.''
</P>
<P>
   The companies overlap in several areas. Tribune bought KTLA in
Los Angeles, now a Warner Bros &UR; . &LR;  affiliate, in 1985. Tribune owns
WTIC, a Fox affiliate in Hartford, Conn., the location of Times
Mirror's Hartford Courant, and WPIX in New York. Newsday, the
second largest among Times Mirror newspapers with a circulation of
575,000, is based in suburban Long Island, within WPIX's viewing
area.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulations prohibiting dual ownership of a daily
newspaper and a broadcast television station are not expected to be
a problem, at least not immediately. If a company that owns a
television station in a market later acquires a daily newspaper in
that market, it can wait until its existing license expires before
seeking a waiver. None of the licenses in Hartford, New York or Los
Angeles expire before 2006.
</P>
<P>
   Appert said he believes that the dual-ownership rules are likely
to be shelved well before then.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Friday's closing stock prices, the offer for Times
Mirror consists of $3.79 billion in common stock and $2.66 billion
in cash. The cash represents a tender for about 28 million shares
at $95 per share, The remaining 40.8 million shares would be
exchanged, with Tribune offering 2.5 shares for each share of Times
Mirror.
</P>
<P>
   In the deal, Tribune was always the suitor. The courtship began
last spring when John Madigan, Tribune's chief executive,
approached Willes to discuss some types of partnership, Willes said
in an interview Monday. But when Madigan raised the prospect of a
merger, Willes said he passed on the offer because he did not
believe that a merger would be acceptable under the terms of the
Chandler Trust, which represents the interests of the Chandler
family in the company. Within days of that discussion, Willes sent
a letter to Madigan telling him so. The two did not discuss the
idea again, said Willes and several other people close to the
talks.
</P>
<P>
   Then in October, there was a major distraction for Times Mirror
executives, as a decision by Kathryn M. Downing, Willes' handpicked
successor as publisher of the L.A. Times, provoked a firestorm
within the newsroom. Downing, without the knowledge of the top
editor Michael Parks, agreed with the owners of Staples Center the
new downtown arena that the Times would share the profits of a
special Sunday magazine devoted to coverage of the center's
opening.

 Yahoo Goes Live Online With Own Finance Show  &HT;     By Verne Kopytoff 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Departing from a tradition of relying on other companies to create
content for its Internet portal, Yahoo yesterday launched its own
Web finance show that will allow users to see live interviews and
news reports about business.
<P>
   The show, called ``Yahoo FinanceVision,'' will be broadcast
eight hours a day, from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. PST, Monday through Friday
on Yahoo's Web site. The programming will mimic cable television
financial news with company profiles and on-air hosts conducting
live interviews of corporate executives and analysts.
</P>
<P>
   The show will primarily be done out of studios in New York at
the major stock exchanges and from a studio near the company
headquarters in Santa Clara.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you have to count this as a major departure for
Yahoo,'' said Robert Sterling, an Internet analyst for New York
market research company Jupiter Communications.
</P>
<P>
   He said ``FinanceVision'' is a rare example of Yahoo creating
its own content and a milestone in the company's entry into Web
broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   Sterling said the show appears to be aimed at office workers who
have high-speed Internet access. The show's chatty and informal
interviews, he said, appears to be aimed at a younger audience.
Viewers can e-mail questions to guests during live interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Mallet, president and chief executive of Yahoo, was more
muted in assesing ``FinanceVision.'' While he called the show
``dynamic'' and a great convenience to the public, he said the show
represents ``evolutionary, not revolutionary change'' for the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the content, Mallet said, comes from Yahoo's partners
like TheStreet.com, the online financial site, and Business Week.
He said Yahoo is merely providing a new way to distribute the
information that those companies create by offering links to their
articles and interviewing their reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Mallet added that Yahoo is considering launching other original
broadcast shows but would not say what topics they would cover.
Charlene Li, an Internet analyst with Forrester Research, predicted
that one of the shows will focus on sports.

Charles Schwab, which has more than 300 branch offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``This lets us create an environment where you have both high
tech and high touch,'' said Mitchell Caplan, chief banking officer
of E-Trade.
</P>
<P>
   The Bay Area, where E-Trade has ``a huge number of customers for
both the bank and the brokerage,'' is a ``completely logical choice
for the first machines,'' Caplan said.
</P>
<P>
   Converting the ATMs to handle E-Trade banking will would &LR; 
 &LR; happen within 90 days, Caplan said; the brokerage capabilities
will follow within months.
</P>
<P>
   ``This provides more ubiquity. You have to give (customers) the
opportunity to transact whichever way they prefer,'' said Dan
Burke, senior analyst at Gomez Advisors in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   CCS is the largest independent operator of ATMs in the United
States and also has machines in Canada and Mexico. The Oregon
company operates 900 ATMs in California, 300 of them in Northern
California. Its model is to sell ATM terminals to stores, such as
Chevron, Safeway and Rite-Aid, and then sign a long-term contract
to maintain them and process transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Privately held CCS last year earned $4.4 million on revenues of
$72 million.
</P>
<P>
   Menlo Park's E-Trade moved into banking with its June
acquisition of Virginia's Telebanc, the nation's largest
Internet-based bank, for $1.8 billion in stock. It plans to rename
the enterprise E-Trade Bank this month, Caplan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a problem for online banking because customers can't
make a deposit,'' said William Wong, vice president of research at
Josephthal &AMP; Co. in New York. ``They don't want to mail the check
in _ it's not timely. That's true for the brokerage business as
well _ if you want to open an account or add funds, you don't want
to have to mail a check in.''
</P>
<P>
   Caplan said E-Trade was attracted by CCS's ability to update its
ATMs remotely from a central location. The firm's technology allows
it to easily add new features and services to ATMs, as well as
deliver targeted coupons and advertisements to its entire network,
certain regions or individual machines.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Grana, CCS chief executive and president, said he expects
merchants to welcome the idea of converting their ATMs to E-Trade
machines. ``By replacing an ATM that just dispenses $20 bills with
a financial kiosk, the retailer is offering a whole new suite of
products and services to customers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In another move into brick and mortar, E-Trade is planning to
set up a walk-in office on Manhattan's Madison Avenue by the end of
the year, The Chronicle reported last month. But sources said the
store will serve as a high-profile branding device, rather than the
first in a chain of storefronts.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers think E-Trade still needs to venture further into
the world of ``stores with doors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If they really want to make hay, they have to set up branch
offices,'' said Brook Newcomb, senior analyst with Forrester
Research in Cambridge, Mass. ``A lot of people still have an
inclination to do business with someone who has a physical
office.''
</P>
<P>
   E-Trade fell 75 cents, to $25.75, in Nasdaq trading yesterday.

 Vendors Attack Transient Merchant Tax, License  &HT;     By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Southern California entrepreneur Mike Frankovich was incensed when
he heard he would have to pay $500 to the city of San Francisco for
a license to sell novelty goods at a trade show in the city, as
well as a 10 percent tax on any revenue above $5,000 in sales.
<P>
   ``San Francisco is gouging vendors who come to the city for just
a few days,'' he fumed. , &LR; ``This is unfair; I already pay state
sales taxes and have a California seller's permit.''
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, San Francisco Supervisor Mark Leno proposed a measure
to suspend the city's ``transient merchants'' code, which has been
on the books for 40 years or more. Originally, the specified fee
and taxes were designed to make traveling salesmen, like
shirtmakers shirt-makers  &LR; and art dealers who sell out of a hotel
room for a few days, pay something back to the city.
</P>
<P>
   The little-known tax was not seriously enforced for many years.
But when Susan Leal took over as city treasurer and saw the rules
on the books, she began enforcing them in 1999. And not just in
hotels, but at Moscone Center and the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium.
That brought howls from visiting trade show exhibitors.
</P>
<P>
   Most big conferences and conventions, such as those that host
architects, dermatologists and geneticists, don't sell goods over
the conference table. But the few who do were often outraged.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco International Gift Fair holds two large
conventions each year in San Francisco, and President Michael Dean
said hitting trade show exhibitors with special fees in a few
cities like San Francisco and Seattle is ``a real minus.'' Besides
the cost, he said, ``It's an administrative nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the 500 exhibitors who sold hardware and software at
last year's MacWorld Expo at Moscone Center also attacked the local
levies.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco city and business leaders have been listening.
They definitely don't want to kill the goose that lays a fortune in
eggs. The convention business last year contributed more than $2
billion to the local economy, according to the San Francisco
Convention and Visitors Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   The city benefits directly in various ways. For example, it
collects rent of 25 cents per square foot per day at Moscone
Center. If the space were filled all the time, it would generate
$91 per foot per year, or more than $5 million a year for the
600,000-square-foot facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``No other California city imposes a transient merchants' tax,
and that posed a competitive disadvantage,'' said John Marks,
president of the San Francisco Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau. ``We
don't want someone to be dissuaded from booking San Francisco
because of the perception we have an archaic tax that is not
imposed elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Leno said the transient merchants tax ``is definitely a
stumbling block to holding a convention in San Francisco.'' His
proposal to suspend it will likely be heard by the supervisors'
Small Business Committee in a month. Then a public hearing would be
scheduled, with the suspension of the transient merchants tax
possibly coming as early as May.
</P>
<P>
   Little opposition to Leno's proposal is likely. Not only is the
levy a political and business embarrassment, it is costly to
administer and generates little money for the city.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, San Francisco generated a piddling $41,234.38 from 88
transient merchants transactions. Leal, who maintains that her
office is ``neutral'' on the tax, said she began enforcing it
simply because it is the law.
</P>
<P>
   City officials say the measure is hard to enforce, especially
the 10 percent tax on gross receipts over $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to rely on sellers' honesty and integrity,'' said tax
collector Richard Sullivan. ``We don't want to send people back to
Minnesota or New York to verify sales figures.''
</P>
<P>
   While visiting merchants may soon be getting some tax relief, no
immediate tax break is contemplated for local businesses. In
addition to state and federal taxes, they pay a 1.5 percent payroll
tax and gross receipts tax ranging from 1.23 percent to 3 percent
of revenue.

 _ SF CHRON  
 All Aboard the Nasdaq Express  &HT;     By Arthur M. Louis 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
For the past couple of years, experts have been warning that the
technology-laden Nasdaq stock market is grossly overvalued, and
that you would be foolhardy to risk your money there.
<P>
   If you followed that advice, chances are you still are driving a
Ford Taurus, while your foolhardy neighbor is tooling around town
in a flaming red Porsche Carrera.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Nasdaq composite index roared past the 5,000
milestone for the first time, just 10 weeks after passing 4,000 and
18 weeks after it topped 3,000. Although the highly volatile index
plunged below 5,000 yesterday, finishing at 4907.24, it still has
gained 21 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the other major indexes have performed poorly.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, far less heavily weighted with
tech stocks than the Nasdaq, has skidded 6 percent since year
- &LR; end. The Dow Jones industrial average, with an even smaller tech
contingent, has tumbled 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If you had invested $50,000 two years ago in the average Nasdaq
stock, you would be sitting on nearly $140,000 today.
</P>
<P>
   Some big-name Nasdaq stocks have performed far better than that.
A $50,000 investment in Cisco Systems two years ago would be worth
more than $300,000 now; in Qualcomm, $1.1 million; in JDS Uniphase,
nearly $1.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   It's natural for tradition-minded marketwatchers to denounce
this sort of explosive price action as a `'bubble'' or ``mania.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite is selling at nearly 400 times earnings for
the latest 12 months, while tradition holds that multiples greater
than 40 should be considered lofty, if not vertiginous.
</P>
<P>
   But when the phenomenal price increases continue week after
week, month after month, year after year, making a lot of people
rich, you have to consider the possibility that what's happening
has some substance to it.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, quite a few market watchers have capitulated to the
trend and are publicly exclaiming that perhaps the whole thing
actually makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   While that may be an ominous sign _ once the market reaches
unanimity, prices often move violently in the opposite direction _
the arguments for a continuing Nasdaq bonanza are, at least,
rational. Whether they turn out to be correct remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   The principal argument is that today's price-earnings ratios are
irrelevant because nobody can gauge the future earnings of
America's booming high-tech juggernaut. By the same token, nobody
can tell for certain which companies will be tomorrow's winners and
which _ if any _ will be losers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of these companies have very uncertain earnings futures _
it is very difficult to know what earnings will be in 15 to 20
years,'' says Lynn Reaser, chief economist of the Bank of America
Asset Management Group.
</P>
<P>
   For some stocks, perhaps 400 times earnings today will seem like
a bargain tomorrow, some investors reason. It may even be that
almost any price is reasonable when you are buying technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the future can be fully discounted when we don't
know what the future is,'' says Alfred Goldman, market strategist
with A.G. Edwards &AMP; Son, in St. Louis. ``Don't argue with a
well-established trend. If you want to play, you've got to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks _ collectively known nowadays as the ``new
economy'' _ also are supposed to be less vulnerable to
interest-rate increases than the old-economy stocks that make up
the bulk of the other major market averages.
</P>
<P>
   That's a big issue now because the Federal Reserve has raised
interest rates by a full percentage point since mid-1999 and is
expected to raise them significantly more starting as early as this
month in its crusade to cool the economy and forestall inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Old-economy companies borrow more heavily than new-economy
companies, and that tends to crimp their earnings more. New-economy
companies generally finance their expansion with stock rather than
loans.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Acuff, market strategist for Salomon Smith Barney in
New York, points out that when the Fed is particularly hawkish on
inflation, companies with substantial annual growth in unit sales
tend to fare best, because they don't need higher prices to
increase profits.
</P>
<P>
   Most technology companies fit that description, Acuff observes,
while old-economy companies do not.
</P>
<P>
   However, San Francisco money manager Stewart J. Pillette
predicts that tech companies will suffer eventually if old-economy
companies get squeezed by higher rates and cut back their purchases
of services and equipment. ``The old economy buys the new economy's
stuff,'' Pillette observes.
</P>
<P>
   Interest rates still aren't high enough to entice investors to
take substantial amounts of money out of the stock market and
invest it in fixed-income securities. The 30-year U.S. Treasury
bond, for example, is yielding only a bit more than 6 percent
annually.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, many investors simply are taking money out of
old-economy stocks and buying new-economy stocks because that is
where the action is.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Bakar, director of research with Hambrecht &AMP; Quist, a major
underwriter of high-tech securities, insists that ``over the longer
term, Nasdaq will continue to outperform the Dow.''
</P>
<P>
   Bakar concedes that ``things don't go up forever _ you can get
corrections of 10 percent to 15 percent in a short period of
time.'' But he adds: ``People will then step back in and say the
fundamentals haven't changed, there is still huge potential out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Danville retirement planner Richard DelMonte acknowledges that
he has been continually amazed by the Nasdaq skyrocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``But five years from now, I expect it to be a lot higher than
it is now,'' he says. ``It could grow faster than the Dow for the
next 10 years. It is a lot more indicative of the dynamism in our
economy than the Dow or S&AMP;P.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Schlossberg, an economist with Wells Capital Management,
concedes that there is ``a downside risk'' in the Nasdaq market
because ``valuations are so high.''
</P>
<P>
   But he won't bet against further strong price gains, because the
tech story is just too compelling. ``We are in the midst of an
information-based revolution,'' he observes.
</P>
<P>
   As hot as technology's prospects may be, Bank of America's
Reaser advises caution and discrimination. Don't assume that every
tech stock will continue to soar, she observes. Be picky.
</P>
<P>
   ``One should look at the companies to make certain they have a
solid business plan, some earnings prospects and are not vulnerable
to competition or product obsolescence,'' Reaser says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't just assume that because they have gone up 10 percent in
the past week, they will go up 50 percent in the next year.''

GORE SEES OPENING IN FLORIDA, AND WORKS TO WIN THE STATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Six months ago, most polls showed that Vice President Al
Gore had no hope of winning Florida in a general election over Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas. Not only was Gore unpopular, but Bush had
an ace in the hole _ his brother, Jeb, the state's popular
governor, and his political organization.
</P>
<P>
   But now, Gore is even with, if not leading, George Bush in most
national polls, and that is trickling down. Jeb Bush is running
into local political squalls. And Gore is suddenly thinking that
Florida, a conservative swing state, may be up for grabs in
November.
</P>
<P>
   While Florida has voted for a Democratic presidential candidate
only twice in the last 30 years, one of those times was in 1996,
when it gave the edge to Bill Clinton _ and his running mate, Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Monday marked Gore's seventh visit to Florida in the last 12
months, and he is coming back Tuesday night to Tallahassee to watch
the primary returns from Florida and five other Southern states.
Ten days ago Gore visited Jacksonville, where he discussed
education, and he was here Monday discussing health care, Medicare
and Social Security, crucial subjects in a state where one in five
people is at least 65 years old.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to visit so often, and to watch the returns here,
is a strategic one. Gore is going to contest this state and devote
time and money here. If nothing else it tells Bush that he needs to
earn, rather than take for granted, a victory in Florida, which has
25 electoral votes, the nation's fourth-largest total.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the frisson of Gore's play for the state is the
speculation that one possible choice for a vice presidential
running mate is Sen. Bob Graham of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Clinton carried the state in '96 and that's the reason
they're there,'' Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster who specializes
in the South, said of the Gore campaign. ``They're starting with
those states that Clinton carried at least once. It becomes a lot
more competitive if he puts someone like Bob Graham on the ticket.
But it is in play.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham, visiting the Jackson Memorial Medical Center here with
Gore Monday, brushed aside questions from reporters about whether
he would accept the No. 2 slot. But while introducing Gore to an
audience of 150 health-care professionals, Graham said Florida
would be more than a battleground state. ``It's going to be a
foundation for the Gore victory and the Gore administration,''
Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   A Mason-Dixon poll conducted last week showed Bush with an
8-point lead over Gore in Florida with either Ross Perot or Pat
Buchanan running on the Reform Party ticket. The margin of error
was 6 points.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Coker, managing director of the Mason-Dixon poll, said that
the gap between Bush and Gore had closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``My read is that Gore shouldn't write off Florida,'' Coker
said. ``It shouldn't be a key component to his Electoral College
majority. But he could win it if Bush starts to tank nationally.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeb Bush said that he and his brother were ready and confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to win,'' the Florida governor said of his brother
on Sunday. ``He's got lots of support. The state will be
competitive. We're not going to take it for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's supporters speak of a competitive attitude, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1992 Bill Clinton gave up on Florida, withdrew his
campaign, didn't advertise and ended up losing the state by a
narrow margin,'' Graham said. ``Clinton will say now that the
biggest mistake he made in '92 was that decision on Florida. Six
months ago, Al Gore was getting the same advice _ spend your time
and resources elsewhere. I think now, clearly, Florida is
winnable.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats see an opportunity to undermine George Bush's support
because of some dissatisfaction with Jeb Bush on affirmative
action. He has proposed a plan to abolish set-asides and
preferences for minorities in admissions to public colleges and in
state government hiring, although he would guarantee that the top
20 percent of all high school graduates could go to state colleges.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hispanics are strongly behind Jeb on affirmative action,''
Coker said. ``They have prospered in the state without those
programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Butterworth, the state attorney general, who leads Gore's
campaign in Florida, said that another problem for the vice
president would be a perception by some voters that the state would
benefit more under a Bush administration because of the brotherhood
bond. Butterworth said it would be his job to convey that Florida
had benefited under the Clinton administration and would continue
to do well under a Gore administration.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that Gore was addressing the main issues that
would appeal to Florida's independents and moderates who may have
strayed to Sen. John McCain of Arizona earlier this year when
George Bush tacked to the ideological right.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Bush became the conservative, you saw the shifts among
Florida's centrist voters _ women, moderate Democrats and those in
metro areas,'' Coker said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is trying to capture those voters with a focus on issues
like health care, education and gun control. On Monday Graham said
that Gore had offered a detailed health-care plan and that Bush had
not, and he drew sly attention to a perceived Bush weakness by
suggesting that Gore has a stronger command of policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might say his program is actually written down in
understandable language on pieces of paper,'' Graham said. ``We're
still waiting for a set of signals from cyberspace as to what the
other candidate's health-care program is going to be.''

CLINTON AND GORE CLASH WITH NRA OFFICIAL OVER GUN CONTROL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ A long-running dispute between President Clinton and
the National Rifle Association escalated Monday as Clinton angrily
rejected a suggestion that he tolerated a certain amount of
violence and killing to strengthen the case for gun control and to
score political points for the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said such suggestions were grotesque and totally without
foundation. He said the comments by a senior executive of the NRA
were an example of the ``political smear tactics'' and ``slash and
burn'' politics that he deplored.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, the putative Democratic presidential
nominee, joined the verbal fray, saying the comments made by the
executive revealed ``a kind of sickness at the very heart of the
NRA.''
</P>
<P>
   The executive vice president of the National Rifle Association,
Wayne LaPierre, made the comments on Sunday on the ABC News program
``This Week.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the president, LaPierre said: ``I've come to
believe that he needs a certain level of violence in this country.
He's willing to accept a certain level of killing to further his
political agenda and his vice president, too.''
</P>
<P>
   LaPierre asserted that Clinton and Gore had political reasons
for their adamant insistence on tough gun control legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pollsters and consultants are telling them, `Scare
suburban women,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   LaPierre refused to back away from his comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the president needs to understand and the American people
need to understand is people are dying, and this administration
won't do anything about it,'' he said on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   In two speeches here Monday, Clinton said that officers of the
NRA would not dare to make such comments to the parents of
schoolchildren who had been killed by gun violence in the last few
years.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said, ``I'm not going to get in a shouting match'' with
the NRA. But he said the dispute underlined the ``big stakes'' in
this fall's elections. Specifically, he said, the election of more
Democrats to Congress could create a safer country by increasing
the chances for passage of gun controls.
</P>
<P>
   Polls suggest that gun violence and laws to control it could be
a potent issue in this November's elections. A recent opinion
survey for ABC and The Washington Post showed that Gore was more
trusted than his Republican rival, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, to
deal with gun control, 47 percent to 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said Monday that he declined to get involved in a fight
between the White House and the NRA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope that we can have an open and honest discussion
about gun enforcement without calling names,'' he said. ``There are
going to be a lot of emotions involved in the debate. But people
need to come together to come up with policies to keep the handguns
out of the people who shouldn't have them.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to health care workers at a Miami hospital, Gore said
LaPierre's remarks on Sunday were ``shocking, because anyone who
has spent time, as I have, many times, with the families of the
victims of gun violence, and felt the heartache, seen the way gun
violence tears families apart, couldn't make such a comment.''
</P>
<P>
   LaPierre's comments were part of a larger attack on the White
House by the rifle association. The group is running television
advertisements that feature its president, the actor Charlton
Heston.

SOME SEE TAKEOVER OF FIAT IN DETAILS OF DEAL WITH GM 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TURIN, Italy _ General Motors and Fiat announced a strategic
cooperation deal Monday that some analysts called a prelude to a GM
takeover of the Italian industrial giant's troubled automotive
operation. Fiat officials stressed that they expected their
business to remain independent.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement provides for both partners to collaborate broadly
in Europe and Latin America in the buying and manufacturing of
heavy components like motors and gear shifts. It will give GM a 20
percent stake in Fiat's auto division, worth $2.3 billion, in
exchange for a 5.15 percent share in GM for Fiat.
</P>
<P>
   It also will give Fiat the option to sell the remaining 80
percent of its car division to GM in three and a half years.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the deal would bring both companies savings after
the third year of $1.2 billion annually, divided 50-50.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits for Fiat are a capital injection by GM, in which
Fiat becomes the largest single investor, and the steady hand of GM
in helping Fiat expand markets, most notably in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   For GM, the advantages appeared to lie in gaining access to
Fiat's small-car technology, with the possibility of acquiring all
of Fiat's car business.
</P>
<P>
   Fiat officials, for their part, said the deal gave Fiat the
opportunity to continue its independent path. Paolo Fresco, Fiat's
chairman, said the agreement assured the ``maintenance of
decision-making control'' in Fiat's hands. Had Fiat wished to sell
the auto business, he said, it would have done so already.
</P>
<P>
   But some experts said the deal really only made sense as a
precursor to a full takeover of Fiat's auto business by GM.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the end of the game,'' said John Lawson, an auto
industry analyst at Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Valerio Castronovo, an Italian industrial historian and author
of a history of Fiat, called the deal a ``betrothal, that will one
day become a marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   The most immediate effects of the deal will be the creation of
two joint ventures: one for buying; the other for developing and
building motors and related components. But the companies said they
would also be studying ways to save money by allowing their finance
arms to cooperate and by developing joint platforms, global
communications systems and the introduction of some Fiat-built cars
into the United States, including the Alfa Romeo and Maserati.
</P>
<P>
   Fiat now sells only its Ferrarri sports cars in the United
States, a market it effectively vacated in 1995, when it sold its
last Alfa Romeo models there.
</P>
<P>
   Fiat will bring its worldwide capacity into the components
venture, and GM will bring its operations in Europe and Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
   Fiat executives said the companies expected that the next
generation of GM and Fiat small cars would share a single platform
by about the middle of the decade. Fiat expects to show an Alfa
Romeo sports model at the Detroit auto show in 2001 and begin to
sell it through GM dealers thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   For Fiat, Italy's biggest corporation, an alliance with a
foreign partner has been seen for many months as essential for
long-term survival. Its car business, historically volatile, has
been losing money and market share in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is the latest in a consolidation of the global auto
industry, that was given a push forward last year by the merger of
Daimler Benz and Chrysler. But in announcing the deal at Fiat's
headquarters here, both companies emphasized that they saw the
future more in terms of networks of strategic alliances than in the
formation of globe-girdling empires.
</P>
<P>
   The global auto business, Freco said, ``is moving toward a world
of networks, not empires,''
</P>
<P>
   John F. Smith Jr., GM's chairman and chief executive, praised
the deal as a ``historic alliance'' between two of the world's
oldest car makers. But he said it was the latest in a string of
industrial alliances in which GM has taken an equity stake in its
partner, including older agreements with Isuzu and Suzuki, and a
more recent link with Subaru.
</P>
<P>
   As laid out by Fiat executives, Monday's deal signaled an effort
to find a middle path between a full sell-off of the auto business
and complete independence.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Fiat group reported a 45 percent drop in profit
last year, the car division, which for the first time ever
accounted for less than half of the group's roughly $50 billion in
revenue, returned to profitability after a year of losses. In the
last quarter of 1999, operating profit rose to $569 billion,
against a loss of $57 billion the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Fiat's car unit, producing fewer than three million cars a
year, lacks the global power of GM, Ford or Toyota and faces
powerful new alliances like DaimlerChrysler and the combination of
Renault and Nissan.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Fiat executives emphasized that the link with GM did not
mean Fiat was withdrawing from cars. Paolo Cantarella, Fiat's chief
executive, said the companies were ``cost-side allied, revenue-side
competitors.''

UNDATED: center's opening.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the ensuing furor, Downing apologized for the apparent
conflict, which she agreed endangered the newspaper's editorial
credibility. Willes also said the move was a mistake, but continued
to back Downing.
</P>
<P>
   That storm was beginning to die down in January, when Madigan
and Fuller approached two Times Mirror trustees, William Stinehart
Jr. and Warren B. Williamson, and asked if they could meet. The two
agreed and, over lunch at the California Club, a restaurant in
downtown Los Angeles, Madigan made a case for combining the two
companies. Stinehart and Williamson, said people close to the
talks, were intrigued by the idea and agreed to present it to
members of the Chandler family.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, they also hired bankers from Morgan Stanley to
explore other opportunities. But after a review of possible
partners, Unterman, the adviser to the family, said ``there was no
comparable match with the same breadth or size.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second week of February, a group of trustees went to
Chicago for a day-long presentation by the Tribune Co.'s senior
management. Using charts and graphs, the Tribune executives argued
that combining the Tribune's mix of television and newspaper assets
with Times Mirror's newspapers made sense. As importantly, said
people close to the talks, Tribune executives were suggesting that
they were willing to pay a hefty premium.
</P>
<P>
   The profit potential of the dual newspaper-and-television cities
was ``what caught the Chandler family's interest,'' said Unterman.
Once the trustees returned to Los Angeles, a legal team began
researching whether such a merger was doable under the terms of
their trust.
</P>
<P>
   But Times Mirror was not the only partner the Tribune Co. was
interested in. The company was also holding discussions with
television broadcaster Chris Craft Industries, a 50 percent
stakeholder in the UPN Network. Such a merger would bolster the
Tribune's broadcasting holdings. But ultimately the Tribune Co.
decided against a Chris Craft deal, said a person close to the
talks, because broadcasting properties were easier to buy and an
acquisition would have a negative impact on the company's future
earnings. The Tribune's attention quickly turned to Times Mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, trustees for the family trust unanimously voted
to pursue Tribune Publishing's offer, which then included a mix of
stock and cash. (The family preferred stock because the transaction
would be tax-free for them.) But it was only on Feb. 28 that
Stinehart, at the trustees urging, approached Willes about their
intent, said people close to the talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was totally surprised,'' said a person involved in the
talks. ``He was deeply hurt and antagonistic to the idea.'' But
within two weeks, the deal was done and the boards met well into
Sunday night to approve the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, as Tribune executives spent the day in Los Angeles
answering the questions of analysts and reporters, Times Mirror
journalists from the L.A. Times and Newsday, not to mention The
Baltimore Sun, questioned each other, and their bosses, about their
future. There was concern in some quarters, according to one Times
journalist, about whether the Tribune Co. would offer the same
benefits as Times Mirror.
</P>
<P>
   But amid the gossip, speculation and worry was an undercurrent
of sorrow. ``It is a sad thing, in the sense that endings are
always somewhat sad, and this is the end of an important historical
era,'' said Tim Rutten, the city/county bureau chief at the Times.
``The Chandlers have been an important force in the life of Los
Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``there is a part of Los Angeles still governed
by the ethos of developer _ the quick buck, opportunism and
dynamism that goes with it. We're never been very good here at
stewardship. This is a melancholy example of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Unease was widespread. One reporter in a Newsday bureau, who
asked not to be identified, said, ``We could also be getting a new
publisher sitting in Melville, and that could mean changes all down
the line.'' Newsday's headquarters is in Melville, N.Y., on Long
Island.
</P>
<P>
   Tribune executives said in a conference call that they planned
no immediate changes in the executive ranks at any Times mirror
newspaper. And Willes made it clear he had no intention of staying
with the new company.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Madigan, Willes said, ``John has done a really
wonderful job of running that company. I've been used to being CEO
long enough that I'd just as soon not be something other than
CEO.''
</P>
<P>
   Willes, who had been openly emotional in his meetings with
employees during the day, said that his personal disappointment was
that he would not preside over what he believed would be a robust
renewal in the Times' profits, which had fallen below expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frankly an enormous personal disappointment that I didn't
have a couple more years to let everybody see how profound the
changes have been and how strong the base is on which were
growing.'' He added, ``What I would like my legacy to be is that I
cared so deeply and so profoundly about the role of newspapers in
society that I was willing to take whatever brickbats or criticism
anybody had to hurl at me, for the sake of finding ways to extend,
significantly extend, both the reach and the breadth and the depth
of what we do.''

ASTROS' MINOR LEAGUERS TANGLE WITH ARMED ROBBERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ Aaron Miles plays second base in the Houston
Astros' minor league system, but he was forced to take on another
role Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Miles, five other minor league players for the Astros and a
woman were victims of an armed robbery at their motel late Sunday
night, and he wound up struggling with one of two robbers for a gun
before the police crashed through a window and shot and wounded the
intruder.
</P>
<P>
   The gunman, who was shot six times, was listed in critical
condition at Orlando Regional Medical Center Monday. Joe Brown, a
hospital spokesman, said the gunman had not yet been identified.
</P>
<P>
   The other robber escaped, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Miles was bitten on the back of his neck in his tussle with the
robber, while the other five players and the woman were uninjured,
the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros declined to make any of the players available for
comment Monday, and efforts to reach them at the motel were
unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   But Tim Purpura, the Astros' assistant general manager, said,
``It was an unfortunate situation, but we were lucky that
everything came out the way it did.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident occurred at a Holiday Inn on Route 192, a main road
in Kissimmee, several miles from the Astros' spring training
complex. About 80 of the Astros' 110 minor league players stay at
the motel.
</P>
<P>
   Miles was in Room 252. The other five players and a female
friend of one of the them were in the next room, 254, with the door
open.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a dormitory situation,'' Purpura said, explaining
why the door was open. ``They're real comfortable with each other.
In one room they're watching TV. In another room they're playing
Play Station, just hanging out. It's a real community
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The police said the two robbers burst into Room 254 between
10:30 and 11 p.m. Using plastic ties that lock when put in place,
the two men tied up the five players and the 23-year-old woman, put
duct tape on their mouths, ransacked the room and bundled together
money and other items of value.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the two gunmen get what they want, they leave the room,''
Commander Fran Iwanski of the Kissimmee Police Department said.
``The men inside are easily able to free themselves and lock the
door. One of the men picks up a phone to warn his friend next door.
No one answers the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point the guy tried to call 911. For some reason, it
didn't go though. He calls downstairs to the desk, who in turn
calls police and we respond.''
</P>
<P>
   The two robbers had moved to Room 252, where they burst in and
found Miles alone.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Jeff Bogen arrived at the motel a few minutes after 11
p.m. and was on the second-floor balcony when, he said, a man
emerged from Room 252. The man leaped over the rail, the officer
said, and a semiautomatic handgun fell from his waist or jacket.
Bogen said he lost sight of the man, who escaped.
</P>
<P>
   Inside Room 252, meanwhile, Miles saw a chance to gain control
of the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The player felt he had a chance to maneuver the gun out of the
hand of the gunman and was able to get his hand on the gun,''
Purpura said. ``He tried to steer the gun away from himself and get
control, and they went back and forth.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Houston minor league player said that while Miles held
on to the gun with both hands, the gunman repeatedly punched him
with his free hand. At one point in the struggle, Purpura said,
Miles got the robber against the wall, knocked him to the floor and
was on top of him. But the man still held a gun.
</P>
<P>
   Iwanski said the police officers who were standing outside the
room could hear the struggle. When they heard Miles yell for them
to come into the room, two officers, Peter Szlezak and Glenn Ford,
broke the large window next to the door and climbed through.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they get in,'' Iwanski said, ``they see them still
struggling on the ground. The officers yell for the gunman to give
up and release the gun. He won't release the gun.''
</P>
<P>
   The officers began shooting, wounding the robber, who was taken
by helicopter to Orlando Regional, where he underwent four hours of
surgery. Miles, 23, received a tetanus shot and antibiotics for his
neck bite and was released.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than the mental trauma of it, they're all in great
shape,'' Purpura said.
</P>
<P>
   The other five players were the infielders Morgan Ensberg, 24,
and Keith Ginter, 23; the outfielders Derek Nicholson, 23, and Eric
Cole, 24; and catcher Michael Rose, 23.
</P>
<P>
   Police identified the woman as Alicia Szczerba of Valrico, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Purpura said the team's minor league players have stayed at the
Holiday Inn for seven springs. He said the team had no problem with
the motel, but he also said that both the motel and the Astros
would increase security.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a crime of opportunity,'' he said. ``They saw
some rooms open and they were prepared to do what they did. Whether
it was our guys or someone else, they were ready to go.''

 &HT;    Marino holds back tears as he makes retirement official
 &HT;    By Mark Woods
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVIE, Fla. _ It was one thing to make the decision, to
formulate the words in his head. It was another to actually have
them come out of his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   The first time Dan Marino did it was last Thursday. He was
sitting in the kitchen of his Weston home, having breakfast with
his wife, Claire, when he asked his parents, visiting from
Pittsburgh, to join them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them, 'It is time; it is time to retire,''' Marino
recalled Monday. ``It wasn't a big deal or anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that moment wasn't a big deal. But the second time Marino
said the words _ at 10:08 a.m. Monday _ it certainly was.
</P>
<P>
   Fans stood across the street from the Dolphins' training
facility, waving signs, wearing his number and chanting his name.
The players' parking lot was filled with 13 television satellite
trucks, ready to beam his words all over the country. And inside
the auditorium, more than 150 journalists waited along with former
Dolphins coach Don Shula and former teammates _ from Mark Clayton
to Zach Thomas _ for Marino to enter and repeat what he had said to
his family four days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Not a big deal?
</P>
<P>
   Marino knew better. He spent parts of two days trying to write
his speech. And Sunday night, as he pictured himself delivering it,
he kept telling his wife, ``I can't cry.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't. But it was a struggle from the moment he stepped to
the lectern, pulled out his notes, took a deep breath and, without
wasting any time, made it official. After two decades of racking up
numbers that looked like they belong on a car odometer _ 61,361
yards and 420 touchdown passes _ he was calling it quits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to thank you all for coming,'' he began. ``After 17
years, I would like to announce my retirement from the Miami
Dolphins. After playing this game of football for most of my life,
this was an extremely difficult situation. But I know I made the
right decision for me and my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his eight-minute prepared speech, Marino's voice
sounded hoarse, as if it were on the verge of cracking. He coughed.
He cleared his throat. He bit his lip. He tried to avoid looking at
his family, knowing that if he caught a glimpse of his wife, who
kept wiping away tears with a tissue, he also might lose composure.
</P>
<P>
   When he thanked his five children, he caught his 10-year-old son
smiling, laughed and shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not easy, Joe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not much about the end was easy. He didn't get the fairy tale
ending like John Elway or Michael Jordan. He didn't get his
championship ring. Instead, he spent the final season dealing with
the most frightening injury of his career _ nerve damage in his
neck that prevented him from throwing a football _ and the doubts
of everyone from the media to fans to his head coach.
</P>
<P>
   It ended not in glory, but with a 62-7 loss to Jacksonville in
the second round of the playoffs. And it was the two months after
that game _ the time spent trying to decide whether to retire,
continue with a team that clearly no longer wanted him on the field
for anything other than tribute ceremonies, or head elsewhere _
that Marino on Monday called the toughest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really struggled with this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pittsburgh Steelers called him to talk about coming back to
his hometown. The Minnesota Vikings wooed him, not only offering a
one-year contract but also offering to allow him to fly home after
every game and return on Wednesdays.
</P>
<P>
   He almost accepted that offer, he said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were times I told Claire we were going,'' he said, ``and
two hours later I said, 'No, I don't think I can go.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Marino decided it was time to retire _ a decision he
insists won't change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not play football again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Being close to his wife and children was a factor. But the main
reason, he explained, was the signal he was getting from his
38-year-old body _ especially the legs that are covered with scars
from six knee surgeries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kept coming back to how my legs felt during last season,
going through the neck injury, not knowing whether I was going to
be able to throw the football,'' he said. ``Claire and the kids
were great. They wanted me to play, to be honest with you.''
</P>
<P>
   The day Hank Aaron announced his retirement, baseball's home-run
champ said: ``You can only milk a cow for so long, then you're left
holding the pail.''
</P>
<P>
   Marino could relate Monday. The NFL's long-ball king _ he threw
78 more touchdowns than anyone else in league history _ decided he
had squeezed as much out of his body as he could. He said that
although he never won a title, he felt lucky to have played the
game for so long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not many people have an opportunity to spend 17 years of their
life doing what they truly love to do,'' he said. ``And I stand
before you today, I can say that I had been blessed with a career
greater than I could have ever imagined ... I am going to miss
it.''
</P>
<P>
   As he glanced at his notes and rattled off a list of things he
will miss, Marino's voice sounded strained.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to miss everything about it,'' he said. ``I am
going to miss the friends that I made over this time. I am going to
miss all the good times that we have had together. But, most of
all, I am going to miss Sunday afternoons.''
</P>
<P>
   The hardest part of the day might have come after his speech _
after he finished thanking everyone from Shula to the equipment
staff, but conspicuously missing former Dolphins coach Jimmy
Johnson and current coach Dave Wannstedt _ when Dolphins owner
Wayne Huizenga stepped to the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Huizenga spent the past few weeks trying to accomplish a
difficult task: pave the way for Wannstedt to start his tenure with
a new quarterback, but make sure a rift didn't develop between the
franchise and its most beloved player.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly into his speech Monday, he made an apology of sorts _
not for what happened the past two months but for what didn't
happen in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greatest disappointment that I have as a team owner and as
a longtime Dolphin fan is that you never won the Super Bowl,'' said
Huizenga, who bought the team before the 1994 season. ``There is no
one more deserving of winning that championship than you, and I
just wish that we could have gotten that for you.''
</P>
<P>
   After telling a few jokes and praising Marino for his work on
and off the field _ including the establishment of the Dan Marino
Foundation to benefit children's charities _ Huizenga then
presented Marino with some parting gifts, beyond his obvious Pro
Football Hall of Fame induction in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really is no way we can thank you for what you've
done,'' he said. ``But we can try.''
</P>
<P>
   Huizenga said that no Dolphin will ever wear No. 13 again, that
Marino will be inducted into the team's honor roll at halftime of
the first regular-season game and that a street next to the stadium
will be named after him.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, by the way,'' he said, ``it just might pass by the new
statue that will be erected there in your honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Marino knew beforehand that Huizenga might retire his number.
Still, as the owner made these gestures, Marino rocked back and
forth, repeatedly taking deep breaths. When Huizenga finished, the
men hugged and Marino returned to the lectern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow,'' he said, his voice cracking. ``I guess we are going to
open it up for questions and answers. Not any tough ones, please.''
</P>
<P>
   Marino then spent the next hour patiently answering questions.
He recalled his favorite moment _ a touchdown pass to Mark Duper to
beat the New York Jets in 1985. He talked about his future, saying
he might work as a TV analyst in the near future and that one day
he could see himself following in Michael Jordan's footsteps and
becoming an owner or working in a front office.
</P>
<P>
   He only ruled out two things: playing football and coaching it.
</P>
<P>
   By the end, Marino had relaxed. He analyzed his own performance
for the day _ saying delivering that eight-minute speech was
tougher than any of the 37 fourth-quarter comebacks he led _ and
joked about what it will be like to have a statue next to Pro
Player Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just make sure that it's good-looking and has a nice, tight
belly,'' he said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   There is one thing it won't have: a Super Bowl ring.
</P>
<P>
   That missing piece of jewelry, Marino said, is ``the only
reason'' he thought about going to Minnesota. He wanted to give it
one more shot. But then he thought about the inevitable shots to
his body and decided ``it is time.''
</P>
<P>
   And when he said those words, it was a big deal. Big enough to
prompt live coverage on two networks and every local affiliate. Big
enough to bring reaction from Al Gore, Jeb Bush and Bob Graham. Big
enough to make Marino _ a player known for his emotions once he
walked off the field _ struggle to keep from crying.

QUESTIONS ON HOW FUND RAISING FOR MRS. CLINTON AFFECTS PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., N.J., Fla., S.D., Pakistan, India)  (SUBS to clarify references to Mrs. Clinton) 
(js) 
 By RAYMOND BONNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While President Clinton was engaged in an intense
debate with his advisers about whether to stop in Pakistan during
his upcoming visit to South Asia, a group of Pakistani-Americans in
New York with a keen interest in the decision raised $50,000 for
the Senate campaign of his wife.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing illegal about the Feb. 22 fund-raiser, a
$1,000-a-plate dinner of barbecued chicken kebab, spicy goat curry
and rice at a house on Staten Island. All the donors were U.S.
citizens, the organizers said. And no evidence has emerged that
Hillary Rodham Clinton, who told people at the dinner that she
hoped her husband would visit Pakistan, had influenced her
husband's decision last week to do so. A White House spokesman,
Mike Hammer, said, ``The first lady's views were not part of the
decision-making process.''
</P>
<P>
   But the fund-raiser still illustrates a unique aspect of Mrs.
Clinton's candidacy: While her husband still occupies the White
House, people may seek to influence his policies by making
donations to her Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton spent more than two hours at the fund-raiser, the
organizers said, listening to the concerns of the
Pakistani-Americans, and left before the meal was served. Her hosts
were a group of Pakistani-Americans who wanted to press the case to
the first lady that her husband should visit Pakistan and that his
administration should become engaged in finding a solution to the
war in Kashmir, a territory claimed by both Pakistan and India.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the event's organizers, Suhail Muzaffar, a businessman,
and Asim Malik, a doctor from Long Island, New York, said $50,000
was the minimum amount required before Mrs. Clinton's aides would
add the event to her schedule. The donors were primarily from the
New York metropolitan area, but some came from New Jersey and
Maryland, Malik said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Clinton announced that he would stop in Pakistan for
a few hours during his visit to the region, which begins Saturday.
The decision was a difficult call because of the intense rivalry
between India and Pakistan and the strife between the two nations
over Kashmir, among other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's hosts moved the dinner to an earlier date so that
it would take place before the president's trip, organizers said.
The fund-raiser was organized by the Pakistani community on Staten
Island, and the Pakistani-American Physicians Political Action
Committee, or Pak-Pac, as it is known. Her appearance there was
first reported by newspapers in India.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it went very well, in terms of the message and the
timeliness of it, especially in terms of the president's going to
the region,'' Muzaffar said. In her remarks at the event, Muzaffar
recalled Mrs. Clinton saying, ``I would hope the president would
go'' to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's spokesman, Howard Wolfson, confirmed that remark
and said that she had also told the group that the president wanted
to make the stop in Pakistan. Wolfson also confirmed that the
campaign usually asks for a minimum of $50,000 in exchange for Mrs.
Clinton's appearance at a fund-raiser. Asked if Mrs. Clinton had
conveyed the views of the Pakistani-Americans to her husband,
Wolfson said, ``Everyone in the administration, including Hillary
and the president, hoped that he could go, and said that.'' Wolfson
added that Indian-American groups had also contributed to Mrs.
Clinton's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Pakistani leaders on Staten Island were working with
other ethnic leaders in the borough on a fund-raiser for Mrs.
Clinton that would address issues facing a spectrum of immigrants,
including Arabs and Africans, as well as Pakistanis, said Abdul
Rehman, who was a member of the reception committee at the dinner.
But then, with President Clinton's trip to the region approaching,
he said, the visit to Pakistan became a central focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot deny that the fact that she's the president's wife
makes a difference,'' Malik said. ``But also as a woman, she can
feel more pain for the victims of Kashmir, the women and
children,'' he added, explaining why most Pakistani-Americans are
endorsing her.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The presidential trip was not the only reason the Pakistanis
have for backing Mrs. Clinton's Senate bid, the event's organizers
said. Pakistani taxi drivers and street vendors in New York City
are generally not happy with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, her Republican
opponent, they said. Both the drivers and the vendors have been the
targets of stricter regulations under Giuliani's ``quality of
life'' efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The dinner for Mrs. Clinton was attended by Lanny J. Davis, who
as a lobbyist for the Pakistani government urged the president to
visit the country, but Davis said he played no role in arranging
the fund-raiser. He called $50,000 a ``minor event'' compared to
the amounts Indian-Americans give to campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who was a special counsel to Clinton in the aftermath of
the 1996 Democratic fund-raising excesses, vigorously rejected any
suggestion that somehow it might be considered unseemly for the
Pakistani community to raise money for Mrs. Clinton. `` It is no
different from what Jewish, Italian or Irish-Americans do,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Indian-Americans are generally better organized politically than
their Pakistani counterparts, and they lobbied against the visit to
Pakistan. Indian-Americans have given large amounts of campaign
money to a variety of lawmakers. For instance, Frank Pallone, a New
Jersey Democrat who was a founder of the India caucus, one of the
most powerful in Congress, has received tens of thousands of
dollars in campaign contributions from Indian-Americans who live
outside New Jersey. An Indian-American doctor in Florida, Zachariah
Zachariah, raised more than $500,000 from Indian-American doctors
for President Bush in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Indians and Pakistanis have squared off before in Senate
contests, most notably four years ago in South Dakota. The
Pakistani-American community poured money into the campaign of U.S.
Rep. Tim Johnson, a Democrat, in his successful effort to oust Sen.
Larry Pressler, the Republican author of legislation that had cut
off U.S. military aid to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   But full immersion in the U.S. political game is new for most
Pakistani-Americans. ``We have never been part of the political
system,'' said Malik, of Old Westbury, N.Y. ``And very slowly,
we've realized you have to be part of the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Mrs. Clinton could not stay for the fund-raiser's
dinner, she made a good impression on her hosts, Malik said,
telling them that once she was elected they should come to see her.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to do that,'' he said.

<P>
   SAGAMIHARA CITY, Japan _ This town an hour outside of Tokyo,
unremarkable except for its sprinkling of Chinese and Southeast
Asians, could soon be known as a forerunner of Japan's 21st-century
immigration boom.
</P>
<P>
   Shrinking faster than any other nation, this country's
population is projected to decline by 17 percent during the next
half century. By 2050 the population will dwindle to 105 million
from 127 million now, according to U.N. estimates. To maintain a
steady population, on average, Japanese women would have to give
birth to 2.08 children. But in Japan, by 1998, the last year for
which such information is available, the childbearing average stood
at 1.38 per woman. What is worse, the rapid aging of Japan's people
will further accelerate the population decline as there will be
fewer women of childbearing age.
</P>
<P>
   Government experts, demographers and economists say that as
Japan loses people _ and workers _ the only way for it to maintain
its lofty living standards is to quickly begin accepting immigrants
in far greater numbers and to abandon the age-old comfort of its
near-uniform ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has gone one step further, pointing out that
Japan, which has the lowest percentage of immigrants and expatriate
workers of any advanced industrialized nation, would need to take
in 600,000 immigrants a year just to maintain its present work
force. Already, industries like elderly care, hospital work and the
lowest-paying farming and manufacturing jobs are struggling to find
enough workers to keep up with demand.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Japan's coming demographic crisis, which will affect
everything from financing pensions for the world's oldest
population to supplying workers to crucial manufacturing
industries, any discussion of remedies quickly collides with a
deep-seated social resistance to accepting outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   Sagamihara and the surrounding area came by its immigrant
population through an accident of history, and not as a result of
any repopulation drive. The city was selected two decades ago as
one of the relocation centers for about 10,000 people from
Southeast Asia who were brought to Japan in an extremely rare bid
by this country to absorb part of the region's swelling pool of
refugees. Life in places like this may differ little from the rest
of Japan, but nonetheless, as many as 80 percent of the respondents
in a recent national poll said they opposed allowing any more
immigrants into the country.
</P>
<P>
   Most invoked Japan's historically high unemployment rate in
opposing more immigrants. But experts say there is far more at work
in the rejection _ above all, a tradition of insularity that openly
regards most foreigners, particularly fellow Asians, with disdain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We face tremendous handicaps to internationalize our
country,'' said Masakazu Yamazaki, a playwright from Osaka
University who is a member of a commission recently appointed by
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi to identify national priorities for the
21st century. ``Japanese are not confident about opening up, but
this is because of historical factors. Japan was effectively closed
up until the 1970s or 1980s.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan was, in fact, an officially closed country between 1639
and 1854, with no immigration or foreign travel allowed, on penalty
of death. Since then, the country has scarcely opened. The largest
influx of foreigners was the arrival of thousands of Koreans
brought to Japan to work or fight on its behalf during Japan's
35-year annexation of Korea early in this century. And even after
several generations here, these Koreans have never been truly
accepted into Japanese society. In 1998, the latest year for which
information is available, 1.1 million foreigners were registered
with the government as residents of Japan. Another 270,000 are
estimated to be living here without proper visas.
</P>
<P>
   Yamazaki's panel was created largely because of government alarm
over the implications of Japan's expected population decline, and
worries that Japan's largely homogeneous, monolingual population is
ill prepared to face the challenges of globalization. Even before
the panel's conclusions were published in January, the Justice
Ministry began to formulate new, slightly looser rules governing
what types of jobs foreigners should be allowed to have in Japan.
In an unprecedented pronouncement, the ministry urged Japanese to
``aggressively carry out the smooth acceptance'' of foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many acknowledge, any plans for increasing the number of
foreigners runs up against the harsh realities of a culture that is
fearful, suspicious and often even openly contemptuous of
outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, lock companies appeal to racial fear in advertisements
that bluntly link crime to foreigners. Most real estate companies
openly refuse to take foreign clients. Banks often refuse to lend
to foreigners. And many places of entertainment, from pachinko
parlors and bars to hot baths, maintain a Japanese-only policy.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese disdain for others is directed most strongly at other
Asians, who would be the most logical source of future immigration.
But even the cautious recommendation of increased ``intellectual
immigration'' made recently by the prime minister's panel already
faces serious resistance.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, the prime minister, Yasuhiro Nakasone, set a national
goal for Japan to draw 100,000 foreign university students to the
country annually by the year 2000. But with its reputation as a
relatively unwelcoming place for foreigners _ particularly other
Asians _ the number of exchange students has stagnated around
50,000 since 1993. Foreigners who study in the United States, or
other Western countries, often do so with the desire, or at least
option in mind, of eventually working in the country. Japan's
immigration laws make naturalization almost impossible, and
rigorous work-permit laws and rules governing residency are meant
to discourage prolonged stays.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, foreign faculty members here have often found
themselves subject to discrimination, typically denied equal pay or
tenure and other benefits on the same basis as their Japanese
counterparts. In one recent, widely discussed case, Gwendolyn
Gallagher, a foreign professor who is married to a Japanese and has
lived here for 14 years, was dismissed from Asahikawa University
with the sole explanation that the school needed ``fresh
foreigners.'' To the shock of many foreign academics here, the
dismissal was upheld in court.
</P>
<P>
   In cases like these, many who favor increased immigration say
that the government has often set nice-sounding goals, but has
failed to lead.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese are taught as children that when they find something of
value that has been lost, they should seek to return it. But moral
lessons about discrimination are totally absent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japanese are very interested in racial discrimination in other
countries, but they behave as if they are not aware of the
phenomenon in their own country,'' said Hiroshi Tanaka, a professor
of sociology at Hitotsubashi University in Tokyo. ``Now that we
have these problems in our country we need to have regulation. We
need leadership on this issue, but the basic premise of the
government is that Japanese do not accept foreigners.''
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Here in Sagamihara, in contrast to most of Japan, where
foreigners are few and far between, Asian immigrants represent an
appreciable minority. In Sagamihara City's schools, about 3 percent
of the students nowadays come from countries including Laos or
Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   At the Oshima Elementary School in Sagamihara, a small number of
Chinese, Laotian and Cambodian children blend into their classrooms
so well that a visitor would be unable to point most of them out.
Such scenes make up a sort of best-case fantasy of Japanese who
realize that their country will have to open up to outsiders: As
long as the change is imperceptible, the nuisance will be
tolerable.
</P>
<P>
   But like the country in general, the school makes almost no
concessions to the foreigners who attend it. What is done to help
them depends largely on a few volunteers, and on the goodwill of
the administrators and teachers here.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike an American school, say, in New York or Los Angeles,
there is no special program of second-language instruction, or
special learning classes. There are no social workers to ease the
adjustment of families, and as the academics become increasingly
rigorous in middle school and beyond, few immigrant children are
able to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what has happened to the kids who came in the
early years, but I have heard that some of them have had hard
lives,'' said the school's principal, Tadashi Shinoda. ``It seems
that some of their families have collapsed.''
</P>
<P>
   If mixing is free and easy at the youngest ages, by the time
immigrants reach the age to attend the high school next door, they
find that their young Japanese classmates have frequently absorbed
the hostility to foreigners that is characteristic of their elders
and often express it cruelly.
</P>
<P>
   Korean immigrants to Japan have long known the phenomenon of
taunting and hazing by their school-aged Japanese peers. In this
school district, now it is the turn of the Cambodians and other
Southeast Asians who began arriving here in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had one girl who was looked down upon by schoolmates,'' said
Masahisa Minato, a teacher who recently wrote a study about the
challenges of absorbing foreign students. ``She was told, `You
should go back to your home,' and `You are too black.' Through this
experience, she lost her desire to study.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that kind of condition exists all over Japan, even in
elementary school,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Such attitudes have led many Japanese who advocate greater
openness toward foreigners to feel pessimistic about the future.
Even if Japan faces labor shortages in the near future, they say,
there is little to suggest that hostility toward outsiders will
soon fade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japanese society still has fantasies about our pure blood, and
about the ability of Japanese people to understand each other
better than others,'' said Katsuo Yoshinari, head of the Asian
People's Friendship Society. ``Even if the government or the
business community accepts more foreigners, without much more
effort on our side, these feelings of rejection toward foreigners
will remain strong.''

EDITORIAL: THE POPE'S APOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Tuesday, March 14: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of his 21-year papacy, John Paul II has attacked
the inhumanity of communism and, more recently, the costs of
unbridled capitalism. Now, in the twilight of his career, he has
delivered a solemn apology for the errors of the Roman Catholic
Church over the last 2,000 years. The pope's act of repentance,
delivered as part of the liturgy of Sunday Mass in St. Peter's
Basilica, was a courageous and historic declaration that many of
his own cardinals and bishops opposed.
</P>
<P>
   In calling for a church-wide ``purification of memory,'' John
Paul acknowledged the mistakes and cruelty imbedded in church
history, including the Inquisition, the forced conversions of
native peoples in Africa and Latin America, and support of the
Crusades, whose victims included Jews, Muslims and members of the
Eastern Orthodox church.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul's statement not only reaches back across the centuries
to redress the wrongs of the church, but also looks ahead by
clearing the air for his successors. As long as it was burdened by
its failure to reckon with past misdeeds committed in the name of
Catholicism, the church could not fully heal its relations with
other faiths. John Paul has now made it easier to do that. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some of the things he did not say bear note. The apology was
expressed in broad terms. It was offered on behalf of the church's
``sons and daughters,'' but not the church itself, which is
considered holy. Nor did John Paul directly address the sensitive
issue of whether past popes, cardinals and clergy _ not just
parishioners _ also erred. The pope's apology for discrimination
against women is welcome but difficult to square with his continued
opposition to abortion and birth control, and to women in the
priesthood. Regrettably, he made no mention of discrimination
against homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Another widely noted omission was the lack of a specific
reference to the Holocaust. Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean of the Simon
Wiesenthal Center, expressed regret at that omission but called the
pope's sweeping reference to mistreatment of Jews by Catholics a
``bold and important step forward.'' It comes two years after the
Vatican's ``call to penitence'' on behalf of Catholics who remained
silent in the face of the Holocaust. That earlier statement was a
moving denunciation of anti-Semitism and the Holocaust, but it fell
short of candidly acknowledging the failure of Pope Pius XII to
speak out against the Nazi genocide. John Paul's visit to Israel
next week will provide a striking opportunity for him to address
the suffering of Jews in the Holocaust and the Vatican's role in
the war years.
</P>
<P>
   Bent by age and illness, John Paul is no longer the energetic
leader who did much to speed the demise of communism in Eastern
Europe. But as he demonstrated on Sunday, he still has the strength
of heart and mind to confront the historical deviations of the
Catholic Church and to prepare it for the changes that will come in
its third millennium. &QL;

Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida at the Strawberry Festival in Plant City
on Sunday. The first to grant vouchers to students whose schools

Giuliani's rival, Hillary Rodham Clinton, during a campaign stop at

Photographs of West 52nd Street in Manhattan taken by Percy Loomis
Sperr. In an ambitious effort to expand an already vast photo
archive showing practically every street in New York City as long
ago as the 1870's, the New York Public Library is preparing to
repeat the process to match many of the 54,000 old views with
contemporary ones. Some 30,000 pictures already in its collection

New York would to some extent retrace his footsteps. (Fred R.

   (NYT9) AUSTIN, Texas -- March 13, 2000 -- BUSH-REFORM -- For
Gov. George W. Bush, reform has been a matter of legislative
proposals rather than an overriding political philosophy, which

reformer when asked to describe the governor. Bush during his

Dr. John Tooby, both professors at the University of California at
Santa Barbara, are widely regarded as intellectual leaders of the
evolutionary psychology school. ``Psychologists should be
interested in evolutionary biology for the same reason that hikers
should be interested in an aerial map of an unfamiliar territory

the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, shows off a hard drive
that stores 200 CD's. A music aficionado and a musician himself, he
owns several hundred CDs. Like most students, he moves frequently,
and he is tired of lugging around all that plastic. The solution?
He converted his CD collection to a digital file format called MP3,
a relatively simple process. He now stores his music on his
computer. ``Every time I change dorm rooms, I just carry my hard
drive with me,'' he says. (Tom Herde/Boston Globe)

SPORTS COLUMN: IT'S ONLY WORDS, BUT WORDS ARE ALL THEY HAVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The post-Boomer Esiason Era has begun at ABC's ``Monday Night
Football.'' Too bad all that nastiness he described going on behind
the scenes didn't spill over on the air. Once upon a time it did.
Remember when the love affair was over between Howard Cosell and
Don Meredith? They didn't hide their hatred.
</P>
<P>
   And Cosell ripped all his old friends in his memoirs and railed
about the jockocracy. Danger! Unpredictability! It's a
back-to-the-future prescription.
</P>
<P>
   Don Ohlmeyer, who produced ``Monday Night'' from 1973 to 1976,
is back to save the franchise and find new partners for Al
Michaels. He task is tough. ``Monday Night'' was an aberration 30
years ago, a true event that didn't have cable, home video, the
Internet and professional wrestling against it.
</P>
<P>
   If Ohlmeyer doesn't provide inspired choices, people will wonder
why ABC deemed Esiason expendable. The lineup of usual suspects is
not overwhelming. None will cause angry viewers to blast the screen
with rifle fire.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Johnson's stint on Fox's Sunday studio show demonstrated
his candor, but success on a 60-minute studio program with three
talkative partners does not necessarily translate into greatness
over three hours in the game booth.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Parcells? He defined mediocrity at NBC in the studio and on
games in 1991 and 1992; the Parcells that television may never get
is the one who saves his best stuff for off the air, or in
off-the-record conversations.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Marino? Why would the newly retired Dolphin be better than
Esiason was? The last thing ABC needs is someone with no television
experience. Being an articulate interviewee does not magically
translate into great game analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Young? Not yet retired, he is being considered because of
his so-so stint as an analyst for ABC's postseason studio programs.
Definitely not ready to step into the league with Fox's John Madden
and NBC's Phil Simms.
</P>
<P>
   If you're dipping into the past, then bring back Keith Jackson,
Cosell's and Meredith's partner in ``Monday Night's'' inaugural
season in 1970 before being shoved aside for Gifford. If you're
dipping into the Walt Disney family, then shift Stuart Scott and/or
Sterling Sharpe from ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   Some other choices:
</P>
<P>
   JIM ROME _ He never played the game, but once wrestled on the
air with Jim Everett after deriding the quarterback as ``Chrissie
Evert.'' The host of a syndicated radio show and Fox Sports Net's
``The Last Word'' is young, bearded, opinionated, speaks his own
language of ``smack'' (an on-line glossary is 23 pages long and is
almost as incomprehensible as Scott's personal patois) and could
succeed Cosell as, simultaneously, the most-hated and most-liked
sportscaster in America if given the ``Monday Night'' platform.
Pull Paul Maguire off ESPN's Sunday night telecasts and the team is
complete.
</P>
<P>
   JUDGE JUDY _ Nastier and tarter than Cosell, she wouldn't
hesitate criticizing players, especially the whiners, fakers and
malcontents. Would Marino do that? I hear Judy telling Michaels,
``Shut up, Al, can't ya hear me talking?'' or asking, ``Is Aikman
thick? Do I have to repeat that a screen pass is stupid on
third-and-2? Or do I have to explain it again?'' Teaming her with
Dr. Laura Schlessinger would relieve Michaels of any need to speak
and capture more female viewers. But your hair might hurt after
three hours with them.
</P>
<P>
   WILLIAM BENNETT _ The loquacious conservative politician, former
Cabinet member and crusader for virtues in American life would be
perfect for ``Monday Night'' in an era of players being charged
with domestic abuse and murder. His partner, Bob Dole, would speak
only about players whose initials are E.D.
</P>
<P>
   TERRY BRADSHAW _ Probably impossible to pry from ``Fox NFL
Sunday,'' Bradshaw is a latter-day Meredith: a corny, rambunctious
Southerner who likes to sing. He never wowed anyone at CBS with his
game analysis, but the new ``Monday Night'' won't be about Xs and
Os; it'll be freewheeling entertainment that needs someone who was
recently re-created as a Claymation action figure. And ``Monday
Night'' needs a bald man, to erase the memory of Cosell's rug.
</P>
<P>
   ART DONOVAN _ Who defines old-time football values better than
the legendary Fatso, perhaps the greatest storyteller in the NFL
Films archive? Is anyone funnier than the crew-cut, former
Baltimore Colts defensive tackle? Plus, he's drunk enough beer to
be both analyst and human suds sponsor. For real beer-belly
machismo, hire him in tandem with another NFL throwback, Chuck
Bednarik, who might give Michaels a nasty concussion (as he gave
one to Frank Gifford, who served ``Monday Night'' for 28 years) to
enforce his air time.
</P>
<P>
   BILL MAHER _ The host of ABC's ``Politically Incorrect'' would
usher in a revolutionary new format. Not three, four, five in a
booth, but six around a circle. He, Michaels and four weekly guests
(chosen from a pool to include Sandra Bernhard, Tommy Lee, Laura
Ingraham, Kenneth Starr, Meat Loaf, Leon Spinks, Barry Switzer and
Dr. Joyce Brothers) would spend their three hours dissecting
third-down pass efficiency, uniforms and Al Davis' haberdashery.
</P>
<P>
   THE ROCK _ The inevitable choice to compete for young male
viewers against wrestling at 9 p.m. on Mondays and blunt the impact
of the World Wrestling Federation's planned XFL. So what if he
speaks of himself in the third person? ``The Rock says Keyshawn
Johnson is in motion and that if I get him in the ring next week,
I'll whip his butt for that holdout! Al?'' &QL;

NITWITTY `SON OF THE BEACH' SETS ITS SIGHTS BELOW THE BELT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Those who have spent time watching ``Baywatch Hawaii'' _ and we
know who we are _ might be wondering why Howard Stern decided to
back a comedy series that spoofs one of the best self-parodies
anywhere on TV.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Stack, co-creator and star of ``Son of the Beach,''
explains: ``It's `Get Smart' on the beach. Inspector Clouseau of
the sand.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: Stack and Stern didn't exactly aim to lampoon
``Baywatch.'' They wanted to recapture the irreverent humor of the
old Don Adams spy comedy and more recent satires like ``Airplane''
and the underappreciated cop spoof, ``Police Squad!'' But they
didn't want to recreate the same characters.
</P>
<P>
   So Stack kept coming back to this idea of a lifeguard who was
more than just a lifeguard. A nitwit in the tradition of Maxwell
Smart and Frank Drebin, he manages to right wrongs and survive
life-threatening situations by dint of sheer stupidity.
</P>
<P>
   His name is Notch Johnson, head of a lifeguard unit _ he loves
showing off his unit _ that patrols the sandy strand of Malibu
Adjacent. He also manages to solve murders, bring down drug lords
or, in the case of Tuesday's premiere on the FX cable network,
break up a Cambodian sex-slave ring.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing seems to be off limits to Stack and his co-creators,
David Morgasen and James R. Stein. There are enough Johnson jokes
to keep a locker room of junior high kids snickering for weeks, but
if ``Son of the Beach'' stays strictly below the belt with its
humor, even Howard Stern's hard-core fans may eventually tune out.
On second thought, no they won't.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, ``Son of the Beach'' isn't targeting the ``Masterpiece
Theatre'' crowd. It wants men who like their TV metaphor-free, and
preferably with lots of cleavage. In this case, both qualities are
supplied by Jaime Bergman and Leila Arcieri. Bergman plays the dumb
blonde, B.J. Cummings, who wouldn't know a metaphor from pinafore.
You can probably guess how she got her name. Arcieri plays the
jive-talking ``lifeguard from the inner city,'' Jamaica St. Croix.
Rounding out this group of beach bozos is Roland Kickinger, playing
a ripped Schwarzenegger type named Chip Rommel, an ``exchange
lifeguard'' from Germany.
</P>
<P>
   A new addition to the unit is wholesome, all-American Kimberlee
Clark, the only one with enough brains to take an IQ test. Stack
calls her the Barbara Feldon character, and Kim Oja (pronounced
OH-yah) seems right for the part.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's nemesis is a crooked mayor named Anita Massengil (Lisa
Banes), who thinks ruining Johnson's career will aid her
congressional aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the amusing names, ``Son of the Beach'' specializes in
low-brow humor of questionable taste. It is suitable accompaniment
to mindless, sexist stuff like FX's ``The X Show,'' which airs
immediately afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The potential problem is that it's dumb funny, not smart funny.
This may be what FX is looking for as it tries to become known for
something other than reruns of somebody else's shows. But Stack has
proven he's considerably smarter than Notch Johnson, having hosted
the clever make-believe talk show, ``Nightstand with Dick
Dietrick'' on E! Entertainment Television. If Stack wants to make
an impression beyond the six episodes already in the can, he'd be
wise to aim higher than the crotch.
</P>
<P>
   Son of the Beach. Half-hour comedy series about a dimwitted
lifeguard who manages to succeed in spite of himself. Starring Tim
Stack, Leila Arcieri, Lisa Banes, Jaime Bergman, Roland Kickinger
and Kim Oja. Premieres Tuesday night on FX cable. Parental
guideline rating: TV-14.

RAPTORS AND SONICS ARE FINED $100,000 EACH
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The tension has deepened between the National Basketball
Association and its coaches over the issue of requiring miniature
microphones to be worn during telecasts, with the league imposing
fines of $100,000 apiece Monday on the Toronto Raptors and the
Seattle SuperSonics for the defiant actions of their coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Butch Carter of Toronto and Paul Westphal of Seattle balked at
the league's mandate to wear the mikes during Sunday's regionally
televised game in Seattle, bringing punitive measures by
Commissioner David Stern, who has promised more substantial fines
if coaches fail to comply.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Van Gundy, one of the more vocal critics on the issue, was
scheduled to be miked Tuesday night when his Knicks play the
Houston Rockets at Madison Square Garden. He said he would wear the
microphone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've already stated my objections,'' Van Gundy said. The
executive board of the National Basketball Coaches Association
implied Monday that it may take legal action to prevent the league
from forcing coaches to wear microphones.
</P>
<P>
   Lenny Wilkens, the Atlanta coach and the organization's
president, and several officials of the unit, including Nets Coach
Don Casey, participated in a conference call on the issue along
with Michael Goldberg, a Manhattan lawyer who is the association's
executive director.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enough of them feel strongly about it that we feel duty-bound
to support them,'' Goldberg said. ``If the league insists on
maintaining this stance, the association will have no choice but to
explore all the options available to it to support its members who
do not wish to be miked while they coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Many coaches have objected to the use of microphones because of
privacy issues related to their jobs. In a statement released
Sunday, Westphal, who said he would personally pay the fine imposed
on his team, said: ``The league wants me to allow my private
strategies, insights, relationships and speech to be monitored,
then eventually owned by others. I am being asked to choose between
compromising the competitive integrity of the game or seeing my
ownership fined $100,000. I cannot accept that this great league
would want to force such a choice.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue has created a division in the league office as well,
according to one Eastern Conference team official, who did not want
to be identified. He said there was a concern among some league
officials that the move is an overreaction to low ratings.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was given birth by the league's entertainment division.
NBC was informed in November of the plan to use microphones during
telecasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all fairness, this issue is not a television issue,'' said
Dick Ebersol, the NBC Sports president. ``This is all part of an
Internet strategy _ and not a bad one to be pursuing at that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol said the network was taking great pains to be sensitive
to teams and coaches during the process, and that it was not
counting on the microphones to rescue slumping ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time we put it on the air, it's later in the game,'' he
said. ``We don't put strategy on the air. We don't go inside the
huddle during a timeout because that wouldn't be fair to the
coaches. We're looking for personalities and intrigue. But it's all
adjunct to the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Some players have been emboldened to support their coaches on
the microphone issue. Carter, the Toronto coach, said Sunday that
the team's two veteran leaders, Charles Oakley and Antonio Davis,
did not want him miked.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought it was an invasion,'' Carter said. ``I can't
afford to lose the respect of my players.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks' Allan Houston said: ``It's still a sport. And there
are still certain things that should be shared internally between
players and coaches, players and players, that I don't think other
people should have to hear.'' &QL;

MICROSOFT, ANDERSEN JOIN TO OFFER TECH TO LARGE CORPORATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RICHMAN  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Microsoft and Andersen Consulting agreed Monday to
create a $1 billion, Seattle-based joint venture that will offer
Microsoft technology to large corporations, adding 300 to 500 jobs
in the Puget Sound area over the next three years as it ramps up.
</P>
<P>
   The company, to be called Avanade (``av-uh-NAHD'') and
eventually to employ about 5,000 people, is among the largest
partnerships ever undertaken by either Microsoft or Andersen, an
$8.3 billion management and technology-consulting company based in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Avanade marks the first time Andersen has embraced one company's
technology fully, and heralds an unprecedented assault on
traditional Unix and mainframe strongholds based on Microsoft's new
Windows 2000 operating system.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is big _ really big,'' said Mitchell Hill, the Andersen
Consulting partner and 12-year Seattle resident who will serve as
Avanade's chief executive. Steve Ballmer, Microsoft's chief
executive, said, ``This is a part of the market we've never been
able to form a partnership to serve super, super well.''
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Andersen committed to training 25,000 of its
consultants _ nearly one-third of its staff _ in using Windows
2000, SQL Server database, Exchange Server e-commerce software, and
DNA 2000 development tools. About 3,000 of those will form a
Microsoft consulting division within Andersen.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft will put $385 million in cash into Avanade, while
Andersen will contribute employee training, services and
intellectual property valued at more than $600 million. Avanade
will hire a total of 5,000 people, staffing offices with at least
200 people each in San Francisco, New York, Dallas, London, Paris,
Frankfurt, Sao Paulo, Singapore and Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Hill said he expects the company to generate revenue of $1
billion within the next three years and to go public within two.
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer said the venture's primary competitor will be IBM Global
Services. Antitrust regulators must approve the venture before it
can proceed, but the company expects to be operational within
several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Until the debut of Windows 2000 last month, Microsoft's attempts
to break into the largest, most demanding computing environments _
challenging competitors like IBM, Sun Microsystems and Oracle _
were often fruitless. Now, ``Andersen sees Windows 2000 as a change
in the value of Microsoft and its value to the Fortune 1000
customer space,'' said Geoff Nyheim, Microsoft's director of global
partners.
</P>
<P>
   The market for Avanade's services could reach $15 billion in two
years, Andersen estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Hill said the new company's name combines the word avenue,
referring to ``the journey our clients have to go on,'' and the
word promenade, referring to ``a place _ and the place for the
global economy is the Internet.''

CONNECTICUT POLICE OFFICER CONVICTED IN FATAL SHOOTING 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITCHFIELD, Conn. _ The first Connecticut police officer to be
charged with murder for fatally shooting a suspect while on duty
was acquitted of murder Monday and instead convicted of a lesser
charge of intentional manslaughter, ending yet another trial in a
racially charged police brutality case.
</P>
<P>
   The officer, Scott B. Smith, 28, of the New Milford, Conn.,
police, faces a sentence of five to 40 years in prison for killing
Franklyn Reid, a fleeing suspect, by shooting him once in the back
after chasing him along a local highway and pinning him to the
ground on Dec. 29, 1998. A conviction of murder could have carried
a sentence of life imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's jury verdict in state Superior Court here ended a
three-week trial that had drawn relatively little national notice,
overshadowed by the much higher-profile police brutality cases in
New York involving the death of Amadou Diallo and the assault on
Abner Louima. Like the officers in those cases, Smith is white, and
like the victims in New York, Reid was black.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the officers in the New York cases, however, Smith seemed
favored by public sentiment in Litchfield County, and prosecutors
were not under extraordinary pressure to charge him.
</P>
<P>
   The jury's decision to acquit on the most serious charge but
convict on a lesser one spurred mixed emotions that left spectators
on both sides of the courtroom nearly speechless. Elation among
Smith's supporters as the forewoman said ``not guilty'' quickly
turned to dismay at ``guilty.'' Smith looked toward the ceiling and
shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the courtroom, where Reid's family and
their supporters sat, faces etched with tension burst into relieved
smiles at the guilty verdict. The silence was broken by the Rev.
Henry Price of Hartford, one of several black ministers who had
attended the trial diligently. ``Justice is finally done,'' he
declared.
</P>
<P>
   After closing arguments last week, Judge Charles D. Gill
instructed the predominantly white jury to consider two lesser
manslaughter charges, granting the prosecution's request over the
objections of Smith's defense lawyer, John J. Kelly. That decision
proved crucial, and the jury returned its verdict after
deliberating for a total of about two days.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the jurors seemed relieved as they left the
building without speaking to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   In charging the jurors on Thursday, Gill told them that if they
were to find Smith not guilty of murder, they should consider two
lesser charges: intentional first-degree manslaughter with a
firearm, or reckless manslaughter with a firearm. The crucial
difference, Gill said, was the distinction between intent and
recklessness, and he told the jurors they could convict on one but
not both of those counts.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the manslaughter charges seemed to offer the jury an
alternative to two unpalatable options: convicting a police officer
of murdering a fugitive ex-convict who had a knife in his jacket
pocket when he was shot, or acquitting a white officer of shooting
to death a black suspect under circumstances that many witnesses
described as clearly not warranting deadly force.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Reid, who had served time in prison for stabbing one of his
uncles and having a sexual relationship with a minor, was wanted
for failing to appear in court to face charges of harassment and
violating his probation. He was driving through New Milford on Dec.
29, 1998, and jumped out of his car and ran away when he was
spotted by a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and a partner later saw Reid near a gas station on Route
202, and Smith ran after him. Several eyewitnesses testified that
they thought the chase was over and that Smith had his suspect
pinned to the ground. The prosecution said Smith had his foot on
Reid's back and his gun pressed against Reid's spine when he fired
the fatal shot.
</P>
<P>
   Smith testified that he shot Reid only after Reid resisted being
handcuffed and made a sudden move as if to reach for a weapon. He
testified that Reid had been up on his knees, not lying on the
ground, and had given the officer an intimidating stare. Later
investigation determined that Reid had a small knife in the pocket
of his jacket, which he was not wearing when he was shot but which
was found near his body.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courthouse, Reid's mother, Pearlylyn Reid, thanked
the judge, prosecutors and witnesses. ``Thanks a trillion trillion
trillion times to the jury for your courage to do the right thing
of convicting Scott Smith for the public execution of Franklyn
Reid,'' she said, adding: ``He should be treated like any other
citizen when he is sentenced to prison. He is not above the law.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor, John A. Connelly, also praised the jurors,
saying they ``showed a great deal of courage and they returned an
appropriate verdict.'' Connelly would not say what penalty he would
recommend at the officer's sentencing on May 5.
</P>
<P>
   Smith remains free on $250,000 bail. He left the courthouse with
his family and lawyer, declining to speak to reporters.

WILL KINGS GET CAUGHT IN AVALANCHE?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Kings were not in the running for Ray Bourque,
but they are very interested in the way Colorado has sprinted past
Edmonton since last week's trade for the future Hall of Fame
defenseman.
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche won its fifth straight Sunday night, an impressive
3-1 victory over Philadelphia. It puts Colorado two points ahead of
the Oilers in the Northwest Division and sets up a first-round
playoff matchup with the No.6 Kings.
</P>
<P>
   The trade deadline is 3 p.m. today, but the Bourque deal is
expected to have the biggest impact on the West. Defending Stanley
Cup-champion Dallas has made some moves, but top seed St. Louis has
stood pat. The two also played Sunday and the Stars won 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of Bourque, who at age 39 still has great skill and
an incredible work ethic, blends perfectly with a team that is
getting hot. The Avs jumped far in front of Edmonton in January,
when they spent most of the month at home. But they were passed in
February by the pesky Oilers, who were riding the hot goaltending
of Islanders castoff Tommy Salo.
</P>
<P>
   Now they are back, healthy and happy. Captain Joe Sakic even
offered Bourque his C.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went on a surge in January and then February was just a
terrible month,'' Sakic said. ``I don't know why. We kinda hit the
wall. We've been playing better. We just weren't a confident hockey
team. Our confidence is back. Obviously, with the way we've played
lately and with this trade, we're going to have a dressing room
that really believes in one another now.''
</P>
<P>
   And watch out if the Avalanche get to overtime. In the
four-on-four format, they could go with a lineup of future Hall of
Famers: Sakic, Bourque, Peter Forsberg, goaltender Patrick Roy and
500-goal scorer Dave Andreychuk, who also came over from Boston.
</P>
<P>
   All this, of course, has Edmonton general manager Glen Sather a
little upset. He doesn't have the resources to swing a big deal,
getting only tough but limited defenseman Igor Ulanov from Montreal
for Christian Laflamme.
</P>
<P>
   Sather knows Bourque probably will retire after the season, but
that doesn't help him now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like the whole idea of renting players,'' he said.
``Somehow we have to push the trading deadline back a month, but
the Players Association, of course, would have to agree to that.
I'm sure Colorado made the deal because we're making them nervous.
I'm not so sure it'll work anyway. All those stars they have there
now will be bumping into one another.''
</P>
<P>
   By the way, there is a Kings connection with Bourque. In 1979,
the Boston Bruins sent goaltender Ron Grahame to the Kings for
their No.1 pick (eighth overall), which turned out to be Bourque.
</P>
<P>
   SITTING IT OUT
</P>
<P>
   San Jose was a major player at the deadline the past two years,
getting Vincent Damphousse last season and Bryan Marchment and Joe
Murphy in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   This season, the Sharks probably will slip in with the final
playoff spot but are expected to go out in the first round. Like
the Kings, they have shown interest in gritty veterans like Shayne
Corson and Kelly Buchberger, but both now are off the market.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks, however, might benefit from the Bourque trade
anyway. They do not play the Avalanche again this season, but
Colorado still has three games remaining with Edmonton and one with
Calgary and the Mighty Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   Those are San Jose's top playoff competitors. In fact, the
Sharks played Calgary on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   While Marchment provided solid defense and heavy hitting after
coming over from Tampa two years ago, this had been a lost season.
He is just returning from his third major injury of the year. He's
had knee, ankle and groin problems.
</P>
<P>
   A SURE THING
</P>
<P>
   Most of the season, the Florida Panthers appeared to have the
easiest road to a division title. The Washington Capitals have
created quite a pot-hole.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers' once insurmountable lead in mid-January is gone.
Last week, the Capitals beat Florida at home to take sole
possession of first place in the Southeast Division.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is 20-6-4 since trailing the Panthers by 16 points,
14-2-3 at home since Christmas and 9-0-1 in its past 10 against
division opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Florida came back to beat Tampa Bay two nights later but then
lost to lowly Chicago on Saturday to give the Panthers a 3-8-1
record in their past 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   A division title means home ice advantage in the first round and
an excellent chance against Ottawa, which won't catch Toronto in
the Northeast. But now the Panthers are fifth and could wind up on
the road against No.4 Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want Florida to use a win to springboard where they
could regain their confidence,'' Washington coach Ron Wilson said
after beating the Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extremely disappointing,'' Florida's Ray Sheppard
said.``I think every guy in the room knows how far ahead we were,
and to now be in a dogfight, it should serve as a wake-up call.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most prominent players to suffer during the slump is
the league's leading goal scorer, Pavel Bure. Against Washington,
he was held to just two third-period shots. Bure, once second in
the NHL with a plus-30, is a minus-9 in the past 10 games. &QL;

CRITICS CIRCLE'S BEST FICTION PRIZE IS GIVEN TO `MOTHERLESS
BROOKLYN' 
</HEADLINE>
  (DUPLICATION NOTICE: Also filed in category `e')

<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Motherless Brooklyn,'' a novel about a detective
whose Tourette's syndrome turns his sentences into rhymed barrages
of free association, was awarded the National Book Critics Circle
Award for best fiction Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The book, by Jonathan Lethem of Brooklyn, follows Lionel Essrog
as he tries to solve the murder of his boss and mentor. Essrog's
illness causes him to compulsively tap everything within reach _
six slaps of the dashboard or six touches on the shoulder _ and
makes every conversation a pun-filled call-and-response. ``Alfred
Hitchcock'' becomes ``Altered Houseclock'' and ``friend of the
deceased'' is rendered ``mend the retreats.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing in The New York Times Book Review, the critic Albert
Mobilio said that Essrog's tics evoke James Joyce and that Lethem's
novel ``immerses us in the mind's dense thicket, a place where
words split and twine in an ever-deepening tangle.''
</P>
<P>
   The general nonfiction award went to ``Time, Love, Memory: A
Great Biologist and His Quest for the Origins of Behavior'' by
Jonathan Weiner. The book chronicles the career of Seymour Benzer,
one of the founders of molecular biology, and his work to find the
genes that control aging, mating and memory in fruit flies. ``Mr.
Weiner has a poetic and philosophical turn of mind,'' Richard
Bernstein wrote in a column in The Times, ``and he manages to see
the almost spiritual implications of the search for the deepest
truths about the nature of life.''
</P>
<P>
   The biography award went to Henry Wiencek's ``The Hairstons: An
American Family in Black and White,'' which chronicles the history
of America's largest slave-holding family and their descendants,
both black and white. Wiencek's book traces the slow rise of the
Hairstons' black children and the parallel descent of their white
cousins.
</P>
<P>
   The poetry award went to Ruth Stone for ``Ordinary Words.'' The
collection was published in celebration of the 84th birthday of
Stone, a professor of English at the State University of New York
in Binghamton. The poems touch on issues of aging, poverty and the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Luis Borges, the Argentine writer who died in 1986, won
the criticism award for his collection ``Selected Non-Fictions.''
</P>
<P>
   The collection won praise for its sharp criticism and
philosophical incisiveness.

<P>
   DAVIE, Fla. _ As Dan Marino gave his farewell speech Sunday
after 17 years as the Miami Dolphins quarterback and the National
Football League's most dominant career passing record-holder, he
tried to avoid making eye contact with his wife, Claire, who sat
sobbing nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept telling Claire that I can't cry during this thing,''
Marino said after formally announcing his retirement at the
Dolphins' training facility at Nova Southeastern University. ``I
felt many a time like crying, but I was able to hold back. Tried to
make a few jokes and keep it loose.''
</P>
<P>
   Marino, whose NFL career records include most touchdown passes
(420), most passing yards (61,361) and most completions (4,967),
said he decided to bring his playing career to a close at age 38
mostly because of his health. He has had six knee operations,
ruptured an Achilles' tendon and last season suffered a scary neck
injury that sidelined him for five games.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are physical limitations I would have had to deal
with,'' he said. ``It kept coming back to how my legs felt during
last season going through the neck injury and not knowing whether I
was going to be able to throw the football.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Dolphins indicated by their long, awkward silence that
their interest in Marino had waned, he was temporarily invigorated
by an offer from the Minnesota Vikings. Coach Dennis Green was so
interested in Marino that he offered to let him fly home after
every Sunday game and not return until Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Marino said he had gone through a number of emotional swings
before deciding last Thursday morning to retire. ``There were times
I told Claire we were going and two hours later I'd say, `No, I
don't think I can go,''' he said. ``It is the toughest thing I had
to deal with professionally in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   A source close to Marino said that if the Dolphins had shown as
much enthusiasm for his continuing to play as the Vikings had, he
would likely still be a Dolphin. ``He probably would have gone to
training camp, to see how he felt physically, and then take it from
there,'' the source said.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins have been widely perceived by their fans as
bungling the handling of Marino's status, and hundreds of fans
showed up to give No. 13 a raucous sendoff.
</P>
<P>
   The team's owner, H. Wayne Huizenga, tried to defuse some of the
tension by making several announcements: retiring Marino's No. 13
jersey; saying that a statue of Marino would be placed at Pro
Player Stadium next to one of Don Shula, the Hall of Fame coach;
naming a street near the stadium after Marino, and saying he would
install Marino into the Dolphins' Ring of Honor at their first home
game next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``To put it simply, Danny, nobody did it better than you; you
are the greatest quarterback ever,'' Huizenga said before the pair
hugged.
</P>
<P>
   Shula attended Monday's announcement, as did former Dolphins
Mark Clayton, Dwight Stephenson, Jimmy Cefalo, Kim Bokamper and Joe
Rose. Jimmy Johnson, the recently retired Dolphins coach, was
conspicuously absent, and his successor, Dave Wannstedt, stayed in
the background and left quickly afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between Johnson and Marino became particularly
acrimonious last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would just have to say that our relationship was up and down
at times,'' Marino said. ``We had some great, great days together
and some fun times. And times I wasn't very happy here while he was
coaching, and that is just being honest.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose, a former tight end who became a local television
broadcaster, caught the first touchdown of Marino's NFL career in
1983 against the Raiders, after the rookie from Pittsburgh relieved
David Woodley. But Rose, Marino's roommate on the road,
particularly recalled an occasion when they woke up in Baltimore on
game day to find it snowing hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looks like a four-touchdown day,'' Rose quoted Marino as
saying. ``I said, `You've got to be kidding me.' But that was just
the kind of confidence he had. And he went out and had a great
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Clayton, who teamed with Mark Duper to catch 1,030 of Marino's
passes for 16,743 yards and 134 touchdowns, said they used to kid
the quarterback that they were saving his reputation with acrobatic
catches taken from defenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd tell him that he'd be nothing without us,'' Clayton said.
``He'd dispute that. He'd say, `No, no, no. You didn't make me. I
make you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Clayton said that he and Duper became so comfortable with Marino
that sometimes the quarterback would abandon the usual play calls.
``He'd just say, `Get open, the ball's coming to you,' '' Clayton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Marino was the last of five quarterbacks taken in the first
round in 1983. But that 27th pick soon had Shula's eyes bulging.
Marino passed for a league-record 48 touchdowns in 1984, then had
44 two seasons later, making him the only player in NFL history to
throw at least 40 touchdown passes twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never felt you were out of a ball game with Dan Marino as
your quarterback,'' Shula said. ``Today is the celebration of a
great career _ an unmatched career, really.''

SOUTH FLORIDA FANS RECALL MARINO'S BOYISH EXUBERANCE

<P>
   MIAMI _ The Miami Dolphins' millionaire quarterback was beloved
for his heart-squeezing comeback drives, for his quick release and
his perfect, arching spiral, and for his toughness, for playing
with a battered body that seemed as if it would fall to pieces if
he untied all the knee braces, ankle splints and rib protectors he
wore into battle.
</P>
<P>
   But what Mike Vogt, a fan, will miss most is the feeling that,
every time he saw the famous Dan Marino at work, he was seeing a
boy at play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what we all loved about him was he had this boyish
joy,'' said Vogt, after he learned Monday that the National
Football League's record-shattering passer and South Florida's most
famous sports celebrity had finally, officially retired. ``We all
felt that.''
</P>
<P>
   Marino would smile and even hop in the air like a little boy
when he completed a long pass, and would pout and fret, his face a
bright, shining red, when he was intercepted or a receiver dropped
the ball, recalled the Dolphin fans who were really, at heart,
Marino fans.
</P>
<P>
   It was as if, depending on the situation, he was always on the
verge of either snatching up the ball and going home, or
celebrating with a glass of chocolate milk.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he'd throw the ball, he'd just grin like a 10-year-old
would,'' said Vogt, a computer programmer in Boca Raton who has
been a Marino fan for all of his 17 years as a Dolphin. ``He was
magic.''
</P>
<P>
   Marino, who threw the football down field, with varying results,
more times than anyone in professional football ever has, will not
throw for the Dolphins _ or for anyone else _ ever again. And in
South Florida, even though his retirement had been rumored for
months, people who followed Miami football reacted with a mix of
gloom and relief.
</P>
<P>
   After a disappointing year in which he played injured and played
as a mortal, not the superstar who built a legend, he chose to
retire at age 38 rather than attempt a comeback with the Dolphins
or another team. He watched a young, strong backup win games in his
place, and it became clear that the future did not include him here
in the city that worshiped him, at least not in an aqua-and-orange
uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sundays will not be the same,'' said Richard Molinary, a
customer service representative who works in Hollywood, north of
Miami in Broward County.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be like something's not quite right,'' said Molinary,
who has a fame of his own in Florida sports circles as the
often-photographed ``Miami Fanatic,'' because he paints his face in
Dolphin colors and wears a Dolphins towel like a cape. ``I started
my career when he started his, in 1983, so I've watched him game
after game for all these years. They've been some of the best years
of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Molinary and other fans winced as injuries to Marino's knees and
ankles took their toll, as their hero took the field in football
cleats that were so built-up and padded that they looked more like
the boots worn by Frankenstein's monster. At times, it seemed like
Marino was so tightly bound and strapped that the only thing that
really moved was his arm.
</P>
<P>
   It does not matter to people who loved him that Marino's last
game was a 62-7 playoff loss at Jacksonville. ``He is the Babe Ruth
of football,'' Molinary said, standing outside the Dolphins'
training camp in Davie Monday, as inside, Marino announced his
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Marino did not cry; he just seemed as if someone had let all the
air out of him, even as the Dolphins' owner, H. Wayne Huizenga,
told him he would have a statue erected of Marino outside Pro
Player Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to miss Sunday afternoons,'' Marino said.
</P>
<P>
   Marino became a superstar when Miami was a greatly different
city, when English, not Spanish, was still the principal language
and the region had only the Dolphins _ there was no professional
basketball, hockey or baseball in Miami then.
</P>
<P>
   Now Miami is generally regarded as the financial, cultural and
entertainment capital of Latin America, where international soccer
crowds fill the Orange Bowl. In downtown Miami, where the
storefront signs are mostly in Spanish and the pedestrians, many of
them new Americans, talk of everything but football, Marino's
retirement was barely noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could care less about football or Dan Marino,'' said Lydia
Martin, speaking in Spanish at a courtyard restaurant in downtown
Miami. ``They make him sound like he's God.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make a difference in my personal life,'' said
Martin, who was born in Colombia and has been living in Miami for
three years.
</P>
<P>
   While his retirement was covered by Spanish-language television,
radio and newspapers, Marino's fan base has mostly moved north to
Broward and Palm Beach counties, along with most of the region's
Anglos. Even the Dolphins' stadium itself has moved north, from the
Orange Bowl in downtown Miami to up near the Broward line.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's part of the old Miami,'' said Tony Segreto, an anchor for
WTVJ, the NBC affiliate in Miami, and co-host of Marino's
television show. But, said Segreto, he also drew many new fans from
the new Miami, in the way only a superstar athlete could. ``I don't
think an athlete can ever have the same impact on this town.''
</P>
<P>
   After every famous athlete's retirement, fans and media exhaust
superlatives in creating their legend. But in Miami, say longtime
fans and friends, Marino will be remembered almost as much for what
he did not do as for what he did.
</P>
<P>
   He never won a Super Bowl, ``the burning desire, what I played
for,'' said Marino, who lost his one chance in a 1985 loss to Joe
Montana and the San Francisco 49ers, 38-16.
</P>
<P>
   But, unlike so many sports superstars of the past decade, he
never embarrassed himself in the community he represented. He was
never arrested driving drunk, doing or buying cocaine, soliciting a
prostitute, resisting arrest at a wild party or become entangled in
a nasty paternity suit, said fans. ``He's the kind you want to
emulate,'' said Kenny Dorsey, the freshman starting quarterback at
the University of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of making headlines with the police, Marino made them by
adopting a Chinese baby, Niki Lin, with his wife, Claire, rescuing
the child from an orphanage. He spent and raised millions for
charities. In 1992 he established the Dan Marino Foundation to
benefit children's charities, and did television commercials with
his autistic son, Michael, to help raise money.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's become more than just the guy who throws the ball,'' said
Jimmy Cefalo, who played football with the Dolphins and Marino as a
wide receiver.
</P>
<P>
   His former coach, Don Shula, summed up his quarterback's time in
Miami this way:
</P>
<P>
   ``You just want to applaud.''  &QL;

ANALYSIS: TEMPLE WILL NOT LET SURPRISING UCLA SWIPE THE CROWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last year on this day, headline writers and talking heads had
decided that the National Collegiate Athletic Association
basketball tournament should be renamed the Duke Invitational. The
Blue Devils were sitting on a record of 32-1, they led the nation
in victory margin and the team featured four future National
Basketball Association first-round picks.
</P>
<P>
   The other 63 teams were playing for second place _ except that
no one told a pretty good Connecticut team, which upended the smart
pick in a thrilling championship final.
</P>
<P>
   This year? Well, all 64 teams are playing for the title. At
least 16 of them have a real shot. And except for a few NCAA-made
notorious prep school and summer-league legends, the casual fan
might have a hard time naming the marquee players who are likely to
be their team's first man on the ladder when it is time to cut down
the nets in Indianapolis on April 3.
</P>
<P>
   This year, look for two story lines to keep you in your easy
chair: the revenge of teams that are angry and feel persecuted, and
the Big East's return to the big games.
</P>
<P>
   Until last week, the only player and team that enjoyed both name
recognition and a lukewarm favorite's status from opposing coaches
was Kenyon Martin and Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't any great teams out there _ except Cincy because
physically they are blessed with players,'' Connecticut Coach Jim
Calhoun said recently. ``But by March a lot of teams will be able
to play with them _ including us. Anybody can win this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   When Martin broke his leg in the Conference USA tournament
against Saint Louis, the Bearcats (28-3) were demoted to a No. 2
seeding in the South and may not even get past Tulsa or UNLV in the
second round. So what are we left with? The usual sense of
discovery. But this time around, the Valparaisos and the Miami of
Ohios of tournaments past will go further.
</P>
<P>
   Only the East will unfold according to the seedings. No. 1 Duke
should survive a regional semifinal scare from Illinois and await
Temple in the regional final. The No. 2 Owls bring pathos and
passion. Coach John Chaney has never advanced to the Final Four
despite reaching four regional finals.
</P>
<P>
   He was enraged that NCAA investigators had suspended Kevin Lyde
for a game because a summer team coach paid for a summer school
class when the forward was still in high school. Fortunately, he
has a cooler-headed point guard in the senior Pepe Sanchez, who
will aggravate the Duke freshman Jason Williams and get the ball in
the hands of the Owls scorer Mark Karcher.
</P>
<P>
   In the South, UConn will expose Stanford as a weak No. 1-seeded
team and take advantage of favorable matchups to return to the
Final Four. None of the current Huskies remotely replaced last
season's star, Richard Hamilton. But in Khalid El-Amin, Kevin
Freeman, Jake Voskuhl, Albert Mouring, Soulemayne Wane and Edmund
Saunders, he has got six players who played well and extensively in
last year's title upset of Duke.
</P>
<P>
   In the regional final, the Huskies are again likely get a team
that looks like them, probably Ohio State in a rematch of the
national semifinals. The Buckeyes starting guards, Scoonie Penn and
Michael Redd, get the edge, but only because Redd can create more
shots than Mouring. But the Huskies' five-big-man rotation should
overwhelm the willowy Ohio State center, Ken Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The West Regional is essentially St. John's to lose. No.
1-seeded Arizona will most likely be without its 7-foot-1-inch
center and leading scorer, Loren Woods, who has been nursing a back
injury. The Wildcats are likely to meet a dynamic Fresno State in
the second round and a rugged Texas team with college basketball's
most skilled big man in Chris Mihm. Like Stanford, Arizona may be
gone by the final.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 2-seeded Red Storm, on the other hand, are playing the
best basketball in the nation when by all rights it should be the
most distracted bunch around. They've survived an NCAA
investigation that sat Erick Barkley down for three games and a
halftime argument in the Big East semifinal game between Barkley
and Bootsy Thornton that sent the point guard into a bizarre and
brief leave of absence _ all while winning 11 of their last 12.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's Coach Mike Jarvis has made use of the
you-can't-keep-good- men-down mentality in the midst of the
turmoil. But the fact is _ undersized and undermanned or not _ the
Red Storm is hard to match up with. On most nights, all five St.
John's starters are as at least as quick and athletic as their
opponents star.
</P>
<P>
   What's a Final Four without one totally unexpected attendee.
Most are penciling another of last year's Final Four teams,
Michigan State, all the way to the championship. With the exception
of potential semifinal opponent Kentucky, the No. 1 Spartans,
behind Mateen Cleaves and a mugging team defense, should waltz
until the finals. But against who?
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, UCLA (19-11) looked NIT-bound. But after JaRon
Rush returned from a 17-game NCAA suspension relating to his high
school summer league team, the Bruins showed how talented they were
by beating Stanford in overtime last week. They are bigger, as fast
west coast version of St. John's. A pair of 6-10 sophomores, Jerome
Moiso and Dan Gadzuric, offer inside muscle; Rush slashes and
freshman Jason Kapono is smooth shooter.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Red Storm, the Bruins have something to prove and what
better place than the national semifinals in a game that would make
NCAA investigators nauseous. They beat St. John's.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, it's Chaney's turn _ Temple beats UConn and,
like Calhoun last year, wins a long-awaited championship by beating
the Bruins. &QL;

PURPLE WOULD NOT SUIT THE GAME'S TOP PASSER 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was January in Jacksonville when Dan Marino saw his mortality
flash before him as if he were watching a loud movie in Dolby
stereo. His knees had been operated on so many times that they had
aged in dog years. Marino called those operations ``oil changes.''
His throwing elbow pained him so much, he could barely bend it. And
his arm strength, well, reaching the sideline with one of his
bullets used to be easy; now it took a presidential order.
</P>
<P>
   The signals were there, screaming. He knew it. He was a goner.
The Jaguars had destroyed Marino and the Dolphins, 62-7, in the
second round of the playoffs. In the locker room after the game,
one of Marino's teammates asked him what he was going to do. It was
an awkward question at an awkward time. Marino didn't answer. He
didn't have to.
</P>
<P>
   He was making plans to spend time playing golf, maybe do a
little television commentary and definitely spend a lot of time
with his family. Then his phone started to ring. It was Minnesota
Coach Dennis Green, laying down the purple carpet, courting Marino,
begging him to play. Marino was intrigued and entranced. The
Dolphins did not want him, and there were those Vikings wide
receivers, Cris Carter and Randy Moss, to sweeten the pot.
</P>
<P>
   Marino went back and forth. One minute he was telling his wife,
Claire, he was going to do it; two hours later he would change his
mind, deciding it was too risky. Then, he would think about his
friend John Elway, raising that Lombardi trophy over his head after
all of those years of getting so close, and Marino would change his
mind yet again, thinking that one more run was not out of the
question.
</P>
<P>
   The knees were suddenly young again. The arm had a little more
pepper in it. Marino was at the stage a lot of great players reach;
they know in their hearts it is time to leave the game, but the
aura of football can be overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy, I really struggled with this,'' Marino said Monday at his
news conference in Davie, Fla., at times fighting back tears.
``This has been the toughest moment of my life as far as dealing
with playing football or retiring. After the season I pretty much
thought that I was not going to play anymore. I felt that way for a
while. I think it is because of the physical aspects of the game.
It kept coming back to how my legs felt, going through the neck
injury, not knowing whether I was able to throw the football.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came Green, and all of that changed. But Marino did the
smart thing, not succumbing to what would have been a difficult
dream, leading Minnesota to a Super Bowl victory.
</P>
<P>
   And that is the great news of this day. There won't be those
distorted images of Marino playing in a purple Vikings uniform, his
knees wobbly. Or talk of how he should have ended his career in
Miami, the way there was constant blathering about Joe Montana, the
longtime San Francisco 49er, ending his days in Kansas City. Or
Johnny Unitas, who ended his Hall of Fame days in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Marino came in a Dolphin, and he will leave one. That, by
itself, is a remarkable achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Green's attempt to snag Marino was a smart one, but even he
conceded that seeing Marino in a Vikings uniform would have seemed
strange. ``Dan would have had to do what so many guys are doing
now,'' Green said, ``and that is change teams at the end of a
career.''
</P>
<P>
   When Marino is eligible for the Hall of Fame in five years, it
may be the easiest decision voters ever had. Marino threw more
passes for more completions for more yards and more touchdowns than
anyone else. His 33,508 passing yards in the 1990's are the most in
a decade for any quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to imagine another quarterback duplicating the kind
of success Dan had,'' Don Shula, his former coach, said. ``I know I
won't see it in my lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   Marino's retirement is sad in many ways. The game loses one of
its classiest stars, a man who has donated more time and money to
charity than almost any other player the league has seen. His arm
is ranked in the top 10, but so is his heart.
</P>
<P>
   After 17 years as a Dolphin, this should have been Marino's day.
Instead, he had to share the airways and talk shows with seeding
news from college basketball's national tournament. Who goes to
what bracket in what city from what conference _ can someone wake
us for the Sweet 16, please? The greatest quarterback ever was
elbowing for room on ``SportsCenter'' with Louisiana-Lafayette.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, Marino is almost pitied because he was so
productive, yet unable to win a championship. That fact will stick
to his resume forever, almost overwhelming the miles of passing
yards he has thrown and the oodles of touchdown passes he has
whirled through the sky. Most people in football will never
consider him the best because he failed to get fitted for a Super
Bowl ring.
</P>
<P>
   Yet none of that erases his greatness. It is difficult to
believe there were draft-day doubts 17 years ago about Marino. Some
scouts worried that mechanical flaws in his throwing motion might
be too difficult to correct. Such thoughts seem silly now,
especially since Marino became known for a deadly, quick release.
</P>
<P>
   Silly, yes. As silly as Marino in a Minnesota uniform. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, company officials said Monday, Microsoft
will take a 20 percent equity stake in RealNames, which has filed
for an initial public offering of its stock. Microsoft's chief
executive, Steve Ballmer, is expected to make the announcement at
PC Forum, the annual technology conference here sponsored by
Edventure Holdings.
</P>
<P>
   RealNames charges large corporations $100,000 to $300,000 a year
to license a keyword, and 10 cents to $1 per visit generated. Small
businesses can buy a keyword for $100 a year.
</P>
<P>
   At least for now, the system also refers users in many cases to
the most likely result, even if the keyword has not been purchased
_ for example, Apple Computer if the word ``apple'' alone is typed.
Typing in generic terms like ``pizza''generates a list of search
results.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months Microsoft has incorporated the technology into
its Internet Explorer browser. It will now do so with its MSN
online service as well, enabling it to compete more effectively
with America Online, which has long used its own keyword system
within its proprietary network.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape Navigator, the other popular Web browser, which is
owned by America Online, does not use the RealNames keyword system,
but the deal with Microsoft does not prevent AOL from adopting the
technology.
</P>
<P>
   The RealNames system includes an elaborate tracking scheme that
the company says allows it to measure the effectiveness of offline
advertisements that mention the keyword, and to share that
information with its customers. RealNames hopes keywords will
replace domain name addresses and 800 numbers in print and
television advertising. AltaVista, Inktomi and the Go Network are
among the Internet companies using the system.
</P>
<P>
   Esther Dyson, the host of the conference here, said that using
keywords would be a welcome new way to surf the Web. ``It's a very
nice concept,'' she said. ``There are lots of different ways to get
to URLs, and this is one of them. The world needs more creative
navigation interfaces. It needs point and click, it needs
pictorgrams.''
</P>
<P>
   But she added that just as with the system of allocating domain
names, which is being opened up to competition, there is a
potential danger of a keyword monopoly. ( Dyson is the chairman of
the group that is overseeing the new domain name system, but she
did not speak in that capacity because the organization works by
consensus and only sets policies for the domain system.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that they've done a deal with Microsoft, that obviously
puts them in a much stronger position,'' she said. ``Clearly, as
long as people have alternatives there are no issues, but when
people don't have alternatives, there are.''

<P>
   Boeing's once-docile union of white-collar engineers has been on
strike now for more than a month; airplane deliveries are slipping
again, and some industry analysts have significantly cut their
estimates of the company's first quarter earnings.
</P>
<P>
   If that wasn't bad enough, Boeing's Sea Launch program suffered
a high-profile setback this weekend when a rocket carrying a $100
million communications satellite fell into the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Though the rocket failure had nothing to do with the strike, it
does add to the company's recent problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it would be fair to say Boeing is in trouble,
but they are certainly having their share of difficulties, some of
them self-inflicted,'' Paul Nisbet, analyst with JSA Research, said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Added another industry analyst, who did not want to be quoted by
name:
</P>
<P>
   ``We are starting to get calls from concerned shareholders,
asking us what is wrong at Boeing.''
</P>
<P>
   But he and other analysts said Boeing, and Sea Launch, will be
okay in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   Sea Launch is a joint project that uses a Russian-Ukrainian
rocket called Zenit to launch satellites from a platform in the
Pacific near the Christmas Islands about 1,400 miles southest of
Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   After two straight successes, the third Sea Launch rocket failed
Sunday. It carried a satellite for the ICO Global Communications
system.
</P>
<P>
   The rocket crashed back into the ocean about 2,600 miles
downrange after reaching an altitude of more than 100 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Albaugh, president of Boeing's space group, said in a
statement Monday the Sea Launch partners will conduct a full
investigation. He would not speculate on what went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts downplayed the setback.
</P>
<P>
   ``The space launch business is high risk,'' said Peter Jacobs of
Seattle's Regan MacKnzie.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should not have any long term implications. The Sea
Launch venture has the potential to be a very good business for
Boeing down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   But it does mean that two of Boeing's most important new rocket
programs are grounded at a time the company is trying to establish
itself as the world's leader in the space-launch business.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's Delta 3 program has been delayed by back-to-back
failures. The first rocket blew up in 1998 and the second failed to
put its satellite into the proper orbit last year.
</P>
<P>
   Industry experts believe Boeing will have to use a dummy payload
on the next Delta 3 launch attempt later this year to now prove the
rocket's reliability to customers.
</P>
<P>
   The first Sea Launch rocket also carried a dummy payload. The
second rocket successfuly placed a communications satellite into
orbit.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are both new programs,'' said analyst Nisbet. ``This is
not uncommon.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Sea Launch setback comes at a time when Boeing is
feeling the results of a strike by many of its engineers.
</P>
<P>
   As the strike entered its 34th day Monday neither side showed
signs of new flexibility and no new talks were scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   The stand-off continues to place a drag on airplane deliveries.
Boeing has only delivered two airplanes in March and 16 since
employees walked off their jobs on Feb. 9, according to Peter
Conte, a Boeing spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The union doubts Boeing has even made all of those deliveries,
questioning how the manufacturer can deliver airplanes with most of
its Seattle-area technical workforce on strike.
</P>
<P>
   Both camps also continued to disagree over how many Boeing
employees remain on strike. Boeing said 15,000 engineers and
technical workers were on strike as of March 9, while union leaders
estimated 18,000 workers were involved.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides are battling over union demands for greater
guaranteed raises, the protection of existing benefits, lump-sum
bonuses, as well as other contact proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, on the other hand, wants its technical workers to begin
paying healthcare premiums, and accept other changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still time to resolve this strike with only light to
moderate damage,'' said Richard Aboulafia, senior aviation analyst
with the Teal Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if it goes on, the cost could be potentially ruinous. In
the short term, deliveries and revenues will slip. Pure and
simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Of more lasting concern, he said, is a possible ``brain drain''
at Boeing with its best engineers finding other jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a hot market out there for engineers,'' Aboulafia
said. ``We could see a hollowing of the Boeing work force.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts have cut their estimate of Boeing's first quarter
earnings, which are due out next month, by 20 percent or more
because of the strike. Much of that lost revenue, they said, is due
to planes not being delivered.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing had been expected to earn about 54 cents per share for
the first quarter, based on the average earnings estimate of
analyst surveyed by First Call. Some analysts, however, said they
will cut their estimates by at least 20 cents because of
strike-related issues, such as the undelivered airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   But Nisbet said Boeing should be able to get all its planes
delivered once the strike ends, which means year-end financial
results are not likely to change.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the strike, he said, ``Boeing is doing the right
things.''
</P>
<P>
   That view was echoed by another analyst.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing that comes to mind is, `can Boeing make planes
at a reasonable cost to earn a profit in the commercial airplane
business?' The answer is becoming yes,'' this analyst said.
</P>
<P>
   He said there is a growing frustration on Wall Street that the
striking engineers don't really know what they want.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say they want money, they want respect,'' said the
analyst, who asked not to be quoted by name. ``But that's difficult
for shareholders to get their arms around.''
</P>
<P>
   Nisbet said the strike might even benefit Boeing in the long
run.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they bust the union, they might be better off,'' he said.
``I don't see much sympathy (on Wall Street) for the union on
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Jacobs said Boeing will have to work hard once it
settles the strike to regain lost momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boeing will be challenged to get the production lines back on
track once this strike is settled and regain the productivity
improvements it was able to achieve throughout 1999,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Boeing will have to repair the relationship with its
engineers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company can't afford to have long-term morale problems
with its work force if it is going to achieve the long-term goals
it envisions,''' he said.

WHEELCHAIR ATHLETES WILL GET RECOGNITION
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By LENA WILLIAMS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There will be a competitive wheelchair division in
this year's New York City Marathon.
</P>
<P>
   It will be determined by qualifying times, and have a separate
early start and its own awards ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   The New York City Road Runners Club announced the rules and
guidelines Monday at a news conference in Manhattan. Competitors in
the official wheelchair division will race on the five-borough,
26.2-mile course starting approximately one-half hour before the
regular start and finishing in Central Park. This year's race is
Nov. 5.
</P>
<P>
   The wheelchair division will be limited to 150 entrants who have
qualified by completing a marathon since Nov. 5, 1998, in a time
faster than four hours. If more than 150 qualify, entrants will be
selected based on fastest times. Wheelchair applicants who do not
have the qualifying times will start with the rest of the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will in effect be having two wheelchair events this year,''
said Robert L. Laufer, the wheelchair coordinator and general
counsel for the running club.
</P>
<P>
   Within the competitive division, there will be separate award
ceremonies for athletes using push-rim wheelchairs and those using
hand-cranked chairs. A special version of the Samuel Rudin Trophy,
traditionally presented to the first-place male and female runners,
will be given to the top male and female finishers in each of the
two subdivisions.
</P>
<P>
   Although no prize money will be offered this year to winners in
the wheelchair division, Allan Steinfeld, the director of the
marathon, said organizers planned to offer money next year.
</P>
<P>
   During the past 20 years, the wheelchair race has been held as
an exhibition event, with no prize money or awards. In January, in
response to a discrimination suit filed by a group of disabled
athletes, the road runners club agreed to create a separate
division for wheelchair athletes for the first time in the
marathon's 30-year history.
</P>
<P>
   In a lawsuit filed last year, nine disabled athletes accused the
club, which runs the marathon, of discriminating against wheelchair
competitors by stopping wheelchair racers to allow runners to pass
them, limiting their access to the news media and denying them
prize money or awards.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Such, who won the wheelchair event in 1998 and 1999, and
Tony Niguero, an artist and professional wheelchair racer who
finished third last year, were given the first wheelchair
applications for the 2000 marathon yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Such said the competitive division would attract more elite
wheelchair athletes, and he predicted the field would grow with the
addition of prize money next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wheelchair racing is not a recreational sport anymore; it's a
professional sport like any other,'' he said. ``What they've done
today will add color to the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Niguero agreed. ``I like the energy I see from officials here,''
he said. ``They may have started late, but it's better than
never.''
</P>
<P>
   The club also unveiled a marathon logo. Created by FDT Design,
the blue-and-white logo depicts the five points of the crown of the
Statute of Liberty above a ribbon-shaped design that stands as a
symbol for the starting and the finish ribbon. &QL;

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two of the nation's largest newspaper companies, the Tribune Co.
and Times Mirror Co., both built around newspapers that helped
define the brawling, partisan days of 19th-century journalism,
announced Monday that they would merge. The deal ends 119 years of
ownership of The Los Angeles Times by the Otis and Chandler
families.
</P>
<P>
   The new company would seek to replicate in cities like New York
and Los Angeles the Tribune's success in offering many kinds of
media to the Chicago market. The idea is to create a network of
regional media hubs where advertisers are matched with audiences
through newspapers, television broadcasts and Internet sites.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which will retain the Tribune Co. name, will own 11
daily newspapers, 22 television stations and four radio stations.
The company's newspapers would have a combined circulation of 3.6
million copies, ranking third among newspaper companies after
Gannett and Knight Ridder. Tribune's television stations reach 38.4
million households.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed acquisition of Times Mirror by the Tribune Co. was
greeted with deep skepticism by investors; Tribune shares, which
had closed Friday at $37.1875, fell swiftly to $27.75 as trading
opened, and closed at $30.8125, down 17 percent. Shares of Times
Mirror soared $37.6875, to close at $85.625.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the Tribune's corporate heirs of Robert McCormick and
James Patterson, whose pugnacious conservatism often enraged their
barrel-chested union town of Chicago, are buying out and the
corporate heirs of Gen. Harrison Gray Otis and Harry Chandler, who
used The Los Angeles Times as a political hammer, helping fashion
the southern California desert into the nation's second-largest
city.
</P>
<P>
   Tribune's offer of $6.45 billion in the stock and cash deal _
not including the assumption of $1.8 billion of Times Mirror debt _
also puts an abrupt end to the mercurial five-year stewardship of
the Times Mirror chairman, Mark H. Willes. A former cereal company
executive, he brought an almost religious fervor to his quest to
streamline the company, challenging the newspaper industry to
reinvent itself, increase its audience, and toss out its
shibboleths _ notably the historic separation of the news and
business divisions.
</P>
<P>
   The essential details of the deal were arranged by members of
the Chandler family, without Willes' knowledge, according to both
Willes and Thomas Unterman, the former chief financial officer of
Times Mirror who was a primary adviser to the Chandler family
trusts.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts dismissed the flight from Tribune stock as a
short-sighted reaction, particularly considering the success the
company has achieved in its hometown. Peter P. Appert, an analyst
at Deutsche Bank, said ``the 30-percent-plus profit margins it has
had in Chicago demonstrate the leverage that can be achieved owning
both broadcast and a major newspaper in one market. This gives it
the same potential in Los Angeles and New York.''
</P>
<P>
   The companies overlap in several markets. Tribune bought KTLA in
Los Angeles, now a Warner Bros &UR; . &LR;  affiliate, in 1985. Tribune owns
WTIC, a Fox affiliate in Hartford, Conn., the location of Times
Mirror's Hartford Courant, and WPIX in New York. Newsday, the
second largest among Times Mirror newspapers with a circulation of
575,000, is based in suburban Long Island, within WPIX's viewing
area.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulations prohibiting dual ownership of a daily
newspaper and a broadcast television station are not expected to be
a problem, at least not immediately. If a company that owns a
television station in a market later acquires a daily newspaper in
that market, it can wait until its existing license expires before
seeking a waiver. None of the licenses in Hartford, New York or Los
Angeles expire before 2006.
</P>
<P>
   Appert said he believes that the dual-ownership rules are likely
to be shelved well before then.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Friday's closing stock prices, the offer for Times
Mirror consists of $3.79 billion in common stock and $2.66 billion
in cash. The cash represents a tender for about 28 million shares
at $95 per share, The remaining 40.8 million shares would be
exchanged, with Tribune offering 2.5 shares for each share of Times
Mirror.
</P>
<P>
   In the deal, Tribune was always the suitor. The courtship began
last spring when John Madigan, Tribune's chief executive,
approached Willes to discuss some types of partnership, Willes said
in an interview Monday. But when Madigan raised the prospect of a
merger, Willes said he passed on the offer because he did not
believe that a merger would be acceptable under the terms of the
Chandler Trust, which represents the interests of the Chandler
family in the company. Within days of that discussion, Willes sent
a letter to Madigan telling him so. The two did not discuss the
idea again, said Willes and several other people close to the
talks.
</P>
<P>
   Then in October, there was a major distraction for Times Mirror
executives, as a decision by Kathryn M. Downing, Willes' handpicked
successor as publisher of the L.A. Times, provoked a firestorm
within the newsroom. Downing, without the knowledge of the top
editor Michael Parks, agreed with the owners of Staples Center the
new downtown arena that the Times would share the profits of a
special Sunday magazine devoted to coverage of the center's
opening.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the ensuing furor, Downing apologized for the apparent
conflict, which she agreed endangered the newspaper's editorial
credibility. Willes also said the move was a mistake, but continued
to back Downing.
</P>
<P>
   That storm was beginning to die down in January, when Madigan
and Fuller approached two Times Mirror trustees, William Stinehart
Jr. and Warren B. Williamson, and asked if they could meet. The two
agreed and, over lunch at the California Club, a restaurant in
downtown Los Angeles, Madigan made a case for combining the two
companies. Stinehart and Williamson, said people close to the
talks, were intrigued by the idea and agreed to present it to
members of the Chandler family.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, they also hired bankers from Morgan Stanley to
explore other opportunities. But after a review of possible
partners, Unterman, the adviser to the family, said ``there was no
comparable match with the same breadth or size.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second week of February, a group of trustees went to
Chicago for a day-long presentation by the Tribune Co.'s senior
management. Using charts and graphs, the Tribune executives argued
that combining the Tribune's mix of television and newspaper assets
with Times Mirror's newspapers made sense. As importantly, said
people close to the talks, Tribune executives were suggesting that
they were willing to pay a hefty premium.
</P>
<P>
   The profit potential of the dual newspaper-and-television cities
was ``what caught the Chandler family's interest,'' said Unterman.
Once the trustees returned to Los Angeles, a legal team began
researching whether such a merger was doable under the terms of
their trust.
</P>
<P>
   But Times Mirror was not the only partner the Tribune Co. was
interested in. The company was also holding discussions with
television broadcaster Chris Craft Industries, a 50 percent
stakeholder in the UPN Network. Such a merger would bolster the
Tribune's broadcasting holdings. But ultimately the Tribune Co.
decided against a Chris Craft deal, said a person close to the
talks, because broadcasting properties were easier to buy and an
acquisition would have a negative impact on the company's future
earnings. The Tribune's attention quickly turned to Times Mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, trustees for the family trust unanimously voted
to pursue Tribune Publishing's offer, which then included a mix of
stock and cash. (The family preferred stock because the transaction
would be tax-free for them.) But it was only on Feb. 28 that
Stinehart, at the trustees urging, approached Willes about their
intent, said people close to the talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was totally surprised,'' said a person involved in the
talks. ``He was deeply hurt and antagonistic to the idea.'' But
within two weeks, the deal was done and the boards met well into
Sunday night to approve the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, as Tribune executives spent the day in Los Angeles
answering the questions of analysts and reporters, Times Mirror
journalists from the L.A. Times and Newsday, not to mention The
Baltimore Sun, questioned each other, and their bosses, about their
future. There was concern in some quarters, according to one Times
journalist, about whether the Tribune Co. would offer the same
benefits as Times Mirror.
</P>
<P>
   But amid the gossip, speculation and worry was an undercurrent
of sorrow. ``It is a sad thing, in the sense that endings are
always somewhat sad, and this is the end of an important historical
era,'' said Tim Rutten, the city/county bureau chief at the Times.
``The Chandlers have been an important force in the life of Los
Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``there is a part of Los Angeles still governed
by the ethos of developer _ the quick buck, opportunism and
dynamism that goes with it. We're never been very good here at
stewardship. This is a melancholy example of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Unease was widespread. One reporter in a Newsday bureau, who
asked not to be identified, said, ``We could also be getting a new
publisher sitting in Melville, and that could mean changes all down
the line.'' Newsday's headquarters is in Melville, N.Y., on Long
Island.
</P>
<P>
   Tribune executives said in a conference call that they planned
no immediate changes in the executive ranks at any Times mirror
newspaper. And Willes made it clear he had no intention of staying
with the new company.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Madigan, Willes said, ``John has done a really
wonderful job of running that company. I've been used to being CEO
long enough that I'd just as soon not be something other than
CEO.''
</P>
<P>
   Willes, who had been openly emotional in his meetings with
employees during the day, said that his personal disappointment was
that he would not preside over what he believed would be a robust
renewal in the Times' profits, which had fallen below expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frankly an enormous personal disappointment that I didn't
have a couple more years to let everybody see how profound the
changes have been and how strong the base is on which were
growing.'' He added, ``What I would like my legacy to be is that I
cared so deeply and so profoundly about the role of newspapers in
society that I was willing to take whatever brickbats or criticism
anybody had to hurl at me, for the sake of finding ways to extend,
significantly extend, both the reach and the breadth and the depth
of what we do.''

   WASHINGTON _ A 17-year-old Romanian immigrant from Port
Washington, N.Y., who encrypted a secret message on a DNA strand
won first prize and a $100,000 college scholarship Monday in the
Intel Science Talent Search. She led two other Long Islanders in a
remarkable sweep of three of the top 10 places in the national
competition.
</P>
<P>
   A senior from Midwood High School in Brooklyn also scored among
the top 10 finalists. But two schools in New York City that once
dominated the science competition, the Bronx High School of Science
and Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan, had none among the top 10,
and Stuyvesant had only one winner among the 40 finalists.
</P>
<P>
   The first-place winner, Viviana Risca, a senior at Paul D.
Schreiber High School in Port Washington who emigrated from Romania
eight years ago, submitted a project on steganography, a data
encryption technique that embeds secret computer messages within
large amounts of relatively innocuous information. According to
Intel officials, the message she embedded in the gene sequence of a
DNA strand was ``June 6 Invasion: Normandy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not really complicated,'' Risca said of her research.
</P>
<P>
   Second prize and a $75,000 scholarship went to Jayce Getz, a
senior at Big Sky High School in Missoula, Mont., for a mathematics
project on partition function; third prize and a $50,000
scholarship went to Feng Zhang, a senior at Theodore Roosevelt High
School in Des Moines, for a biochemistry project in molecular
virology.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Risca, the New York state contingent in the top 10
included Eugene Simuni, 18, a senior at Midwood High School in
Brooklyn, who finished fifth and won $25,000 for a biochemistry
project that investigated G proteins; Kerry Ann Geiler, 17, of
Massapequa High School, who finished seventh and won $20,000 for a
project on communication by ants; and Zachary Cohn, 17, a senior at
Half Hollow Hills East High School in Dix Hills, who finished ninth
and won $20,000 for a study of perfect squares.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 40 finalists came from schools that teach students
how to do scientific research, often pair them with professional
mentors and help them prepare for competitions like Intel, formerly
known as the Westinghouse Science Talent Search.
</P>
<P>
   Sidney Barish, the principal of Risca's school, which had three
entries among the 40 finalists, acknowledged that his school had a
special program to prepare students for competitions. ``Sure, in
science, math and social sciences, but not just to get awards,'' he
said. ``We have a rich talent pool in Port Washington, and we try
to address it as it exists.''
</P>
<P>
   The other winners in the top 10, their schools, the amounts of
their scholarships and their projects:
</P>
<P>
   4. Alexander Schwartz, Radnor (Pa.) High School, $25,000,
abstract algebra concerning Abelian groups.
</P>
<P>
   6. Matthew Reece, duPont Manual Magnet High School, Louisville,
$25,000, a proposal on fluid dynamics problems.
</P>
<P>
   8. Elizabeth Williams, Palos Verdes Peninsula High School,
Rolling Hills Estates, Calif., $20,000, perception of light and
shape by the brain.
</P>
<P>
   10. Bob Cherng, Troy High School, Fullerton, Calif., $20,000,
the transition of ammonia and hydrogen halide into ammonium halide.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining 30 finalists will receive $5,000 scholarships. The
finalists were judged by a team led by Dr. Andrew Yeager, a
physician and stem transplantation investigator at the Emory
University School of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The talent search was formerly sponsored by Westinghouse
Electric Corp. and was taken over by Intel two years ago. Intel
gave $330,000 in scholarships and equipment in the competition last
year and almost quadrupled the amount this year to $1.25 million.

CLINTON SAYS HE WILL ACCEPT GERMAN CANDIDATE FOR IMF POST 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to insert new 6th graf. Inserts attributions in 7th and 9th
grafs.)  
(sw) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER and JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Monday told Germany's
chancellor that he would accept Horst Koehler as the new head of
the International Monetary Fund, ending a heated diplomatic contest
over who would lead the institution that battles global financial
crises.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's apparently reluctant support virtually assures that
Koehler, a former German finance official who is now president of
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, will win the
top post at the fund.
</P>
<P>
   But the huge rift that opened during the selection process _
during which Clinton refused to support Germany's first nominee and
developing nations attempted to install their own candidate _
leaves open many questions about how the much-criticized
institution will change, and the tradition-bound method by which
its leaders are chosen.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews on Monday, senior administration officials who had
been far from enthusiastic about Koehler last week were beginning
to tout his strengths, describing him as ``an important player'' in
the economic unification of Germany and in the creation of the
European Monetary Union.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few weeks ago his name was not even on the short list of
finance ministers, central bankers and European politicians judged
by the U.S. Treasury and European officials to have the political
influence and judgment for the job.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, Clinton administration officials had sent signals
that they were partial to the candidate Italy was pushing for the
job, Treasury Secretary Giuliano Amato. Italy had been the most
vocal opponent of Koehler, but agreed to support him at a meeting
Monday of European Union finance ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's approval seemed driven more by a sense that Clinton
could not turn down a second German candidate, and one endorsed
directly by the German chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, according to
administration officials close to the internal deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   Just two weeks ago Clinton rejected the selection of Caio
Koch-Weser, Germany's deputy finance minister. That led one of
Schroeder's top advisers, Michael Steiner, to complain that the
United States ``sees its global role not only in the military area
but also in setting the rules of globalization through the IMF.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, Germany won its struggle. Clinton and Treasury
Secretary Lawrence H. Summers, according to the administration
officials, concluded that they could not violate the 50 year-old,
unwritten rule that allows Europe to fill the IMF post, while the
United States appoints the head of the World Bank. The White House
spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said Clinton had spoken to Schroeder on
Monday afternoon from Cleveland, where he was speaking to promote
his plan for expanded prescription drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president told Chancellor Schroeder that the United States
was prepared to support Mr. Koehler as the new head of the IMF,''
Lockhart said. ``The president and Schroeder agreed that Mr.
Koehler should come to Washington to meet with the IMF board,
particularly with the developing countries,'' Lockhart said. They
also agreed that Koehler ``should retain the talented management
team at the IMF.''
</P>
<P>
   That was thinly-veiled code to suggest that Stanley Fischer, the
No. 2 official of the fund and the man promoted by African and
Middle Eastern nations for the top job, should remain in place.
Fischer, formerly chairman of the economics department at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was the IMF architect of the
bailout of Asia during the economic crisis that began in the summer
of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's decision came only hours after all 15 nations within
the European Union on Monday endorsed Germany's new candidate.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As the administration has learned repeatedly in the past five
years _ first when the Mexican peso collapsed, then when Asia's
tigers, Russia and Brazil saw their economies implode in quick
succession _ the United States has a huge stake in who heads the
IMF.
</P>
<P>
   In return for providing emergency funds and arranging bailouts,
the fund can command huge changes in a country's economic policies.
Sometimes it is heeded, as it was in the case of Thailand and South
Korea, two of its biggest success stories. Sometimes its
prescriptions touch off riots and political instability; it was
widely criticized for hurting Indonesia's poor while saving the
banks that lent the country money. Without question, the IMF's
prescriptions in Indonesia sped the departure of its longtime
dictator, President Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, however, the fund has met considerable political
resistance and little success. It has repeatedly delayed disbursing
funds until Moscow fulfilled its economic commitments. And Koehler
will find himself maneuvering with Russia's acting president,
Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   That will be an important test because Koehler's current
institution, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development,
watched loan after loan to Russia go bad, and often found itself at
the losing end of negotiations with Russian authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Koehler presided over a large-scale write-off of Russian loans
in 1998 that led to the bank's first-ever yearly loss. But it has
since returned to profitability, and Koehler has sought to refocus
the bank of small-business loans and smaller scale development
projects since then.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Clinton clearly endorsed him before hearing his
views on the IMF's future. In the conversation with Schroeder, one
official said, ``the president said we need to engage about what
his vision will be. And Schroeder said `We'll do it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Koehler, 57, never topped the list of European candidates to
head the IMF. When Michel Camdessus announced his retirement last
fall, Koehler's name was among those briefly floated among European
officials. But Germany decided to push Koch-Weser. One reason was
almost certainly domestic politics: Koch-Weser was chosen
personally by Schroeder to serve as the No. 2 official in the
finance ministry, while Koehler held the same job under Helmut
Kohl, the long-time German chancellor whom Schroeder defeated.
</P>
<P>
   Koehler comes closer to meeting the litmus test the Treasury
Department set for any new IMF director. He has a higher political
stature than Koch-Weser, Clinton administration officials said. He
was the financial point man during the unification of East and West
Germany, overseeing West Germany's program to quickly integrate the
East by unifying the currency on terms favorable to the East and
channeling tens of billion dollars in development aid to help
development in the Eastern half of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Koehler was also the top international official in the German
finance ministry when European countries agreed on the terms of
monetary union in 1992. That showed he had much more experience
than Koch-Weser dealing with currency matters _ a crucial part of
the IMF's duties. Koch-Weser focused almost exclusively in internal
management and poverty relief programs during his 25 years at the
World Bank.

ALBANY LAWMAKERS SEEK SUSPENSION OF GASOLINE TAX 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Responding to the recent jump in the price of
gasoline, legislative leaders from both major parties called Monday
for the suspension or even repeal of the state's gasoline tax.
</P>
<P>
   The move by the leaders of the Democratic-led Assembly and the
Republican-controlled Senate is intended to defuse what many
believe will be a major pocketbook issue in this year's elections.
</P>
<P>
   The price of gasoline has risen sharply over the last few
months, and many lawmakers here and across the nation fear voter
reprisal in November if they do not move to address the situation.
</P>
<P>
   The average price of a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline in
the state is now around $1.50 _ up from about $1.25 in December.
The main reason was a move last year by the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries to force up the price of crude oil by
limiting production.
</P>
<P>
   New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani joined the chorus of
lawmakers Monday calling for elimination of the federal and state
tax on gasoline. He also sought to put Democrats on the defensive,
blaming President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore for the
increase.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who will face Hillary Rodham Clinton in a bid for the
U.S. Senate this year, said that people were being ``absolutely
economically ruined by the policies of the Clinton-Gore
administration with regard to gasoline.''
</P>
<P>
   In Albany, the situation has led to dueling proposals, with
Democrats and Republicans attempting to outflank each other on the
politically charged issue in a year when all 211 members of the
Legislature are up for re-election. But no matter which party gains
the upper hand, consumers are almost certain to benefit, because
legislation seems imminent.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic speaker of the Assembly, Sheldon Silver, made the
opening bid when he proposed eliminating the state's 4 percent
sales tax on gasoline in July and August, the height of the summer
travel season.
</P>
<P>
   Silver urged adoption of the measure Monday, saying it would
save drivers $63 million over the two months and encourage them to
travel to New York's vacation destinations. Silver's plan would
also give all localities the option to eliminate their local share
of the gas tax, which ranges from 3 percent to 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York is a tourist state from eastern Long Island to
Niagara Falls,'' Silver said. ``This proposal will make it more
attractive for people to get in their cars and vacation in New
York.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican majority leader of the Senate, Joseph Bruno,
immediately countered with his own plan, calling for the complete
elimination of the state's sales tax on gasoline. His plan would
save motorists about $300 million a year, and it would also allow
localities to repeal their portion of the tax.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno said that the state could afford to provide the tax cut
because his aides estimate that the state will have a budget
surplus of more than $1 billion at the end of the fiscal year. ``We
think that that money really belongs to the taxpayers,'' Bruno said
of the surplus. ``We have to come up with appropriate ways to
return it to the taxpayers.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan is the latest in a rapidly growing list of tax-cut
proposals and spending items that the lawmakers have placed on
their agenda even before budget negotiations have begun in earnest.
The measures will likely lead to weeks, if not months, of
maneuvering between the two houses and Gov. George E. Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   Monday afternoon, Pataki, a Republican, said that he, too,
favored the elimination of the state's gasoline tax. But he warned
that there had to be trade-offs for it in the negotiations over a
new state budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the strength of the state's economy,'' he said, ``we
could afford a tax cut that would get rid of the state's sales tax
on gasoline for years to come, but not if we're going to go on
spending binges in other areas, not if we're going to pass other
massive tax cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats in the Assembly also called Monday for a $1.3
billion rise in state spending in aid to schools, more than triple
the increase that Pataki has proposed, setting the stage for a
protracted budget fight.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans in the Senate, for their part, proposed a $900
million increase in state spending for primary and secondary
education, placing even greater pressure on Pataki to move well
beyond the $355 million, or 2.8 percent, increase he has proposed
for schools.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Democrats are also proposing that the state
provide $500 million to help school districts across the state
repair or replace crumbling buildings. ``It makes sense to invest
in our children,'' Silver said Monday afternoon as he unveiled his
education plan.

<TEXT>
<P>
   After being abroad in the land of fashion, with a suitcase and
Marianne Faithfull singing ``The Ballad of Lucy Jordan'' in your
head as you drive around Paris, it is hard to come back to New York
and the reality of clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Paris changes your perspective every six months, or at least
reminds you that the reason people follow fashion as they would a
twister hurtling across a plain, churning up everything in its
path, is that it produces emotions that can transcend such mundane
questions as ``What will I wear tomorrow?'' Fashion in Paris, and
to a lesser extent in Milan and New York, asks the question, ``Who
do I want to be?''
</P>
<P>
   That was the spirit, if not the message, of the fall 2000
ready-to-wear season, which, for the buyers and journalists who
attended the shows _ and who will spend the next few months placing
orders or deciding which looks they want to promote _ ended 10 days
ago in Paris. Certainly a lot of retailers came away from the
collections with a sense of optimism. After the Chanel show, with
its almost jubilant flaunting of scarves and other feminine symbols
that haven't been seen on the runway in a while, Tina Johnson, the
president and chief executive of Saks Fifth Avenue, said, ``I think
a woman is going to feel beautiful again.''
</P>
<P>
   Joan Kaner, the fashion director of Neiman Marcus, expressed a
similar sentiment, saying, ``I think there's a real return to
pulled-together dressing.'' By this she meant a proliferation of
suits with coordinated blouses or turtlenecks, stockings with
open-toed shoes or spiky sandals, and coats _ with fur, with
gold-embellished belts or just swinging open in plain tweed _
coats, in any case, that say, ``I'm a put-together girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Julie Gilhart, a longtime buyer for Barneys New York, singled
out the collections of Yves Saint Laurent and Dries van Noten for
their sense of refinement and color, and said of Viktor &AMP; Rolf's
first ready-to-wear collection: ``I tried on a lot of their coats.
They make you feel as if you're standing two inches taller.'' She
added: ``I think the designers who really grab your attention are
the younger ones, like Viktor &AMP; Rolf and Nicolas Ghesquiere at
Balenciaga. It's the people who don't have six collections under
their wing. They're just doing their own thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, what Gilhart and her retail sisters are saying is
that the collections that succeeded are the ones that give you the
possibility to be something else _ to be beautiful, to look like
the quintessential coordinated lady heading off to Le Cirque 2000,
or to simply feel a few inches taller.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Chanel show, which for many summed up the
collections, with its chaotic mix of separates, its lanky sense of
sophistication and its open-ended interpretation of what is
feminine, Karl Lagerfeld said: ``In the past, the shows used to
relate to life. Now, the moment they relate to life, they look too
commercial.''
</P>
<P>
   So even a designer as established as Lagerfeld knows he has to
push things. It is true that many of the shows this season seemed
calibrated to get people's attention by presenting clothes that
were pointedly, even extravagantly, unwearable, like those in John
Galliano's show, which were purposefully oversized to make the
models appear as though they were wearing Mommy's swanky threads.
</P>
<P>
   But if you were to place in the hands of a mildly interested
fashion observer two photographs, one of a perfectly nice tweed
coat and the other of a coat trimmed fancifully with fur and
dragging indifferently across the ground, as if the occupant were a
weary romantic waif _ Mimi of ``La Boheme'' _ the odds are the
person would choose the latter as the more interesting. The fact
that the new fall fashion can elicit a purely emotional response,
beyond questions of commerce or practicality, is the most powerful
message of all. Who do you want to be?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a lot of themes emerged from the shows. Expect to see
an abundance of tweeds and houndstooth checks, often in blown-up
configurations, like those in John Bartlett's show. Just about
every designer, it seemed, dabbled in herringbone _ Marc Jacobs,
Tom Ford at Gucci _ while chevron stripes and old-fashioned argyle
patterns turned up in fur and knits, most vividly at Michael Kors.
Separates in crocodile and intarsia _ a technique of piecing
together fabrics to form a printlike pattern _ were ubiquitous, but
likely to be costly.
</P>
<P>
   Suits are making a comeback, though it remains to be seen if
women, only recently liberated from their jackets, will accept the
notion of a structured look, predominantly in a single color like
charcoal or camel. Some of the new suits and coat dresses, with
their razor-sharp shoulders and neat-as-a-pin sobriety, strangely
conjured up images of secretaries or 1960s-era airplane hostesses.
Both Gilhart and Andre Leon Talley, editor at large of Vogue, said
they detected something of this in Ghesquiere's suits.
</P>
<P>
   ``He actually used navy blue, which is not a color we saw a lot
of,'' Gilhart said. As it happens, Cristobal Balenciaga, in the
60's, designed flight attendant uniforms for Air France.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Susan Cianciolo seemed to be on a similar
wavelength with her plain, almost wholesome version of dressing up.
But such clothes require a knowledge of the arcane subtleties of
fashion, which are usually too obscure or marginal to put across
without sounding like an idiot. As Gilhart advised, in retail
parlance, ``You have to have a really good sense of direction.''
</P>
<P>
   A more accessible look, one advanced with convincing clarity by
Jil Sander, is a slim monochromatic suit with the skirt pegged to
just below the knees and worn with high heels of a slightly 1940's
genre. At the opposite extreme of the suit and silhouette story
were Lagerfeld's jackets (or knee-length coats) over a fuller
skirt. Lagerfeld has been touting the idea of wearing a fitted,
small-shouldered jacket with a more voluminous skirt for the last
couple of collections, including his spring haute couture show.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time,'' Kaner of Neiman Marcus said, ``he got it right.''
The look is softer.
</P>
<P>
   By now, one probably has heard enough about ladylike chic to
have developed an aversion toward it. Obviously there are a lot of
ways to approach this style _ with a sense of let-them-eat-cake
luxury, with a sense of camp (think Gucci's quilted caramel leather
coat with overtones of early 1970's jet-set glam).
</P>
<P>
   Or with the knowing spirit of individuality. The telling detail
of Miuccia Prada's collection was the simple grosgrain ribbons _
the kind you used to find in the waistbands of skirts _ that closed
many of the coats. The effect hinted of something poor, raw.
</P>
<P>
   At Balenciaga, the unfinished element was the fraying edge of a
blouse, the tattered bits of yarn and fur piled on the shoulders of
a top. At Comme des Garcons, it was a jacket bursting with stuffing
_ another myth, another image of women exploded.

MALCOLM WILSON, FORMER GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK, IS DEAD AT 86 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Malcolm Wilson, who spent 15 years as Nelson A. Rockefeller's
lieutenant governor and one year as governor of New York, died
Monday at his daughter's home in New Rochelle, N.Y.. He was 86.
</P>
<P>
   Long the understudy (and after 36 years of state service in
all), Wilson finally became governor in November 1973, when
Rockefeller resigned, and inherited a growing fiscal crisis. A year
later, Wilson was swept from office in the post-Watergate
Democratic landslide, losing to Hugh L. Carey by more than 800,000
votes.
</P>
<P>
   Known as a consummate parliamentarian, Wilson spent 20 years in
the State Assembly and then, as lieutenant governor, presided over
the State Senate. His command of the rules was such that, even as
they complained, Democrats could not help but express admiration
for Wilson's political skills.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, who often lapsed into Latin and kept an unfailingly
cheerful mien in public, often gave the impression of being too
erudite, too much the gentleman and too lacking in concern for
appearances to play the roughhouse game of politics. In the
mid-1970s, he refused his aides' pleas to give up the narrow ties
he wore, then badly out of fashion, insisting that they were still
perfectly good.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George E. Pataki on Monday described Wilson as ``a
wonderful human being,'' who, to his detriment, disdained talk of
politics and the careful positioning politicians engage in. He
recalled that in the 1974 campaign, reporters peppered the governor
with questions about President Ford's pardon of Richard M. Nixon.
Wilson disagreed with the pardon, said Pataki _ who was then a
young lawyer working on Republican campaigns _ but Wilson would not
say so because he thought it irrelevant to his post.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of political issues that could have been
attractive and could have helped him in the campaign,'' Pataki
said. ``But what he wanted to focus on was policy.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1938, at age 24, Wilson was first elected to the Assembly
from a district that included his hometown, Yonkers. Using skills
acquired as a member of the Fordham University debating team and an
eye for detail, he became known for his ability to get his bills
passed. One of the best known created the Higher Education
Assistance Corp., which made college loans widely available for the
first time in the state.
</P>
<P>
   In 1958, he threw in his lot with Rockefeller, scion of the
nation's wealthiest family, who had never before run for office.
Wilson became a political tour guide of sorts, driving Rockefeller
about the state to introduce him to local chieftains eager for a
fresh candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Quietly and just the two of them, they made the rounds in
Wilson's own car in order not to flaunt the novice's immense
wealth. Wilson sold his man, who then insisted that Wilson be
chosen as his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Some looked upon Rockefeller as a sacrificial lamb to run
against Gov. W. Averell Harriman, the Democratic incumbent. But
Rockefeller beat the odds and Wilson stood in his shadow for the
next nearly 15 years. Although the law severely limits the
lieutenant governor's executive functions, Rockefeller put Wilson's
vast expertise and connections to use by making him a member of his
inner circle.
</P>
<P>
   Through those years, the two men publicly differed on only one
issue of principle. Unlike Governor Rockefeller, Wilson _ a Roman
Catholic _ opposed the legalization of abortion. He was generally
considered a conservative but, rejecting such political labeling,
he defined himself as ``an economic conservative and a human-rights
liberal.''
</P>
<P>
   Forever loyal, he never spoke ill of the ever-upward spiral of
spending and debt under Rockefeller that led to the fiscal crisis,
though friends and aides said it doubtless contradicted his own
instincts.
</P>
<P>
   As the enduring No. 2, Wilson always presented a proper, for the
most part amiable, face to the world. At the same time, it was no
secret in Albany that he would not mind dropping the ``lieutenant''
from his title once Rockefeller moved on to indulge his well-known
higher ambitions. As he waited, Wilson presided over the Senate
with a ready gavel and an intimidating command of Robert's Rules of
Order.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from his mastery of the state budget, Wilson had a hand in
shaping the Governor's priorities. It was he who persuaded
Rockefeller to press for federal revenue sharing to help states
that were in financial straits, an idea Rockefeller successfully
pushed after Nixon won the White House in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   At age 59, Wilson, by then a grandfather, got his big chance
when Rockefeller, his presidential ambitions thwarted, grew bored
with state government and resigned. (The following year, President
Ford named Rockfeller as his vice president).
</P>
<P>
   One of Wilson's worries as governor was the growing practice by
local governments, particularly New York City, of financing local
government expenses with a dubious array of fiscal gimmickry. At
one point, he admonished, there must come the day of reckoning, as
New York City soon learned when it came near financial collapse.
</P>
<P>
   But the first piece of the fiscal crisis to break into view
occurred in Wilson's own bailiwick, at the state's Urban
Development Corp., which flirted with bankruptcy _ an issue Carey
used against him in the 1974 campaign. After taking office, Carey
accused his predecessor of having tried to hide the severity of the
crisis, and asserted that Wilson's outgoing administration had
granted him ``limited access and little rapport'' during the
transition.
</P>
<P>
   After losing office, Wilson was at first an active political
fund-raiser and a sought-after speaker at party functions. But
increasingly, liberal Rockefeller Republicanism fell from favor,
and Wilson faded from the political scene. He returned to his law
practice and served as chairman and chief executive officer of the
Manhattan Bank for Savings from 1977 to 1986.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, the former Katharine McCloskey, died in 1980. In 1991,
Wilson underwent surgery for an aortic aneurysm, then experienced
serious complications. Since then, he had lived with his daughter
Katharine Wilson Conroy, a lawyer and former member of the New
Rochelle City Council. In addition to Conroy, he is survived by
another daughter, Anne Matthews of Freehold, N.J., and six
grandsons.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Malcolm Wilson was born Feb. 26, 1914, in New York City,
one of four children in a family of Irish and Scottish ancestry.
His first name eventually disappeared, to distinguish him from his
father, Charles H. Wilson, a patent attorney who had made an
unsuccessful run for the Assembly in 1912. His mother, Agnes,
served as a member of national Republican women's groups and as a
district party leader in Yonkers, where the family moved in 1920.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm Wilson graduated from Fordham Preparatory School at 15,
Fordham College at 19 and Fordham Law School at 22, in 1936. He
spent his entire legal career with the White Plains firm that would
become Kent, Hazzard, Jaeger, Greer, Wilson &AMP; Fay, becoming a
partner in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   He enlisted in the Navy in 1943 and oversaw a gun crew on an
ammunition ship that shuttled across the Atlantic and supported the
landings at Normandy and Anzio. He kept his Assembly seat, winning
re-election in absentia, and returned to New York in 1945 with the
rank of lieutenant junior grade.
</P>
<P>
   As a government official, aides said, Wilson was addicted to
detail and studied tomes of reports that caused lesser mortals to
doze off. His discourses on the affairs of state tended to be
soporific, although no Albany insider would have disputed his
ability to grapple with complex issues.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Wilson had a distaste for the oversimplification so
common to politics. Beware of simple answers, he warned, quoting
the Swiss historian Jacob Burkhardt: ``The essence of tyranny is
the denial of complexity.''

PATAKI AND BRUNO BACK BILL TO LET PATIENTS SEE MALPRACTICE DATA 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By WINNIE HU   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Gov. George E. Pataki and the majority leader of
the State Senate, Joseph L. Bruno, threw their support Monday
behind a proposed law that would give patients access to
information about doctors whose insurance companies had settled
malpractice claims against them.
</P>
<P>
   In so doing, Bruno and Pataki, both Republicans, joined
Democratic Assembly leaders who passed a similar proposal last
year. That proposal died in the Senate, where Bruno tightly
controls all legislation, and many Democrats concluded that Bruno
had opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno, though, said the issue was still being worked out.
``We've always had an interest in helping patients get access to
information they ought to have,'' he said. ``We've sort of been
there, but somehow, these things are hard to put together, and be
fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said Monday that he also supported the creation of a
database of malpractice records. Several lawmakers said he had
signaled his approval in earlier conversations with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concept I think is important, that if some doctor has a
horrendous record, that a patient can get that information,''
Pataki said. ``Now, the details have to be worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruno and Pataki have made their endorsements while a diverse
group of patients and advocacy groups have demanded the right to
obtain confidential information about doctors. Under current law,
malpractice settlements are frequently not made public, and
information about lawsuits can be scattered in several counties.
Hospitals' disciplinary actions against doctors are usually kept
confidential.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed law to make such records available to the public,
commonly known as Lisa's Law, is named for Lisa Smart, who died in
1997 during routine gynecological surgery at Beth Israel Medical
Center in Manhattan. An assisting surgeon during the operation, Dr.
Marc Sklar, was on probation with the state at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Sen. Kemp Hannon, a Republican from Nassau County and
chairman of the Health Committee, submitted a bill that critics
said did not go as far as the Assembly's bill in disclosing
confidential information about doctors. It would require only the
disclosure of a verdict in a malpractice case, even though most
claims are settled out of court.
</P>
<P>
   Hannon said Monday that he would amend his bill to extend the
disclosure requirement to malpractice settlements after consulting
with Senate leaders. ``It's a question of getting agreement from
all parts of the Senate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael S. Murphy, a spokesman for the Medical Society of New
York, which represents 30,000 licensed doctors, said the society
opposed releasing information about individual malpractice claims
because it could be misinterpreted. ``Our concern is, taken
individually, malpractice cases bear no correlation to physician
competence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But several advocacy groups praised political leaders Monday for
taking a step toward protecting patients' rights and improving
health care. ``Both the governor and senate majority leader have
correctly diagnosed the problem,'' said Blair Horner, legislative
director for the New York Public Interest Research Group.
``Consumers need better access to information.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Henry S. Middendorf Jr., a prominent New York lawyer
who also was active in conservative politics, serving as vice
chairman of the Conservative Party in New York state, died Thursday
at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was a heart attack, said Robert Speller, a
friend.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Stump Middendorf Jr. was born in Baltimore on Feb. 23,
1923. He graduated from Harvard University and was in the Army in
1945 and 1946.
</P>
<P>
   He received a law degree from Harvard University in 1952 and
another law degree from New York University in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   Middendorf worked for the law firm of Milbank, Tweed, Hope &AMP;
Hadley in Manhattan from 1952 to 1956 and at Gilbert &AMP; Segall, also
in Manhattan, from 1956 to 1959.
</P>
<P>
   He was in private practice since 1959. He was also editor of Law
Today magazine from 1963 to 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Middendorf was vice chairman of the Conservative Party in New
York from 1970 to 1974 and also worked on the presidential
campaigns of Barry Goldwater in 1964 and Richard M. Nixon in 1968
as well as the Senate campaign of James L. Buckley in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965 and in 1974, Middendorf ran unsuccessfully for a seat on
the State Court of Appeals and in 1975 he lost a bid for a seat on
the State Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a brother, J. William Middendorf II of Little
Compton, R.I., and a sister, Sarah Lofving of Portland, Maine.

EDMONDS TRADE TALKS HIT SNAG
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   MESA, Ariz. _ The Angels' search for starting pitching became
that much tougher over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankees continue to have interest in Jim Edmonds
because they are short in the outfield, but their concerns about
the pitching staff have become just as big, diminishing the Angels'
chances of getting Ramiro Mendoza.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Ed Yarnell, whom the Yankees are counting on to win a
job in the starting rotation, was hammered for 10 runs and eight
hits in one inning. It was his first start of the spring because
he's been bothered by back spasms.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza, who can both start and pitch out of the bullpen, is
insurance for Yarnell, as well as 37-year-old David Cone. But even
if the Yankees don't need him to fill a need in the starting
rotation, Mendoza is a vital part of their bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Yankees are not happy with their current
situation in left field _ a platoon of Ricky Ledee and Shane
Spencer _ Yankees manager Joe Torre is saying he'd settle for the
current state of the outfield in order to keep the pitching staff
intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, pitching is what our strength has been,'' Torre told
the New York writers. ``Can we become a better offensive team?
Possibly. But at the expense of your strengths? Then you have to
make a decision. ... I'm a little reluctant to do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Unwilling to trade Mendoza, Yankees GM Brian Cashman is now
talking with other clubs in the hopes of putting together a deal
involving the Yankees, Angels and a third club.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Edmonds continues to live in limbo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone says I'm going to be traded, but the front office
says I'm not,'' Edmonds said. ``Who do you believe?''
</P>
<P>
   ORTIZ HURTING: Pitcher Ramon Ortiz will travel to Los Angeles
today to be examined by Dr. Lewis Yocum. Ortiz, counted on to be in
the starting rotation, was scratched from his scheduled start
Monday against the Chicago Cubs because of stiffness in his right
arm.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz threw about 30 warmup pitches when he told manager Mike
Scioscia and pitching coach Bud Black that his arm didn't feel
right.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't seem very serious, but it's spring right now,''
Scioscia said. ''He had a little bit of discomfort trying to get
loose. He's been throwing very good and very hard. It was good to
take a step back.'' &QL;

<P>
   PENSACOLA, Fla. _ When Gov. Jeb Bush initiated the nation's
boldest voucher experiment last year, it was clear that its fate
would depend on two things: the progress of the students using
taxpayer money for private-school tuition, and the impact on the
struggling schools they left behind.
</P>
<P>
   In their Roman Catholic school plaids and pleats, the voucher
children stand as symbols of the program's promise: One
fourth-grade boy has finally learned to read, and a third-grader is
mastering cursive writing; their parents consider the vouchers a
blessing.
</P>
<P>
   But in the debate roiling American cities over whether vouchers
are the greatest threat to public schools or the best hope to solve
the problems that plague them, the more vexing issues arise at two
elementary schools here in an impoverished corner of the Florida
Panhandle.
</P>
<P>
   Florida is the first state to grant vouchers to students whose
schools fail standardized tests and it will probably soon have the
nation's largest program. It is the model for a national program
proposed by Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the likely Republican
presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   The two schools here, A.A. Dixon and Spencer Bibbs, were the
first in the state to lose students to vouchers when the law took
effect last summer because so many of their pupils performed so
poorly on the tests two years running. While it may take several
years to gauge the program's success, its impact is already
apparent at the two schools, nestled in two of the state's poorest
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   With grants from the district and the state, the schools have
hired more teachers, reducing class size, stretched the school year
by 30 days and added afternoon tutoring.
</P>
<P>
   They have also shriveled the curriculum, stressing subjects that
will help students improve test scores, while shunning science and
social studies _ subjects not covered by the tests. Instead, they
are drilling children on reading, writing, math and, inevitably,
test-taking tips. Field trips have disappeared, replaced by events
like a recent Saturday ``test-taking fair.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're leaving out important parts of the education process,''
lamented Dixon's principal, Judith O. Ladner. ``They're going to
learn what's on a test. But are they going to learn to be able to
cooperate with each other in the business world? Are they going to
be creative thinkers?''
</P>
<P>
   At its core, the question over vouchers is whether a
market-based approach, embraced in so many sectors today, is
appropriate for education. The notion of rating schools based on
the standardized test scores of students is sweeping the nation as
nearly every state strives to hold teachers and principals more
accountable. But beyond providing an escape for children trapped in
failing schools, vouchers may be shifting the student-teacher
relationship in ways that some find troubling.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a low-performing child walks into a classroom,'' said Jim
May, superintendent here in Escambia County, ``instead of being
seen as a challenge, or an opportunity for improvement, for the
first time since I've been in education, teachers are seeing them
as a liability.''
</P>
<P>
   First proposed by the free-marketeer Milton Friedman in 1955,
vouchers have exploded from a pilot program of 300 students in
Milwaukee in 1990, to 63,840 children in 31 states today, most from
low-income families who enter a lottery. That includes 11,538
students, chiefly in Cleveland and Milwaukee, using public money to
attend private schools, and about 70 small programs throughout the
country that are less controversial because they are financed by
philanthropists.
</P>
<P>
   Florida has only 53 students using vouchers for private schools
and another 85 who transferred to higher-performing public ones.
</P>
<P>
   But school grades being released in June could expand the
program to as many as 60,000 students in 78 schools; those schools
received `F's' last year because of poor performances on the
Florida Comprehensive Assessment Tests and their students will be
eligible for vouchers if they are rated `F' a second time.
</P>
<P>
   Though they still touch only a tiny fraction of the nation's 52
million schoolchildren, vouchers are among the most contentious
issues today in cities including New York, and form a key point of
dissension between Bush, the governor of Texas, and Vice President
Al Gore, his expected Democratic opponent.
</P>
<P>
   More than 25 state legislatures are considering voucher plans _
many, like Florida's, linked to standardized test performance _
while constitutional challenges to programs here and in Cleveland
are expected to land before the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The philosophical gap is wide: Opponents fear vouchers will
drain resources from troubled schools, leaving them worse off for
the students who stay. Advocates say that vouchers give poor
children opportunities akin to the affluent and will make weak
schools improve in order to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Research so far has been murky, as partisans pick apart each
others' studies, challenging the results and the methods.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, experts believe that students using vouchers to attend
private schools score slightly higher on math and reading tests
than the students who remain in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   But ``the great question that nobody can really answer,'' said
John F. Witte, a University of Wisconsin political scientist who
has published a book on the Milwaukee voucher program, is, ``Does
it create competition and does it create change?''
</P>
<P>
   Things are certainly different this year at Bibbs and Dixon,
schools where nearly all the students are black and poor enough to
qualify for federal free breakfast and lunch programs.
</P>
<P>
   Hallways at Bibbs are lined with posters of sample answer sheets
for the Florida assessment test, and efforts to redefine the
dreaded ``F'' label: ``We are Fueled, Focused and Fighting.'' At
Dixon, there is a trophy case of prizes _Pokemon toys, a Sony
Playstation, a color television _ for those who score best on the
tests.
</P>
<P>
   Inside every classroom, the mission is clear.
</P>
<P>
   In Vickie Ward's fifth grade, there was an orange FCAT math
workbook on every desk as Ward drilled the students on writing
multidigit numbers in standard form _ numerals _ and word form.
Fifth-grade math scores count toward the school grade.
</P>
<P>
   Rosa Dean's fourth-graders were practicing an FCAT reading
comprehension exercise; their reading scores help determine the
school's rating.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do the process of elimination,'' advises Dean, sounding
like the high-priced test-preparation gurus who coach teenagers for
the College Boards. ``You have four choices; try to get it down to
two choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers at Bibbs and Dixon, and the parents who spurned the
vouchers, blame the F's largely on demographics: Many of their
families are headed by single mothers or grandmothers on welfare
with little education; kindergarteners arrive never having picked
up a book, not knowing the alphabet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a bicycle, and the man next door has a Cadillac,'' said
Georgia Smith, a kindergarten teacher at Bibbs. ``If you're going
to compare the distance I can travel with the man who has a
Cadillac, well, let me swap vehicles with that man, and then see
how far I can travel.''

 PENSACOLA, Fla.: can travel.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Indeed, across Florida, no school where less than 10 percent of
the students qualify for free lunch scored below a C, and no school
where more than 80 percent of the students qualify scored above a
C.
</P>
<P>
   Many Florida educators want the school grades to take account of
socioeconomics, or focus on a school's improvement from year to
year, rather than judging all schools on the same criteria.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Gallagher, the state's education commissioner and the
architect of the school-grading plan along with the governor, said
improvement will help dictate school grades as soon as the
assessment tests are old enough to track annual progress. But ``our
expectations are the same for a first-grader in Coral Gables as it
is for Bibbs or Dixon,'' he insisted. As for whether test
preparation has squeezed out enrichment programs and even basics
like science, Gallagher is not worried: Nobody can pass the test,
he noted, without reading its directions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't operate in our society if you can't read, write and
do math,'' he said. ``You can operate in our society if you haven't
been on a field trip, if you haven't had any art this year, if you
haven't been to gym, and if you haven't had any science.''
</P>
<P>
   Though parochial students do not take the FCAT, those using
vouchers must. But there is no sign of the test _ no posters in the
hallways, no mention of multiple-choice bubble techniques _ at
Little Flower, one of the five private schools, four of them
Catholic, where former Bibbs and Dixon students have enrolled.
</P>
<P>
   In classrooms arrayed around a central courtyard with a
fountain, fifth- graders are writing persuasive letters, while
first-graders put on a puppet show. In the computer laboratory,
students are compiling databases of the books they have read.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, it was nothing but work sheets,'' said Patricia
White, whose daughter, Katrina English, took a voucher. ``Now,
homework every night, books, essays to write. We just finished a
report with poster board and such _ we didn't even leave the house
last Saturday!''
</P>
<P>
   The teachers say they have tweaked the curriculum _ cutting
spelling tests from 20 to 10 words a week for one boy _but that the
acculturation process was little different than with other
public-school transfers.
</P>
<P>
   Many voucher families had always wanted to send their children
to religious school but could not afford it; some were just fed up
with what they saw as behavior problems and low expectations at
Bibbs and Dixon.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Cameron, whose son, Ray, is repeating fourth grade this
year at St. Michael's, called Dixon ``a giant sewer'' where ``the
academic atmosphere is nonexistent.''
</P>
<P>
   White said she volunteered in Katrina's class every day last
year, and saw third-graders still struggling to identify letters;
even if vouchers are ruled illegal, she will keep Katrina in
Catholic school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got cable, it'll go,'' White said. ``The telephone? That's a
luxury. I will get a night job. I'll do what I have to do. She's
getting a better education.''
</P>
<P>
   In this very enthusiasm over the children's progress lies a
potential pitfall.
</P>
<P>
   Whether vouchers are targeted by income, as in Milwaukee or
Cleveland, or by school performance, as here in Florida, they are
typically seized by families with relatively more money and better
educational backgrounds; the most disenfranchised of the
disadvantaged groups stay behind, only making the educational
challenge steeper.
</P>
<P>
   As Bibbs and Dixon struggle to get off the ``F'' list,
principals and teachers are working overtime, and children are
focused as they study in small groups, aided by a huge influx of
volunteers serving as mentors.
</P>
<P>
   Evaluating their effectiveness is tricky. In the writing
laboratory at Bibbs, fourth-graders cheerily chant a rhyme about
adverbs; but they cannot name any. They enthusiastically sing a
song diagramming sentences, but when asked to define a
``predicate,'' one of the items they have just identified, the
children are at a loss.
</P>
<P>
   In Dixon's corridor, a simple sign suggests the complexity of
the challenge: ``Teach half as much, twice as well.''

   The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, March 14:
</P>
<P>
   The general election campaign has gotten off to an unusually
fast start, and it has done so under a cloud of suspicion created
by Attorney General Janet Reno's incompetent and politically biased
response to the campaign finance abuses of the 1996 campaign. The
prospective Republican nominee, Gov. George W. Bush, has every
right to take advantage of news reports that Reno protected Vice
President Al Gore from the searching inquiry recommended by senior
Justice Department officials. That said, Bush's fully justified
criticism of Clinton-Gore fund-raising in 1996 should not divert
attention from the fact that in the 2000 campaign debate Gore is
right about how to fix the campaign finance laws, and Bush is
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has learned the hard way about the need for reform. He let
himself be used by President Clinton to raise huge amounts of soft
money. He will be haunted the rest of his career by his appearance
at the Buddhist temple and by his assertion that there was ``no
controlling legal authority'' to prevent fund-raising telephone
calls from the White House. Since the independent counsel law has
lapsed, any lingering questions about the 1996 campaign should be
resolved by the Justice Department's campaign finance task force
under new leadership chosen from the department's professional
ranks. If Gore has legal liabilities there, he will have to address
them.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, voters should insist that Bush match the commitments
being made by Gore __ as well as Bill Bradley and John McCain _ to
fix the existing law. The vice president wants to outlaw unlimited
soft money contributions to the parties by corporations, unions and
wealthy individuals and to move toward full public financing. Bush
opposes public financing and has even chosen not to accept the
spending limits set under current law as a requirement for getting
federal funds. Bush would also exclude wealthy individuals from the
ban on soft money contributions, a step that would keep the special
interest money flowing.
</P>
<P>
   There was a clear tactical imperative to Gore's admitting to his
1996 fund-raising ``mistakes.'' But that does not detract from the
importance of his pledge to make campaign finance reform a major
theme of his campaign. His promise means that even with Bradley and
McCain out of the race, the nation's election laws will remain at
the top of the issues agenda for 2000. Gore needs to improve his
proposals by suggesting new enforcement powers for the Federal
Election Commission, which would help prevent future attorneys
general from blocking investigations of their own party. Bush, for
his part, needs to couple his criticism of Gore with proposals that
would really improve campaign finance laws instead of perpetuating
loopholes for the wealthy.

EDITORIAL: DESPERATE RHETORIC FROM THE NRA

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, March 14:
</P>
<P>
   Americans have become used to hearing nutty talk from leaders of
the National Rifle Association. But Sunday's outrageous assertion
by the group's executive vice president, Wayne LaPierre, that
President Clinton is ``willing to accept a certain level of killing
to further his political agenda'' deserves special condemnation.
</P>
<P>
   LaPierre made his sick suggestion that the president relishes
having gun tragedies to exploit in an interview on ABC's ``This
Week.'' He was there to push the NRA's demonstrably false line that
the nation already has enough gun laws on the books if only the
administration would enforce them. Thanks largely to the NRA's
lobbying, those laws do not adequately address issues of supply,
distribution, design or child access.
</P>
<P>
   In a new advertising campaign the NRA's president, Charlton
Heston, accuses Clinton of engaging in lying and scare tactics to
win support for gun control measures bottled up in Congress. But
for dishonesty, it is hard to beat the NRA's own whopper in trying
to portray the group as a friend of the reasonable gun safety
measures it has been fighting to defeat or water down.
</P>
<P>
   The sparring came just days after Clinton's meeting with key
congressional leaders at the White House failed to produce progress
in freeing a modest gun control package from the House-Senate
conference committee where it has been stalled for months. The
sticking point remains the strong gun-show provision that cleared
the Senate last May over the NRA's vehement opposition. This
provision would extend to gun-show sales the same background check
requirement that now applies to guns purchased from licensed
dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Two Democratic senators, Charles Schumer of New York and Richard
Durbin of Illinois, are planning to step up the pressure by
attaching gun control amendments to other legislation coming to the
floor. This will force recorded votes on matters with broad public
support, like mandatory trigger locks and background checks of
buyers at gun shows, flea markets and Internet sales.
</P>
<P>
   Only two weeks ago a 6-year-old killed a classmate with a
handgun, one of many reasons gun regulation promises to be an issue
in the long political campaign ahead. The chief obstacle to saner
gun control remains the obstructionism of the NRA, whose extremist
views and rhetoric should offend Americans fed up with all the
gunfire.

   The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, March 14:
</P>
<P>
   Buried in President Clinton's new budget is a cleverly designed
proposal to encourage pharmaceutical companies to invent new
vaccines for poor countries. The proposal would address a severe
problem. Malaria, tuberculosis and AIDS kill more than 5 million
people each year. Yet effective vaccines do not exist, in part
because most of the victims live in poverty and cannot afford
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's task was to find some way to encourage drug
companies to invest huge amounts of money in long-term research to
produce products that few of their intended customers could afford.
The answer was a targeted tax credit.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, drug companies would be given a credit against
their taxes of one dollar for each dollar of sales of new vaccines
they make to government or nonprofit agencies in the world's
poorest countries _ in effect doubling the companies' money on each
sale. That could create sufficient incentive for an expensive
research program.
</P>
<P>
   The administration proposes to spend $1 billion over nine years
on the tax credit _ about the same that Unicef spends each year on
its vaccination programs. One reason to believe the credit will
work is the successful record of a similar tax credit for
low-income housing that has successfully channeled corporate money
to community groups in some of America's worst slums. The drug
credit would be limited to new vaccines for malaria and any other
infectious disease that kills more than a million people each year.
With any luck, the benefits for mankind could be spectacular.

ALFRED NEAL, 87, AN ECONOMIST WHO INFLUENCED TRADE POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alfred C. Neal, an economist whose interest in developing the
global economy influenced United States trade policy in the 1950s
and 1960s, died March 8. He was 87 years old and lived in Sarasota,
Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Neal, who was one of 11 children, got early exposure to
free-enterprise realities when he was 10 years old and began
delivering milk, using a pony and a cart, to other families in his
hometown of Kentfield, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   As a college student, he arrived at the University of
California's Berkeley campus in 1929, just weeks before the stock
market crash that led to the Great Depression. As a result, Dr.
Neal's career became focused around the prevention of similar
catastrophes.
</P>
<P>
   While much of the economic theory at the time contended that
peacetime economies were doomed to failure, Dr. Neal worked to find
alternatives to war that would permit businesses to flourish. Among
those was the concept of a controlled recession that would affect
some people, but not all, for a brief period of time, and prevent
deeper economic problems.
</P>
<P>
   After Berkeley, he studied at the London School of Economics,
where Harold Laski, the political theorist and socialist, was one
of his professors. Dr. Neal earned his doctorate from Brown
University.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II he worked at the Office of Price
Administration, moving on to the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the war he became the first president of the
Committee for Economic Development, a nonprofit organization of
economists and company executives that tried to foster progress
around the world. He worked with many prominent economists,
including Alan Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Neal's sister, Carolyn N. Hedley, said: ``The Depression
left deep impressions on Al. When he graduated from Berkeley, all
of the graduation speakers just spoke in despair and said we
couldn't live without wars, that if you didn't have a war raging
the economy would go to hell.''
</P>
<P>
   With Arthur Burns and Donald Watson, Dr. Neal wrote ``Modern
Economics,'' which became widely used in the 1940's as a basic
textbook. He retired in 1976 from the Committee on Economic
Development, and is credited with influencing the creation of the
European Economic Community; helping to rebuild the German and
Japanese economies after World War II; and getting the United
States off the gold standard. He advised President Dwight D.
Eisenhower, President John F. Kennedy and President Lyndon B.
Johnson on trade as a member of several commissions.
</P>
<P>
   As head of the Committee on Economic Development, ``he was
unique in his ability to bridge the gap between the ivory tower and
the marketplace,'' said Sol Hurwitz, who worked with Dr. Neal on
the committee. ``He brought business leaders together with
economists, and the two sides actually developed a healthy respect
for one another _ and they learned from one another,'' Hurwitz
said.
</P>
<P>
   He took pride in the committee's counterparts in Japan, Germany,
and Sweden, among other countries, and worked to strengthen them.
He also had a knack for persuading the committee's trustees to come
to an agreement on something. ``He didn't simply wait for a
consensus to unfold,'' Hurwitz said. ``With a twinkle in his eye,
he would tell them what the consensus ought to be and would bring
them around to his way of thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the office, Dr. Neal, who had no children, loved to
entertain with clambakes held in his backyard in Harrison, N.Y.,
where he lived for many years before moving to Sarasota in 1997. He
was also knowledgeable about wine, and shared his insights with his
siblings. ``After a while, we knew a good Margaux,'' Dr. Hedley
said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Dr. Hedley, of Sarasota, he is survived by three
sisters, Stella Hadley, of Petaluma, Calif.; Rose Nelson of Azalea,
Ore.; and Jeanne Doellstedt of Richmond, Calif.; and two brothers,
William, of Novato, Calif., and James, of Santa Rosa, Calif.

PATAKI URGES REVAMPING OF GOP PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY RULES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Gov. George Pataki on Monday urged a revision of
the presidential primary rules that so embarrassed his Republican
Party this year, proposing to make the ballot simpler and to make
it far easier for candidates to enter contests.
</P>
<P>
   But one change that he proposed could meet resistance in the
Legislature. It would make New York's primary a winner-take-all
Republican contest like California's, an idea opposed by the state
Senate majority leader, Joseph Bruno.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's bill would put all recognized candidates on the
ballot, ending the requirement that they gather thousands of
signatures, a certain number in each congressional district. That
process has proved difficult for many candidates, particularly
insurgents, and has been described as the most difficult system in
any state for getting on the primary ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's bill would also eliminate the listing of delegates'
names on the ballot _ with the candidates listed below in tiny
print _ in favor of having voters cast their ballots directly for
candidates. The structure of the ballot in the March 7 primary was
widely derided as confusing and intended to benefit the party
favorite, George W. Bush, who had the best-known slate of
delegates.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as a week ago, the governor's aides had said they
were unsure that he would act on the matter at all and that there
was no hurry because the next presidential primary was now four
years away. But last week, his fellow Republican, Bruno, called his
party's primary system ``absolute nonsense'' and said he would seek
to change it, whether the governor did so or not.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why he had decided to move quickly, after all,
Pataki, speaking at a news conference in the Capitol, said: ``It's
the right thing to do. Obviously, there's no primary for four
years, but why not do it now?''
</P>
<P>
   In most respects, Pataki's proposal jibes with Bruno's, and if
experience is any guide, they are likely to reach a compromise this
year. Bruno said Monday that he had not seen the governor's
proposal but that he generally liked the sound of it.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno said last week that he did not favor a winner-take-all
system. In fact, he said, he disliked the fact that New York's
system had awarded Bush 67 delegates and 26 to Sen. John McCain,
though the popular vote was much closer, 50 percent to 44 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, each party gives the others free reign to set
their own ballot access rules, so that if Bruno and Pataki reach
some agreement, the Democrats who control the state Assembly would
go along with it. Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver's office declined
to comment Monday on the governor's bill. The Democrats'
presidential primary rules are much like what the governor has
proposed for the Republicans, though the primary is not a
winner-take-all contest.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ballot access first became a political issue in the 1996
campaign, when the state's Republican establishment, united behind
Bob Dole's presidential campaign, tried to keep Steve Forbes off
the primary ballot. After taking considerable abuse over that
effort, Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato, then the state's most powerful
Republican, and Pataki, both seeming contrite, said the rules
should be changed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the state eliminated many of the highly technical rules
for gathering petitions to win a place on the Republican ballot. In
1999, the state cut the number of signatures needed by 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as McCain found this year, obstacles remained. It is hard
for an insurgent to find the troops to circulate petitions, and
hard to find enough Republicans in some districts to sign them.
There are also many surviving technical rules that allow an
opponent to challenge petitions in court, in the hope of knocking a
candidate off the ballot: the person signing must list the city or
town of residence, not the village; the person circulating the
petition must live in the same congressional district as the people
signing that petition.
</P>
<P>
   With the support of Pataki, who headed the Bush campaign in New
York, the Republican State Committee went to court to challenge
McCain's petitions in the hope of knocking him off the ballot in
many parts of the state. But a federal judge ruled against the
entire system and ordered McCain placed on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   With good-government groups and newspaper editorials railing
against New York's system, McCain turned it into a potent symbol of
the fear with which some party leaders viewed his underdog
candidacy. He derisively referred to New York's governor and its
Republican Party chief, William D. Powers, as ``Comrade Pataki and
Comrade Powers.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the governor's plan, any candidate who has qualified for
federal matching funds, or who is deemed by the state Board of
Elections to be a generally recognized candidate, would win an
automatic place on the ballot. Candidates who do not make it
through either of those routes could still reach the ballot through
the difficult petition process.
</P>
<P>
   Good-government groups that have demanded such election changes
welcomed Pataki's proposal. But they asserted that it should be
extended to elections for state offices, where a dizzying array of
highly technical rules are still used to keep challengers off the
ballot.

THANKS TO DNA AND FAMILY'S PERSISTENCE, MAN IS CHARGED IN A 1979
MURDER 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. _ When Carolyn Gregory appealed to an old
friend in public office to help reopen the 20-year-old case of her
sister's unsolved murder, it was not the advent of new DNA-matching
technology that inspired her. It was the ache of another year gone
with no answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to get it resolved before her daughter Lakisha's 23rd
birthday, because her mother did not see her own 23rd birthday,''
said Gregory, whose sister, Diane, was killed at 22. ``Lakisha
wanted to have a dinner to mark the occasion and I wanted to have
some information to give her.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Gregory got her wish. She was told that DNA collected
from bloody linens and a shard of glass found in her sister's
apartment matched a DNA sample taken from a jailed robber, Walter
Gill. It was the first DNA match in a cold murder case _ unsolved
and inactive _ since legislation was passed last fall allowing the
state to create a criminal offender databank from DNA samples of
convicted felons.
</P>
<P>
   It was also the first news in the murder case that Gregory had
heard in decades. In August 1979, her sister, Diane Gregory, the
single mother of Lakisha, then 2, was found stabbed to death in her
apartment on South Second Avenue in Mount Vernon, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   At first there were leads, and the police kept the Gregory
family informed. Carolyn Gregory, just a year older than her
sister, took on the job of helping her distraught mother cope and
raising Lakisha. After a year, there were no arrests, no more leads
and no more calls from the police.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard,'' said Gregory, 44, who attended a news
conference here Monday in which the Westchester district attorney,
Jeanine F. Pirro, announced that Gill would be charged with
intentional murder. Gov. George E. Pataki also attended, and called
for expanding the DNA database and eliminating the statute of
limitations for some felonies.
</P>
<P>
   Standing next to her mother, Pauline, and her niece, Lakisha,
Gregory fought back tears and said she was grateful that a suspect
had finally been named.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest part of this was having her daughter grow up
without a mom and not knowing who did this,'' said Gregory, who
wore a gold pendant shaped like a broken heart that read ``Big
Sis.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was a suspect,'' she said. ``We assumed that it was
someone she knew that we knew. We never felt safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Then in September, Gregory, an administrator for a turnstile
manufacturer, called her old friend, Steven D. Horton, who is now a
Mount Vernon councilman. Horton went to school with the Gregory
sisters and lived around the corner from them. He is Lakisha's
godfather.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Horton kept in touch with the Gregorys, who
moved to New Rochelle soon after the murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``She called me and said it was the 20th anniversary of Diane's
murder,'' Horton said. ``It dawned on me that the family hadn't
really put it behind them in all that time. I had gone on with the
business of living, but the family hadn't been able to turn the
page.''
</P>
<P>
   So in the fall, Horton went to see Mount Vernon's police
commissioner, Gertrude LaForgia, who was just putting together a
cold case squad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to laugh,'' Commissioner LaForgia said. ``I said, `We
just put together a case squad going back to 1980 and now you are
asking me to go back to 1979.'''
</P>
<P>
   She put the Gregory case on the list at just about the time the
criminal offender database was approved. Gill, who has been
convicted of nine felonies and eight misdemeanors since 1969 and is
serving a 10- to 20-year term in Sing Sing Correctional Facility in
Ossining, was among the first group of inmates asked for blood
samples.
</P>
<P>
   Gill, 49, knew Gregory, though the police would not disclose the
nature of their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that Gill knew, when the blood was taken a few
months ago, that he would be caught,'' Pirro said. ``He wasn't
surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, he confessed to the murder, said Commissioner LaForgia,
who would not discuss a motive.
</P>
<P>
   When Lakisha turns 23 on April 9, she will have the dinner party
she wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think now it will probably be a little larger than we
thought,'' Gregory said.

CARDINAL IGNATIUS KUNG, 98, LONG JAILED BY CHINA, DIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Cardinal Ignatius Kung, one of China's most enduring
religious dissidents, who spent most of his adult life in a battle
of wills with the Communist government over his right to practice
his Roman Catholic faith, died Sunday in exile at his nephew's home
in Stamford, Conn. He was 98.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was stomach cancer, said his nephew, Joseph
Kung, who arranged for Cardinal Kung to go to the United States for
medical care in 1988 after he was released from more than 30 years
in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a man who became of symbol for world leaders in all
countries in their fight for religious freedom,'' his nephew said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Ignatius Kung, born in Shanghai in 1901, was ordained a priest
in pre-Communist China, in 1930. He was consecrated as bishop of
Shanghai, the first Chinese to hold that post, just days after the
Communists took power in 1949, setting up a battle that would
consume his entire life.
</P>
<P>
   He spent the next half-century tirelessly declaring his devotion
to Roman Catholicism and the pope despite long prison terms and
constant pressure from the Communists to support the
state-sanctioned ``patriotic'' Catholic church.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing does not recognize the authority of the pope over the
millions of Catholics in China and broke diplomatic ties with the
Vatican in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   From the start of the Communist era, Bishop Kung refused to
affiliate himself with the government-backed Chinese Catholic
Patriotic Association and instead led his own group of devout
Catholics, the Legion of Mary, which continued to hold its own
religious activities through the early 1950s despite frequent
arrests of its priests. Knowing that he, too, would at some point
be imprisoned, he trained hundreds of lay people and members of the
clergy to pass on the Catholic faith, his nephew said.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 8, 1955, Bishop Kung and 200 priests from Shanghai were
taken into custody.
</P>
<P>
   But for the next three decades he perpetually frustrated China's
leaders with his unwillingness to recant. According to his nephew,
during a ``struggle session'' in 1956 at Shanghai's dog racing
stadium, the bishop was pushed to the microphone to confess. But
all he said was: ``Long live Christ the King. Long live the pope.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Kung was finally brought to trial in 1960 and sentenced
to life in prison for leading a ``counterrevolutionary clique under
the cloak of religion.'' For the next 25 years he spent long
periods in solitary confinement. Unswerving in his loyalty to the
church and the pope, he was not allowed to receive visitors,
letters or money to buy essentials _ despite repeated requests by
his family, human rights groups, governments and religious
organizations, his nephew said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, while still in prison, Bishop Kung was secretly
elevated to cardinal by Pope John Paul II, who used his authority
to appoint cardinals ``in pectore,'' meaning the appointment was
not made public. It was disclosed only in 1991, by which time
Cardinal Kung had long since left China and was living at a center
for retired clergy in Bridgeport, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, after Cardinal Kung had spent 30 years in prison, the
Chinese authorities released him to house arrest at the age of 84.
He was officially freed from house arrest two and a half years
later and went to the United States for medical treatment shortly
thereafter, in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   He was never allowed to return to his homeland, and he spent the
last 12 years of his life celebrating public masses and
spearheading a media campaign to publicize the plight of China's
Catholics through the Cardinal Kung Foundation, based in Stamford.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, in a telegram to Bishop Edward M. Egan of Bridgeport,
the pope praised Cardinal Kung for his ``heroic fidelity to Christ
amid persecution and imprisonment.''

NASA'S MARS FAILURES PUT UNDER MICROSCOP 

</HEADLINE>

c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The cheaper, faster, better strategy that successfully propelled
NASA to Mars with a small roving robot three years ago crumbled
just as spectacularly because it took success for granted,
according to two reports released by the agency Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The more exhaustive study, conducted by a nine-member panel led
by Marshall Space Flight Center Director Art Stephenson, was
initiated after the losses of NASA's Mars Polar Lander on Dec. 3
and the Mars Climate Orbiter on Sept. 23.
</P>
<P>
   Valued at a combined $372 million, the two failures have thrown
into disarray NASA's long-term efforts to determine whether Mars
was once warm and wet enough to support life. The program gathered
public and political momentum July 4, 1997, when NASA's $262
million Pathfinder mission reached an ancient Martian watershed
with a small camera-equipped robotic rover.
</P>
<P>
   NASA Administrator Dan Goldin pledged to make changes in
response to the findings released Monday, but he vowed to stick
with the strategy he brought to the agency in 1992 of stepping up
the frequency of planetary missions by scaling back costs of
expensive missions.
</P>
<P>
   A year after his arrival at NASA, the agency lost a $1 billion
orbital probe as it neared Mars when a fuel line ruptured.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people have said loudly and clearly they desire a
government which costs less and does more. NASA has heard that
message and embarked on a fundamental cultural change over the last
several years,'' Goldin said. ``We knew this change would not be
easy. These reviews have identified where we can and must do
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldin has assigned NASA's chief engineer, Brian Keegan, to
coordinate the development of a corrective strategy by mid-summer.
Much of the effort will borrow from Monday's second report,
compiled by Tony Spear, who managed the Pathfinder mission before
he retired from NASA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to slow down, not rush too quickly into important
programs and projects, plan and implement them more carefully, and
move away from fixations on cost and near-term gain,'' Spear said.
He urged NASA to do more to foster the risk assessment skills of
its future managers.
</P>
<P>
   The reviews of the recent Mars probe failures concluded that
NASA had become too absorbed with meeting cost and schedule
objectives as it attempted ever more ambitious missions. The
failure to assess the risks with sufficient vigor was accompanied
by a lack of engineering oversight, lapses in communication among
top managers and failures to deal with a shortage of experienced
personnel.
</P>
<P>
   The oversights caused the Climate Orbiter to reach Mars after a
nine-month journey from Earth on a trajectory that was too low as
it attempted to maneuver into orbit. The spacecraft either broke up
in the thin Martian atmosphere or skipped off into a useless orbit
around the sun.
</P>
<P>
   In November, the same team of investigators determined that an
embarrassing mix-up between NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and
its contractor, Lockheed Martin Astronautics, over the use of
metric and English measurements led to the navigational errors.
</P>
<P>
   The error in trajectory went undetected and built up gradually
over time through the frequent maneuvers required by the Climate
Orbiter during its lengthy journey from Earth. The probe's
asymmetric shape required the frequent maneuvers, a factor the
investigators found was not communicated to the mission's
navigational experts by the probe's designers.
</P>
<P>
   The oversight was compounded by confusion among workers and
managers over their responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``To exacerbate this situation, the mission was understaffed,
with virtually no Jet Propulsion Laboratory oversight of Lockheed
Martin Astronautics' subsystem developments,'' the report
concluded. ``Thus, as the mission work force was reduced and focus
shifted from spacecraft development to operations, several
mission-critical functions _ such as navigation and software
validation _ received insufficient management oversight.''
</P>
<P>
   The space agency has yet to report on the cause of the Polar
Lander's loss _ investigators may be unable to pinpoint the cause.
</P>
<P>
   The Polar Lander was last heard from moments before it was to
separate from the rocket stage that delivered it from Earth and
begin its high-speed descent to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   As a cost- and weight-saving measure, the spacecraft was not
equipped with a radio transmitter that could have relayed
information on the spacecraft's fate. Nor was it equipped with a
radar system that would have enabled the spacecraft to maneuver
away from hazardous terrain.
</P>
<P>
   The probe was designed to land on the Martian south pole with
small braking rockets. Equipped with a robot arm, the Polar Lander
was to dig into the terrain in search of suspected frozen water in
the subsoil.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's report, investigators faulted the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory for failing to engage veteran spacecraft engineers,
quality assurance personnel and other experts from outside the core
Climate Orbiter and Polar Lander teams in the two missions until
the Climate Orbiter loss.
</P>
<P>
   The space agency has yet to formulate a change in its Mars
exploration efforts in the wake of the two losses. However, plans
to use robots to gather Martian rock and soil samples and return to
Earth by 2008 now appear unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   In its latest budget, NASA will seek money to begin work on a
network of communications satellites around Mars that could be used
to improve the success of future missions.
</P>
<P>
   At least one expert believes NASA must improve the way it
conducts its low-cost missions if it wishes to continue its studies
of Mars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The essence of faster, better, cheaper is not that you do
things sloppy,'' said Louis Friedman, the director of the Planetary
Society, a private, California-based, pro-space organization whose
founders include the late astronomer Carl Sagan. ``You have to go
back to the basics and do what people want from NASA. They want it
to be cutting edge, taking risks and exploring the frontier. But
they want a competent NASA.''

ADVENTURES IN THE SKIN TRADE  &HT;       
  
</HEADLINE>
   By SCOTT OSTLER  
 c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Today only, feel free to stop just about anybody on the streets of
San Francisco and ask him or her about that troublesome pimple on
your chin.
<P>
   Chances are, he or she will be a dermatologist, 15,000 of whom
wrap up their convention in town Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   They're not all in the cosmetic end of the biz, but many of them
are wrinkle shrinkers, and they have been studying at the feet of
Dr. Seth Matarasso, whose office is known to every celeb and
socialite in the city as the Fountain of Youth.
</P>
<P>
   The hottest face-fix substance is botox, botulism toxin, which
is injected into muscles in the upper face, paralyzing them and
causing wrinkles to disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Matarasso goes through more boxcars of botox per year than
any other doctor in America, except for one guy in Miami. I'm
trying to persuade Dr. M to write his story, ``Pumping Botox.''
</P>
<P>
   He says the big trend in faces is the quick fix, because a lot
of people can't hide out in Acapulco while the scars heal.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you'd like to invest in my new chain of drive-thru
wrinkle-relaxing clinics: Botox-in-the-Box.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; THE OPERATOR  &LR; of Becky Mertens' BART train from the East Bay
announced Monday morning, ``Attention BART passengers: For your
safety and the safety of others, please do not put your head
between the train doors.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe some guy just likes the wind in his face.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; O.J. FAME:  &LR; The gift that keeps on giving.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Fuhrman, the infamous ex-L.A. police detective and a
co-star of the O.J. Simpson trial, was in San Francisco over the
weekend promoting his new book.
</P>
<P>
   Fuhrman popped into Andrea E Soci Custom Tailoring on Union
Square and dropped a couple thou on a pair of Italian-fabric suits.
</P>
<P>
   Then Mark and tailor Andi Valo sauntered over to Postrio, maybe
the city's best restaurant, for a long lunch discussion about
Mark's wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   Read that and other heartwarming stories of Simpson-trial
characters in my upcoming book, ``Thank$ a Million, O.J.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; DANCE WITH PLANTS  &LR; and sponsor grants.
</P>
<P>
   That's what the truly hip will do tomorrow night at the Cow
Palace, at the Friends of Recreation &AMP; Parks Preview Party, an
early look at the S.F. Flower &AMP; Garden Show. The money goes to
grants for neighborhood parks near you (tickets $150, call
415-750-5441).
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Cow Palace rest rooms were switched around for
some reason for the Friends event, and women were startled to walk
into a rest room that had urinals, each filled with potted flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Most women don't realize how common that is. We guys think plain
urinals just look, you know, tacky.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; LATE SATURDAY  &LR; night, after her show at the Orpheum, Liza Minnelli
stepped out of the Globe restaurant on Pacific for a sidewalk
smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Three women on the sidewalk did a double-take, said hello, told
Liza they like her work. Most stars would smile or nod, then turn
away. Liza joined the group and immediately was giggling with the
girls like they were her best buddies.
</P>
<P>
   Liza is old, she's overweight, she has been through throat and
hip surgery and she's launching a comeback, singing tunes from her
dad's movies. She should call it the ``What the Hell World Tour.''
We should all be so gutsy.
</P>
<P>
   Liza turned 54 on Sunday in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you want to do for your birthday?'' a friend asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to laugh,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; SKIN DOC  &LR; footnote: Sources at two big downtown restaurants tell me
that the dermatologists are incredible drinkers, quantity and
quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``They go for our most expensive wine,'' a GM said.
</P>
<P>
   That works well. Many rich folk who get face-lifts also own
interests in wineries. So the money they spend on wrinkle work
boomerangs back to them in wine sales. It's called karma.
</P>
<P>
   Or: You scratch my back, I'll sand your face.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; A SUBWAY  &LR; to Chinatown. Sounds like a cool novel title.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, city transportation people have been quietly
planning that subway. I guess they hold underground planning
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good idea, but why not spend more money and dig tunnels
and parking lots under the entire city, and declare the surface
streets a car-free zone?
</P>
<P>
   Cars are trouble. The Wall Street Journal reports that San
Francisco drivers have more car crashes per capita than Los Angeles
drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Monday morning, Fifth and Mission, a woman sat through an entire
green light, gabbing on her cell phone. Then the light turned red
and she glanced up, realized her silly goof and hit the gas, as
pedestrians danced out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   I can't wait for the new computer-and-Internet-equipped cars.
Pedestrians won't be killed, they'll be deleted.
</P>
