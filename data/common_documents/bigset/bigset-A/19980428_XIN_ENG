<HEADLINE> UK's PM, Sinn Fein Hold Constructive Talks in London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams
Monday called for more progress on the "demilitarization" of
Northern Ireland in the wake of the peace agreement struck two
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with British Prime Minister Tony Blair in Downing
Street for 90 minutes, Adams also called for replacement of the
Royal Ulster Constabulary, the province's Protestant-dominated
police force, by a "proper policing service."
</P>
<P>
But he said too much haste in the disarming of the Irish
Republican Army (IRA) and other guerrilla groups was not
realistic.
</P>
<P>
"We want to see all guns taken out of Irish politics, but we
don't expect the British army to disarm tomorrow morning, we don't
expect the Protestant paramilitaries to disarm, and I don't think
anyone should expect the IRA," said Adams, whose Sinn Fein party
is the political wing of the IRA.
</P>
<P>
Adams said his party still regarded it as unfair that the six
counties of Northern Ireland, with their majority Protestant
population who generally favor union with Britain, should be able
to veto unity.
</P>
<P>
But he added, "We think the next logical step in all of this is
for the British government to be encouraging, to be facilitating,
to be moving the whole situation in that direction."
</P>
<P>
Adams also said the meeting with Blair, under Sinn Fein's
request, was "positive and constructive."
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein will hold an annual party meeting on May 10 at which
it will decide whether the party will accept the peace accord
thrashed out by the eight political parties in the province.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, Northern Ireland would get its own
parliamentary assembly, with power shared between the parties
according to their electoral strength. But there would be moves to
increase cross-border cooperation.
</P>
<P>
A referendum will be held on the peace agreement in both
Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic on May 22. Prime Minister
Blair is expected to go to Northern Ireland recently to campaign
for a "yes" vote for the deal which will end the 30-year conflict
in the province.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The IOC has sold TV rights to
the Canadian and African television for the 2000 Sydney Olympics,
announced Dick Pound, vice-president of IOC in Sydney on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the opening day of the IOC executive board
meeting, Pound said the Canadian rights for the next five Olympics
had been sold as part of a package to the Canadian Broadcasting
Corporation and two cable networks for 160 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The African rights to the Sydney Olympics fetched 12 million
U.S. dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are pleasantly surprised," Pound was quoted as saying. "The
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation has paid 28 million U.S. dollars
alone for the Sydney rights compared to 20.75 million U.S. dollars
for Atlanta and that was in prime time."
</P>
<P>
Pound said preliminary worldwide figures for this year's Nagano
Winter Olympics suggested the cumulative audience would match
Lillehammer's record 10.7 billion viewers.
</P>
<P>
He said figures were up in most countries but were down in the
United States.

<HEADLINE> HK Government Vows to Combat Copyright Piracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) reiterated
on Monday that the government attaches great importance to the
fight against copyright piracy.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Hong
Kong Film Awards Association Ng See-Yuen, Tung called for the
copyright owners' support and cooperation which is "conducive to
the successful prosecution of copyright pirates."
</P>
<P>
Tung called on the industry to join hands in reporting
copyright piracy and give strong support to the Reward Scheme of
the Customs and Excise Department so as to facilitate the
execution of law and the gathering of intelligence.
</P>
<P>
"The government is committed to enhancing respect for
intellectual property rights among various sectors and to strictly
enforcing the relevant regulations," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive said Hong Kong's laws concerning
intellectual property rights are regarded as "among the world's
highest standard" and the HKSAR government has implemented a
series of measures in a bid to strengthen actions against
copyright piracy.
</P>
<P>
According to Tung, Hong Kong customs seized more than 4.5
million copies of pirated optical discs valued at more than 140
million HK dollars (17.9 million U.S. dollars) in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of 1998, he added, Hong Kong customs again
stepped up their efforts in raiding the "more notorious retail
outlets" and seized more than 2.5 million pirated optical discs.
</P>
<P>
As a result, he said, such outlets have now largely subsided.

<HEADLINE> Split Comoros Sends Envoy to Meet Mugabe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Special envoy from the Federal
Islamic Republic of the Comoros Islands Salimi Himidi Monday
conveyed Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe a message from
President Hamomed Taki Abdoulkarim on the current political
crisis facing the islands.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with the Zimbabewean president, Salimi Himidi
told reporters that he came to brief Mugabe in his capacity as
Chairman of both the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) and the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) organ on politics,
defense and security, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said that the OAU had already convened two meetings with
the government and representatives from the separatists involved
in the Comoros crisis in a bid to bring back peace and stability
to the Comoros, which is comprised of four islands.
</P>
<P>
Himidi, who is also Cabinet Director in Abdoulkarim's office,
said that the two meetings convened in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and
the Comoros respectively resulted in the signing of an agreement
that would see the country holding a constitutional conference to
usher in a new dispensation to deal with the people's needs.
</P>
<P>
"One of the partners has since backed out. We expect this was
because of external pressure," he said. "We are still trying to
solve the separation crisis in one of the islands."
</P>
<P>
Last year, a separatist government was formed in one of the
islands, Anjouan, with the leaders of the self-declared state
announcing its secession from the Federal Islamic Republic of the
Comoros.
</P>
<P>
Led by Abdallah Ibrahim, the separatists claim that they have
been economically disadvantaged to the benefit of the government
based on Grande Comoro.
</P>
<P>
Himidi, on a similar mission to Mozambique, Tanzania and South
Africa to convey the same message to these countries' presidents,
said that it was almost apparent that a diplomatic drive to deal
with the Comoros issue had been completely exhausted, raising the
need for the OAU to send a conflict resolution mission or force
to help out.
</P>
<P>
"Something more than diplomacy may be envisaged at our next
African ministerial meeting on the issue and we hope the message
to President Mugabe will help in accelerating the need to bring
the crisis to an end," he said.

<HEADLINE> Pak Foreign Minister: U.S. Sanctions in the Cards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Foreign Minister
Gohar Ayub Khan admitted here Monday the United States is
contemplating fresh restrictions against the Khan Research
Laboratories (KRL) under U.S. laws pertaining to the missile
technology control regime.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister said Pakistan would continue its
indigenous missile research and development program to meet any
threat to its security.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the National Assembly, he said Pakistan has
received indications from the U.S. administration that the latter
is contemplating fresh restrictions against Pakistan's missile
program.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan was informed that these restrictions emanate from U.S.
internal processes under its national laws relating to imported
technology and not from the latest Ghauri missile test, he said.
</P>
<P>
During his recent visit to Pakistan, the U.S. president's
special envoy and U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Bill
Richardson affirmed that the U.S. administration understood and
appreciated Pakistan's legitimate defense needs, Ayub Khan noted.
</P>
<P>
On the test firing of Ghauri, he said the Pakistani government,
after a careful strategic review, concluded that the test firing
of "our indigenously produced Ghauri missile was an essential
element of our research and development program that was vital for
Pakistan's security."
</P>
<P>
"This decision was made after due deliberations and careful
assessment," the foreign minister added.
</P>
<P>
On the possible U.S. sanctions, Ayub Khan said the application
of fresh restrictions "will have no practical implications" as
Pakistan is not a recipient of U.S. aid. "If, and when, these
restrictions are applied, these will be only against the KRL."
</P>
<P>
He also said Pakistan has already conveyed to the United States
"our serious concern regarding the action now being contemplated
by the U.S. administration against the KRL."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and the United States enjoy a cordial and friendly
relationship, Ayub Khan said, adding that "the relations of trust
and confidence between our governments and peoples have, however,
been strained by selective and discriminatory approach adopted by
the United States."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan would continue to engage constructively with the
United States "to build a new relationship based on shared
interests and mutually beneficial cooperation," he said.

</P>
<P>
The wounded soldiers have been taken to hospital, and four of
them were in serious condition, said the agency.

attack military and civilian targets there.

<P>
LONDON, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The battle for control of
Britain's Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, the most prestigious motoring
marque in the world, between German companies Volkswagen (VW) and
BMW is set to intensify this week, said UK media reports Monday.
</P>
<P>
The battle lines were drawn up when the board of VW gave its
approval for an increased bid over the weekend as the deadline for
offer from BMW approaches Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It has already offered a bid of 370 million pounds (614.2
million U.S. dollars) and German press reports saied the board of
VW had approved an increased offer of 500 million pounds (830
million dollars) for the UK company.
</P>
<P>
Vickers, Rolls-Royce's owner, accepted BMW's 340 million pound
(564.4 million dollar) offer late last month and gave the German
group a 30-day exclusive negotiating period which will end
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
If BMW's offer had not been accepted by the deadline, the board
of Vickers would have to consider the VW offer.
</P>
<P>
However, Vickers was reported to be unable to comment on
reports of a higher offer from VW, saying, "We are currently in
exclusive negotiations with BMW, so we cannot comment."
</P>
<P>
BMW also refused to comment, but a spokesman repeated an
earlier threat that if its bid failed, it would cancel its
contract to supply engines to Rolls-Royce.

HARARE, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Delegates from Quebec Province of
Canada Monday called for greater cooperation between Zimbabwe and
Canada in a bid to increase business links.
</P>
<P>
Addressing journalists after meeting Zimbabwean President
Robert Mugabe in Harare, Quebec Minister of International
Relations Sylvain Simard said the focus of their talks was on the
education and health sectors in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
"The president and my delegation have agreed for better
cooperation so as to improve the trade between the two
countries," Simard said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the current economic problems that Zimbabwe was
experiencing, he said, it was generally a stable country.
</P>
<P>
The Canadians were optimistic that the country would be able
to overcome these problems and increase trade with Canada.
</P>
<P>
He said that they had also shared ideas on credit unions as
possible ways of helping up coming businesses and individuals
save money.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus: Turkish Cypriot Regime Not Recognized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus said on Monday that
neither the United States nor Britain has the intention to
recognize the self-styled Turkish Cypriot regime in the north of
the Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
"No concrete proposal has been made either by the Americans or
the British on the recognition of the illegal state," Cypriot
government spokesman Christos Stylianides said at a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and Turkish Cypriot-controlled north in 1974 when Turkey landed
troops and took over the northern third in the aftermath of a
failed coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
In 1983, the Turkish Cypriots declared unilaterally the
breakaway "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus," recognized only
by Ankara.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said there have been indications that the Turkish
Cypriot side has backed down from its demand for international
recognition as the precondition for resuming peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that the Cypriot government wants "specific
indications" that the Turkish Cypriots are ready to participate in
talks, which are aimed at reunifying the island in a bicommunal

<P>
This is something that the Cypriot government would see "in a
concrete and precise way" when the U.S. presidential emissary for
Cyprus Richard Holbrooke comes here, Stylianides said.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke is expected here early next month in a bid to seek
ways to revive Cyprus' peace process, which has been deadlocked
since last summer when the European Union decided to list Cyprus
as a candidate for its membership.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash walked out of the talks
with Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides in protest and insisted
that the intercommunal negotiations sponsored by the United
Nations be resumed on the basis of "two states."

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot Interior Minister Dinos
Michaelides announced on Monday that Cyprus has decided to impose
a ban on foreign workers in the construction sector.
</P>
<P>
A ministerial committee on foreign workers in Cyprus made the
decision at a meeting during the day, Michaelides told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus will indefinitely stop issuing work permits or renewing
existing permits for foreign workers in the sector, he said,
adding that it will soon take the same measures in other sectors.
</P>
<P>
He said the move was prompted by the increased unemployment
rate, which stands at about 3 percent in recent years, on the
Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
There are some 1,000 foreigners currently employed in the
construction sector, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He called on trade unions to help the government combat illegal
employment of foreign workers.

<HEADLINE> WCC Attacked by Zimbabwean Christian Leader Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 27 (Xinhua) -- President of Evangelical
Fellowship of Zimbabwe Andrew Wutawunashe Monday castigated the
World Council of Churches (WCC) for trying to use its December
convention as a forum to promote homosexualism, the Zimbabwe News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The president said in a statement it was alarming that WCC, a
body which should be upholding biblical standards, was trying to
negate true Christian faith by turning the 12-day conference
scheduled to be held in Harare into a forum for gays and
lesbians.
</P>
<P>
"We roundly condemn such blatant perversion of the Christian
faith," he said. "We cry shame that it should be sanctioned by a
body claiming to represent Christians."
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the Zimbabwe Council of Churches to stick to
its previously scriptural stand on this issue and not be swayed
by international pressure so that Christians would not be forced
to boycott such an important convention.
</P>
<P>
While Pentecostal churches jointly condemned the move, local
mainstream churches have been divided over the issue of
participation by gays and lesbians at the assembly.

<HEADLINE> Chinese General Calls on Indian Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 27 (Xinhua) -- General Fu Quanyou, chief of
general staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, called on
Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee here Monday evening and
both sides expressed the desire to enhance the two countries'
ties.
</P>
<P>
After recalling his visit to China in 1979 when he was serving
as the Indian foreign minister, Vajpayee expressed his thanks to
Chinese leaders for their congratulatory messages when he was
sworn in as India's new prime minister last month, a member of
General Fu's entourage said.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee said he shared the happiness of the Chinese people
over their achievements in the past few years and was satisfied
with the development of friendly relations between India and
China.
</P>
<P>
He said it takes time and patience to solve the border issue
between the two countries. What is more important is that the two
great countries are duty-bound to maintain regional and world
peace in face of the changes in the world situation.
</P>
<P>
General Fu said at the meeting that establishing long-term and
good-neighborly relations between China and India is not only in
the interests of the two countries and peoples, but also conducive
to regional and world peace and stability. He said the main
purpose of his current visit is to further promote Sino-Indian
friendly relations.
</P>
<P>
General Fu arrived here Sunday evening for a five-day official
visit to India.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Talks Suspended Over Differences on Ulema </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The intra-Afghan talks went
into an apparent stalemate Monday as differences popped up between
the Islamic Taliban militia and their rival Northern Alliance over
the Ulema (religious scholars) Commission.
</P>
<P>
After the two sides concluded their second day of talks Monday
evening, James Ngobi, acting head of the U.N. Special Mission on
Afghanistan, said they had decided to suspend their discussion
until Tuesday afternoon and allow both sides to consult their
respective leaderships on the definition of the Ulema.
</P>
<P>
He said the Joint Steering Committee, which consists of five
Taliban and nine alliance delegates, discussed matters relating to
the proposed Ulema Commission during the fourth session of the
talks.
</P>
<P>
He said the committee considered the definition of the Ulema
and finally decided to suspend its discussion and ask each side to
consult their respective leaderships on that topic.
</P>
<P>
"It will resume its discussion as soon as the result of those
consultations have been received, probably by Tuesday afternoon,"
Ngobi said. "The next session of the committee will take place at
3:30 p.m. Tuesday."
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan diplomat denied that the talks, which are being
jointly sponsored by the United Nations and the Organization of
the Islamic Conference, were deadlocked.
</P>
<P>
"There is no deadlock or anything like that," he declared.
</P>
<P>
When asked why the committee did not take up other items on the
agenda, he said it was because most of the time was devoted to the
Ulema topic.
</P>
<P>
And the committee "decided to use all the time between now and
Tuesday afternoon on this consultation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, head of the Northern Alliance delegation, Fazal Hadi
Shindawari, told Xinhua that "the talks were very fruitful."
</P>
<P>
When asked if they discussed cease-fire and the exchange of
prisoners of war besides the Ulema issue, he said: "We discussed
this issue, there was some progress and our discussion will
continue on this point Tuesday also."
</P>
<P>
On Monday morning, the two sides agreed on a four-point agenda
including the formation of the Ulema (religious scholar)
Commission and a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
The Ulema Commission, proposed by the Taliban, would decide the
future political setup in Kabul if and when formed. The Joint
Steering Committee is yet another attempt to iron out the
differences between the Taliban and the Northern Alliance after
the former rejected the latter's first Ulema list in February.

<HEADLINE> Deaths of Iraqi Children, Elderly Rise Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The number of deaths among Iraq's
children and elderly has increased appallingly due to the U.N.
sanctions imposed since its invasion of Kuwait in 1990, the
latest statistics showed.
</P>
<P>
According to Iraq's health ministry, 5,617 Iraqi children died
in March, compared with only 362 in the same month of 1989 before
the economic sanctions were put into place.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the figures showed, 2,215 old people in Iraq died in
March, up from 407 nine year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said most of the children died of diarrhea,
pneumonia and malnutrition, and the elderly of hypertension,
diabetes and malignant neoplasm.
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the mounting death rate to the
shortages of food and medicine caused by the sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Long-Term Economic Prospects in Asia Remain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The long-term economic prospects
for Asia remain bright, and would be made brighter still if
responsible steps were taken by Asian as well as other countries,
especially the U.S. and Japan, an annual conference was told here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the CGES (Center for Global Energy Studies) eighth
annual conference, Mike Bowlin, chairman of ARCO, said, "There are
some short-term obstacles, to be sure. The Asian flu will not
immediately disappear, and a lot of hard work will be required to
restructure the region's economy."
</P>
<P>
However, there is solid ground for optimism, given the signs of
renewed strength in the region, he said, adding, "A restoration of
confidence in Asia can't be achieved with an agreement, an
announcement or a promise."
</P>
<P>
"It has to be earned with actions, over time. We can see the
process underway in South Korea and Thailand, and fully expect it
to begin in earnest in Indonesia," Bowlin added.
</P>
<P>
In considering the Asia picture, the ARCO chairman said that
another issue, probably one that will require a more drastic and
long-term solution, "is the Japanese economy."
</P>
<P>
Japan is the dominant economy in the region. However, after 40
years of outstanding performance, the Japanese economy has
virtually stagnated in this decade. It has had flat growth this
year and there's little prospect of change for next year.
</P>
<P>
Bowlin said, "This is an economy requiring serious
restructuring. There is an immediate need for a substantial fiscal
expansion, and a need to address deep-rooted structural problems,
particularly in the financial sector."
</P>
<P>
As far as the U.S. is concerned, Bowlin said, if the Clinton
administration would find more "constructive ways" to restore
confidence in Asia, the Asian economic prospects "would be made
brighter."

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) will hold
ministerial talks with six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
countries in London Wednesday in a bid to build a "strategic
partnership" between the two regions, said British officials
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing here Monday, British officials
said that the EU-GCC talks would focus on Iran, Iraq and the
stalled Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
One British official said, "Our objective is to develop a
political dialogue and strengthen it to reflect what we think
should be a strategic partnership between the GCC and the EU."
</P>
<P>
"We hope the meeting will create a fuller and franker dialogue"
between the two important regions," he added.
</P>
<P>
The official also said that the London talks would pay
particular attention to Iraq, which is campaigning to have strict
international sanctions against Iraq lifted.
</P>
<P>
"We want discussions of how the GCC perceives Iraq and the
actions it's taking. I think we'll probably find there will be a
pretty close identity of views between the GCC and the EU," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The EU side will be represented by Britain, Luxembourg and
Austria -- the current, immediate past and future EU presidents
--, while the GCC comprises Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar,
the United Arab Emirates and Oman.

<HEADLINE> Israeli PM Reiterates Determination to Withdraw </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Following the latest casualties
of Israeli soldiers in South Lebanon, Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated on Monday that Israel is determined
to withdraw its troops from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel Radio, Netanyahu said that
Israeli cabinet's decision on conditional withdrawal from south
Lebanon, adopted on April 1, has drawn positive reactions in
the international community.
</P>
<P>
He said that security arrangements will be reached with
Lebanon, which will eventually lead to the peace between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made his remarks just after six Israeli soldiers
were wounded by a road-side bomb early Monday in the west sector
of the "security zone" in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The radio said that one soldier is still in serious condition.
And Hizbollah guerrilla group has claimed responsibility for the
attack.
</P>
<P>
Israel has announced that it will withdraw from the so-called
"security zone" in south Lebanon, set up in 1985 to protect its
northern border areas against guerrilla attacks, if it can reach a
security arrangement with Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
However, Lebanese leaders have stated that Lebanon will not
provide Israel with security guarantees, saying that Israel should
withdraw its troops from south Lebanon without any conditions in
accordance with the U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
On the Israeli-Palestinian peace track, Netanyahu told Israel
Radio that he has been examining the American peace proposal even
the Palestinians have already accepted in principle the
U.S. initiative.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu stressed that Israel will determine its security by
itself, saying that it is pointless to exert pressure on
Israel to make a decision.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister did not elaborate on his latest talks with
the U.S. Middle East Peace Envoy Dennis Ross, who is currently in
the region to pave the way for the meetings between the
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Israeli and
Palestinians leaders next month in London.

NICOSIA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot Finance Minister
Christodoulos Christodoulou announced on Monday that his country
has been removed from the list of high risk money laundering
countries.
</P>
<P>
The minister said this was done by a committee of the Council
of Europe (CoE) monitoring efforts in combating money laundering
in member countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after meeting with representatives from
21 CoE members, Christodoulou said Cyprus' endeavor in this regard
has been evaluated by the Financial Action Task Force of CoE.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot minister said Cyprus has ratified the international
convention of Vienna and the CoE convention, set up a special team
to fight money laundering and a consultative commission to inform
and assist the government about the issue.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus is the second country the CoE committee has visited,
after Slovenia. Christodoulou said the committee should visit all
member countries to see for itself practical steps each country is
taking to combat the crime.

<HEADLINE> Germany Opposes Splitting Term of 1st EU Central </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 27 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl has
expressed his objection to a possible compromise to split the
eight-year term of the first European central bank (ECB) president
in order to end a EU dispute over the post, a German government
spokesman said Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to German government spokesman Peter Hausmann, Kohl
would not accept a splitting of the term at the European Union
summit meeting on May 1-2 in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also confirmed a newspaper report that German
central bank president Hans Tietmeyer had sent a letter to Kohl to
express the bank's objection to such a speculated plan.
</P>
<P>
The German newspaper Bild am Sonntag reported Sunday that
Tietmeyer said in his letter to Kohl that the Bundesbank would
reconsider its recommendation on the single European currency euro
at its central council meeting Thursday, a day before European
leaders will meet to officially select countries to start the euro
in January next year.
</P>
<P>
Viewing the proposed compromise as a violation of the ECB's
independence, some Bundesbank council members have reportedly
threatened to reconsider their support for the euro project.
</P>
<P>
The Bundesbank, along with the German government and most other
EU nations, supports the former Dutch central bank chief, Wim
Duisenberg, to head the ECB which will set common monetary
policies for all euro member states. France, however, insists that
its own central bank chief, Jean-Claude Trichet, should assume the
powerful post.
</P>
<P>
It has been speculated that a "gentleman's agreement" might
have been reached under which Duisenberg, 63, would serve as the
first ECB president for the first four years and then give up the
post to Trichet, 55, for the second half of the term.

NICOSIA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- A Cypriot woman AIDS patient was
sentenced to seven month imprisonment on Monday for placing her
sexual mates at the risk of contracting the lethal HIV.

Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Zarzour is a British-born Cypriot hairdresser and came to
Nicosia from London in 1987. She is the second person charged with
knowingly passing AIDS virus.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The intra-Afghan talks reached
an apparent stalemate Monday as the Islamic Taliban militia and
their rival Northern Alliance got bogged down in the definition of
the Ulema and decided to seek guidance from their respective
leaderships.
</P>
<P>
After the two sides concluded their second day of talks Monday
evening, James Ngobi, acting head of the U.N. Special Mission on
Afghanistan, said they had decided to suspend their discussion
until Tuesday afternoon, to use the time for consulting their
leaderships over the qualification of the Ulema.
</P>
<P>
During the three-hour-long fourth session beginning in the
afternoon, Ngobi said, the Joint Steering Committee, which
consists of five Taliban and nine alliance delegates, focused on
the topic of setting up the proposed Ulema Commission.
</P>
<P>
He said the two sides agreed to refer contentious matters to
the Ulema Commission but they differed on the Ulema's definition.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, they decided to approach their respective
leaderships to seek clarification and guidance.
</P>
<P>
"It will resume its discussion as soon as the results of those
consultations have been received, probably by Tuesday afternoon,"
he said. "The next session of the committee will take place at
3:30 p.m. Tuesday."
</P>
<P>
However, the Ugandan diplomat denied that the talks, which are

When asked if they discussed cease-fire and the exchange of
POWs besides the Ulema issue, he said, "We discussed these issues,
there was some progress and our discussion will continue on this
point Tuesday also."
</P>
<P>
Another member of the alliance delegation, Rasool Talib, said
the two sides were getting closer to resolving their differences.
"The talks are heading toward positive direction," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, no Taliban representative spoke to reporters.
</P>
<P>
Monday morning's session of the talks produced a "positive
note" as the Taliban and the alliance agreed on a four-point
agenda including considerations on the formation of the Ulema
Commission, a cease-fire and the date and venue of the next
meeting of the steering committee.
</P>
<P>
But the suspension of the talks, the first encounter between
the two rival Afghan factions in over a year, has again cast a
shadow on the Afghan peace process. The Taliban and the alliance
met three times in Islamabad last year but they failed to make any
progress due to the inflexible positions of both sides.
</P>
<P>
The Ulema Commission, proposed by the Taliban, would decide the
future political setup in Kabul if and when formed. The Joint
Steering Committee is yet another attempt to iron out the
differences between the Taliban and the Northern Alliance after

<P>
BEIRUT, April 27 (Xinhua) -- A 2,000-year-old burial site has
been unearthed by accident in Lebanon's southern coastal city of
Sidon, the country's Future Television Station reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Construction workers found two three-meter-deep caves when
digging foundations last Thursday night, the TV said.
</P>
<P>
The caves lead to a five-by-six-meter hall with a
drawing-covered column at its entrance. The hall then branches
into several burial chambers.
</P>
<P>
The walls are covered with colored drawings, featuring
animals, birds and plants with golden, green, yellow and red
inscriptions.
</P>
<P>
Director general of antiquities of Ministry of Culture and
Higher Education Camille Asmar said the burial site is believed to
date back to the Roman period 2,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Work to deciphering the inscriptions has started to learn more
about the site, he added.
</P>
<P>
Sidon and the country's other several cities were once
inhabited by ancient Phoenicians and Romans 2,000 years ago. Many
historical sites have been unearthed in these areas.

<HEADLINE> KSE Index Up After Government Supporting Effort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The Kuwait Stock Exchange
(KSE) market index was up 58 points to close at 2206.5 points
Monday, the third straight day of rallying.
</P>
<P>
All KSE listed shares were on the rise, except for some but
mostly Arab banking institute shares. The gross rise for the three
days starting Saturday is 124.2 points.
</P>
<P>
Traded shares totaled 33.7 million Kuwait Dinars (111.21
million U.S. dollars) in value through 3,386 transactions Monday.
</P>
<P>
The rise followed a protracted retreat totaling 570.5 points
since the start of this year. The market was reacting quickly to a
government effort to support the mechanism of KSE.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti cabinet on Sunday reviewed a report on KSE activities
and decided to form a committee grouping the finance minister and

<HEADLINE> Gender Disparities Apparent in Africa: UN Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Gender disparities are still
apparent in Africa, the United Nations Economic Commission for
Africa (ECA) has said in a publication entitled "Gender in
Africa".
</P>
<P>
Gender-differentiated resource allocation and prevailing
social norms prevent African women from playing their full role
in socio-economic development, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to "Gender in Africa", barriers to African women's
economic participation include:
</P>
<P>
-- Significant gender differences in education;
</P>
<P>
-- Obtaining credit is hampered by women's inability to
provide collateral;
</P>
<P>
--They are over-represented among the poor in Africa, and find
it harder than men to escape the poverty trap since their income
generating opportunities are few;
</P>
<P>
--In many countries they work longer hours than men on
agricultural and non-agricultural activities;
</P>
<P>
--Child rearing and housekeeping take up a large part of
women's time;
</P>
<P>
--Legal restrictions on women's employment, family life and
access to financial services leave little room for their
advancement;
</P>
<P>
--And food shortages, restricted access to health and welfare
services, insanitary conditions and low education levels manifest
themselves in higher morbidity among African women than men. More
girls than boys die young.
</P>
<P>
Now, more and more insighted people in Africa are clearly
aware that closing the gender gap is essential to achieve
sustainable growth in African nations.
</P>
<P>
According to the ECA, strategies have been made to eliminate
gender gap in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The five-point strategies include: promoting female education,
improving women's health and nutrition, increasing women farmers'
productivity, increasing women's participation of formal labour
markets and improving women's access to credit and other
financial facilities.
</P>
<P>
"Supporting a stronger role for African women will greatly
enhance their own lives, contribute to economic growth, improve
child survival and the health of all members of the family,
reduce fertility, and help slow population growth," ECA Executive
Secretary K.Y. Amoako pointed out in foreword of the "Gender in
Africa''.
</P>
<P>
At the close of the Fourth World Conference on Women held in
Beijing two years ago, governments adopted a global platform for
action.
</P>
<P>
This document reflects a new and important global consensus on
the need to promote gender equality and is an agenda for women's
empowerment, requiring immediate and concrete action by all.
</P>
<P>
Closing the gender gap, giving recognition to women's
developmental contributions and enhancing their participation in
all levels of leadership are essential not only for achieving
social justice, but also for reducing poverty and ensuring
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
An international conference, entitled "African Women and
Economic Development: Investing in Our Future" is expected to
open at the United Nations Conference Center here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Some 500 participants, including a number of heads of state
and government, African policy makers, United Nations,
organizations and specialized agencies, representatives of civil
society, and the donor community will attend the four-day
conference which is aimed at promoting the pivotal role of women
in Africa's economic development.
</P>
<P>
Women may "hold up half the sky" as the Chinese saying goes.
African women have played and are playing crucial roles in food
production, household maintenance and reproduction.
</P>
<P>
It is noteworthy that significant progress has been made in
improving the situation of African women since the independence
of African countries, especially in narrowing gender gaps in
major socio-economic indicators.
</P>
<P>
For example, women produce 75 percent of basic foodstuffs in
sub-Saharan Africa, process 100 percent of basic household
foodstuffs and meet 90 percent of household water and fuel needs
throughout Africa. They head over 60 percent of the households
in some parts of africa.

<HEADLINE> African Countries Urged to Shun Old Aircrafts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 27 (Xinhua) -- African countries have been urged
to discourage the acquisition and operation of old and noisy
aircrafts by their airlines at the 15th plenary session of the
African Civil Aviation Commission (AFCAC).
</P>
<P>
This is necessary so that Africa will not become the junk-yard
of old and noisy aircrafts, the Nigerian News Agency quoted Ita
Udo-Imeh, the host country's aviation minister, as saying Friday
at the close of the week-long meeting in Nigerian capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
Though the minister acknowledged the efforts by AFCAC states
to safe-guard the interests of African airlines in seeking
extension of time for them to continue operating old aircraft
types, he stressed that Africa should not be a perpetual seeker
for the use of unwanted or unacceptable aircraft types.
</P>
<P>
According to the Nigerian News Agency, the meeting in Abuja
admitted South Africa and Eritrea into AFCAC, bringing the
group's member states to 42.
</P>
<P>
Captain Shettima Abba-Gana, Commandant of the Nigeria College
of Aviation Technology in Zaria, Kaduna State, was re-elected
President of AFCAC for another three-year term.
</P>
<P>
AFCAC also discussed issues concerning the privatization of
the aeronautical industry, aviation security, training in civil
aviation and consequences of environmental policies and
globalization on air transport, according to the report by
Nigerian News Agency.

<HEADLINE> China: IAEA's Work in Iraq Should Be Shifted to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 27 (Xinhua) -- China said Monday that the
U.N. Security Council should authorize the International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA) to end its wide-ranging investigations of
Iraq's nuclear program and shift its work to the monitoring phase.
</P>
<P>
Shen Guofang, Chinese deputy permanent representative to the
United Nations, made the remarks here Monday after the Security
Council was briefed by the IAEA on its report of the inspection of
Iraq's nuclear program in the past six months.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Ambassador Shen said significant
progress has been made so far in Iraq's weapons inspection and the
Security Council should give a comprehensive and objective
evaluation of it.
</P>
<P>
Shen said China has noticed that in the past six months, the
IAEA has conducted many inspections and also participated in the
base-line visits of Iraq's presidential sites, during which no
prohibited materials, equipment or related activities were found.
</P>
<P>
China believes, Shen said, that Iraq has complied with the
obligations under Resolution 687 of the Security Council, and the
council should formally authorize the IAEA the transition from the
present stage to the next one, that is the monitoring phase.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Finalizes Mereb Basin Development Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The draft study on the Mereb
Basin Integrated Development Master Plan has been finalized, the
Ethiopian News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, an eight-day meeting appraising the
study was opened in Addis Ababa Monday.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Stocks on Wall Street Plunge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Heavy selling pulled down
sharply U.S. stock markets at midday Monday, triggered by fears
that interest rates could be headed higher soon.
</P>
<P>
Rising bond yields and steep declines in overseas markets added
to the pressure, contributing to what analysts called the
beginning of an expected market correction.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after 2:30 p.m. the Dow Jones industrial average
plummeted more than 200 points, or about 2 percent, to 8,864
points. On the New York Stock Exchange, declining issues led
advancers by a wide margin of 2,768 to 218 as 253 million shares
changed hands.
</P>
<P>
Other markets followed suit, with the Nasdaq Composite losing
62 points, or 3 percent, to 1,806. The S&AMP;P 500 index slipped 28,
or more than 2 percent, to 1,079.
</P>
<P>
The sell-off was triggered by sharp declines in bonds on the
heels of a Wall Street Journal article that said the U.S. Federal
Reserve has dropped its neutral monetary policy stance and is now
leaning toward raising interest rates. The story triggered a sharp
drop in the price of the 30-year Treasury bond, raising its yield
to 6.04 percent -- the highest in almost two months.

<HEADLINE> Israel Accused of Damaging PNA Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) accused Israel on Monday of damaging its economy
by obstructing free movement of Palestinian goods.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem-based Palestinian press service JMCC quoted PNA
Minister of Trade and Economy Maher Masri as saying that the way
the Palestinian goods is handled at the Karni crossing point is
back-to-back checking by the Israeli security forces.
</P>
<P>
The crossing point is between the Palestinian self-rule Gaza
Strip and Israel.
</P>
<P>
"Palestinian goods are unloaded onto the ground, undergo a
thorough security search and are then reloaded onto trucks, taking
a great deal of time for checking and causing a great deal of
spoilage," Masri said.
</P>
<P>
Israel has violated the 1994 Paris Economic Protocol, which
views the Palestinian area as a single geographic entity, he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the protocol, free movement of goods should be secured in
the Palestinian area, between the area and Israel as well as other
countries of the world, Masir said.
</P>
<P>
The protocol stipulates that the PNA has the sole authority
over goods passing all crossing points, but Israel is enforcing
security measures and has resulted in a decline of Palestinian
export to the Jewish state, he added.
</P>
<P>
Israel intends to deal a blow to the Palestinian economy by
allowing free flow of goods from Israel to Gaza, but obstructing
Palestinian goods from flowing into Israel, Gaza Governor Mohamed
Qudweh told JMCC.
</P>
<P>
According to a report issued on Monday by PNA Ministry of Trade
and Economy, Israel's imports from the Palestinian area has been
reduced sharply.
</P>
<P>
Israel exports about 3 billion U.S. dollars worth of goods
annually to the Palestinians, while the Palestinian export to
Israel stands at 300 million dollars in a year, the report said.

<HEADLINE> OA to Have Strategic Alliance With Foreign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas said Monday that Olympic Airways (OA), Greece's
national carrier, would have to enter into strategic alliance with
foreign airlines in the future in a bid to ensure its viability.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Reppas said the Greek government
was doing everything possible to make the national carrier's
revitalization plan a success.
</P>
<P>
He added that loss-making routes should be dealt with through
flight mergers.
</P>
<P>
The airline, which currently employs 7,250 people including 950
flight attendants, is estimated to have a debt of about 600
billion drachmas (about 1.8 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the Greek parliament approved a bill tabled
by the government to restructure the debt-ridden national carrier
as part of its efforts to meet the targets for the European
Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, the Greek government will be able to implement
its five-year plan to restructure the OA including a three-year
wage freeze and wage cuts totaling 5.5 billion drachmas (about
16.9 million dollars) as well as flexible working hours.
</P>
<P>
OA's pilots have since then been holding a work-to-rule protest
against the government's restructure plan, resulting in the delays
or cancellations of many domestic and international flights.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the OA administration appealed to pilots and cabin
crews to resume duties while the government warned that the
airline was in danger of closing if employees did not work towards
saving it.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia Reaffirms Support for Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia reaffirmed
Monday its solid support for the Middle East peace process and
called on Israel to return occupied Arab territories in accordance
with U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi position was made clear by King Fahd Bin Abdul Aziz
during a regular cabinet meeting Monday, a Saudi Press Agency
report said.
</P>
<P>
The agency said King Fahd pledged support for the Palestinian
people and their National Authority until their independent state
with Jerusalem as its capital is established.
</P>
<P>
The king's remarks coincide with the ongoing visit to the
region by U.S. peace coordinator Dennis Ross, who is trying to
bring the Palestinians and Israelis to terms on implementing their
signed accords in the run-up to the May 4 talks in London.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair who toured the Middle East
recently proposed to host talks in London among Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
U.S. State Secretary Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
Monday's Saudi cabinet session tackled the outcome of Arafat's
visit to Saudi Arabia last week. He held talks with King Fahd and
Crown Prince Abdullah Bin Abdel Aziz on the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia has been critical of Israel's anti-Arab policies
and urged it to comply with the relevant U.N. resolutions.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Celebrates Independence Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leonean President Ahmed
Tejan Kabbah Monday called on the people of the country to work
together to build a better independent Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
In what was described as a "very strong" speech on the State
Radio to mark the country's 37th anniversary of independence,
President Kabbah congratulated Sierra Leoneans for their change
of attitude toward national issues.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone, a tiny west African country known for its rich
natural resources like diamond, gold and other minerals, won its
independence from Britain on April 27, 1961.
</P>
<P>
However, after 37 years, it seems a difficult job for Sierra
Leoneans to get much to celebrate the anniversary, especially as
the seven-year civil war has left the country in chaos, according
to a British Broadcasting Corporation report monitored here.
</P>
<P>
President Kabbah had to take Sierra Leoneans back to the days
when hospital provided medicines to the sick and poor, and the
police, the army and the civil service were considered the best
in west Africa.
</P>
<P>
According to what the president said, Sierra Leone was ahead
of such countries as Singapore and Malaysia in 1961. But today
it has been declared by the United Nations as one of the least
developed countries.
</P>
<P>
At independence, the president went on, Sierra Leone was given
the keys to freedom and chance to use these keys to open doors
that would keep national development, peace and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Today, however, there is evidence showing that Sierra Leone is
in a backward state, the president told the nation, adding that
it is because Sierra Leoneans do not like to see good things
about their fellow countrymen.
</P>
<P>
However, the president congratulated Sierra Leoneans for the
change he noted since the return of democracy and called on
everybody to move forward for a better tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah and his government was overthrown in a military coup in
May last year. He was only reinstated on March 10 this year
after the ousting of the illegal military regime.

UNITED NATIONS, April 27 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Monday appointed Major-General Seth Kofi Obeng of Ghana
as the new force commander of the United Nations Observer Mission
in Angola (MONUA) to be effective at the end of April.
</P>
<P>
Born on January 26, 1945, Major-General Obeng joined the Ghana
Military Academy in 1963. He is also a graduate of the United
States Command and General Staff College, Fort Leavenworth.
</P>
<P>
Major-General Obeng served as a directing staff at the Ghana
Armed Forces Command and Staff College. He also served at the Army
Headquarters as General Officer Grade I, and deputy director of
military operations.
</P>
<P>
Major-General Obeng was appointed defense adviser at the
Ghanaian High Commission to the United Kingdom from 1984 to 1988.
From 1989 to 1991, and then from 1992 to 1993, he was seconded to
the State housing corporations as managing director.
</P>
<P>
From December 1993 to August 1994, he served as commandant of
the Military Academy and Training School, with additional
responsibility of commandant of the Ghana Armed Forces Staff
College. In October 1996, he became chief of staff at the General
Headquarters of the Ghana Armed Forces.

<HEADLINE> Egypt-Israel Summit to Focus on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said on Monday the stalled Palestinian-Israeli peace talks
will top the agenda of the Egypt-Israel summit.
</P>
<P>
Moussa made the remarks one day before Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu arrives here for talks with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Egypt announced on Wednesday that Mubarak has invited Netanyahu
to visit Cairo during a telephone conversation to discuss the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
This will be Netanyahu's first visit to Egypt since last
May. Egypt has been critical of Israel's hardline policy on the
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli talks have been stalled since March,
1997 when Israel broke ground for the construction of Jewish
settlement in Arab East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians want as
the capital of a future independent state.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on reports in Israeli media that the meeting will
also deal with Israel's offer to withdraw from south Lebanon,
Moussa said Egypt's stand in this respect is clear and will be
communicated to Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
On April 1, Israel decided to endorse the United Nations
Security Council Resolution 425, which calls for a unilateral
Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon. But it demanded that security
arrangements be negotiated with the Lebanese government before any
troop pullback.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has expressed support for the stance of Lebanon and
Syria. The two countries have rejected Israel's offer, insisting
that the withdrawal be unconditional.
</P>
<P>
"I believe it is high time that signed agreements be
respected," Moussa said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Begins Final Debate on NATO Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate Monday began a
debate on the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO), which will lead to a final vote on the measure to add
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to the alliance.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a Senate press briefing, Defense Secretary William
Cohen sought to dismiss "apocalyptic suggestions" that expanding
NATO to include the three former Soviet bloc nations would poison
relations with Moscow, as charged by opponents.
</P>
<P>
"I think that the Russian government understands exactly what
NATO enlargement is going to mean as far as the stability for the
future," Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
The 100-member Senate is expected to vote on the measure
Wednesday. A two-thirds majority vote is needed for the approval.
</P>
<P>
Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota, who
brought Cohen with him to his regular news briefing, said
rejection of the treaty modification "could send a tragic and an
extraordinarily damaging message to the European community and the
rest of the world about how the United States views its role."
</P>
<P>
It is widely predicted that the Senate will be able to
approve the measure, which has been ratified by Canada, Denmark
and Germany.
</P>
<P>
However, a close vote was expected on a proposed amendment by
Sens. John Warner, R-Va., and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., for
a three-year moratorium on further expansion.
</P>
<P>
Opponents of expanding NATO, a diverse and bipartisan group,
took their complaints to the Senate floor, calling enlargement too
costly to U.S. taxpayers and an unnecessary poke-in-the-eye to
Russia.
</P>
<P>
But Cohen stuck to the most recent Pentagon estimate that
enlargement would cost U.S. taxpayers about 400 million U.S.
dollars over 10 years, down from an initial Pentagon estimate of
2.5 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said that since the initial estimate, it had been
determined that the three eastern European nations were in a
position to bear more of the necessary changes themselves.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cohen voiced opposition to the Warner-Moynihan
proposal to put a three-year pause on expanding beyond those
three nations.
</P>
<P>
While the administration has no timetable for further members,
to lock a decision into a three-year freeze would be unwise... and
counterproductive," he said.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Ready to Help African Nations Tackle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 27 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is ready to
co-operate with other African nations in tackling their problems,
the country's ambassador to Tanzania Thandi Lujabe-Rankoe has
said.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is ready to avail its resources and expertise to
help other countries address such problems as unemployment, poor
health care conditions and lack of clean drinking water, the
ambassador said during a dinner to mark South Africa's fourth
freedom anniversary on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
These problems are common to African countries, said the South
African ambassador to Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
During the dinner, attended by diplomats and dignitaries, she
said that Africa should enter the next millennium as a respected
member of the global village.
</P>
<P>
At the party, Tanzanian Minister of Home Affairs Ali Ameir
Mohammed said that despite implementation of the World Bank and
International Monetary Fund (IMF) policies, African states are
yet to make improvements in capital flows.
</P>
<P>
He called on African countries to implement policies geared to
increase real value of production and enhance economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Ameir said the freedom day anniversary is a very important
event for not only the South Africans, but the entire African
continent because it was the day the country gained its rightful
place among the African nations and the international community.
</P>
<P>
On internal affairs, the South African ambassador said her
country still suffers from high level of crimes, disclosing that
President Nelson Mandela is expected to launch a non-violence
project in South Africa as part of efforts to address the
problem.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Opposes Lifting of Sanctions on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The United States
acknowledges the progress Iraq has made in compliance with U.N.
nuclear investigations, but opposes the lifting of sanctions on
Iraq imposed following its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters here Monday, U.S. Ambassador to the
United Nations Bill Richardson said Iraq has made progress in
providing U.N. inspection teams access to presidential and
sensitive sites, "but the overwhelming facts show that in order to
lift sanctions a variety of Security Council resolutions Iraq
still fails to comply with."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council is on a one-day consultation Monday
reviewing whether it should lift sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq needs to make many many steps" before sanctions are
lifted, Richardson charged.
</P>
<P>
He accused Iraq of "hardly" making progress in the issues of
chemical and biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the inspections by the International Atomic
Energy Agency, Richardson said progress has been made in Iraq's
"nuclear enrichment, design, exports and concealment matters
regarding some of the nuclear operations."
</P>
<P>
But it's "premature" to close the nuclear file as the U.S. sees
a need for more progress to be made by Iraq in the disarmament
area, he said.
</P>
<P>
Disclosing that Russia has made a draft resolution to close the
nuclear file, he said it was not on the agenda of today's council
consultation.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Again Rejects Palestinian Statehood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 27 (Xinhua) -- In celebrating Israel's 50th
anniversary as a state, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on
Monday once again rejected the establishment of a Palestinian
state.
</P>
<P>
Talking to Israel-based foreign reporters to mark the 50 years
of Israel's existence, Netanyahu said that Palestine can only be
allowed to exist as an autonomous region, not a sovereign state.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat
has said on several occasions that he will announce the
establishment of the Palestinian state in May 1999, no matter the
peace process is progressed or not.
</P>
<P>
The conflicts between Israel and the Palestinians in the past
were great disasters not only for the Jewish people, but also for
the Arab people, the Palestinians in particular.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, however, blamed the Israeli-Arab conflicts on the
Arab refusal to accept the U.N. resolution concerning the
separation of Palestine 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Israel's troop redeployment in the West Bank,
Netanyahu said that Israel's condition is that the security of
Israel must be guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
Only Israel can make decisions on its security needs, he said,
apparently in an effort to justify his rejection of a U.S. plan
calling for a 13.1 percent Israeli troop withdrawal from the West
Bank.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Cuban Leader's Trial Call "Absurd" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Monday the call made by Cuban leader Fidel Castro for putting
organizers of the U.S. embargo of Cuba on trial is "absurd" and
acknowledged disagreement with Canada on policies to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Castro, in welcoming Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien to
Cuba on Sunday, called the U.S. embargo a "great crime" and
suggested the U.S. government should be taken to an international
court of law to stand trial as war criminals.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry, commenting on Canadian
Prime Minister Jean Chretien's visit to Cuba, acknowledged that
the 36-year-old U.S. policy of economically isolating Cuba had not
changed the island.
</P>
<P>
But he added it remained the best long-term strategy. "We think
over time it represents a better prospect for bringing about
change."
</P>
<P>
McCurry said Washington had made clear it did not agree with
Canada's policy of engagement as a way to encourage democracy in
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
"We certainly understand their desire to achieve change through
engagement. We do not believe there is evidence that engagement
with Cuba has produced any change. They turn right around and say
that there's no evidence the embargo has produced any change
either," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We respectfully disagree about who's got the best strategy,"
McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Foley said Castro's calls for
the organizers of the embargo to be tried "are absurd."
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, the plight of the Cuban people, their economic
backwardness, is wholly the result of the economic system in place
for the last four decades," Foley told a news briefing.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Existing Home Resales Climb Up to New Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The existing homes resales in
the United States shot up to a new record in March, surprisingly
climbing 2.5 percent, the National Association of Realtors
reported here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The monthly growth has pushed the resales to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 4.89 million units. The level breaks the
old record, a 4.77 million unit rate, which was created just the
month before. The rates are also the highest since the association
began compiling the data in 1968.
</P>
<P>
Based on the performance for the first quarter of the year,
Realtors President R. Layne Morrill predicted sales for all of
1998 would set a record.
</P>
<P>
The strong sales were attributed mainly to low mortgage rates,
which makes home-buying more affordable, as well as healthy income
gains fueled by the lowest unemployment since the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
By region last month, sales rose 7.4 percent in the Northeast,
5.1 percent in the Midwest and 1.6 percent in the South. They
slipped 1 percent in the West.
</P>
<P>
In the country-wide, the median price for an existing home, was
127,000 U.S. dollars in March, up 5.8 percent from a year ago.

NAIROBI, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Peace talks between the Sudanese
government and the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA)
will be postponed to May 4 from April 30.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan Daily Nation reported Monday that Sudanese Foreign
Minister Mustafa Osman affirmed that his government had received
word of the new date from Kenya, host of the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
But the reason for the postponement is unknown yet.
</P>
<P>
"Sudan is keen to participate wholeheartedly in the coming
round of peace talks in Nairobi on the grounds that war has
proved to be an improper means for solving conflicts," the Sudan
News Agency quoted Osman as saying Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to newspaper reports, the Sudanese Army predicted a
major rebel offensive in the south and east of the country.
</P>
<P>
General Abdul Rahman Siral Kethim was quoted as saying that
"Intensive troop concentrations have been monitored on Sudan's
southern borders, poised for an offensive in the coming days."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it was reported that Sudanese rebels had released
about 400 government soldiers from SPLA'S stronghold in Western
Equatoria Province.
</P>
<P>
The last round of talks between the Islamist government and
SPLA ended inconclusively in Kenya in November, 1997. The
government has been fighting the rebels since 1984.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Urges Netanyahu to Accept U.S. Initiative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
Tuesday has urged visiting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu to accept a new U.S. peace initiative to revive the
long-stalled Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak advised Netanyahu to respond positively to the
U.S. initiative which calls on Israel to hand over to the
Palestinians 13.1 percent more of the West Bank land over 12
weeks, a press release issued after their meeting said.
</P>
<P>
During their two-hour talks in the Al-Salem Palace here,
Mubarak reiterated that the only way to achieve progress in the
peace process is "strict implementation, in good faith, of all
agreements signed by the two parties, in particular the
implementation of credible further redeployments."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. proposal "represents the minimum of what is necessary
to revive the peace process, especially in light of the positive
reaction of the Palestinian side," he added.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Mideast peace envoy Dennis Ross has met twice in the past
three days with Netanyahu to try to persuade him to accept the
U.S. proposal. But no progress has been made.
</P>
<P>
So far, Israeli government showed no sign that it would budge
from its rejection of anything more than a 9 percent pullback.
</P>
<P>
However, Netanyahu is reportedly considering a 11 percent
pullback in exchange for Palestinian National Authority's (PNA)
promise to intensify fighting against terrorism and accelerate the
final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians, on the other hand, have endorsed the proposal
in principle as a compromise and is demanding the U.S. pressure
Israel to accept the plan.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak expressed his conviction that a positive Israeli stance
would pave the way for the permanent status talks and facilitate
the resumption of peace negotiations on the Syrian and Lebanese
tracks, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
But apparently, the Mubarak-Netanyahu talks on Tuesday, their
fourth since Netanyahu took office two years ago, have failed to
soften Netanyahu's position in any measure.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu left for home immediately after the talks and no
press conference was given. This was interpreted as an indication
of a very tough meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace making has been stalled after
Israel broke ground for a Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem
in March 1997 and deteriorated over the long-delayed Israeli troop
redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Mubarak-Netanyahu summit came ahead of the May 4 four-way
London talks to seek ways of breaking the impasse in the Mideast
peace process. U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will
meet separately with Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat before the two can meet with each other.

<HEADLINE> UNDP Helps Kazakhstan Find Solutions for Nuclear Waste Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has
allocated 223,200 U.S. dollars to help the government of
Kazakhstan assess the social, economic and environmental
consequences of unclear contamination at the former Soviet unclear
weapons test site near Semipalitinsk.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) Crisis Committee
made the allocation, a release from UNDP said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Assistance from UNDP and UN agencies will also help the
government develop an action plan to present to international
donors and train experts.
</P>
<P>
During the Soviet era, more than 500 nuclear and chemical
explosions occurred at the site. Some were several times more
powerful than the Hiroshima bomb.
</P>
<P>
Over 2 million people were affected by the resulting nuclear
and chemical contamination, which is blamed for birth defects and
abnormally high cancer rates. Infant mortality in the
Semipalitinsk area is 2.5 times higher than elsewhere in the
Republic.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Navy, Coast Guard Look For Missing Malaysian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Rescue ships and aircraft of both
the Philippine Navy and Coast Guard were scouring the sea off the
southwestern island of Palawan to look for a missing Malaysian oil
tanker reportedly spotted near the area, the Coast Guard said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Officer Edwin Pimones of the Philippine Coast Guard Fourth
District in Palawan said Coast Guard chief Rear Admiral Manuel de
Leon ordered the search-and-rescue operations after a mariner
sighted a tanker similar to the missing Malaysian oil tanker near
the Linapacan islet.
</P>
<P>
The ill-fated oil tanker, declared missing on April 17 while on
its way from Singapore to Vietnam, was believed to have been
hijacked in the pirate-frequented South China Sea.
</P>
<P>
Pimones said de Leon also notified all sailors and fishermen
passing Palawan waters to immediately report to the nearest Coast
Guard and military stations if ever they find the tanker.
</P>
<P>
The tanker, carrying 1.5 million U.S. dollars worth of diesel
oil and kerosene, has 21 crew members, including seven Malaysians,
six Indonesians and a Filipino.

<HEADLINE> China to Continue Moves for Full Currency Convertibility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- China will continue its move to
achieve full convertibility of its currency, the Chinese yuan
(Renminbi), in defiance of the Asian financial crisis ripping
through Southeast Asian nations, a senior Chinese bank official
said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"China will continue to move step by step towards full
convertibility of its currency," said Chen Yuan, governor of the
State Development Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark at a seminar convened to discuss the Asian
financial crisis before the Asian Development Bank (ADB) begins
its annual meeting in Geneva on April 29 to May 1.
</P>
<P>
"The process will not be slowed down due to the Asian financial
crisis," Chen said. "On the contrary, the crisis makes us realize
that we have to exert even greater effort in preparation for full
convertibility of China's currency."
</P>
<P>
He also invited more foreign financial institutions to open
offices in China.
</P>
<P>
As another sign of China's continuous economic opening, Chen
said, a package of tariff reduction plans has been submitted to
the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
The package specifies the details of the promise made by
President Jiang Zemin at the informal summit of the Asia Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) in Vancouver last year, which includes
slashing the average tariff rate on industrial imports to 10
percent by the year 2005.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
is expected to have a telephone conversation with German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl Tuesday in an effort to break the deadlock
over who will be first president of the European Central Bank
(ECB), according to Downing Street sources.
</P>
<P>
A Downing Street spokesman told reporters Tuesday that the
telephone talks between Blair and Kohl would focus on the issue of
ECB presidency.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that most of the EU's 15 member states support
Wim Duisenberg, the Dutch president of the European Monetary
Institute, to head the ECB, while France has insisted that Bank of
France Governor Jean-Claude Trichet become the first ECB
president.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman indicated that the British government, the
current EU president, would be able to broker an agreement at this
weekend's special EU summit in Brussels. "It doesn't have to be
sorted out this weekend, but that is the desirable outcome," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He also confirmed that Prime Minister Blair spoke by telephone
last week to French President Jacques Chirac and Dutch Prime
Minister Wim Kok over the row on the ECB chief.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Export Industry Faces Tough Times </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's export sector is
facing tough times ahead despite the government's efforts to seek
an export-led recovery.
</P>
<P>
An on-going seminar on "East Asia's Meltdown -- Life After
Death" noted that many hurdles remain for the export sector, not
only in Thailand but for all East Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
These hurdles include declining global demand, overcapacity in
some sectors and the region's intensifying competition.
</P>
<P>
The seminar quoted a forecast by the United Bank of Switzerland
as saying global demand growth this year would shrink to 3.3
percent compared with 4.4 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Stifled by the economic crisis and tight liquidity, Thailand
and other East Asian nations all hope that exports would generate
foreign exchange earnings to bring local economies back to growth.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, competition in the world market is intensifying
this year as East Asian nations flood the international market
with exports.
</P>
<P>
Former Bank of Thailand Governor Vijit Supinit said at the
seminar that structural adjustment in industry is now the crucial
challenge facing Thailand's export sector.
</P>
<P>
"The government has so far implemented structural adjustment
programs for the finance and banking sector. It is now time to
start thinking of restructuring the industry and real sector,"
Vijit said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Thailand is now gradually losing its export
competitiveness to other emerging markets and its competitiveness
ranking has slipped from 10th place to 39th in just one year.
</P>
<P>
Vijit said Thailand's economic crisis was spearheaded by the
sharp fall of export value, made worse by the cyclical downturn in
world demand for computers and parts, the world's economic
slowdown in general and finally the speculative attacks on the
baht, the country's currency.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the Thai economy would regain its stability
and equilibrium over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Poosana Premanoch, the former minister to the Prime
Minister's Office, said Thailand is now in the "stabilization
stage before a recovery."
</P>
<P>
He proposed that the government quickly stabilize the baht and
encourage banks and finance companies to recapitalize.
</P>
<P>
He added that negotiations with international creditors are
needed to settle Thailand's corporate foreign debts and to ensure
that relief is provided to the newly unemployed and a trade
financing scheme is set up for export industries.
</P>
<P>
"The government itself should play an intermediary role to
address the corporate foreign debts. A joint meeting between Thai
borrowers and foreign creditors should be held to discuss possible
loan relaxation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Poosana suggested that Thailand focus on its competitive
strength in agriculture and agro-industrial products and phase out
non-competitive industries to boost the country's export.
</P>
<P>
He also called for the establishment of a private investment
fund with government backing to invest in strategic industries and
corporations which are viable but lack liquidity.

<HEADLINE> Close Ties between FM Commissioner's Office, SAR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Ma Yuzhen, commissioner of the
Chinese Foreign Ministry in the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR), said here Tuesday that a close relationship of
cooperation has been established between his office and the SAR
government departments.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a luncheon hosted by the American Chamber of
Commerce in Hong Kong, Ma said: "We have also formed satisfactory
working relations with foreign consular offices."
</P>
<P>
Over the past nine months, he noted, "we have helped the SAR
government to send its officials to attend, as members of the
Chinese government delegation, over 40 international conferences
sponsored by some 20 inter-governmental organizations."
</P>
<P>
The Commissioner's Office has passed to the SAR government the
Central People's Government (CPG) instruments authorizing Hong
Kong to negotiate with 42 states 71 bilateral agreements in six
areas, including civil aviation.
</P>
<P>
The CPG has authorized the SAR government to formally sign 12
bilateral agreements with eight countries such as air services and
surrender of fugitive offenders.
</P>
<P>
It has also given a standing authorization to the SAR
government to negotiate visa exemption agreements or make
visa-free arrangements with foreign states, he said.
</P>
<P>
In close cooperation with the SAR government and Chinese
diplomatic missions overseas, he said the Commissioner's Office
has also handed 131 consular cases, including seven major
incidents involving the life or property of Hong Kong people.
</P>
<P>
"We have issued exequaturs to consuls-general and honorary
consuls representing 11 countries and consulted the views of the
SAR government on 25 consular post nominations submitted by
foreign states.
</P>
<P>
"We have handled and granted, upon the approval of the CPG,
diplomatic clearance for portcalls to 55 warships, of which 51 are
from the United States, and diplomatic clearance for landing or
flying over Hong Kong to 80 foreign military aircraft and VIP
planes, of which 61 are American," he said.
</P>
<P>
In order to do a good job in Hong Kong in accordance with the
principle of "one country, two systems," Ma said the
Commissioner's Office must be positioned in a proper way.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the relationship between Commissioner's Office
and the SAR government is not one of subordination but a
relationship of mutual respect, mutual trust, mutual support and
close cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"We shall render our full support and complete trust to the SAR
government in handling on its own the external affairs authorized
by the Basic Law so as to bring their initiatives into full play,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
It is imperative for the Commissioner's Office to combine
prudent attitude with pioneering spirit, proceed from the
realities of Hong Kong and seek solutions in a new environment
with a new approach, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ma said: "We and the SAR government have built an effective
working mechanism with clear division of responsibilities and
enjoyed satisfactory cooperation. We have also established good
working relations with foreign consular offices."
</P>
<P>
"Our smooth operation has been achieved mainly because of the
wisdom and practicability of 'one country, two systems', the
timely and explicit instructions from the CPG and the Foreign
Ministry, the valuable support of the SAR government and
cooperative efforts made by people of all walks of life in Hong
Kong, including foreign consular offices and foreign business
people," he said.

<HEADLINE> Indian Prime Minister Outlines Economic Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Atal
Behari Vajpayee outlined Tuesday his government's economic
policies aiming to make India a global economic power by the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
At the annual session of the Confederation of Indian Industry
here, Vajpayee presented a 13-point action plan for reviving the
depressed economy to achieve a 7-8 percent annual growth rate
before 2000.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, foreign investment would be welcomed in all
areas of special priority including infrastructure development,
high technology, introduction of better management practices,
upgradation of product quality and critical global marketing
linkages.
</P>
<P>
The government would soon formulate transparent and
non-discriminatory foreign direct investment (FDI) policies, he
said, adding that the Foreign Investment Promotion Board would be
empowered to decide on FDI proposals.
</P>
<P>
A commission would also be established to review all
administrative laws, rules and regulations governing industry and
trade, and outmoded laws would either be scrapped or radically
simplified.
</P>
<P>
In his 45-minute address, Vajpayee also announced that the
Foreign Exchange Regulation Act would be replaced with a law
consistent with current needs.
</P>
<P>
The government would set up a national task force to draft a
national informatics policy to provide Indian business and
industry with an opportunity to become what he called "software
czars."
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee said his government would play a more active role as a
legislator, facilitator and regulator and its relationship with
industry would be based on trust.
</P>
<P>
The government would substantially increase investment in
infrastructure development and private sector investment would
receive far greater policy and implementation support, he said.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee said that to avoid delay in the implementation of
projects in the power sector, the prime minister's office would
directly monitor projects capitalized at more than 1 billion
rupees (about 260 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
"My office will seek a monthly progress report on all such
projects and ensure that they are completed and commissioned on
due dates," he said.

Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Yevgeny Ananyev, director general of the company, released the

Weapons Import and Export Company has remained Russia's biggest
weapon importer and exporter, and is responsible for 90 per cent
of Russia's weapons exports.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Beijing University, China's most
prestigious higher-learning institute, which will celebrate its
100th anniversary May 4, boasts many firsts in the country,
according to historical records.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1898, it was the first state-owned comprehensive
university in modern China. In 1903 its students launched the
country's first student movement, to protest against Russian
aggression.
</P>
<P>
Also in 1903, the school sent the first group of 46 Chinese
students to study abroad, and China's first national university
games were held on the university's campus.
</P>
<P>
In 1910 it became the first Chinese university to open
institutes on seven different subjects. And in 1917 the school set
up research bodies on mathematics, physics chemistry and the
Chinese classics, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Beijing University is known as the cradle of Marxism and
communism in China, as the country's first communist group
came into being here in 1920.
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, in the same year, the university also became
the first in the country to admit girl students -- only three in
the beginning -- and allow them to sit together with boy students
in the same classrooms.
</P>
<P>
The university has China's largest school library, with more
than 4.5 million books, and the largest number of labs -- 116. It
also has the country's largest school museum.
</P>
<P>
It has engaged in exchanges with 143 universities in 40
foreign countries and regions, ranking first among all Chinese
universities.
</P>
<P>
Beijing University now has eight institutes, 21 departments, 52
research institutes and 63 research centers, ranking first in the
country in terms of the number of subjects taught.
</P>
<P>
The Founder Group of Beijing University is the country's
largest school-run enterprise. It generated a total income of
nearly six billion yuan (723 million US dollars) in
1997. Moreover, the Founder Group is China's first school-owned
firm listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
Finally, Beijing University is well known for its 80-plus
student groups which are the basis for the school's colorful
campus life.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Inflation Rate Seen to Rise This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' inflation rate is
expected to rise this year due to the effect of the El Nino
weather phenomenon and the impact of the regional currency crisis,
the Central Bank of the Philippines said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"While expected to remain single-digit, inflation is
nevertheless projected to rise in 1998," the central bank said in
an annual report issued here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The bank blamed El Nino and high costs of imported goods and
interest rates caused by the financial crisis for the expected
rise in the inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
The El Nino phenomenon, which hit the country late last year,
has caused a massive drought in the southern island of Mindanao,
dealing a severe blow to agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
But the bank did not say whether the average inflation rate for
1998 could reach its earlier estimated level of between 7.5 and
8.5 percent. Last year, the country's inflation rate averaged 5.1
percent.

HONG KONG, April 28 (Xinhua) -- A leading commercial
institution of Hong Kong on Tuesday expressed its confidence in
continued economic improvement in Hong Kong this year.
</P>
<P>
James Pei-Chun Tien, chairman of the Hong Kong General Chamber

see a significant economic improvement by the year's end."
</P>
<P>
Tien recognized that this year started "rather poorly" for the
Hong Kong economy -- external trade remains weak, consumer
spending was down, and the property and share markets are under
pressure -- and that it may take a longer period for the economy
to recover.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the opening months of the year were "notable
for some extremely positive signs" and "we are fortunate to see
GDP growth of between 1 and 2 percent in the first three months."
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's "economic fundamentals are still sound and with
continued good growth on the mainland we should be able to ride
out the storm (financial crisis)," said the chamber chairman.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the hope that interest rate would be
gradually lowered to the pre-crisis level.
</P>
<P>
Tien said the General Chamber of Commerce will continue to work
with and give full support to the Hong Kong Government to ensure a
better overall business environment.

<HEADLINE> HK Launches Patent Application Grant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 28 (Xinhua) -- To stay competitive in the Asia
region, Hong Kong will need to add value to its commercial and
industrial activities through innovation and technology
development, a Hong Kong official said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Hosting a launching ceremony of the Patent Application Grant,
Director-General of Industry Francis Ho said that there is a need
for fostering innovation in the local industry.
</P>
<P>
This is in line with the one of the missions of the newly
established Chief Executive's Commission on Innovation and
Technology, which is to make Hong Kong an innovation center for
the region, the official noted.
</P>
<P>
The grant will assist local companies and individuals to apply
for patent registration of their own inventions.
</P>
<P>
The Industry Department has made available an initial sum of 6
million HK dollars (769,000 U.S. dollars) to start off the pilot
scheme for a period of three years.
</P>
<P>
The scheme will be open for all locally incorporated companies
or Hong Kong permanent residents who have never owned any patents
before.
</P>
<P>
All functional patents and inventions (except cosmetic designs)
are eligible.
</P>
<P>
The applications will go through a patent search and a
technical appraisal by the implementation agencies to ensure that
there is little chance of infringement on existing patents and
demonstrate a reasonable chance of success.
</P>
<P>
The grant will be used to cover the direct costs involved in
the patent application process, such as pre-application technical
appraisal, attorney fees, consultant fees and filing of
applications.
</P>
<P>
Application forms for the scheme can be obtained from the
Industry Department and the two implementation agencies -- the
Hong Kong Productivity Council and the Hong Kong Institute of
Biotechnology Ltd.

<HEADLINE> HK's Development Proves One country, Two Systems Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 28 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese official said here
Tuesday that the developments in Hong Kong over the past nine
months since the handover last July proves the absolute
correctness of the "one country, two systems" policy.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a luncheon hosted by the American Chamber of
Commerce in Hong Kong, Ma Yuzhen, commissioner of the Chinese
Foreign Ministry in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(HKSAR), said that the situation in the HKSAR is, on the whole,
very good.
</P>
<P>
The principles of "one country, two systems", "Hong Kong people
administering Hong Kong", and a high degree of autonomy and the
Basic Law have been fully implemented, he said.
</P>
<P>
The previous social system and lifestyle in Hong Kong have
remained unchanged, and the laws in Hong Kong basically unchanged.
Hong Kong has been operating smoothly in all aspects, he added.
</P>
<P>
"All these have ensured Hong Kong's continued prosperity and
stability," he said, adding that the SAR Government headed by
Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa has excelled itself with a
highly-effective administrative performance.
</P>
<P>
He pointed to a remarkable achievement that Hong Kong has made
especially in the wake of the Asian financial crisis that has
produced some adverse effects on Hong Kong. He described the
counter-measures adopted by the SAR Government as firm,
appropriate, and effective.
</P>
<P>
As a result, he said the financial and economic situation in
the SAR has, on the whole, remained stable.
</P>
<P>
Over the past nine months, the commissioner said that the
Central People's Government (CPG) has steadfastly implemented in
Hong Kong the principles of "one country, two systems", "Hong Kong
people administering Hong Kong", and a high degree of autonomy and
the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
This is because these basic guidelines not only serve the
immediate and long-term interests of Hong Kong, but also fully
conform to China's overall national interests.
</P>
<P>
They constitute the fundamental guarantee for Hong Kong's
long-term prosperity and stability and they are state policies
aimed at early reunification of the whole of China and
revitalization of the Chinese nation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ma said that facts have proved that the determination of the
CPG to implement the concept of "one country, two systems" is by
no means lip-service but a serious commitment substantiated with
actual deeds. It is definitely not an expedient or something
temporary, but a firm commitment to be honored for decades to
come.
</P>
<P>
He said the CPG has complete trust in the SAR Government and
given it full support and a free hand in administering Hong Kong
in accordance with the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
The CPG has fully supported the SAR Government in its recent
efforts to stabilize Hong Kong's financial market. A good
relationship has been established between the CPG and the SAR
Government.
</P>
<P>
Ma said the great concept of "one country, two systems" has now
become a reality in Hong Kong, which proves that Hong Kong
residents composed mainly of Chinese have both the determination
and ability to run Hong Kong well.
</P>
<P>
It proves that the SAR government headed by Tung Chee Hwa has
both the wisdom and experience to steer Hong Kong through
complicated situation smoothly and to maintain its prosperity and
stability.
</P>
<P>
It also proves that the motherland is the solid and strong
support base for the HKSAR in its endeavor to maintain prosperity
and stability and to tide over difficulties and risks in its
course of development.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong to Harness E-commerce Technology: FS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 28 (Xinhua) -- A senior Hong Kong official
said here Tuesday that Hong Kong must seize the opportunities
presented by the Electronic Commerce (E-commerce) in a bid to
retain its leadership position in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
Business Advisory Council Roundtable on Electronic Commerce held
on Tuesday in Hong Kong, Donald Tsang, financial secretary of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), said that
E-commerce has the potential to massively reform the way people do
business and the way the communities function.
</P>
<P>
"The APEC Business Advisory Council has a role to play in
helping governments to learn about E-commerce, come to understand
it and to work through rationally the steps that we must all take
to manage properly the introduction of this phenomenon," Tsang
said.
</P>
<P>
While discussing technology development in Hong Kong, Tsang
said with the establishment of the Information Technology and
Broadcasting Bureau, the Hong Kong government would be able to
take a more holistic approach to information infrastructure issues
across the SAR.
</P>
<P>
The Bureau would among other things be examining Hong Kong's
physical information infrastructure, applications for use of the
physical information infrastructure and the support facilities
needed to sustain such an infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
"The market conditions for mass market E-commerce will ripen
progressively over the coming years and during this time
governments will have some precious breathing space in which to
address the relevant issues which are appropriately their
responsibilities in the promotion and facilitation of E-commerce,"
Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
"Simultaneously business will experiment and learn what will,
and will not, lend itself to profitable enterprise on this new
medium," Tsang added.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Vice-Chairman Meets US Chinese School Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- It is important to help overseas
Chinese and their children learn the Chinese language, and help
more foreigners to learn about Chinese culture.
</P>
<P>
This remark was made by Wan Guoquan, vice-chairman of the the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), while meeting a delegation of the Chinese
School Association in the United States here today.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC leader said that language education and cultural
exchanges comprise an important window for the rest of the world
to know more about China. He praised the association for the
efforts of its members to teach the Chinese language overseas.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Li Yunchen, president of the association, said that the
Chinese schools under the association not only serve overseas
Chinese but also enrol many Americans who wish to learn about the
Chinese language and culture.
</P>
<P>
According to Li, thousands of Chinese students are studying in
the United States, and nowadays many of their children have
reached school age, which has led to the mushrooming of Chinese
schools run by overseas Chinese across the United States.
</P>
<P>
The association has nearly 90 member schools scattered in over
30 states, she noted.

<HEADLINE> PKK Leader Admits Killing Palme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Former Swedish Prime Minister
Olof Palme was murdered by members of the outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK), the Swedish media quoted a senior PKK leader
as saying on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Semdin Sakik, the Number 2 leader of the PKK, has been arrested
by Turkish authorities. Sakik said the assassination of Palme was
ordered by the PKK leader Abdullah Oecalan.
</P>
<P>
Sakik said the Swedish government's refusal to grant political
asylum to PKK members, and the fact that eight PKK members were
deported, triggered the assassination.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit told the press that
he would inform Stockholm of the most recent findings.
</P>
<P>
"Details of the assassination Sakik has described are
horrifying," Ecevit said.
</P>
<P>
Palme was gunned down on a Stockholm street at midnight on
February 28, 1986. The investigation has been ongoing since then.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish police had doubted that the PKK guerrilla
organization was involved in the killing. Authorities arrested
about 20 Kurds who were believed to be involved in the
assassination, but eventually released them because of
insufficient evidence.

</P>
<P>
Tehran is the sixth leg of Yassin's seven-nation tour since
February, which has taken him to Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan,
Syria and Qatar. He is also expected to pay a visit to Kuwait
after Iran.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival, Yassin said that the main goal of his visit
to Iran and several other Muslim states was to expand ties among
Arab and Muslim states and hold talks with officials of these
countries.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Hamas was a popular movement with its roots in
the heart of the Palestinian nation and no power could uproot it.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian nation would continue its struggle against
the Israeli regime until the liberation of Muslim lands and holy
sites, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Hamas leader also called on the Muslim world to stand by
the Palestinian nation and help them with their struggle against
Zionism.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Iran's stance towards Palestine, Yassin said that
Iran has always been in favor of the Palestinian people and
against Israel after the Islamic revolution in 1979.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Chief Ends Visit to Algeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General
Ahmed Esmat Abdel-Meguid left the Algerian capital on Tuesday,
ending a three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
During his stay, Abdel-Meguid held talks with Algerian leaders
on current developments in the Arab world, the dialog between Arab
and European countries and the issue of fighting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
He warned at a press conference Monday that the Middle East
peace process is at a critical stage due to Israel's hardline
policies.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League calls for a fair and comprehensive Mideast
peace based on the relevant United Nations resolutions and the
land-for-peace principle, he added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Israel's offer to withdraw from south Lebanon, he
said the U.N. Security Council Resolution 425 demands an
unconditional and immediate withdrawal from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
On April 1, Israel decided to endorse the U.N. resolution. But
it attached the pullout with conditions that Lebanese government
guarantee the security of its northern border.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has rejected the offer, insisting that the withdrawal
be unconditional.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the Lockerbie issue, Abdel-Meguid said Libya is
in a good position after the U.N. International Court of Justice
ruled on February 27 that it has the authority to settle the
dispute between Libya, on the one side, and the United States and
Britain, on the other.
</P>
<P>
Two Libyans have been suspected of bombing a Pan Am jumbo jet
over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988, killing 270 people. Washington
and London insist that the two suspects be tried in either of the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
But Libya, fearing that its citizens would not get a fair trial
in those countries, has refused to hand over the suspects. Instead
it proposed that they be tried in a neutral country.
</P>
<P>
On the anti-terrorism issue, Abdel-Meguid said the Arab
Anti-Terrorism Agreement signed last Wednesday is "an enormous and
historic achievement" for the Arab world.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: S. Africa's ANC Mounts Attack on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 28 (Xinhua) -- As the next general
election draws near, South Africa's ruling African National
Congress (ANC) has mounted its attack on opponents amid
opposition parties' outcry that ANC's intolerance toward
opposition is threatening multi-party democracy.
</P>
<P>
On the fourth anniversary of South Africa's freedom from
apartheid Monday, ANC leaders renewed their attack on elements
opposed to ANC-led democratic reforms and urged the government to
oust white officials who were "enemies of change."
</P>
<P>
Addressing a union congress in Durban, Deputy President Thabo
Mbeki said forces of the past "were still among us" and that
their agenda had not changed.
</P>
<P>
Emphasizing the fact that the present government had inherited
most of its structures from the former government, Mbeki said it
was imperative that the public service transform itself to become
more representative of the population, of which blacks account
for more than three quarters.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki suggested that a recent military intelligence report
warning of a plot by senior ANC members to overthrow the
government was aimed at getting the government to act against
itself and ANC's best former officials.
</P>
<P>
The report, presented to President Nelson Mandela in February
by defense force chief Georg Meiring, implicated top ANC members,
including Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, Defense Minister Joe Modise
and other former cadres of Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK), ANC's now
defunct military wing.
</P>
<P>
The report, later found to be fraudulent, triggered widespread
controversy and led to resignation of Meiring earlier this month.
Meiring was chief of the old South African Defense Force and
regarded by leftists as an obstacle to new defense force's
transformation.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said the enemies of change, arrogant and showing no
remorse for their wrong doings, have even "regrouped and
reorganized."
</P>
<P>
He referred to the South African Rugby Football Union (Sarfu)
which had sought a court order to set aside the appointment of a
judicial commission of inquiry into its affairs.
</P>
<P>
Hinting at Sarfu chief Louis Luyt, who insisted Mandela should
testify in court to explain his appointment of the commission,
Mbeki said that the enemies apparently felt strong enough to take
a man of Mandela's stature to court.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Mandela testified in court for the Sarfu case,
marking the first time a South African president appeared in
court to defend his executive decision.
</P>
<P>
Many saw Sarfu's demand for Mandela's appearance in court as
largely being aimed at humiliating the black national hero.
</P>
<P>
In another public address a week ago, Mbeki hit hard at
critics of government policies, saying that "enemies of
democracy" are desperate to spit on all efforts to create the new
order and to propagate lies to show that the democratic system is
failing.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Deputy Tourism and Environmental Affairs
Minister Peter Mokaba said the ANC-led government must remove all
"reactionary white bureaucrats" from senior positions and employ
skilled black people.
</P>
<P>
At a Freedom Day celebration in the Eastern Cape province,
Mokaba said white bureaucrats were opposed to the democratic
process under way in the country and that their leadership should
be replaced by "our own people."
</P>
<P>
"It is high time that we take our gloves off and fight back
against white bureaucrats whose intentions are to undermine the
ANC and its programs," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also called on people to vote ANC and to help it get a
two-thirds majority in the 1999 general elections so that some
clauses of the constitution could be changed.
</P>
<P>
His remarks contradicted Mandela's assurance last week that
the ANC would uphold the constitution even if it won a two-third
majority. Mandela said that the constitution was a collective
possession and anyone who works against it is "not being true to
the nation's founding principles."
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties Monday claimed that the ANC's recent
repeated attacks on the opposition and the press showed an
intolerant stance to criticism, which posed a serious threat to
the basis of democracy inaugurated in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Peso Falls Sharply Against U.S. Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine peso plunged
Tuesday, breaking through the important psychological level of 40
pesos per dollar amid mounting concerns over the forthcoming
presidential elections, traders said.
</P>
<P>
The average exchange rate between the peso and the dollar was
39.883 pesos for the day, up 2.7 percent from Monday's average of
38.817 pesos. It hit a high of 40.1 pesos within the first hour of
trading.
</P>
<P>
Traders attributed the sharp fall of the local currency to
mounting fears of political instability during the May 11
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
They said banks are buying dollars heavily in fear of political
uncertainty and a drop in investors confidence.
</P>
<P>
Analysts expected the peso to drop to as low as 42 to a dollar
in the run-up to the elections due to heavy demand for the dollar
and a tight dollar supply caused by the absence of offshore funds
in the financial system.

<HEADLINE> Belgian PM Dismisses Another Official Over Dutroux Escape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc
Dehaene dismissed another high-ranking official on Tuesday over
the prison escape of a convicted child rapist and killer.
</P>
<P>
Dehaene, who dismissed his deputy prime minister -- who
also served as interior minister and justice minister -- over the
escape of Marc Dutroux, announced in a parliamentary session that
he was dismissing Willy Deridder, chief of the Belgian gendarmes.
</P>
<P>
Deridder had served in that post since November 1989.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian prime minister has nominated Louis Tobback to
replace outgoing Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Johan
Vande Lanotte, and chosen Tony van Parys to replace outgoing
Justice Minister Stefaan de Clerck.
</P>
<P>
Vande Lanotte and de Clerck submitted their resignations last
week after the paedophile managed to escape from a court in
southeastern Belgium. He remained at large for more than three
hours before being shot and recaptured by police.
</P>
<P>
Dutroux was charged with raping and killing four of the six
young girls he abducted in mid 1996 when a nationwide child sex
ring was exposed.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties called for a vote of no confidence on
the current government and also demanded the prime minister resign.
</P>
<P>
The no-confidence vote was expected to be held on Tuesday as
Dehaene had promised.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Palestinians, Jordan to Discuss Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 28 (Xinhua) -- A Jordanian-Israeli-Palestinian
meeting is to be held in the coming two weeks to facilitate
Jordan's exports to these two countries, Israeli ambassador to
Jordan Odid Eran was quoted as saying Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will concentrate on means to increase Jordanian
exports to the Palestinian self-rule areas as well as to Israel,
Eran said in an interview with Jordan's official news agency.
</P>
<P>
There are some "specifications" that limit the flow of goods
from Jordan to the Palestinian market, said Eran. But according to
the 1994 Paris Agreement, the Palestinian have the right to import
goods from Jordan and Egypt out of the frame of the Israeli
"jurisdiction."
</P>
<P>
During the upcoming tripartite meeting, representatives from
the three sides will seek ways within such a framework to help
Jordan export more commodities to the Palestinian area, Eran
added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Jordan's exports to Israel, Eran said they will
benefit from the rebuilding of the King Hussein Bridge which
serves as the border gate between the two countries and the
launching of Qualified Industrial Zone in Irbid where Israeli
products can be processed and exported duty free.
</P>
<P>
Israel is activating work in the fields of trade, transport,
tourism, communications, water and industries with Jordan, and the
upcoming tripartite meeting is just a part of it, he added.
</P>
<P>
Israel has been trying to maintain monopoly of the Palestinian
market which each year absorbs 2.7 billion to 4 billion
U.S. dollars of Israeli-made products, almost 95 percent of
Palestinians' total imports, according to the semi-official Jordan
Times.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Jordan and the Palestinians held rounds of talks to
ease bilateral trade and finally signed agreements on tourism and
product specifications. But the kingdom still fears that Israel
will hamper their trade exchange.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade between Jordan and Israel stood at 35 million
dollars in 1997, which was considered as low by the Jordanian
government.

<HEADLINE> UN Conference Opens to Discuss Gender Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- An international conference
on "African Women and Economic Development: Investing in Our
Future" was opened at the U. N. Conference Center here Tuesday to
discuss gender issues.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening session, Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles
Zenawi said issues revolving around questions of gender equality
have received increasing attention at the international level
since the 1975-1985 U.N. Decade for Women which was given further
impetus by the 1995 Beijing International Conference on Women.
</P>
<P>
"The effective and genuine promotion of gender equality and
the protection of the rights of women is, in the African context,
... inextricably bound up with commitment to grass-roots
democracy and their active participation in decision making at
various levels," Meles said.
</P>
<P>
The four-day conference is convened to coincide with the 40th
anniversary of the founding of the United Nations Economic
Commission for Africa (ECA).
</P>
<P>
Some 600 participants, including a number of heads of state
and government, African policy makers, U.N. organizations and
specialized agencies, representatives of civil society and donor
community are attending the conference.
</P>
<P>
Speaking also at the opening session, ECA Executive Secretary
K.Y. Amoako expressed his optimism on "a new era for Africa's
women", saying that "the good future of African women in
development depends upon women who see a different future for
themselves, with real opportunities, and with the odds shifting
more in their favor."
</P>
<P>
A new Africa requires a new gender partnership, he said,
adding that ECA has chosen Africa's gender issues as the single
greatest cross issue for its work.
</P>
<P>
The conference will deliberate issues on implementation of the
regional Dakar and Global Beijing Platforms of Action, which
place poverty reduction through the economic empowerment of women
as a top priority.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The Interstate Council of the
four-nation Customs Union, at the conclusion of its one-day Moscow
meeting, vowed Tuesday to further relax border controls among
member states to ensure integration.
</P>
<P>
A statement entitled, "Ten Simple Steps for Ordinary People,"
was issued to simplify the procedure for acquiring citizenship,
for ensuring the free crossing of member-states' borders by
citizens, and creating favorable conditions for TV and radio
broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
The Customs Union, a body grouping Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan
and Kyrgyzstan, commonly called "the group of four," has accepted
Tajikistan as a new member.
</P>
<P>
The five partners were also members of the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS), a bloc formed by former Soviet Union
member-states to bid for economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Council also adopted a treaty on the legal status of
citizens of one country permanently living in the territory of
another country.
</P>
<P>
The participants in the Customs Union summit agreed to prepare
a draft treaty on the establishment of a single economic space for
the five member countries.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the Union also decided to move the headquarters
of the Integration Committee from Moscow to Almaty, Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
The next meeting of the Interstate Council of five members will
take place in Kazakhstan's capital Akmola on July 1-3.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin praised the results of the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the meeting, Yeltsin said that "unlike other
sittings," the meeting in Moscow on Tuesday was quite dynamic.
With the admission of Tajikistan, "the volume of work will grow,
but so will the effect," Yeltsin said.

<HEADLINE> "Walk With Lions" to Come True in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Touring game parks in Africa, to
many, may be an experience of "caged men" in their vehicles
parading free animal world, but a new project here in Nairobi is
to free tourists from the cages and "walk with lions".
</P>
<P>
Just as the newly-shot Hollywood film "Walk with Lions" may
hint, the project, dubbed "Nairobi Safari Walk", is to bring men
and animals as close to their natural environment as possible,
David Western, Director of the Kenyan Wildlife Service told
Xinhua here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony for the Mini-Orphanage park,
a makeshift place for the building of the future "Nairobi Safari
Walk", Western said that the project would serve as a very good
education program for wildlife reservation in the country.
</P>
<P>
About 400,000 visitors are expected to come and view the new
para-natural park each year, Western said, adding that this would
be the most-visited park throughout the whole of Kenya, where
there are nearly 30 game parks.
</P>
<P>
The building of the project, the first of its kind in the
country, would take about 12 to 18 months, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Nairobi Safari Walk" is to be built on the current site of
the Nairobi Animal Orphanage which was established in 1964.
</P>
<P>
Originally served as a refuge for wild animals found abandoned
or injured throughout Kenya, the Nairobi Animal Orphanage has
taken in other animals, including non-Kenyan species as
chimpanzees and tigers, Western said, and the new idea is to
reshape it into a park between city and wilderness, and make it a
modern educational exhibition of live animals.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan Wildlife Service director said that two classrooms
are to be built along with some other tourist facilities in the
Kenyan Safari Walk.
</P>
<P>
Visitors would move through a natural environment,
encountering animals as part of an unfolding tableau, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
The new facility may attract wild animals to the Safari Walk
park, blending seamlessly with those in permanent exhibit areas
carefully crafted to appear part of the native landscape, he
said.
</P>
<P>
All development in the new park will be integrated into the
natural landscape of Nairobi National Park, the first wildlife
reserve in Kenya, which, just nine kilometers out of the capital
Nairobi, opened its gates to visitors in 1946, Western said.
</P>
<P>
Open savanna merged with bush, forest and wetland, would make
the animal habitat area in the park a natural world for the
animals originally housed in the zoo-like Nairobi Animal
Orphanage, Western said.

<HEADLINE> Women and Science Conference Held in Brussels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 28 (Xinhua) -- More than 300 specialists
participated in a conference offered here by the European
Commission, the executive body of the 15-nation European Union, to
explore the relationship between women and science.
</P>
<P>
The two-day conference was aimed at assessing the reasons why
so few European women took an interest in science, and in devising
a plan of action to interest them in scientific careers.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that only six out of every 100 engineering
students in the European Union are women, and although 70 percent of
medical or biological students are women, the figure falls to less
than 20 percent in physics and mathematics.
</P>
<P>
In Britain only one fifth of women with a science degree
actually pursued a science career in 1996, compared with 38 percent
of men.
</P>
<P>
European Commission officials say the fact that so few women
opt for a science career cannot be ignored when preparing to enter
the third millennium.
</P>
<P>
In order to redress the balance and promote equal opportunities
for women in the field of science, Commissioner Edith Cresson took
the initiative and organized the two-day conference in cooperation
with the European Parliament.

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Tehran -- During an international trade exhibition held in Iran
recently, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said that his
country plans to set up 10 new petrochemical projects during the
coming four years. He said that these projects will cost 2.5
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Zanganeh noted that Iran, the second biggest exporter of
petrochemicals in the Middle East, plans to treble its capacity
for producing petrochemicals so as to reach 30 million tonnes by
the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
Riyadh -- Starting from May 1, Saudi Arabia will implement
the second phase of its plan to levy higher customs duties on
imported farm products.

<P>
These measures are taken under a government decree raising

</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel's unemployment rate continued to climb
this year and reached 8.3 percent in February, its highest level
since the end of 1993, the English daily The Jerusalem Post
reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Israeli Central Bureau of Statistic as
saying that the rise in the jobless rate has brought the
number of people out of work to more than 180,000.

A survey conducted recently found that 72 percent of the
unemployed believe that the government is not doing enough to
solve the unemployment problem, and 86 percent do not believe

In response to the rising unemployment rate, Israeli Finance

<HEADLINE> Central, Western Regions Show Huge Export Potential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Local products from central and
western regions such as coke and vinegar from Shanxi Province,
cashmere from Inner Mongolia, fruit from Xinjiang, and motorcycles
from Chongqing Municipality are all favorite durings the ongoing
export commodity trade fair here.
</P>
<P>
For example, the coke of Shanxi, which is in ample supplies,
was sold at 90 U.S. dollars per ton at the fair, up from 74.9
U.S. dollars last year. The 20 varieties of Shanxi vinegar have
also sold well.
</P>
<P>
During the first half of the annual fair which opened on April
15, transactions of exports from the provinces of Anhui, Sichuan,
Hunan, Shanxi and Jiangxi, and Xinjiang Uygar Autonomous Region
rose sharply over last year.
</P>
<P>
"The good performance epitomizes the enhanced role of foreign
trade in the regional economy; it also shows the huge export
potential of these regions," said an official with the Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, China's foreign trade grew by 12 percent with a number
of regions achieving growth of over 20 percent, including 10
less-developed central and western provinces and regions.
</P>
<P>
The advantage of the products of the central and western
regions lies in their distinct local features, variety, good
quality and sales in small quantity, market analysts said.
</P>
<P>
"We can never neglect the importance of expanding the export
channel of the these regions," a trade official said.
</P>
<P>
The potential will be further tapped when an increasing number
of civil products made by previously military enterprises enter
into international markets.
</P>
<P>
The brand-name Changhong color television, for example, is
expected to make its debut at the export commodity fair this
autumn.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- A publisher in central China's
Henan Province has published a book with more than 500 selected
articles from an influential periodical encompassing modern
China's ideology early this century.
</P>
<P>
The articles, all published in the original style, were chosen

discussing radicals and conservatives, obsolete and new morals,
democracy, science, freedom and liberation.
</P>

Much of the discussion has continued to today, and that's why
the articles are published again, according to a spokesman for the
Henan Literature and Art Press.
</P>
<P>

of the Chinese to the world.

Youth Again," caught the attention of many media and book
stores. Managers of some big stores here said that they are

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's GDP to Grow 6 Percent: ADB Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's GDP (gross domestic
product) growth is expected to grow by 6 percent in the 1997-98
fiscal year ending on June 30, 1998, an Asian Development Bank
(ADB) report available here Tuesday said.
</P>
<P>
The growth represents a slight rise from fiscal 1996-97, when
the country registered a 5.7 percent growth in its GDP, the
highest since 1990.
</P>
<P>
The report said that growth in agriculture may slow down in
1997-98, from a growth of 6 percent the previous year, while the
industry sector would rebound from its "disappointing
performance."
</P>
<P>
And the fiscal deficit, which accounted for 5.5 percent of the
country's GDP last year, is forecast to decline to about 5 percent
of the GDP in fiscal 1998-99, but will remain high this year as
the recent pay increase for the public sector will raise public
expenditure, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Inflation rate in the country is expected to rise moderately to
5.5 percent this fiscal year from 3.9 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Both imports and exports will witness increases this fiscal
year, with the former expected to rise by 8 percent compared to 3
percent last year, and the latter to grow by 15 percent compared
to 13.7 percent in the 1996-97 financial year.
</P>
<P>
The report suggests that the Bangladeshi government develop
adequate infrastructure, including energy, roads, ports, and
telecommunications, to attract more foreign investment,
particularly in power generation, gas exploration,
telecommunications and cement production.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Needs More Skilled Professionals, Official Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital is badly in
need of competent managerial personnel, academicians, high-tech
talent and those with two or more kinds of professional skills, a
municipal official said here today.
</P>
<P>
High-tech industries, service trades and private enterprises
will attract more competent people in the future, said Xin
Tieliang, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Personnel
Bureau, at a news conference on the city's personnel resources.
</P>
<P>
Government departments will want fewer people now that
institutional restructuring is under way, Xin said.
</P>
<P>
The total human resources and demand for skilled professionals
will be approximately even in Beijing this year, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
Some 75,000 will graduate from institutions of higher learning,
secondary professional schools and adult schools, or retire from
the army this year. On the other hand, the total demand for such
people is about 70,000.
</P>
<P>
However, Xin said structural problems remain, explaining that
those studying specialties such as computer science, machinery,
industrial automation, marketing, architecture and foreign
languages will be more in demand.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Two South Africans who
bought three leopards from a game farmer appeared in a court in
Windhoek, Namibia last Friday on a charge of illegally
transporting or possessing a protected species.
</P>
<P>
South African citizen Willem Adriaan Nel and J. Knoesen were
arrested by Namibia's Police at a bar in Windhoek shortly after

sources as reporting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses at the bar said the animals were being taunted by
people around the vehicle. Some threw cigarette butts at the
leopards, apparently to elicit a show of aggression.
</P>
<P>
Several foreign conservationists attending a conference in
Namibia also witnessed the animals' mistreatment.
</P>
<P>
Clarky McKay, Commanding Officer of Namibia said the arrested
South Africans bought the leopards without having the permit

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Seeks Alternative Fish Fillets Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania is seeking
alternative markets for the export of its fish fillets after the
European Union (EU) imposed a ban on the goods late last year out
of fear of cholera spread.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Minister of Natural Resources and Tourism Zakia
Meghji has said one potential market is Zimbabwe and that
consultations have been made during President Mkapa's visit to
that country last week, The Guardian reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The market is already there. But it is the question of
research," Meghji said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean experts will visit Tanzania to conduct a survey
before inking an agreement, she said.
</P>
<P>
Last December, the EU imposed a ban on export of fresh fish
fillets from east African countries on the shores of Lake
Victoria, the second largest freshwater lake in the world,
because of an outbreak of cholera there.
</P>
<P>
Fillets of the nutritious fish of Nile Perch which was
introduced into the lake in the 1960s have been attractive to
European countries. Tanzania used to export 13,000 tons of fish
fillets to the European market. Of the total, 7,000 tons were
fresh fish fillets while the other were frozen.
</P>
<P>
The embargo, if not lifted, will cause Tanzania a loss of 6.7
million U.S. Dollars a year, and has forced the country to seek
markets elsewhere. Apart from Zimbabwe, the minister said the
government is also finalizing plans to export fish fillets to
China, the United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Meghji said the ministry has formed a committee to recommend
the best forms of fish exports.

French Defense Ministry officials said that the visit, in

<HEADLINE> Former U.S. Commerce Secretary on Sino-U.S. Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Mickey Kantor, the former
Secretary of Commerce of the United States, said here today
that the U.S. business community believes President Clinton's
scheduled visit to China will continue to build relations between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Mentioning the successful visit to the United States by Chinese
President Jiang Zemin last year, Kantor, in an exclusive interview
with Xinhua, said that "the creation of a good atmosphere and the
policy of strategic cooperation between our two countries will
allow U.S. businesses to increase their involvement here in China,
which will be good for China and U.S. businesses alike."
</P>
<P>
Kantor, who was invited by the China Council for the Promotion
of International Trade, said he has learned that "great progress
has been made in many areas, including market access" during
negotiations between the United States and China on China's entry
into the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
He attributed the progress to the flexibility shown by the two
sides during the last few months, although "distribution and
agriculture are still of some concern."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Clinton administration supports China's
WTO entry on a commercially reasonable basis.
</P>
<P>
Of the financial crisis in Asia, Kantor said that China's
decision to refrain from devaluing its currency -- RMB -- has
helped avoid another round of devaluation in Asia, which was
"important for the stabilization of the Asian economic situation."
</P>
<P>
The currency decision was looked upon as an active and
responsible move and was welcomed in the financial community, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Modern Chinese May Not All Originate From Peking Man: Scientist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese anthropologist has
offered a new explanation on the origin of modern Chinese.
</P>
<P>
"Modern Chinese may have developed separately from the south
and the north, and not all originated from Peking Man which lived
400,000-to-500,000 years ago in north China," said Zhang Zhenbiao,
a professor with the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and
Paleoanthropology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Zhang inferred that modern northern Chinese may have evolved
from northern apes represented by Peking Man, and southern Chinese
may have developed from southern Asian apes represented by the
Yuanmou Man in Yunnan Province about 1.7 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
However, most previous research inferred that modern Chinese
all originated from Peking Man.
</P>
<P>
Zhang found that the difference between modern southern Chinese
and northern Chinese dates back more than 100,000 years after
analyzing the skulls in 36 regions dating from 200,000 years ago
to the present.
</P>
<P>
"At that time, the facial characteristics of modern Chinese
began to appear and could be basically divided into two types: the
south and the north," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
The professor compared detailed measurements of the skulls and
the result showed that, if analyzed in two groups with the Yangtze
River as the boundary, the evolution of both the southern and
northern skulls are continuous.
</P>
<P>
"If not, there is an obvious discontinuity in evolution from
the early sapiens to the late sapiens, which could hardly be
explained," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, I infer that modern Chinese may not have developed
from the same near ancestor."
</P>
<P>
Zhang added that he could only infer the southern and northern
near ancestors of modern Chinese are the southern early sapiens
represented by the Maba Man in Guangdong Province and the northern
early sapiens represented by the Dali Man in Shaanxi Province and
the Jinniushan Man in Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
"And, before that, which apes they evoluted from needs further
research and cannot be decided yet," Zhang said.

<P>
JERUSALEM -- The Bank of Israel will cut the key lending rate
by 0.3 percentage points to 11.9 percent in May.
</P>

The officials are expected to exchange views over the issues of
the pipeline construction aimed at exploiting the abundant Caspian
oil and natural gas.
</P>
<P>
The planned pipeline from Azerbaijani capital of Baku to the
southern Turkish city of Ceyhan, which has 468 kilometers in
Azerbaijan, 225 kilometers in Georgia and 1,037 kilometers in
Turkey, is of great significance to the three countries' energy
industries, according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
A report prepared by German experts and financed by the World
Bank put the total cost of the project at around 2.5 billion
U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> S'pore Manufacturing Output Up 6.1 Pct in 1st Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's manufacturing
output in the first quarter of this year grew by 6.1 percent from
a year ago, partly because of the low base in 1997 and the fast

<P>
It said that for the same reasons, the manufacturing output in
March increased by eight percent.
</P>
<P>
The EDB said the pharmaceutical industry grew by 106.5 percent
compared to March last year, boosted by the production of high
value added pharmaceuticals by an existing company and increased
capacity in a new plant. Cumulative output for the first quarter
of 1998 rose by 22.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The output of the electronic cluster rose by 4.5 percent in
March. There was significant growth in semiconductors arising from
increased U.S. sales and in comparison with the weak base last
year when the semiconductor segment was in the slump.
</P>
<P>
The cumulative output for the electronics cluster registered a
4.6 percent increase in the first three months of the year.
</P>
<P>
The chemicals cluster, including petroleum, petrochemicals,
pharmaceuticals and specialty chemicals, recorded a year-on-year
growth of 31.8 percent in March, with increases coming from the

substantial growth. The cumulative output for the first quarter
grew by 13.3 percent compared to the same period of 1997, the EDB

<HEADLINE> Afghan Factions Trade Accusations on Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's Islamic Taliban
militia and their rival Northern Alliance Tuesday accused each
other of opposing peace in their current round of talks being held
in Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
"We are not opposing the peace. We have already adopted an
agenda which includes formation of the Ulema Commission," Rasoor
Talib, member of the alliance delegation, told Xinhua when his
attention was drawn to a report broadcast by the Taliban-run Radio
Shariat.
</P>
<P>
"There is different interpretation of the Ulema between (the
two sides). They've their own definition and we've another," said
Talib, representative of the Hezb-e-Wadhat, which is one of the
major alliance factions.
</P>
<P>
"They (Taliban) are blocking the road to peace, and we want
talks to move further," he said.
</P>
<P>
He quoted Abdul Waheel, head of the Taliban delegation, as
saying "my first proposal is my last proposal" in Monday's session
of talks.
</P>
<P>
"This means they (Taliban) don't believe in consultations,"
Talib said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, Radio Shariat declared that "the opposition
delegation are not ready to accept the Ulema Commission."
</P>
<P>
The radio said that the alliance representatives had reversed
an earlier stand and now opposed the formation of the Ulema
Commission to solve the country's protracted conflict.
</P>
<P>
The Steering Committee talks, which started on Sunday, were
suspended Monday to enable both delegations to consult with their
top leaders over the issue of who should be qualified to sit on
the proposed Ulema Commission.
</P>
<P>
The Steering Committee, made up of five Taliban and nine
alliance delegates, is to resume its talks Tuesday afternoon,
announced James Ngobi, acting head of the U.N. Special Mission on
Afghanistan, Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
During their morning session on Monday, the two sides agreed on
a four-point agenda which includes formation of the Ulema
Commission, a ceasefire, an exchange of POWs and the date and
venue of the next Steering Committee meeting.
</P>
<P>
The talks, the first face-to-face formal encounter between the
Taliban and the Northern Alliance in more than a year, are being
sponsored by the United Nations and the Organization of the
Islamic Conference.

<HEADLINE> Fire Disasters Cause 1.5 Billion Yuan in Losses for 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Fire disasters cost China 1.54
billion yuan (186 million U.S. dollars) in 1997, doubling that of
five years ago, a senior official with the Ministry of Public
Security said here today.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, more than 300,000 fires claimed 12,368
lives and injured 22,382 people in China, said Sun Lun, chief of
the Ministry's Fire Control Bureau, who was attending the ongoing
Second Session of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress (NPC) which will end Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
There were 88 disastrous conflagrations which left at least 10
dead and 20 severely injured each, Sun said.
</P>
<P>
The five-year loss for the nation and the people was 6 billion
yuan, said Sun, adding that authorities urgently need to propose a
law on fire control.
</P>
<P>
Some 320 people lost their lives and another 120 were injured
in a fire at a disco hall in northeastern Liaoning Province years
ago, sources from the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
China has had fire control regulations for 14 years, experts
said, however, the existing regulations cannot help reduce fires
and prevent them from happening.
</P>
<P>
The draft of a Law on Fire Control has been deliberated by the
NPC Standing Committee several times.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that the draft might be approved in the
current session.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Call for Profound Changes in Higher Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Senior Chinese legislators said
today that China's higher education system must undergo profound
changes to meet the national goal of revitalizing the country with
science and education.
</P>
<P>
Deliberating the draft Law on Higher Education at the ongoing
second session of the National People's Congress (NPC) Standing
Committee, many lawmakers offered sharp comments on the system,
saying that the present system has lagged far behind the country's
economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
In a country with a population of over 1.2 billion, there are
only 2,000 universities and colleges in China which enroll 5.67
million students.
</P>
<P>
Lawmaker Shen Jingzhu said that various types of institutions
of higher learning can be set up which can be run by the central,
provincial and municipal governments and individuals.
</P>
<P>
"There are too few higher education institutions in China, so
it is hard to change the present examination-oriented system with
such number and mechanism of the institutions," Shen said.
</P>
<P>
Many university presidents have to be engrossed in obtaining
funds instead of concentrating on teaching, Shen said.
</P>
<P>
Lawmaker Jiang Shusheng said that after the institutional
restructuring of the State Council, some universities and colleges
should detach themselves from the ministries and commissions of
the State Council.
</P>
<P>
He suggested the founding of an intermediatory organization
responsible for allocating funds to higher educational
institutions to coordinate their teaching and research.
</P>
<P>
The majority of colleges and universities which used to be run
by the ministries and commissions of the State Council can be run
by provincial governments, but some high-quality ones should
remain under the overall management of the Ministry of Education,
the lawmaker said.
</P>
<P>
According to the draft law, the state encourages enterprises,
social organizations and citizens to manage institutions of higher
learning. However, fiscal appropriation will remain the main
channel of funding universities and colleges.

Kim, adding that he is looking forward to visiting China at an
early date.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Hu expressed his appreciation of Kim's
dedication to the growth of relations between China and South
Korea. The remarkable development in bilateral ties achieved over
the past five years is not only in line with the fundamental
interests of the two peoples, but also conducive to peace,
stability and development on the Korean peninsula, Hu added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Korean peninsula problems, Hu said that the
Chinese government has always been striving for the maintenance of
peace and stability in the area, which is China's basic principle
concerning the affairs on the peninsula.
</P>
<P>
China hopes that both sides on the peninsula would promote
mutual understanding and trust, and improve their relations
gradually through contacts and dialogue to create environment for
the realization of self-reliance and peaceful reunification,
the Chinese vice-president added.

<P>
-- French Minister of Education Claude Allegre has decided to
reduce the weekly school hours in high schools to 35 hours, in

<P>
-- Winning 12.9 percent of the votes in the regional election

biggest victory of the extreme-right in Germany since the end of
the war.
</P>

from the west after reunification.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The defeat on Sunday of the mainstream rightwing candidates
for the local parliament in Toulon, southern France, reflected the
weakening and disarray within the rightwing RPR and UDF. A
socialist candidate and a candidate from the extreme-right
National Front will compete each other in the run-off next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a latest poll shows that 53 percent of the French
people consider the FN as a party different in nature from others.
</P>
<P>
-- The tension over interest rates in the United States and
Germany and the uncertainty over the nomination of president of the
European Central Bank have made the major stock indexes in Europe
and the United States fall on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Weaker Ahead of CPI Figures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed
Tuesday weaker just ahead of the release of the consumer price
index (CPI) due Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The local currency ended at 64.48 U.S. cents from 64.69 on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The CPI data is widely tipped to show inflation remains
subdued, thus increasing speculation of a rate cut by the Reserve
Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar also sank slowly at the end of the
trading day, weighed down by the weakness in the Japanese yen and
the gold price.
</P>
<P>
Rothschild Australia treasury manager Paul Macarounas said:
"The yen is still very, very choppy and most things in this time
zone are moving with it."
</P>
<P>
A weakness in the gold price also caused damage to the local
unit.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that gold very easily went back under 310.00 U.S.
dollars has also weighed on the Aussie," Macarounas said.
</P>
<P>
The gold price finished at 309.15 U.S. dollars down from 311.65
at the close Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed at 84.99 from 85.64 against the
Japanese yen and at 1.1539 from 1.1614 against the Deutsche mark.

<HEADLINE> Air Route Linking Highest Airport Achieves Safety Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- China Southwest Airlines
announced today it has achieved three years of safe operations
between Chengdu in southwest China's Sichuan Province and Bangda
Airport of Changdu in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
The Bangda Airport of Changdu on the "roof of the world," the
Tibetan Plateau, is the world's highest airport. It is 4,334
meters above sea level, and the air route connecting it is
considered by the world's civil aviation industry as the most
difficult.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen Bo, spokesman for the airline, the launch of
the Chengdu-Changdu route three years ago was "another wonder in
civil aviation history after the opening of the Chengdu-Lhasa
route," and terminated the city's total dependence on highway
transportation.
</P>
<P>
Changdu, halfway on the Sichuan-Tibet Highway, is a political
and cultural center of eastern Tibet. It took five days to reach
either end of the highway, Chengdu or Lhasa, before the air
passage was available.
</P>
<P>
In the last three years, 414 flights in Boeing 757 series
have safely transported 37,000 passengers.
</P>
<P>
Faced with unfavorable flying conditions, including constant
weather changes and complicated geography, Southwest Airlines
conducts the highest safety management system, special plane
standard, between Chengdu and Changdu. Each flight has two
captains on board.
</P>
<P>
The airline has not recorded an accident during its 42-year
performance on the route connecting the Tibetan Plateau with the
outside.

<HEADLINE> Australian Sharemarket Continues Slide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The Australian share market lost
1.3 percent Tuesday to close at its lowest level since April 3,
after fears of a rate increase in the United States and lower
Asian markets sapped confidence.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index fell 36.7 points lower at 2,781.3, but
off lows of 2,763.1 in late trade.
</P>
<P>
"The fall was on the back of Wall Street and concerns about
interest rate rises. The weakness in the Asian markets during the
day has perpetuated that," Steve Mayne from Nevitts said.
</P>
<P>
"A US interest rate rise is more and more of a possibility and
there is less likelihood there will be a rate cut here," he said.
</P>
<P>
Locally, banking stocks were sold off on the interest rate
prospects, with National Australia Bank's 67.2 cent fall, the
largest drop of the majors. ANZ fell 30.6 cents, Commonwealth
dropped 19.2 while Westpac was steady at 10.60 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
The banking index fell 1.73 percent or 102.7 points to 5,838.7,
while the all industrials index finished 1.38 percent or 66.3
points lower at 4,746.4.
</P>
<P>
News Corp ordinary shares lost 19.7 cents to 10.227 Australian
dollars while the Preferreds shed 20 to 8.70 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
Patrick stevedores parent Lang Corp lost another 10 cents to
1.65 Australian dollars as the market awaited the outcome of its
High Court battle with the Maritime Union of Australia.
</P>
<P>
The all resources index closed 12.5 points weaker at 1,217.1,
with the gold sector weaker on a falling bullion price.
</P>
<P>
The gold index dropped 3.3 percent or 45.5 points to 1,328.1,
as the bullion price tumbled 2.75 per ounce to 308.90 U.S. dollars
in late Sydney trade.
</P>
<P>
National turnover was 312.52 million shares at a value of
908.01 million Australian dollars (590.2 million U.S. dollars)
with falls outnumbering rises by 826 to 349.

<HEADLINE> Export Policy Adjusted To Cope With Changing Global Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 28 (Xinhua) -- China is adjusting its export
policy to offset the negative influence of the financial crisis in
Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Since the start of the financial crisis in Southeast Asia,
China has been confronted with declining exports to this region
and the increasing competitive pressure of cheaper products from
neighboring countries for export to Europe and North America.
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstances, China has not only expanded its
market share in Europe and North America but also built up trade
ties with customers in the Commonwealth of Independent States,
Eastern Europe, Africa and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
The policy of multi-outlet international markets and optimizing
the structure of exports has paid off at the 83rd Guangzhou
Commodity Export Trade Fair, which is being held in south China's
Guangdong Province, said Liu Xiangdong, assistant minister of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC).
</P>
<P>
So far, the transaction volume of the current trade fair has
exceeded the expectations of Chinese exporters. Both the number of
traders and orders have set all-time highs.
</P>
<P>
Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, the
country's leading fruit producer, signed its first contract to
export fruit to Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
As part of China's efforts to shift from labor-intensive to
technology-intensive production, MOFTEC has increased the
management and use of foreign trade funds and encouraged the
development of new, high-tech and high value-added products.
</P>
<P>
Starting from April 1, the country called off the export quota
on 24 products. China Import and Export Bank will increase the
credit to export complete sets of equipment.
</P>
<P>
Experiments on setting up Sino-foreign trade companies will be
carried out at port cities other than the Shenzhen Special
Economic Zone and the Pudong New Area this year, a MOFTEC official
said.
</P>
<P>
Relevant government departments are designing measures to
absorb more overseas investment and boost exports. The country
also encourages well-performing enterprises to build firms or
invest in Southeast Asia and other areas.

<HEADLINE> Australian POW Group Welcomes Comfort Women Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Two Australian "comfort women"
would be heartened by a Japanese court ruling that Japan
compensate three South Korean women forced to provide sex to
Japanese soldiers during World War II, an Australian group said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The two women were among a group of up to 1,000 Australian
former prisoners of wars (POW) taking a class action against the
Japanese government over Japan's treatment of civilian POWs in
World War II.
</P>
<P>
Australian Civilian Japanese War Prisoners Reparation Action
Group, which is based in Australia's third largest city of
Brisbane, is seeking an official apology from the Japanese
government for Australian civilian POWS, as well as 14,300 U.S.
dollars for each surviving member of the group, the Australian
Associated Press (AAP) reported.
</P>
<P>
A ruling on its case, which began in the Tokyo District Court
in 1995, is expected about July, according to the group's Chairman
Harry Rynenberg.
</P>
<P>
Rynenberg said Monday's ruling on the South Korean women was
especially pertinent to at least two Australian women who, as
civilian POWs, were raped by Japanese soldiers in WW II.
</P>
<P>
AAP, which did not provide the names of the women, said one of
the Dutch-born women now lives in Brisbane in Queensland state and
the other in Townsville, a small town in Queensland in northeast
Australia.
</P>
<P>
"This decision is particularly welcome to a few of our members
who were called Comfort Women," Rynenberg was quoted by the wire
service as saying Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The main thing is that the ruling puts the Japanese government
in a position where they have to pay these people," he said.
</P>
<P>
"They have been steadfastly refusing that and now they have to
because this has created a precedent," he explained.
</P>
<P>
The Yamaguchi District Court in southern Japan Monday ordered
the Japanese government to pay 300,000 Japanese yen (2,270 U.S.
dollars) to each of the South Korean comfort women who were forced
to work in brothels for Japan's former Imperial Army.
</P>
<P>
Until now, Japan had refused to pay direct compensation to any
of the women, saying all claims were settled by peace treaties
that formally ended the war.

<HEADLINE> China To Improve Export Quota System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 28 (Xinhua) -- China plans to further improve
its quota system for exporters in order to increase exports of
high quality goods, according to officials with the Chinese
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic relations.
</P>
<P>
China's quota system has served as a long-term policy for the
management of exports, according to officials, noting that reform
launched in 1994 was designed to enhance the competitiveness of
local exporters.
</P>
<P>
The new policy calls for domestic exporters to win quotas
through open bidding.
</P>
<P>
China currently practices two quota systems -- active quotas on
commodities subject to government restrictions and passive quotas
for commodities subject to restrictions in foreign countries,
including textiles.
</P>
<P>
Additional quotas will be granted to exporters of brand name
goods and those exploring new markets in East Europe and Africa,
according to officials.
</P>
<P>
They also noted that the government is currently cracking down
heavily on illegal quota trading.

<HEADLINE> Zhu Rongji Meets Kyrghyz President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- China's policy of developing
trans-century friendship and relations of cooperation with the
Kyrghyz Republic will remain unchanged, Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji
pledged in a meeting this morning with visiting Kyrghyz President
Askar Akyevich Akayev.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that China values very much its friendship with Kyrghyz,
adding that the Chinese government will continue to actively
promote cooperation in various sectors between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that Monday, Akayev's talks with Chinese President
Jiang Zemin were fruitful and wished his current visit to China a
great success.
</P>
<P>
Akayev congratulated Zhu for his serving as Chinese premier and
spoke highly of the progress made in bilateral friendly relations
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Akayev said Kyrghyz-China cooperation has become the locomotive
for the economic development of his country. Akayev said he hoped
bilateral relations oriented toward the 21st century would be
further developed and raised to a new high.
</P>
<P>
Zhu stressed that China and the Kyrghyz Republic, as good
neighbors, have many convenient conditions in their economic and
trade cooperation. Although the current trade volume between the
two countries is not large, potential of bilateral cooperation
remains to be tapped, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said the pivotal points are to take the market demand into
account, choose the right projects for cooperation and proceed
step by step. Zhu said he believed economic and trade cooperation
between the two countries would reach a new level as long as both
sides take concrete measures.

<HEADLINE> Israel Vows to Keep Settlements in Occupied Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Jewish settlements in occupied
Palestinian territories will stand where they are, although they
are blamed for blocking the peace process, according to Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
In an interview published by the English daily The Jerusalem
Post Tuesday, Netanyahu said his government intends to keep all
the settlements there.
</P>
<P>
"I am not delineating a map for you, but our insistence has
been on keeping all the settlements," he told the newspaper on the
eve of Israel's jubilee celebration for the 50th anniversary of
the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to jeopardize the security of any one of them
(Israeli settlements)," he added.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's settlement projects, together with other hard-line
policies, have stalled the peace talks with Palestinians for over
a year. Current efforts by the United States and the European
Union to break the deadlock are making little progress due to
Israel's intransigency.
</P>
<P>
Visiting U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross continued his intensive
mediation here Monday by meeting Israeli President Ezer Weizman
and Palestinian negotiators in order to solve their dispute over
Israel's second redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Ross, who is here to prepare for the May 4 London talks
between U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Israeli
and Palestinian leaders, has so far achieved little in narrowing
the gaps.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu told reporters in Jerusalem Monday night that he has
not softened his position on rejecting the U.S. plan for a 13.1
percent pullback. Israel's right-wing coalition has said it only
agreed to a redeployment of no more than 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu explained that withdrawing from over 9 percent of
West Bank would make it difficult to protect the safety of 40,000
Jewish children travelling on the West Bank's roads.
</P>
<P>
Expressing frustration over Israel's foot-dragging in the
redeployment issue, the Palestinian side has warned against dire
consequences about the failure of the latest round of American
and European mediation.
</P>
<P>
Even Weizman, an outspoken critic of Netanyahu's policies,
spoke out Monday to urge Netanyahu to be more forthcoming so as to
help advance the peace talks. Meeting twice with Netanyahu,
Weizman expressed his dissatisfaction with Netanyahu's failure to
break the peace deadlock.

<HEADLINE> Moi Criticizes NGO's Forum on Kenya's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
has criticized a forum on Kenya's economy organized by
non-governmental organizations (NGO) last weekend, saying it
ignored the existence of a constitutionally elected government
in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement issued Monday in Eldoret, about 320 km
northwest of Nairobi, the president said Kenya has many eminent
economists and scholars, who will comfortably discuss any facet
of the country's development needs, the Kenya Times reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He declared that the ruling Kenya African National Union
(KANU) will not support any motion arising out of the forum
which was held in the port city of Mombasa by the World Bank and
some other NGOs.
</P>
<P>
Moi stressed that his government should be the central player
in any discussions regarding the interests of Kenyans.
</P>
<P>
It is ironical that the NGOs who convened the Mombasa forum
are the same ones which are notorious for organizing strikes to
disrupt Kenya's economic activities, he added.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has no genuine reason to discuss matters in
Kenya with shady non-governmental organizations, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The local Daily Nation reported Tuesday that the president's
denunciation of the two-day forum cast a shadow over its
resolutions among which is the formation of a 19-member
parliamentary committee to seek ways of salvaging the country's
economy.
</P>
<P>
The forum also recommended that the number of government
ministries be reduced from 25 to 18 so as to lessen the financial
burden on the national coffers.

<HEADLINE> Two S. Africans Detained for Buying Leopards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Two South Africans who
bought three leopards from a game farmer appeared in a court in
Windhoek, Namibia last Friday on a charge of illegally
transporting or possessing a protected species, local press the
Citizen quoted informed sources as reporting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
South African citizen Willem Adriaan Nel and J. Knoesen were
arrested by the Namibia's Police Protected Resources Unit at a
bar in Windhoek shortly after midnight on Thursday. They had
three leopards held in open cages on the back of their bakkie.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses at the bar said the animals were being taunted by
people around the vehicle. Some threw cigarette butts at the
leopards, apparently to elicit a show of aggression.
</P>
<P>
Several foreign conservationists attending a conference in
Namibia also witnessed the animals' mistreatment.
</P>
<P>
Clarky McKay, Commanding Officer of the protected resources
unit said the arrested South Africans bought the leopards without
having the permit required for the possession and transportation
of the animals.
</P>
<P>
The South Africans paid 3,000 Rand (600 U.S. Dollars) for each
of the leopards. They were released on bail of 1,000 Rand (200
U.S. Dollars) each after they made a first appearance in the
Windhoek Magistrate's Court on Friday.

<HEADLINE> 3 Nations to Hold Talks on Caspian Oil Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Energy officials from Turkey,
Azerbaijan and Georgia will hold talks in Istanbul, the largest
city in Turkey, from May 5 to 6 on the Baku-Ceyhan pipeline,
Turkish Daily News reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Energy Minister Cumhur Ersumer and Azerbaijani Oil
Company SOCAR Chairman Natik Aliyev will head their respective
delegations. Giorgi Canturiria, head of the Georgian Oil Company,
is to attend the talks as an observer.
</P>
<P>
The officials are expected to exchange views over the issues of
the pipeline construction aimed at exploiting the abundant
Caspian oil and natural gas.
</P>
<P>
The planned pipeline from Azerbaijani capital of Baku to the
southern Turkish city of Ceyhan, which has 468 kilometers in
Azerbaijan, 225 kilometers in Georgia and 1,037 kilometers in
Turkey, is of great significance to the three countries' energy
industries, according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
A report prepared by German experts and financed by the World
Bank put the total cost of the project at around 2.5 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
If completed, the pipeline is expected to have a capacity of
45 million tonness per year and the figure can be raised in the
future, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel, Azerbaijani President
Geidar Aliyev and Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze met in
Turkey's Black Sea city of Trabzon Sunday. They said that the
three countries will join hands in making this huge project a
success.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, as an energy-starving country, has been playing an
active role in exploiting the Caspian oil resources to meet its
rapidly increasing energy demands and to earn foreign exchange
through the pipeline that passes through its territory.

<HEADLINE> Funds Increased for Natural Science Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The State Natural Science Fund
Committee (SNSFC) has allocated 760 million yuan (91.6 million
U.S. dollars) to the country's natural science research, an
increase of 120 million yuan over 1997.
</P>
<P>
The committee has improved controls on funds for scientific
research and tried to help scientists involved in projects, which
cater to the country's general goals, said Zhang Cunhao, chairman
of the SNSFC, at an ongoing meeting of the Third SNSFC which
opened Monday in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said the committee has been providing stable financial
support for research on basic sciences, and the projects it funded
have been productive.
</P>
<P>
The committee approved 3,454 ordinary research projects in
1997, and appraised 98 key projects and 14 major projects in
scientific research. These projects were completed during the
1991-1995 period, he said.
</P>
<P>
It has set up new funds to encourage young overseas scholars to
conduct scientific research in China each year. The committee has
also made efforts to promote popular science, and expand
international exchanges and cooperation, Zhang said, adding that
SNSFC had signed agreements with 44 scientific research institutes
from 35 countries and regions by the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
The committee is also trying to map out a trans-century plan at
the meeting, which would include taking part in the major basic
research projects, promoting the construction of a national
innovation system, and trying to grant more funds for scientific
research efforts.
</P>
<P>
SNSFC, established in Beijing in 1986, aims to use research
funds effectively, and to coordinate and provide funds for
research in basic science and some fields of applied science in
accordance with the state policies and plans.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Environment
Program (UNEP) Chief, Klaus Topfer, stressed Tuesday at his Nairobi
headquarters that the worldwide efforts by the U.N. against forest
fires must continue.
</P>
<P>
"I must stress that the United Nations system's efforts to
mobilize international assistance to fight the catastrophic fires
must continue," he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"We need to act on the basis of a worst-case scenario-short
rains, return of the drought and a repetition of last year's
disastrous situation," he noted, citing the big forest fires in
Indonesia earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
"Both the national authorities and the international
community, through the United Nations, must stand ready to tackle
the further recurrence of the fires, which could certainly be
expected," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Topfer welcomed the reports of recent rains in
Indonesia's forest fire ravaged areas.
</P>
<P>
"Of course, rains are most welcome anywhere in Indonesia, as
many parts of the country are battling severe drought," he said.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that donor countries were requested at a meeting
in Geneva to provide 10 million U.S. Dollars as emergency
assistance to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
More than 250,000 hectares of land in Indonesia's East
Kalimantan Province have been razed by fires this year.

<HEADLINE> Largest Random Survey of Chinese Urban Consumers Conducted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- China has finished a random
survey on the consumption patterns of residents in 12 major
cities in the largest market research of its kind ever.
</P>
<P>
The survey -- organized by Telmar, the British Market Research
Bureau (BMRB), the State Statistics Bureau and Chinese market
research firms -- involved 48,804 residents aged from 15 to
59. The 12 cities included Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu,
Shenyang, Tianjin, Jinan, Xi'an, Nanjing, Wuhan, Kunming and
Fuzhou.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 Chinese and foreign workers participated in the
sampling and data processing.
</P>
<P>
The results of the survey show that 24 percent residents have a
monthly income of 499 yuan per capita or less; 49 percent receive
500-to-999 yuan; 19 percent, 1,000-to-1,499 yuan; and 8 percent,
above 1,500 yuan.
</P>
<P>
In terms of family income, 20 percent of urban families have
a monthly income of 999 yuan or less; 28 percent are between 1,000
and 1,499 yuan; 22 percent are between 1,500 and 1,999 yuan; 15
percent are between 2,000 and 2,499 yuan; and the rest have
monthly incomes of 2,500 yuan or more.
</P>
<P>
About 17 percent of urban families spend more than 700 yuan on
food every month; 23 percent, 500-to-699 yuan; and 33 percent,
300-to-499 yuan. Twenty-seven percent of urban families spend 200

percent and 8 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The results of the survey also indicate that the manufacturers
of VCD players, air conditioners, acoustic equipment and microwave
ovens will have the highest sales growth this year. Eight percent
of urban families plan to buy VCD players; 5 percent, air
conditioners and acoustic equipment; and 4 percent, microwave
ovens and personal computers.

<HEADLINE> China Welcomes EU Removal of Non-Market Label </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese State Councillor Wu Yi
said today that the Chinese government welcomes the European Union
(EU)'s decision to remove China from its list of "non-market
economies".
</P>
<P>
She called the decision "sensible", and noted that it will help
ensure the development of Sino-EU trade ties remain on the proper
track.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the comments during a Xinhua News Agency interview
following her meeting with a German business delegation.
</P>
<P>
EU foreign ministers agreed to remove the "non-market economy"
label formerly applied to both China and Russia during a Monday
council meeting in Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Foreign Ministry warmly welcomed a similar EU
commission proposal tabled December 16 last year.
</P>
<P>
Economist and trade experts say the decision will help solve
problems many Chinese products have faced as a result of
anti-dumping sanctions imposed by the EU. They also note that the
EU will gradually ease controls on Chinese export to the EU.
</P>
<P>
The EU is one on the list of regions which have initiated the
greatest number of anti-dumping investigations against Chinese
products, with some 70-odd related cases on file to date.
</P>
<P>
The EU has imposed quotas, export licensing and various other
controls on exports of Chinese textiles and various other light
industrial products.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the EU has removed China from the "non-market
economy" list does not mean that it regards China as a market
economy, according to Song Jian, a senior researcher with the
Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the EU will not adopt policies applicable for market
economy countries in all anti-dumping cases involving Chinese
products and exports, said Song.
</P>
<P>
He added that that the EU should make further commitments in
order to completely solve problems related to anti-dumping cases
against Chinese goods and controls on Chinese exports.

MANILA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- About 1,400 more members of the
Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) will start a six-month
training course next month prior to their integration into the
Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), the military said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
After a thorough screening and authentication, a total of 1,361
MNLF members have qualified for training for enlisted men while 55
others qualified to the officers course, said Southern Command
Deputy Commander Col. Jessie James Catral.
</P>
<P>
Catral said the training of these MNLF members is part of a
peace agreement signed between the government and the MNLF in
1996.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, the MNLF should be disarmed and disbanded,
and some 6,000 MNLF members will be integrated into the AFP and
the police force.
</P>
<P>
The landmark agreement ended more than three decades of MNLF
separatist movement in Mindanao, the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
A similar number of former MNLF guerrillas have completed their
training course last year and joined the AFP.

<HEADLINE> Over 60,000 Landmines Cleared in Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Over 60,000 landmines have been
cleared in 35,000 hectares of landmine zones all over Mozambique
since the country implemented the program to accelerate de-mining
(PAD) in 1993.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed Monday by Osorio Mateus, Head of the
National Committee of De-mining, local paper Noticias reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mateus accompanied a delegation of the Non-governmental
Association of America (UNA) Monday during their visit to Moamba
landmine zone, about 70 km away from Maputo, which used to be a
base for the former anti-government organization, the Mozambique
National Resistance (Renamo).
</P>
<P>
According to Mateus, it costs about 3.5 million US Dollars a
year for the PAD to be implemented in Maputo, Gaza and Inambane
provinces with the support of the Mozambican government and the
United Nations Development Program (UNDP).
</P>
<P>
He also revealed that the PAD will soon be carried out in
areas along the Maputo-Komatipoorti (South Africa) high pressure
transmission line. The project has gained a three-million-Dollar
assistance from a French bank.
</P>
<P>
The results of the U.S. delegation's visit will be announced
at a special meeting by the U.S. State Department on May 20 to
22.
</P>
<P>
About two million landmines had been planted around Mozambique
during its 16-year-long civil war.

<HEADLINE> China Seeks Effective Therapy for Liver Cancer Treatment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese doctors have found an
effective measure to deal with the later stages of liver cancer
with a patented multi-needle, cold-therapy apparatus.
</P>
<P>
Investigation indicates that, among 53 liver cancer patients
who had received the cold therapy in Shiyan City in central
China's Hubei Province, more than 40 percent survived two years
and five people had survived for five years.
</P>
<P>
In usual cases, patients in the medium or later stages of liver
cancer only survive three to six months. Liver cancer is being
regarded in the medical field as the "king of cancers" because of
the high death rate.
</P>
<P>
The multi-needle cold therapy apparatus, developed at the
central hospital of Dongfeng Motor Vehicle Company, passed
state-level appraisal earlier this week in Shiyan City.
</P>
<P>
Different from other countries' shallow-position cold therapy,
the China-made apparatus can go deeper.
</P>
<P>
The apparatus inserts several specially-made needles into the
liver cancer lump from different directions and uses low
temperatures to kill cancer cells on a large scale.
</P>
<P>
The cancer cells can be killed in 20 degrees below zero
centigrade. The cold therapy could effectively control the
development of liver cancer cells.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Company to Launch Satellites From Australia: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard said Tuesday that his government had signed an agreement
with the U.S.-based Kistler Aerospace Corp to launch satellites
from Australia's rocket-launching town of Woomera.
</P>
<P>
The launching facilities at Woomera will be upgraded by the
company Tony O'Leary, a spokesman for the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
Howard said the agreement paves the way for an initial
investment of 32 million U.S. dollars from Kistler in the project,
under which tests are expected to begin by the end of this year
with the first commercial launch possibly in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The project would ultimately generate up to 1.88 billion U.S.
dollars over the next 12 years with the possible launch of one 65
million U.S. dollar reusable satellite-bearing rocket "every two
weeks," the prime minister said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Britain, Germany and some other countries used to have rockets
launched at Woomera in the past decades, O'Leary said.
</P>
<P>
"It is estimated that over 1,000 communication satellites will
be launched around the world over the next 10 years and this
project helps vision Australia alongside the United States, Russia
and China as a top country in space and communications
technology," Howard said.

<P>
Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, Shi
Guangsheng, also expressed welcome to the decision, saying
that it is of great importance to China because it makes
a great difference in conducting anti-dumping investigations.
</P>
<P>
For a non-market economy country, if the anti-dumping tax is
levied on one of its products, all other products of the same
category will be punished likewise, Shi explained.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he added, the price of the products of a
non-market economy country will be calculated according to that of
a surrogate country instead of its domestic price.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry Zhu Bangzao also
extended a welcome to the EU decision here this afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Prepared to Receive Prisoners Released by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Jordan is prepared to receive the
13 Jordanian prisoners released Monday by the Kuwaiti authorities,
semi-official Jordan Times reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Crown Prince Hassan, the Regent, has issued orders for all
necessary preparations to receive as soon as possible the
Jordanians who were jailed by Kuwait for allegedly collaborating
with Iraq during the Gulf War in 1991, Jordan's acting Foreign
Minister Sami Gammo said Monday during an exclusive interview with
the paper.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to bring them home at any time. We are only
waiting for the formalities to be concluded, and that might take
some time," said Gammo.
</P>
<P>
It was announced on Monday night that Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Jaber
Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah has issued an amnesty to release the 13
Jordanians held since 1991 in the latest gesture of reconciliation
with Jordan which supported Iraq during the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Gammo expressed Jordan's gratitude to the Kuwaiti
emir for granting the amnesty, saying that Jordan hopes the
"brotherly relations" between the two countries will develop
further.
</P>
<P>
Monday's release is the result of continued efforts by the
Jordanian leadership to secure the release of all the Jordanians
jailed by Kuwait on charges of "collaborating" with Iraq, whose
number is estimated at around 60, the paper quoted anonymous
sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
On February 25, 1997, Kuwait released 10 Jordanians under
another amnesty by the Kuwaiti emir.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian-Kuwaiti relations were strained following the
Gulf War when Jordan sided with Iraq, which occupied Kuwait for
seven months before the allied forces drove the Iraqi troops out
of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The emirate downgraded its diplomatic representation in Amman
to the level of charge d'affaires. But bilateral ties have been
improving since last year.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak-Netanyahu Talks End, No Progress Announced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
apparently failed to persuade visiting Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu to offer compromise in Mideast peace process
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders held a two-hour-and-half meeting at the Salem
Palace here, an unusual venue of Mubarak's talks with foreign
leaders, shunning any reporters.
</P>
<P>
No press conferences or briefings were given by either leaders
or any officials. This was interpreted as an indication of a very
tough talk.
</P>
<P>
This has also broken up the custom pursued during Netanyahu's
previous visits that Netanyahu and Mubarak talked to reporters
after their meetings no matter how the talks went.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu left here immediately after the meeting, ending his
hours' visit, the fourth of the kind he paid since taking office
about two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak was believed to have urged Netanyahu to make compromise
in the scope of redeployment from the West Bank before the London
Israeli-Palestinian peace meeting and issued his warning of the
dangerous situation facing the region if the peace process
collapses.
</P>
<P>
The Mubarak-Netanyahu summit preceded the four-way London talks
on May 4 to be co-hosted by British Prime Minister Tony Blair and
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who will hold separate
meetings with Netanyahu and Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace making has been frozen after
Israel started a Jewish settlement on Arab East Jerusalem in March
1997 and deteriorated over the long-delayed Israeli redeployment
in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government has refused to accept any proposal
calling for more than 9 percent troop pullback in the West
Bank. But some reports said Netanyahu is considering an 11 percent
pullback in exchange for Palestinians' promise to intensify fight
against terrorism and enter the final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Mideast peace envoy Dennis Ross has met twice in the past
three days with Netanyahu to persuade him to accept a proposal for
a 13.1 percent redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
As a compromise, the PNA has already endorsed the proposal and
is demanding the U.S. pressure Israel to accept the plan.

<HEADLINE> China Welcomes EU Removal of Non-Market Label </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese State Councillor Wu Yi
said today that the Chinese government welcomes the European Union
(EU)'s decision to remove China from its list of "non-market
economies".
</P>
<P>
She called the decision "sensible", and noted that it will help
ensure that the development of Sino-EU trade ties remain on the
right track.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the comments during a Xinhua News Agency interview
following her meeting with a German business delegation.
</P>
<P>
EU foreign ministers agreed to remove the "non-market economy"
label formerly applied to both China and Russia during a Monday
council meeting in Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Foreign Ministry warmly welcomed a similar EU
commission proposal tabled December 16 last year.
</P>
<P>
Economist and trade experts agree that the decision will help
solve problems many Chinese products have encountered as a result
of anti-dumping sanctions imposed by the EU. They also note that
the EU will gradually lift controls on Chinese exports to the EU.
</P>
<P>
The EU is one on the list of regions which have initiated the
greatest number of anti-dumping investigations against Chinese
products, with some 70-odd related cases on file to date.
</P>
<P>
The EU has imposed quotas, export licensing and various other
controls on exports of Chinese textiles, silk products and various
other light industrial goods.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the EU has removed China from the "non-market
economy" list does not mean that it regards China as a market
economy, according to Song Jian, a senior researcher with the
Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the EU will not adopt policies applicable for market
economy countries in all anti-dumping cases involving Chinese
products and exports, said Song.
</P>
<P>
He added that that the EU should make further commitments in
order to completely solve problems related to anti-dumping cases
against Chinese goods and controls on Chinese exports.

<HEADLINE> Thai Government to Issue Bonds for Easing Liquidity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government plans to
issue bonds worth 500 billion baht (13.5 billion U.S. dollars) in
a bid to ease the liquidity crunch and bring down interest rates.
</P>
<P>
An official of Thailand's central bank disclosed Tuesday that
the measures will be submitted to the cabinet later in the day for
approval.
</P>
<P>
If the cabinet approves the measures, the Financial Ministry
will announce further details, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The central bank has proposed that the funds raised in the
local bond offering be allocated to its financial institutions
development fund, commonly known as the rescue fund, which has
provided large loans to debt-ridden banks and finance companies.
</P>
<P>
The decision to issue long-term local bonds is part of a
four-point plan to lower interest rates by easing the pressure on
the domestic short-term money market, said the official, who
refused to be named.
</P>
<P>
Financial authorities involved in the restructuring and
recapitalization of troubled financial institutions have come
under increasing political pressure to bring down the high lending
rates punishing Thailand's struggling private sector.
</P>
<P>
The three other measures to soften interest rates involve
commercial banks raising 90 billion baht (2.4 billion dollars) in
fresh capital, the government tapping foreign money markets to
boost local liquidity, and keeping under control competition for
deposits among local banks.
</P>
<P>
The central bank believed that interest rates would be brought
down if these measures were implemented.
</P>
<P>
For the measures to work effectively, however, the baht must be
stable and inflation must remain at an appropriate level, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
The baht has been stable since mid-March around 39 to 40 baht
to the dollar, down about 34 percent since the central bank
floated the currency last July.
</P>
<P>
But inflation is on the rise, with the consumer price index
rising 9.5 percent year-on-year in March, compared with 8.9
percent in February.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda's Ex-PM to Be on Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Former Rwandan Prime Minister
Jean Kambanda will be on initial trial at the International
Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) Friday, four days before U.N.
chief Kofi Annan's scheduled visit to the tribunal.
</P>
<P>
The former Rwandan prime minister is charged with conspiracy
and direct and public incitement to commit genocide as well as
crimes against humanity, according to a news release issued
Tuesday by the ICTR based in northern Tanzanian town of Arusha.
</P>
<P>
The 42-year-old man is the highest ranking Rwandan
ex-political leader indicted for genocide and detained by the
tribunal.
</P>
<P>
Kambanda was prime minister of Rwanda from 8 April 1994 until
mid July 1994 when he left the tiny central African state. He was
arrested in July last year in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
The tribunal has conducted only four trials and no verdict has
been made so far. Twenty-five out of a total of 35 indicted by
the U.N now are detained by the tribunal in Arusha.
</P>
<P>
The tribunal was often criticized for its snail-paced progress
towards visible justice for more than 500,000 Tutsis and moderate
Hutus killed in the 1994 Rwanda genocide.
</P>
<P>
However, Annan's May 5 visit "is an indication of the
consistent support the secretary-general has provided to the
Tribunal since he took office in early 1997," said the ICTR.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Tourism Poised for Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's tourism industry is
poised for fast growth this year as investors have pledged to put
80 million U.S. Dollars in the industry.
</P>
<P>
Agness Seenka, Chief Executive of the Zambia National Tourist
Board (ZNTB), confirmed this here on Monday. Times of Zambia
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper Times of Zambia Tuesday quoted Seenka as saying
that ZNTB has received a large number of applications for setting
up tourism enterprises across the country.
</P>
<P>
She attributed the sharp rise in the number of applications to
the on-going privatization of hotels and lodges.
</P>
<P>
The applicants are seeking to set up tourism enterprises
ranging from car hire, tour operation firms and travel agencies
mostly in the capital Lusaka and the southern city of
Livingstone, she said.
</P>
<P>
She said south African financial institutions have pledged to
finance projects aimed at improving infrastructure in game parks
of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zambia's tourism sector will be well represented at
the Indaba Tourism Fair to be held next month in Durban, South
Africa, according to Tour Operators Association of Zambia (TOAZ).
</P>
<P>
At least 17 Zambian tourism-related companies, in addition to
the Tourism Council of Zambia and the Ministry of Tourism, have
confirmed their participation in the fair.
</P>
<P>
"By participating in the fair, we have a chance to meet with
international companies and market Zambia as well as the safaris
and lodges that exist here," said a TOAZ official.
</P>
<P>
Tourism earnings in the country continued to rise in recent
years and reached 62.7 million Dollars in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Foreign Reserve Drops with Oil Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's external reserve
position went down by 2.55 billion U.S. Dollars, or 33.11
percent, in the first two months of this year, the Daily Times
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The foreign reserve of the country, which comprises savings
made on foreign exchange earnings from crude oil and other
sources, stood at 7.7 billion in December last year. It went down
to 5.15 billion at the end of February this year.
</P>
<P>
Finance Ministry sources are quoted as attributing the
significant drop in external reserve to the recent collapse in
the price of crude oil in the world market.
</P>
<P>
The persistent increased demand for foreign exchange at the
domestic exchange market further affected the nation's external
reserve position in February, according to the national daily.
</P>
<P>
It said that Nigeria lost about 700 million Dollars as income
in the first quarter of this year due to the sharp drop in crude
oil prices.
</P>
<P>
In this year's budget, the Nigerian government based its
revenue projection from crude oil on 17 Dollars per barrel, with
total earnings for the whole year estimated at 9.8 billion
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
But the oil price has gone as low as 12 Dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
Major oil producers in the world have taken various measures
in a bid to shore up oil price, and Nigeria, in its own effort,
has agreed to cut back oil production by 125,000 barrels daily.

COLOMBO, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's postal unions have
demanded the withdrawal of the police and the Army from the
Central Mail Exchange (CME) if the government wanted the postal
services to return to normal, informed sources here said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The military and police were moved in last Friday night after

<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian Foreign Minister Nadezhda
Mikhailova said trade sanctions on Yugoslavia should be the last
resort after all precautious diplomatic means are exhausted.
</P>
<P>
In an interview carried by the Bulgarian newspaper Capital on
Monday, Mikhailova called possible sanctions against Belgrade for
its handling of the Kosovo crisis an "extreme alternative."
</P>
<P>
The international community, she said, should be more cautious
this time than imposing sanctions years ago during the Bosnia war.
</P>
<P>
Previous sanctions were "disastrous" also to other countries in
the region, resulting in their heavy direct economic losses and a
sharp rise of criminal activities in economic life, she said.
</P>
<P>
However, in a related development Monday, the European Union
(EU) threatened to step up sanctions to press Yugoslavia into
talks with ethnic Albanians in its autonomous province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
On Mikhailova part, she had sent a letter to foreign ministers
of the six nations making up the Contact Group on the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Mikhailova said, she proposed the two
conflicting parties in Kosovo state their stands and possible
compromises in written form, and then go into talks.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Government Adopts Japan-U.S. Defense Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government adopted
Tuesday two bills and a draft revision of a bilateral agreement
for implementing updated Japan-U.S. defense cooperation guidelines.
</P>
<P>
The two bills will be submitted to the Diet, or parliament,
within the day at the earliest, Japanese government officials were
quoted as saying by a Kyodo News report.
</P>
<P>
The draft revision was signed Tuesday morning by Japanese
Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi and visiting U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
The proposed measures expand the scope of bilateral security
from the defense of Japanese territory to providing support for
the U.S. military in vaguely defined "areas surrounding Japan that
have an important influence on Japan's peace and security."
</P>
<P>
One bill allows Japan's Self-Defense Forces (SDF) to provide
rear support in supplies and services to U.S. forces, assist in
the search and rescue of injured U.S. military personnel, and
inspect ships of other nations on the high seas to ensure the
enforcement of economic sanctions approved by the United Nations
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Another bill would revise the SDF Law in line with the new
guidelines so as to allow Japanese warships and ship-borne
helicopters to evacuate Japanese nationals overseas.
</P>
<P>
The draft proposal would revise the Japan-U.S. Acquisition and
Cross-Servicing Agreement to match the new guidelines, as the
current agreement is effective only in peacetime.
</P>
<P>
Japan and the United States agreed last September on the
revised version of the 1978 bilateral defense cooperation
guidelines. The new version calls for Japan to provide more active
support to the U.S. military in the event of emergencies in "areas
surrounding Japan."

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Arrives in Cairo for Talks With Mubarak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Amid intensive diplomatic efforts
to unlock the Mideast peace logjam, Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu arrived here Tuesday morning on a lightning
visit to Egypt for talks with President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak is expected to warn the Israeli leader on the dangerous
situation facing the region if the peace process collapses.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders entered meeting Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is on his fourth visit to Egypt since taking office
about two years ago. Egyptian-Israeli ties have been further
strained since then.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace making has been frozen after
Israel started a Jewish settlement on Arab East Jerusalem in March
1997 and deteriorated over the long-delayed Israeli redeployment
in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Secretary General of the Israeli government Danny Naveh Monday
paid a short visit to Egypt during which he discussed with
Mubarak's political advisor Ossama al-Baz arrangements for
Netanyahu's visit to Cairo and issues that will be tabled during
the summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
Naveh told reporters that the arrangements for Israel's troops
redeployment is "unnegotiable," which has to be decided according
to its security need.
</P>
<P>
Until now, the Israeli government has not indicated any
willingness to accept any proposal calling for more than 9
percent troop pullback in the West Bank. But some reports said
Netanyahu is considering an 11 percent pullback in exchange for
PNA's promise to increase fight against terrorism and enter the
final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Mideast peace envoy Dennis Ross has met twice in the past
three days with Netanyahu to persuade him to accept a proposal for
a 13.1 percent redeployment in the West Bank so to break the
year-old deadlock in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
As a compromise, the PNA has already endorsed the proposal and
is demanding the U.S. pressure Israel to accept the plan.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, in an interview with the American T.V. network NBC
Monday, said he and Netanyahu will try their utmost to solve the
problems in the region during their talks Tuesday. He also renewed
warning against the explosion of terrorism if peace fails.
</P>
<P>
The Mubarak-Netanyahu summit preceded the four-way London talks
on May 4 to be co-hosted by British Prime Minister Tony Blair and
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who will hold separate
meetings with Netanyahu and Arafat.

<HEADLINE> AmCham Lobbies for Permanent MFN Status for China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The American commerce
community in China began Monday its annual lobbying in the United
States for China's permanent most favored nation(MFN) trade status
with a hope for weaker opposition from Congress.
</P>
<P>
A 30-member delegation from the Beijing-based American
Chamber (AmCham) of Commerce in China arrived here Sunday and
called a press conference to air its point of view in favor of
stronger trade ties with China the next day.
</P>
<P>
Vaughn A. Koshkarian, head of the delegation and also
vice president of Ford Motor Company, said that he and his
entourages share the belief that the United States should
"de-politicize and normalize trade with China by extending MFN
status on a permanent, unconditional basis and by removing all
unilateral commercial sanctions against China."
</P>
<P>
The MFN status for China has become a thorny issue over which
Congress debates once a year. The United States has given the
status to 227 countries in the world and only four nations
including China are denied the normal trade treatment.
</P>
<P>
Although President Bill Clinton has delinked the human rights
issue with trade regarding China, the annual congressional debate
over China's MFN has actually provided platform for attacking
Beijing's overall policy.
</P>
<P>
"The annual debate over China's MFN status undermines U.S.
commercial interests in China and significantly strains the
U.S.-China relations," Amcham said in a policy statement.
</P>
<P>
The delegation represents some 600 American companies in
China. It expressed the fears that "withdrawal or conditioning of
MFN would be a potentially destabilizing move in a region already
rocked by financial and trade uncertainties."
</P>
<P>
The delegation will be divided into six working groups and
plans to meet 250 congressmen, both proponents and opponents to
China's MFN, this week.
</P>
<P>
John L. Holden, Chairman &AMP; General Manager of Carcill
Investments (China) LTD., expressed the belief that the mood in
the House this year would be more "positive" because of the
changes in, and better understanding, of China by many
Congressional members who visited China last year.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, more than 100 Senators and House representatives
visited China.
</P>
<P>
"When they returned home none of them said the trip was not
positive," said Rudolph A. Schlais, president of General Motors
China Operations.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton is obliged to recommend to Congress by June 3
that China's MFN be or not be renewed. The House of
Representatives has 30 days to determine.
</P>
<P>
James W. Jarrett, president of Intel China, shared the belief
that the Administration is in favor of permanent MFN for China.
</P>
<P>
The issue is now linked to China's accession to the World Trade
Organization (WTO), over which the United States and China are
continuing their difficult negotiations.
</P>
<P>
China wants to be treated as a developing country, but the
United States and some other industrialized countries are pushing
for further opening of the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
If China can become a WTO member, its MFN status will no longer
make sense. However, no one can predict when the process will be
over.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will visit China in late June. It is believed that
China's WTO membership will be high on the agenda of his summit
with Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that President Clinton's visit to China will
be very successful," said Vaughn, who declined to specify his
expectations from the president's trip.
</P>
<P>
The delegation voiced its hope that China will further "level
the playing field for American exports" so as to balance the
growing trade deficit, and to increase transparency and enhance
the rule of law to minimize risks.

<P>
JERUSALEM, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The following are major new
items in leading Israeli newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- United States President Bill Clinton told the Post in an
interview that the U.S. diplomatic efforts have lowered
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's expectation for a further
Israeli redeployment in West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he believed that both Israelis and Palestinians
are ready to heed the U.S. call to make pivotal decisions to
advance the talks.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will meet with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak Tuesday morning in Cairo to
discuss on breaking the Israeli-Palestinian deadlock. Netanyahu's
message to Mubarak: I am serious, but there are limitations.
</P>
<P>
Maariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Sources in Jerusalem said the May 4 London talks between
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu might be canceled due to the failure of
U.S. envoy Dennis Ross' mediation mission to nudge forward the
stalled Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
 And on Monday, Israeli President Ezer Weizman met with senior
Palestinian officials Abu Mazen and Netanyahu in a bid to mediate
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Netanyahu's planned 9 percent pullback in West Bank would
likely involve turning a handful of Israel-controlled isolated
settlements under Israeli-Palestinian joint control.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. reluctance to publish its redeployment plan is due to
the fear that it would be attacked by Israel for endangering its
security.

BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's crops have benefited
from artificial rainfall three times since the beginning of April
because of the efforts of the Beijing Meteorological Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Today's Beijing Youth Daily said that, with help from the air
force, the bureau used balloons to launch 120 silver iodide bombs
in five suburban counties on the morning of April 23 followed by a
moderate rain.

Apart from the artificial rainfall, which was the city's most
successful springtime cloud-seeding, Beijing also has launched
operations for producing artificial snow, preventing hail and
expelling fog.

SHIJIAZHUANG, April 28 (Xinhua) -- An official in north China's
Hebei Province was recently dismissed from his post for his
misappropriation of public funds to purchase mobile phones for
personal use.
</P>
<P>
Hu Taian, former director of the Luancheng County Power Supply
Bureau, misappropriated 867,000 yuan of public funds to purchase

<HEADLINE> Planning Commission Calls for Improved Power Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The State Development Planning
Commission has released a notice urging local pricing departments
to improve management over electricity prices in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Today's People's Daily reported that related efforts will
greatly ease unreasonable burdens on farmers.
</P>
<P>
The notice defines electricity prices in rural areas in two
categories -- prices charged by county-level power supply firms
serving township electricity management stations, and maintenance
fees for low-pressure power grids in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
"All fees beyond the two clearly defined categories are illegal
and must be banned," according to the notice.
</P>
<P>
The notice lists ceiling prices for maintenance fees as 0.25
yuan/kwh in east China and Guangdong Province, 0.20 yuan in
northeast, north and central regions, and 0.15 yuan in the
southwest and northwest.
</P>
<P>
The notice called on local governments to unify price and
provide detailed information to farmers.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey conducted by the commission shows that
electricity prices charged by some local governments are subject
to additional fee items. Additional fees charged nationwide stand
at 21.7 billion yuan annually.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Seeks Alternative Fish Fillets Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania is seeking alternative
markets for the export of its fish fillets after the European Union
imposed a ban on the goods late last year out fear of cholera spread.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Minister of Natural Resources
and Tourism Zakia Meghji has said that one potential market is
Zimbabwe and that consultations have been
made during President Mkapa's visit to that country last week,
The Guardian reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The market is already there. But it is the question of research,"
Meghji said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean experts will visit Tanzania to conduct a survey before
inking an agreement, she said.
</P>
<P>
Last December, the EU imposed a ban on export of fresh fish fillets
from east African countries on the shores of the Lake Victoria, the
second largest freshwater lake in the world, because of an outbreak
of cholera there.
</P>
<P>
Fillets of the nutritious fish of Nile Perch which was introduced
into the lake in the 1960s have been attractive to European countries.
Tanzania used to export 13,000 tons of fish fillets to the European
market. Of the total, 7,000 tons were fresh fish fillets
while the other were frozen.
</P>
<P>
The embargo, if not lifted, will cause Tanzania a loss of 6.7
million US dollars a year, and has forced the country to seek markets
elsewhere. Apart from Zimbabwe, the minister said the government is
also finalizing plans to export fish fillets to China, the United
States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Meghji said the ministry has formed a committee to recommend the
best forms of fish exports.

<HEADLINE> Tibet Welcomes Return of 'Golden Buddha' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- One after another, Tibetan
Buddhists went to a lamasery in the suburbs of Lhasa to worship a
recently returned 'Golden Buddha,' according to today's People's
Daily.
</P>
<P>
The country's leading newspaper reported that the
1,200-year-old Buddha, made of alloy, was enshrined in the Netang
Zholma Lhakham Lamasery. On April 9, 1993, it was stolen by two
thieves in a minivan, then sold to smugglers in the southwestern
city of Chengdu for 300,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Three years later, the Lhasa Customs received a clue that the
Buddha had arrived in the United States and would be sold for
eight million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
At the request of the Lhasa Customs, the U.S. Federal Bureau of
Investigation took possession of the relic. However, the
U.S. agency required China to provide pictures or videos to prove
that Tibet is the owner.
</P>
<P>
This presented a problem for the Chinese since there was no
such picture or video, the paper reported. Though computer systems
have been installed in museums and temples in inland areas, the
management of cultural relics in most lamaseries in snow-covered
Tibet remains backward.
</P>
<P>
Tibet Customs finally located a photograph of the Buddha taken
by a foreigner on his Tibetan tour.
</P>
<P>
The United States accepted the evidence and agreed to return
the Buddha.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony held in Hong Kong in November, Ngawang Chagba, a
monk in the lamasery, paid his respects to the returned Buddha
with tears in his eyes, then carefully wrapped the relic with his
yellow kasaya.
</P>
<P>
When told the news, Tibetan people in Lhasa crowded along the
streets near the airport to welcome the Buddha back home.

KAMPALA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- A modern laboratory worth of
600 million Uganda Shillings (some 500,000 U.S. Dollars) for
analysing water quality has been established in Entebbe, central
Uganda, local newspaper The New Vision reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The laboratory which began operation last Friday was
constructed with the assistance of Danish International
Development Agency (DANIDA).
</P>
<P>
The laboratory is part of the water resources assessment
project of directorate of water development. It is the first of
its kind of international standard in east and central Africa.
</P>
<P>
Only 40 percent of Ugandans have access to safe drinking
water, said Gerald Sendaula, Minister of Water Resources at the
opening ceremony of the lab on last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan government has obligation to provide the Ugandan
people with safe drinking water.
</P>
<P>
The minister asked local people to report to the authorities
concerned about suspected water with the samples.
</P>
<P>
Enoch Drabidu, the project coordinator, said water in Uganda
sometimes bear poisonous substances and germs that cause illness.
</P>
<P>
A recent report said some people are engaged in illegal
fishing operation with poisonous substances.
</P>
<P>
During the last rainy season, there are outbreaks of malaria
and cholera in the African country.

<HEADLINE> Market to Play Greater Role in Cotton Pricing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- China will allow the market to
play a greater role in cotton pricing and earlier this month
announced the abandonment of the official pricing system for the
commodity.
</P>
<P>
The government has introduced a new policy based on indirect
control and guideline prices for cotton.
</P>
<P>
The reform goals center on reducing stockpiles of domestic
cotton resulting from rapid increases in the cotton supply and
decreases in demand due to high prices, according to today's
Economic Daily.
</P>
<P>
The paper reported that China witnessed rapidly increasing
cotton stockpiles and marketing cooperatives across the nation,
with March levels standing at 700 million kg, up 38 percent on the
previous year's period. However, current cotton reserves are close
to the required consumption volume for textile production over a
six month period.
</P>
<P>
Supply and marketing cooperatives sustained losses totalling
one billion yuan in 1997 due to excessive cotton stockpiles,
according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
China has also decided to lower the state purchase price for
cotton in bid to solve problems resulting from supply exceeding
demand.
</P>
<P>
State purchase prices for cotton stood at 700 yuan per 50 kg in
1997, and are expected to hover around 650 yuan per 50 kg this
year..
</P>
<P>
Total market demand of cotton will hit 3.25 billion kg by the
year 2000 when considering the impact of a reduced textile
production capacity, the effects of financial turmoil in Southeast
Asia on textile exports, and increased cotton imports.
</P>
<P>
More than 43 million rural Chinese households, or 150 million
people, depend on cotton production. This year's price cuts will
not affect the income levels of cotton growers since China has
slashed prices for chemical fertilizers by 20 percent and the per
unit cotton yield has increased as a result of the extensive
application of advanced agro-techniques.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show the country produced 4.3 billion kg of
cotton in 1997, up 100 million kg on the previous year. The 1997
state purchase volume for cotton stood at 3.07 billion
kg.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Emir Amnesties 13 Jordanian Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Jaber
Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah has issued an amnesty to release 13 Jordanian
prisoners held since 1991 in Kuwait Central Prison in the latest
gesture of reconciliation with Jordan.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Kuwaiti Interior Minister Sheikh Mohammad
Khaled Al-Hamad Al-Sabah on Monday night, Kuwait News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time the Kuwaiti emir issued amnesty since
1997 to release Jordanians serving prison terms in Kuwait for
various offenses. Kuwait released 10 Jordanians in February 1997
under another amnesty of the emir.
</P>
<P>
The prisoners who have been amnestied were convicted by the
State Security Court in 1991 following the Gulf War, during which
Jordan supported Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti interior minister said his ministry is also
coordinating with the Foreign Ministry to deport 25 Jordanians who
have been arrested by the Deportation Administration and were found
using a group travel document.
</P>
<P>
The 25 Jordanians will be repatriated after the Foreign
Ministry contacts the Jordanian authorities, he said.
</P>
<P>
The decision of amnesty was made on the eve of a travel to
Kuwait arranged by the International Committee of the Red Cross of
26 Jordanian families on May 4 for a three-day stay to visit their
relatives jailed in the Gulf state.
</P>
<P>
This will be the fourth visit by these relatives since
1995. Fifty-one Jordanians visited their families last year,
according to the interior minister.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Kuwait and Jordan were strained following the
Gulf War in 1991 when Jordan sided with Iraq, which occupied
Kuwait for seven months before the allied forces drove the
Iraqi troops out of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral ties have been improving since last year within the
framework of a reconciliatory process by the Kuwaiti authorities
with its "former enemy states."
</P>
<P>
Kuwait resumed air flights with Jordan last year after a
seven-year suspension following the Gulf War.

SINGAPORE, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Singapore said on Tuesday that
it is ready to accede to the Berne Convention for the Protection
of Literary and Artistic Works, adding that it is in its "national
interest" to do so.
</P>
<P>
"We will do so shortly as soon as the necessary Instrument of
Accession is processed in accordance with WIPO (World Intellectual
Property Organization) procedures," Minister for Law and Foreign
Affairs S. Jayakumar told a Seminar on the Internet and the
Protection of Intellectual Property Rights.
</P>
<P>
He said Singapore is committed to a policy of giving proper
protection to intellectual property rights, including patents,
trade marks, industrial design and copyright.
</P>
<P>
"It is in our national interest to do so. We will strengthen
our linkage with WIPO and other world bodies to signal our
resolve," he added.
 He also said the Singapore Government is well aware of the
potential of the Internet for conducting business activities and
has just put in place a framework for supporting Electronic
Commerce.
</P>
<P>
Within this framework, the government is looking at legislation
that will, among other things, protect intellectual property
rights on the Internet and provide legal recourse in the case of
infringement of such rights, Jayakumar said.
</P>
<P>
He said an Inter-Ministry Committee, chaired by the Register of
Trade Marks and Patents, was formed earlier this month to examine
these and other copyright issues in relation to electronic
commerce.
</P>
<P>
The committee will complete its work by the end of this year,
and will recommend further changes to Singapore's copyright
legislation, he said.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Determined to Revamp Ailing Agriculture: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Agriculture Minister
Musalia Mudavadi said that the government is determined to revamp
agriculture through an Agricultural Sector Investment Program
(ASIP).
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper Tuesday quoted Mudavadi as saying that the
sub-sector has recorded decreased output in the fields of coffee,
cereal, diary, cotton, pyrethrum and sugar-cane in recent years.
</P>
<P>
He told an ASIP preparation workshop held here last week that
the ASIP will alter the development path of Kenya's agricultural
sector in terms of production structure.
</P>
<P>
The main objective of the program is to empower and not to
control the farmers in the private sector, Mudavadi said.
</P>
<P>
"We also recognize the wider liberalization thrust which is
aimed at enabling greater participation of the private sector in
direct production, with the government playing a more
facilitative role," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to participants to the workshop, the first phase of
ASIP will focus on improved service delivery by the Ministry of
Agriculture and the ministry will also plan to provide linkages
and harmonization of activities undertaken by players in the
sector under the program.
</P>
<P>
On another occasion, the minister said the government is
reviewing agricultural policy with a primary objective of
achieving an effective recovery in food production.
</P>
<P>
The review will try to rationalize the ministry's operations
to make them compatible with changing farmers' needs, he said.
</P>
<P>
The review will lay emphasis on private sectors' participation
through privatization and commercialization of some major
services previously offered by the government, he added.

<HEADLINE> Telephone Service to Be Improved in E. Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- A modern digital telephone
exchange system is to be installed in Uganda's eastern Jinja area
to attract investment and boost local economy, The New Vision
paper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Richard Owora, Principal Public Relations Officer of the
Uganda Telecommunications Limited (UTL), said the new exchange
system is imported from Japan and the installation in Jinja will
begin soon as the staff responsible for installation work had
returned from training in Japan.
</P>
<P>
He said that the system, with a capacity of 10,000 lines,
will be commissioned before the end of the year and only 3,000
lines will be given to first subscribers due to lack of resources
to operate to full capacity.
</P>
<P>
There has long been an outcry from the region for more and
better telephone service. The present system, installed in 1971,
is too much out of date, local people complained.

<HEADLINE> Major Projects Incur Heavy Debt in Central China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Two key projects established in
central China's Henan Province at a cost of over 3.3 billion yuan
have incurred heavy debts totaling 6.5 billion yuan over the past
four years.
</P>
<P>
The Zhongyuan Pharmaceutical Plant, the largest medical project
introduced in China in 1986-1995, was established at a cost of
1.33 billion yuan. The plant has a designed annual production
capacity of 5,000 tons of vitamin C., according to today's
"People's Daily," the leading national newspaper.
</P>
<P>
However, serious problems with imported equipment prevented
the plant from fulfilling production plan and the operation was
forced to close after amassing a debt of over three billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The Zhongzhou Aluminium Plant, built in 1993 at a cost of 1.98
billion yuan, has incurred 3.5 billion yuan in debt resulting from
overeager efforts to become a large-scale operation.
</P>
<P>
The two cases have sent shock waves through party and government
officials in Henan, with some attributing the losses to blind
investments and the rash importation of equipment, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
A commentary in the paper today urged people to draw lessons
from the status of the two projects.
</P>
<P>
The ability of policy-makers to adapt to a market-oriented
economy constitutes the most important element in economic
development in the absence of reform to China's existing
investment system, according to the commentary.
</P>
<P>
The commentary pointed out that most prominent waste in
economic construction centers erroneous investment decisions and
redundant project construction.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's Islamic Taliban
militia have accused the rival Northern Alliance of opposing peace
in the first round of talks between the two sides currently being
held in Islamabad, said reports monitored here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban-run Radio Shariat said the alliance representatives
backed down from their earlier stand and were now opposed to the
formation of the Ulema Commission to resolve the country's
protracted conflict.
</P>
<P>
The anti-Taliban alliance was therefore opposed to a peaceful
solution to the Afghan conflict, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
"The opposition delegation are not ready to accept the Ulema
Commission," said the radio, the mouthpiece of the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
The talks, which started on Sunday, were suspended Monday to
enable both delegations to consult with their top leaders over the
issue of who should be qualified to sit on the proposed
commission.
</P>
<P>
"It is now clear that the opposition do not want peace because
they are advancing such terms which nobody had mentioned in the
past," the radio said.

During the experimental period, China will accumulate
experience, train professionals, tighten supervision and
management and formulate relevant law and regulations, Wu said.

China will check on and rectify joint ventures involving retail
trade which have been set up without Chinese government approval,

<HEADLINE> Israel's Unemployment Rate Hits New High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Israel's unemployment rate
continued to climb this year and reached 8.3 percent in February,
its highest level since the end of 1993, the English daily The
Jerusalem Post reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Israeli Central Bureau of Statistic as
saying that the rise in the jobless rate has brought the
number of people out of work to more than 180,000.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted recently found that 72 percent of the
unemployed believe that the government is not doing enough to
solve the unemployment problem, and 86 percent do not believe
they will find jobs via the employment bureau.
</P>
<P>
In response to the rising unemployment rate, Israeli Finance
Minister Yaakov Neeman is going to introduce a job-generating
program soon.
</P>
<P>
The program will urge the government to impose hefty fines on
employers who take on illegal foreign workers. Neeman estimated
this week that the number of foreign workers without valid permits
in Israel is now over 160,000.
</P>
<P>
The program will call for increasing state and private
spending on infrastructure, and reforming the tax system and the
capital market.
</P>
<P>
It will also ask the government to provide aid to a variety of
unemployment black spots in the country, including examining
development towns on a factory-by-factory basis to see where new
jobs can be created. Additionally, the government would see how to
provide appropriate academic and vocational training courses.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
is already fully behind the program which Neeman will present
at next week's cabinet meeting.

BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Two leading Chinese banks have
pledged to grant more loans to ensure the planned economic growth
of 8 percent in 1998.

The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) plans to

ICBC will increase loans in railway, highway,

the construction of inexpensive houses and mortgages for home
buyers to support government housing reform.
</P>
<P>
While backing will continue to be given to 500 key state-owned
enterprises, the bank will also pay attention to support small-
and medium-size enterprises and foreign-funded businesses.
</P>
<P>
Despite an increase in loans, the bank will not relax loan
conditions to avoid bad loans, an ICBC spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
China Construction Bank has also announced plans to grant 31
billion yuan in loans for fixed-asset development in
infrastructure and technical upgrading of existing enterprises.

<P>
The Comelec said it was not the proper authority to hear the
case and only the Supreme Court can act on such cases.
</P>
<P>
Fornier, a long-time foe of Lim, filed early this month the
petition to disqualify Lim from running in the May 11 elections on
the grounds that the former Manila mayor was not a natural-born
Filipino citizen because his parents were "Chinese mestizos."
</P>
<P>
Under the constitution, only natural-born Filipinos may seek
the presidency.
</P>
<P>
But according to copies of birth certificates Lim submitted to
the Comelec, Lim, the standard-bearer of the Liberal Party, is a
"Filipino."
</P>
<P>
Lim, one of the front runners in the presidential race, has
accused National Security Adviser Jose Almonte of the ruling
Lakas-NUCD Party of being behind the moves to question his
citizenship.

<HEADLINE> Agriculture Continues to Be China's Top Priority: President (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin,
receiving the Agricola Medal from the U.N. Food and Agricultural
Organization (FAO), pledged here today that China will
unswervingly give top priority to agriculture in the national
economy.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony held at the Great Hall of the People, UNFAO
Director-General Jacques Diouf presented Jiang the medal, which
specially honors those heads of state who have made outstanding
contributions to the world's agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
"The Agricola Medal conferred on me by the UNFAO is not only an
honor for myself, but more importantly, a full recognition of the
efforts made by the Chinese Government and people in resolving the
question of food and agriculture," said the president while
addressing the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people once suffered grievously from hunger and
poverty, and now China has grown into a big food producer and
consumer country, and has scored "remarkable achievements" in
energetically expanding food and agricultural production, Jiang
said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, in 1997, China's grain output reached 492.5
billion kg., and the grain reserves hit a historic high. China's
grain, meat, aquatic products and fruits have either reached or
exceeded the world's average in per capita output.
</P>
<P>
"China has, by relying on its own efforts, supported 1.2
billion people on limited arable land, thus making an important
contribution to the world food program," said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that China has accumulated some successful
experience in the agricultural field since the implementation of
reform and opening up.
</P>
<P>
The experience he cited includes taking agriculture as the
basis and giving top priority to agriculture in the national
economy; never slackening food production and actively engaging in
diversified operations; deepening rural reform and mobilizing the
initiative and creativity of farmers; implementing the strategy of
reinvigorating agriculture through science and education and
vigorously advancing agro-technological progress; steadily
increasing agricultural input and improving the conditions for
agricultural production; and opening wider to the outside world
and strengthening international agricultural co-operation and
exchanges.

<HEADLINE> Agriculture Continues To Be China's Top Priority: President (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Along with the population increase, rise of per capita
consumption level and economic development, China's demand on
grain and other farm produce will continue to grow year by year,
the president noted.
</P>
<P>
"We shall unswervingly give top priority to agriculture in the
national economy, further stabilize and bolster agriculture,
ensure a sustained growth of food and agricultural production and
promote the intensive processing of grain and all type of farm,
livestock and fish products so as to satisfy the need of the
people," said the president.
</P>
<P>
There is every reason to believe that China has the capability
to get its people well-fed and well-clad through self-reliance,
and the quality of life of the Chinese People will be enhanced
gradually, Jiang said, citing as proof the country's "huge
potential for increasing agricultural output" and the "boundless
creativity" of the Chinese farmers.
</P>
<P>
The resolution of the food question, which bears on the
survival and progress of mankind, relies on the efforts of each
country itself and but it is also inseparable from extensive
international cooperation and exchanges, the president stressed.
</P>
<P>
"The developed countries should take concrete actions and
fulfil their due obligations in terms of capital and technical
assistance to help the developing countries enhance food
production capacity. The Chinese government, always attaching
importance to and taking an active part in international
cooperation in the area of food and agriculture, has made positive
efforts in promoting world's agricultural development," he said.
</P>
<P>
China and UNFAO maintain a sound cooperative relationship, the
president said, adding that the over 100 projects sponsored by the
organization in China have produced notable results and through
its "South-South Cooperation" Program, China has provided
assistance within its power to some developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to take this opportunity to express sincere
gratitude to FAO and Director-General Jacques Diouf for their
consistent support of China's agricultural development," Jiang
said.
</P>
<P>
Citing an old Chinese saying "A country depends on its people,
and people live on food', the president called for new
contribution to realizing the goal of world food
security. "Mankind has a long and tortuous road to go before
resolving the question of food," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Exports to Japanese Market Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BANGKOK, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's exports for the first
quarter of this year dropped by 2.8 percent in dollar terms
compared to the same period last year, primarily due to a 10
percent decline in the Japanese market, according to the Thai
Commerce Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Exports to Japanese market between January-March stood at 13
billion U.S. dollars, a fall from 13.2 billion U.S. dollars,
compared to the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The poor performance in the Japanese market brought Thailand's
monthly exports in at lower than the projected 5 billion baht
(12.5 million U.S. dollars) a month.
</P>
<P>
The decline in the Japanese market has caused such concern
among the Thai government that Deputy Prime Minister and Commerce
Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi will hold discussions with Japan's
Ministry of International Trade and Investment to find a solution
to the problem, a source at the Thai Commerce ministry was quoted
Tuesday by the Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
Japan was the Thailand's second largest market, but fell to
south place last year, after ASEAN, the United states and EU.

Beijing, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Sichuan
Province has witnessed severe drought since last summer, according
to today's People's Daily.
</P>
<P>
Local government statistics released on April 23 show that
116 out of the province's 180 counties have suffered from
drought conditions.
</P>
<P>
The prolonged drought has adversely affected some 1.4 million
ha. of summer grain crops, with significantly heavy damage to
grain crops planted on 53,000 hectares.
</P>
<P>
The lack of water prevented farmers from planting rice
seedlings on 530,000 ha., and 10 percent of cotton and corn
seedlings have withered.
</P>
<P>
The local government has listed the battle against the drought
as a top priority and has allocated eight million yuan for
minimizing losses.

<HEADLINE> 684 Companies Report Their Foreign Debts to Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- A total of 684 private companies
in Indonesia have reported their offshore debts to the central
bank, Bank Indonesia (BI), a BI director said.
</P>
<P>
Miranda Goeltom said here Monday that 280 firms had complied
with the BI's instruction to report their debts last month,
official Antara News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
However, Miranda did not disclose the amount of the foreign
debts reported by the 684 companies.
</P>
<P>
Of Indonesia's offshore debts amounting to 133.687 billion U.S.
dollars by April 1998, 67.686 billion dollars were corporate
debts.
</P>
<P>
The huge amount of corporate debts is one of the reasons of the
depreciation of the rupiah (national currency). Therefore the
government is trying hard to overcome the problem by setting up
the corporate debts settlement team and implementing Mexico's
Ficorca system after adjustments to local conditions.
</P>
<P>
Mexico implemented the Ficorca program to defray the impact of
a massive 1982 peso devaluation on its corporations, by allowing
them to repay their debts in pesos rather than in dollars to the
Ficorca, which then paid foreign creditors.
</P>
<P>
One effective way to settle the corporate debts would be to
take stock of the debts, Miranda said, adding that the central
bank has distributed some 800 forms to private companies, but not
all have returned them.
</P>
<P>
Bank Indonesia has therefore issued an instruction dated April
8 giving the delinquent companies time until April 30 to hand in
the completed forms.
</P>
<P>
A fine of 500,000 rupiah (about seventy U.S. dollars) will be
imposed on those who have not submitted their report after the
deadline for every week of delay, Miranda said.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Calls for Reincorporation of Cuba Into OAS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Mexico called Monday for the
Organization of American States (OAS) to allow Cuba into the
regional bloc after shutting the Caribbean nation out for 36 years.
</P>
<P>
"The reincorporation of Cuba... will enrich the inter-American
system, generating major stability and harmony within our
continent," Mexican Foreign Minister Rosario Green said here.
</P>
<P>
Mexico and Canada were the only two OAS members that did not
break diplomatic ties with Cuba in 1962, when its OAS membership
was suspended due to ideological turfs with the United States.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the American countries have now resumed their
relations with Havana.
</P>
<P>
Her country, the top Mexican diplomat told a seminar on the
"Present and Future of the OAS," is against every attempt of
intervention in the domestic affairs of other countries.
</P>
<P>
"Any attempt to impose ideologies or models, no matter how
well-intentioned these may be, contradicts and undermines the
sovereignty of the countries," Green said.
</P>
<P>
Mexico opposes the exclusion and intolerance of the political
and cultural expressions that may be different from the majority
on the American continent, she said.
</P>
<P>
"The OAS should reflect continental plurality and diversity.
Respectful relations among different cultures and historical
traditions within our organization should be our best legacy for
the next century," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"We have the opportunity to prove our capacity and political
talent to assert the principle of universality in our hemisphere,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
As Mexico's ambassador to the OAS, Green also urged the member
countries to fight against poverty and drug trafficking, defend
and promote democracy, push economic growth, protect environment,
promote trade liberalization and defend human rights in the region.
</P>
<P>
The OAS, which got its present name in 1948, was launched in
1890 as a forum for economic, political and social exchanges in
the Western Hemisphere.

<HEADLINE> Upcoming Chinese Navy's Visit to Australia is a </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The visit of Chinese naval ships
to Sydney, Australia, next week is unprecedented and also
reassuring, an international relations expert said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese navy's visit to Sydney is a symbol of the new
defense relationship that now exists between China and Australia.
It augurs well for increased stability and security in the
Asia-Pacific region," Gary Klintworth, a visiting fellow at the
Department of International Relations at the Australian National
University said.
</P>
<P>
The visit, scheduled from May 4-7 and involving three Chinese
naval ships and about 700 sailors, is the first of its kind by the
navy of the People's Republic of China to Australia.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese navy also demonstrate an interest in working
co-operatively with other navies in the (Asia-Pacific) region",
the expert wrote on Tuesday's edition of the Australian Financial
Review.
</P>
<P>
"To that end, the People's Liberation Army (PLA, or the Chinese
armed forces) is signaling a commitment to be more transparent and
outgoing than ever before," the expert said.
</P>
<P>
"The new openness (of the Chinese armed forces) suggests ... a
belief in the benefits to be obtained from neighborly exchanges
between the navies of countries in the Asia-Pacific region,"
Klintworth added.
</P>
<P>
The visiting Chinese ships, including a multipurpose
replenishment ship of 37,000 tons when fully loaded, a
guided-missile destroyer of 4,800 tons and a training vessel, are
scheduled to be open to the public in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
The expert praised the move by the Chinese navy to allow public
access to their ships.
</P>
<P>
"This shows the increasing self-confidence of the PLA and its
willingness to try to develop goodwill with the defense forces and
the people of the region, especially influential middle powers
like Australia."
</P>
<P>
"The PLA, in other words, is going out of its way to engage in
the region in public defense diplomacy."
</P>
<P>
The visit follows Chinese Defense Minister Chi Haotian's visit
to Australia earlier this year, the first of its kind since
Australia and China established diplomatic relations in 1972.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Fails to Lift Sanctions Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council of
the United Nations on Monday reached no consensus on lifting
sanctions against Iraq after day-long consultations, thus the
UN sanctions against Iraq will remain.
</P>
<P>
Before the consultations, the Security Council was briefed by
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)and UNSCOM on their
latest reports on the inspections of Iraq weapons in the past
six months.
</P>
<P>
IAEA said Iraq has met its demands by having destroyed all its
nuclear weapons, and UNSCOM said there was no virtual progress
made by Iraq in the areas of chemical, biological weapons and
ballistic misslies, especially in the area of biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council reviews the sanctions against Iraq every
sixty days. This is the first review since UN Secretary-General
Kofi Annan and Iraq's Government reached the Memorandum of
Understanding on the inspection of Iraq's weapons on February 23,
which avoided possible U.S. military strikes against Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Zagallo Turns Back on Veterans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's coach Mario
Zagallo says there might be only three veterans over 30 in his
World Cup team.
</P>
<P>
"On the team that plays, we'll have only Aldair, Dunga and
Romario with higher ages," Zagallo said.
</P>
<P>
He said the 31-year-old Netminder Taffarel will be dropped
because "he doesn't have to run".
</P>
<P>
That also means that Bebeto, 34, has little hope to enter
because there have been a Ronaldo-Romario duo on the front line.
</P>
<P>
The reason Zagallo was keen on young legs was that he believes
they will be a key to success in the grueling tournament, where
speed and strength can prevail over experience and even talent.
</P>
<P>
Zagallo has resisted pressure to call up 36-year-old fullback
Mauro Galvao, despite his standout play on national champion Vasco
da Gama.

<HEADLINE> Good News For Shanghai's Battery-Powered Cyclists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Local battery-powered cyclists
will no longer have to worry about getting their batteries
charged, since a special company is to be set up to help them.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen charging centers and 100 battery banks will be set up
in the city -- battery service every five km on the streets in
urban areas.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Municipal Battery-Powered Bicycle Industry
Development Center announced that these facilities will be managed
by a company soon to be set up, called the Shanghai
Battery-Powered Bicycle Battery Service Co. Ltd., in an effort to
bolster the market for such vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Cyclist will be able to rent batteries from the banks or pay a
fee for having their own batteries charged.
</P>
<P>
There will also be emergency charging stations, at which
batteries can be charged with enough power to enable a bicycle to
go another ten km, by inserting a coin in a slot
</P>
<P>
The local authorities regard battery-powered bicycles as major
substitutes for gasoline-powered scooters and motorcycles, which
pollute the environment badly. The city government plans to reduce
the number of gas-powered bikes by 400,000.
</P>
<P>
Currently, battery-powered bicycles can travel 30-50 km every
charge, while their prices, at 2,000 yuan-5,000 yuan each, are
regarded as reasonable by local residents in this largest
industrial city in the country.

<HEADLINE> US Governors Endorse National Dialogue on Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 27 (Xinhua) -- About half of the governors in
the United States plan to endorse President Bill Clinton's race
initiative by devoting a day this week to getting the national
dialogue on race rolling on the local level.
</P>
<P>
The governors will support a one-day national campaign Thursday
sponsored by the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) as a
follow-up to the Senate's declaration of last April 30 as national
Erase the Hate and Eliminate Racism Day.
</P>
<P>
"The YWCA has had a long-standing history in this arena, and
the president's race initiative resonated with us," said chief
executive officer Prema Mathai-Davis. "It's not just dialogue, but
the next step, moving to create change in the community."
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the number of participating governors grew from 18
to 26, according to the president's race initiative office. Eleven
governors planned to issue proclamations and 14 said they would
personally take part that day in activities such as panel
discussions or town hall meetings.
</P>
<P>
Former Mississippi Governor William Winter, a member of the
president's racial advisory board, said Thursday's events
represent the most significant effort by states to work on racial
reconciliation. Governors are crucial to ensuring that the
dialogue that Clinton wants is penetrating American society, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Some of the governors are being low-key in their approach,
while others have taken up the activities with zeal, Winter said.
</P>
<P>
Besides governors, the mayors of 18 cities will take parts in
events that day as well.

<HEADLINE> Hydropower Plant on Yangtze Tributary Passes State Assessment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The Geheyan Hydropower Plant on the
Qingjiang River, a major tributary of the Yangtze River after it
passes through the famed Three Gorges, has passed assessment by a
panel of 120 experts appointed by the government.
</P>
<P>
The plant took 11 years to build.
</P>
<P>
The plant is situated in Changyang County in central China's
Hubei Province. It was jointly financed by the central government
and Hubei, to the tune of about four billion yuan (about 500
million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Construction started on January 15, 1987. Four generating units
with a total capacity of 1.2 million kw have been installed. The
first generating unit started power generation June 4, 1993, and
the last unit was put in place November 26, 1994.
</P>
<P>
The plant, widely hailed as an experiment pioneering the
ongoing construction of a gigantic water control dam in the Three
Gorges area, has also survived huge floods that may occur once in
a thousand years. It has so far produced 11.2 billion kwh of
electricity.
</P>
<P>
In addition, completion of the Geheyan Hydropower Plant has
laid a solid foundation for developing hydropower resources on the
Qingjiang River on a large scale, according to Wang Dingguo,
chairman of the board of the Qingjiang Hydropower Investment
Company, which is responsible for development of the plant..
</P>
<P>
Wang added that two more hydropower plants would be built on the
Qingjiang River, with a combined generating capacity of three
million kw, in the years to come.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria to Make Amendments to Adoption Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some 440 Bulgarian children were adopted by foreigners last
year. Adoptions by Bulgarians were much more but there are no
accurate figures.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was organized by the Bulgarian Association of Women
of the Legal Profession and the British Council in Sofia. It was
attended by Deputy National Assembly Chairman Petya Shopova,
experts of the ministries of justice, health care and education,
judges, prosecutors and lawyers.
</P>
<P>
The Hague Convention on the Protection of Children Upon
Adoption binds the parties to the Convention to set up such
centralized bodies thus guaranteeing the best interests of the
child, Roza Boteva, chairman of the Association said.
</P>
<P>
The Ordinance, regulating the adoption of Bulgarian children
by foreigners, guarantees the protection of the child and requires
applicants to have an adoption license issued by the respective
bodies in their country of residence. "We check whether such a
license has been issued and whether the adoption will be in the
interests of the child," Videnova said.
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian legislation does not regulate control after adoption
but the Ministry of Justice requires post-adoption reports from
organizations or lawyers.

<HEADLINE> Election Failure Feared in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' Commission on
Elections (Comelec) is expecting a failure of elections in certain
parts of the country which could thwart the proclamation of the
next president, a local newspaper said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We are anticipating failure of elections in Mindanao.
Sometimes, we cannot prevent it. It can only be resolved at the
time of reckoning, " Comelec Commissioner Manolo Gorospe was
quoted by Philippine Daily Inquirer as saying Monday.
</P>
<P>
This scenario, painted by Gorospe, is expected to revive fears
earlier raised by the opposition that the Ramos administration was
intent on holding on to power.
</P>
<P>
President Fidel Ramos must step down from office on June 30
when his constitutionally-mandated single six-year term expires.
</P>
<P>
Gorospe did not identify the regions or provinces where failure
of elections was feared.
</P>
<P>
But Gorospe stressed that if the number of votes in the
affected towns or villages was big enough to affect the results of
the election, there could be a delay in the proclamation of the
candidates.
</P>
<P>
Comelec sources said earlier this possibility was not remote in
the presidential contest, considering that the margin of votes
among the 11 candidates is expected to be slim.
</P>
<P>
Gorospe said partisan politics, insurgency, violence,
intimidation and coercion of election officials and voters could
result in the failure of elections in critical areas in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Under the election law, the Comelec can declare a failure of
elections "on account of natural calamities, violence, terrorism,
fraud or other analogous causes."
</P>
<P>
In the 1995 midterm elections, a failure of elections was
declared in 381 communities in the provinces of Lanao del Norte
and Lanao del Sur in western Mindanao.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Four Japanese opposition parties
merged Monday into a new Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) and vowed
to take power away from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).
</P>
<P>
The Good Governance Party, the Amity Party and the Democratic
Reform Party dissolved themselves within four months of their
separate launches and joined the DPJ, said a Kyodo News report.
</P>
<P>
DPJ leader Naoto Kan was elected president of the new centrist
party, now the largest opposition group with 131 seats at the
511-member upper house and the 252-member lower house.
</P>
<P>
The conservative LDP, led by Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto,
occupies 379 seats in the two chambers of parliament.
</P>
<P>
"We want to play a big historical role as the pivot for a
change in government," Kan was quoted by the Kyodo report as
telling an inauguration ceremony at a Tokyo hotel.
</P>
<P>
The new DPJ and other opposition forces might jointly submit a
no-confidence motion against Hashimoto's cabinet, said Kan.
</P>
<P>
Kan announced his new party's basic philosophy and policies,
under which it will pursue "a new road of the democratic center,"
or an alternative to free market and welfare state systems.

</P>
<P>
A police report said Gerardi, 72, also general
coordinator of the human rights office of the archbishopric
(ODHA), was shot dead by unidentified gunmen in the San
Sebastian church, his residence in the Guatemala City.

presidential house and the national palace.
</P>
<P>
Director of the civil national police, Angel Conte and general
attorney, Hector Perez, also confirmed the murder.
</P>

Last Thursday, Gerardi made public a document against the
atrocities perpetrated during the 36-year civil war. The document
said that in the bloody conflict, more than 55,000 persons were
killed.
</P>
<P>
ODHA director Ronalth Ochaeta said Gerardi's killing was
aimed at undermining a ceasefire agreement which was signed on

<HEADLINE> U.S. Offers Yugoslavia Carrot, Stick on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The United States will propose
a policy of carrot and stick to Yugoslavia at a Contact Group
meeting in Rome on Wednesday for cooperation from Belgrade on
Kosovo, a senior U.S. official said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. has often been accused of putting overwhelming
emphasis on punitive measures, so this time the U.S. has come up
with a package which includes both a substantial amount of
positive incentives," the official told a background briefing.
</P>
<P>
However, the official, who spoke on condition of not being
identified, declined to give details of the package.
</P>
<P>
The Contact Group, which comprises the U.S., Italy, Russia,
Britain, France and Germany, would meet Wednesday in Rome on
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The senior U.S. official also warned that if the five other
nations, including Russia, involved in the meeting of the "Contact
Group" did not agree to the U.S. package, Washington would go it
alone on Yugoslavia policy.
</P>
<P>
Washington wanted the Yugoslav government first to devise a
"framework for negotiations" with the Kosovo Albanians and a
series of moves to lower tensions, then to start talks later,
said the official.
</P>
<P>
If Belgrade does not cooperate, the official said that new
sanctions will be imposed.
</P>
<P>
But he did not say what fresh sanctions could be imposed. The
Contact Group, which has threatened an asset freeze, has already
blocked trade and investment credits and had an arms embargo
passed by the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"It's the hope of the United States that we can reach agreement
on this strong substantive package which we have been proposing to
other countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If we cannot, what we want to do then is begin to engage on
some activity, some more pronounced activity, on our own, on a
coordinated basis with the Contact Group countries," he told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said when Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and
Balkan envoy Robert Gelbard put the U.S. package to European
countries during a recent tour, the reaction varied, with some
reacting well and a couple "less than totally positively".

</P>
<P>
More small and medium-sized German firms are expected to invest

MOSCOW, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Georgian President Eduard
Shevardnadze fired Defense Minister Vardiko Nadibaidze on Monday
and named chief military inspector David Tevzadze as a replacement.
</P>
<P>
The decision, as the Itar-Tass news agency reported, was made
at an urgent National Security Council meeting. But the nomination
of Tevzadze, 50, is yet to be confirmed by the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Surviving the February 9 terrorist attack at the Georgian
capital of Tbilisi, Shevardnadze has asked the Ministry of Defense
to send fighter jets to convoy his plane's takeoff from airport.
</P>
<P>
However, Nadibaidze didn't take the protective measure on April
26, when the president left Tbilisi for a conference in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
In response, Shevardnadze took the chance of a routine radio
speech on Monday to accuse Nadibaidze of failing to fulfill his
obligation of safeguarding the security of the president.
</P>
<P>
Nadibaidze's mistake was unforgivable despite his contributions
to the buildup of the country's armed forces, he said.
</P>
<P>
Nadibaidze had been serving as defense minister since May
1995.

People's Union DVU, a fiercely anti-immigrant group of rightist
nationalists, achieved the biggest surprise by rising from
obscurity to win about 12.9 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
It was the biggest gains of a far-right party in any state
assembly votes in Germany since 1945, which also enabled the DVU
to become the first radical right party to enter a state assembly
in eastern Germany since the 1990 German reunification.
</P>
<P>
"This is a black day for all democrats," commented the German
Bild newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Describing the DVU as an "openly anti-Semitic, racist and
anti-foreigner party", leader of German Jewish community, Ignatz
Bubis, told the German news agency DPA that it was especially
alarming that the DVU had proven to have the strongest appeal to
young voters between 18 to 25 years old.
</P>
<P>
He also blamed Germany's mainstream political parties of not
doing enough to counter the rise of right extremism across the
country.
</P>
<P>
While admitting that the far-right surge in Saxony-Anhalt as
"unacceptable", Germany Chancellor Helmut Kohl told reporters in
Bonn that the DVU would have no chance of winning any seats in the
federal parliament in the national elections in September.
</P>
<P>
"Right-wing extremism does not pose a trace of danger for
Germany," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the main opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD)
described the success of extreme right in the eastern German state
as a protest against the broken promises of Kohl after the 1990
reunification.
</P>
<P>
Dubbed "Germany's poorhouse", Saxony-Anhalt, which once proudly
regarded itself as a stronghold of heavy industry, now has
Germany's highest jobless rate, about 24 percent, the lowest rate
of economic growth, making a mockery of Kohl's promise of
"flourishing landscapes" in the East eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
The German federation of smaller enterprises BVMW on Monday
called the strong youth support for the DVU as "a disaster" for
the German economy and society.
</P>
<P>
"The lack of jobs and training opportunities has once again
proven to be the breeding ground for right extremism," the BVMW
said.
</P>
<P>
Many other German business groups also agreed that the success
of the DVU in Saxony-Anhalt was the direct result of the
unacceptably high unemployment in eastern Germany.
</P>
<P>
They called on politicians in Bonn to break the current
deadlock on structural reforms and to improve the economic
conditions for job creation.
</P>
<P>
Public opinion researchers also attributed the Saxony-Alhalt
election results mainly to the widespread frustration of voters
about the economic situation in eastern Germany.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted by the Mannheim-based public opinion
research institute Wahlen found that the DVU had won much more
supporters from the jobless people than any other parties.
Meanwhile, about 64 percent of the voters said they were dismayed
about the economic outlook in the state.
</P>
<P>
"The election in Saxony-Anhalt was the first opinion test in
eastern Germany since 1994," said the Infratest institute in
Berlin, adding that "Its results have clearly shown that eight
years after the German reunification, the frustration about its
results has peaked and has searched an outlet outside the
established western German party systems."

<P>
NEW YORK, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Pummeled by broad-based selling,
U.S. stocks finished sharply lower Monday as investors dumped
shares, driven by fears that interest rates may rise.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average plummeted 146.98 points, or
1.62 percent, to close at 8,917.64, recovering from a loss of
about 224 points suffered earlier in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Losers outpaced gainers by 2,890 to 313 on a trading volume of
693 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
Other markets suffered heavy losses too, with the
technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite shedding 48.65, or 2.60 percent,
to 1,820.31, its third-largest one-day point loss.
</P>
<P>
The broader S&AMP;P 500 index lost 21.36, or 1.93 percent, to
1,086.54.
</P>
<P>
The stock market's sell-off was triggered by heavy selling in
bonds, caused by a Wall Street Journal report suggesting that the
Federal Reserve is likely to raise interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 1.65 points in price,
raising its yield to 6.06 percent -- its highest in almost two
months.

UNITED NATIONS, April 27 (Xinhua) -- China is in favor of
holding a U.N. Millennium Summit in 2000, Deputy Chinese Permanent
Representative to the U.N. Shen Guofang said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the plenary session on U.N. reforms, Shen said the
United Nations should have an opportunity to look back at the past
55 years and envisage its future task and direction of development
for it to meet the challenges of the next century.
</P>
<P>
He proposed that the General Assembly set up an open-ended
preparatory committee to determine the agenda for the summit.
</P>
<P>
The summit idea was raised by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
in his latest report to the General Assembly to elaborate his U.N.
reform plans.
</P>
<P>
Such a summit may articulate a vision for the U.N. in the new
century and propose system-wide institutional adaptations enabling
the world body to act on the vision, Annan said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Administration Supports Bilingual Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Clinton administration will
send officials to California to stop a measure that they said
would dismantle the state's bilingual education programs and
affect minority children's basic skills.
</P>
<P>
Opposing a Proposition 227 that would replace a multiplicity of
bilingual education programs with a one-year course of instruction
taught mostly in English, Marshal Smith, acting deputy secretary
of the Education Department, said the move would leave school
children without needed skills, including ones that will help them
find jobs in the future.
</P>
<P>
The one-year immersion structure... is a major mistake, Smith
said. "The movement under way in California is not based in sound
policy or research."
</P>
<P>
The administration suggests an alternative with a nationwide
goal of limiting most children's participation in bilingual
programs to three years.
</P>
<P>
Education Secretary Richard Riley said in a statement that
Proposition 227 was not the way to go and it "will lead to fewer
children learning English and many children falling further behind
in their studies."
</P>
<P>
Smith said, current law calls for, but does not require,
non-English-speaking children to go through three to five years of
bilingual education.
</P>
<P>
At present, about 3.2 million students have limited English
skills, and 1.3 million are in local and state bilingual programs,
the Education Department said.
</P>
<P>
Of some 5 million California public school students in
kindergarten through the 12th grade, about 1.4 million have
limited English proficiency.

<HEADLINE> US Senate Begins Final Debate on NATO Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate began on
Monday a debate on the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO), which will lead a final vote on the measure
to add Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to the alliance.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a Senate press briefing, Defense Secretary William
Cohen sought to dismiss "apocalyptic suggestions" that expanding
NATO to include the three former Soviet bloc nations would poison
relations with Moscow, as charged by opponents.
</P>
<P>
"I think that the Russian government understands exactly what
NATO enlargement is going to mean as far as the stability for the
future," Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that rejection of the three new members would
send a damaging message to Europe.
</P>
<P>
"For the United States, to now reject it would be very
destructive and cast a pall over the organization that would be
detrimental for years to come," he added.
</P>
<P>
The 100-member Senate is expected to vote on the measure on
Wednesday. A two-thirds majority vote is needed for the approval.
</P>
<P>
Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota, who
brought Cohen with him to his regular news briefing, said
rejection of the treaty modification "could send a tragic and an
extraordinarily damaging message to the European community and the
rest of the world about how the United States views its role."
</P>
<P>
Senator Jesse Helms told the Senate that arguments that the
move would antagonize and complicate relations with Russia were
"just plain wrong."
</P>
<P>
The NATO expansion would limit any Russian temptation to
restore its power in Central Europe, making Moscow more likely
to seek constructive relations with the alliance, Helms said.
</P>
<P>
"If anything, it will make it easier to maintain relations with
Russia because an expanded NATO will shut off Russia's avenues to
more destructive patterns of behavior," he noted.
</P>
<P>
But opponents of the move say that it would poison relations
with Russia and may lead to new confrontation.
</P>
<P>
"I think people in Russia feel betrayed by this," said
Minnesota Senator Paul Wellstone. "This is a very serious
mistake we are about to make," he added.
</P>
<P>
It is widely predicted that the Senate will be able to
approve the measure, which has been ratified by Canada, Denmark
and Germany.
</P>
<P>
However, a close vote was expected on a proposed amendment by
Sens. John Warner, R-Va., and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., for
a three-year moratorium on further expansion.
</P>
<P>
Opponents of expanding NATO, a diverse and bipartisan group,
took their complaints to the Senate floor, calling enlargement too
costly to U.S. taxpayers and an unnecessary poke-in-the-eye to
Russia.
</P>
<P>
But Cohen stuck to the most recent Pentagon estimate that
enlargement would cost U.S. taxpayers about 400 million U.S.
dollars over 10 years, down from an initial Pentagon estimate of
2.5 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said that since the initial estimate, it had been
determined that the three eastern European nations were in a
position to bear more of the necessary changes themselves.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cohen voiced opposition to the Warner-Moynihan
proposal to put a three-year pause on expanding beyond those
three nations.
</P>
<P>
While the administration has no timetable for further members,
to lock a decision into a three-year freeze would be unwise... and
counterproductive," he said.

<HEADLINE> UK Announces Strategy to Curb Drug Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Assets and profits seized from
drug barons will be used to fund the government's new 10-year
strategy to fight drug abuse, the British government said on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The leader of the Commons, Ann Taylor, told parliament that up
to 25 million pounds taken from criminals would be channelled back
into the drug programs.
</P>
<P>
"It is right that the profits from this evil trade should go
back into tackling the problems it generates," she said.
</P>
<P>
Taylor was unveiling the government's strategy to combat drug
abuse, which is detailed in the White Paper called Tackling Drugs
to Build a Better Britain.
</P>
<P>
"Drugs are a major contributing factor to the crime which
undermines communities and gets in the way of progress and
prosperity," she said.
</P>
<P>
Under the government's new plan, children aged as young as five
will be taught the dangers of drugs.
</P>
<P>
According to government figures, almost half of under
25-year-olds have used illegal drugs and at least half of all
recorded crime has a drug-related element.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate there are between 100,000 to 200,000 addicts
in Britain.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Anti-Smoking Legislation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Pushing for anti-smoking
legislation, U.S. President Bill Clinton Monday distributed a new
surgeon general's report on a growing tobacco threat to children
and minorities.
</P>
<P>
The first such report by Clinton's new surgeon general, David
Satcher, showed increased smoking rates among teenagers in all
major ethnic groups, including blacks, Hispanics, Asian-Americans
and native Americans.
</P>
<P>
Satcher's report also described efforts by tobacco companies to
target their advertising toward such minority groups and their
neighborhoods, and suggested the government specifically design
programs to counter them.
</P>
<P>
At a White House ceremony, Clinton said, "We know what the
danger is. We know what the remedy is. They're just kids. We're
the grownups.
</P>
<P>
"Now if we know what the danger is, and we know what the remedy
is, are we going to do what it takes to save their lives and their
health and their future, or not? It is as simple as that."
</P>
<P>
Clinton has repeatedly endorsed legislation proposed by Senator
John McCain, a Republican, that would require tobacco companies to
pay 516 billion dollars over 25 years, increase the price of
cigarettes by 1.10 dollar a pack by 2003, and provide the federal
Food and Drug Administration authority to regulate nicotine as a
drug.
</P>
<P>
But leading Republicans have begun attacking the McCain bill,
saying they would not accept major new taxes, particularly if they
appear designed primarily to raise general revenues.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Israel to Grasp Chance for Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton on
Monday urged Israel to grasp an opportunity to achieve its
founders' vision of peace with its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
"Never has the opportunity been more real, and it must not be
lost," Clinton said at a White House ceremony marking Israel's
50th anniversary of statehood.
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony, Clinton accepted an honorary doctorate of
philosophy from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem to
commemorate Israel's 50th birthday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said David Ben-Curion, the founders of the Jewish
state, had set three visions for the Jews to fulfil. While the
first two have been achieved, "the battle for the third piece of
Ben-Gurion's vision -- a just, secure and lasting peace -- is
still being waged, and still in blood, and still in tears," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The president held out the hope that Israel and the
Palestinians could "close the gap" in the next couple of years
on stalled peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The event came a day after U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright expressed frustration at the logjam in the Middle East
peace negotiations, saying the process had entered a period of
"grave danger."
</P>
<P>
Albright is to meet separately with Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on May 4
in London to discuss ways of reviving the stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
The secretary of state signaled she is losing patience, and her
criticism appeared to aim mainly at Netanyahu, who has been
pleading for more time to decide on the scope of a West Bank
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
"My message (in London) will be straightforward." she said.
"It is no longer enough just to talk, or to talk about having
more talks. We have been going around in circles for far too
long."
</P>
<P>
U.S. Vice President Al Gore, who also spoke at the White House
ceremony, mentioned he and his wife would go to Israel this week
to participate in the 50th anniversary celebrations.
</P>
<P>
Gore said he would carry "the yearnings of millions of
Americans for peace, for a new season of joy and a new jubilee
of hope" to the country.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Gore is to make another effort to get some
compromises from both Israel and the Palestinians after the
failure of U.S. special Middle East envoy Dennis Ross in his
latest mediation in the region.
