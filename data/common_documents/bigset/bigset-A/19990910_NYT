STUNNED JOCKEYS MOURN DEATH OF `A GOOD GUY'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   POMONA, Calif. _ At the Los Angeles County Fairgrounds stables
early Thursday morning, J.C. Gonzalez gave Ricardo Jaime a racing
saddle, a !ital!bon voyage!off! gift to a younger man embarking on
a career as a jockey.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me, `Take care on this racetrack,''' Jaime said later,
gesturing toward the little five-eighths-mile oval that most of the
big-money riders avoid. `` `It's dangerous.'''
</P>
<P>
   A few hours after their conversation, in the fourth race of
opening day at Fairplex Park, Ricardo Jaime negotiated the sharp
turns safely and rode the first thoroughbred winner of his life.
</P>
<P>
   In the very next race, 30 minutes after that, J.C. Gonzalez fell
from a breaking-down front-runner, hit the ground head-first, was
trampled by trailing horses and died.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, with massive head injuries, didn't even make it to the
hospital. He was 23 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Jaime, a Mexican countryman of Gonzalez, wasn't in that race,
the fifth of the scheduled 12. He was in the jockeys' room with the
other idle riders, watching the accident on closed-circuit
television, and he was still in there when track workers walked in
with the first ominous reports.
</P>
<P>
   Standing outside that jockeys' room about an hour and a half
later, Jaime seemed composed if stunned by the sudden death of a
man he called ``a nice person.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the apprentice handled the tragedy better than
many of the veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Pedroza, a former Fairplex champion, dissolved in tears
against a chain-link fence.
</P>
<P>
   Vic Lipton, Gonzalez's agent, slumped on a bench, his face
flush, crying.
</P>
<P>
   Corey Black, a four-time leading Fairplex rider, walked away
with a barely audible word: ``Wow.''
</P>
<P>
   Other jockeys _ including Hall of Famer Chris McCarron, here
Thursday not to ride but to sign autographs _ spewed their emotion
at track officials, voicing long-standing complaints about the
Fairplex ambulance service (though nobody seemed to blame the
ambulance service for what happened to Gonzalez, who never had a
chance after such catastrophic injuries).
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Valenzuela walked out of the jockeys' room hollow-eyed,
moving ever so slowly, as if he didn't know where to go from here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been racing on a day when something like this
happened,'' Valenzuela said. ``I've never seen this kind of emotion
in a jockeys' room. Everybody broke down in tears.''
</P>
<P>
   The jockeys voted to cancel the rest of the day's races, out of
respect for Gonzalez and in recognition of their own shaken
psyches.
</P>
<P>
   J.C. Gonzalez wasn't a well-known jockey. He won all of 181
races in a three-year career, the highlight coming in 1998 at
Fairplex, where he was the champion rider, helped by the
apprentice's weight allowance.
</P>
<P>
   In the hour after his death, fellow jockeys admitted they knew
little about him, couldn't even agree on what the ``J.C.'' stood
for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juan Carlos,'' said his young friend, Ricardo Jaime.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' an agent said, ``Jose Carlos.''
</P>
<P>
   Jose it was.
</P>
<P>
   This is what they knew for sure about him. Beyond the fact it
could have been one of them.
</P>
<P>
   He was from Yahualica, Jalisco, Mexico. He would have turned 24
on Oct. 5. He rode his first winner at Los Alamitos Race Course in
Orange County in 1996. All of those things are in the media guides.
</P>
<P>
   He was single with no children. He'd been dating Elena Aquino,
daughter of Los Alamitos trainer Betsy Aquino. He'd been living in
Reseda when he wasn't off in Northern California or at Del Mar
pursuing the vagabond life of a journeyman jockey.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very quiet. He kept to his task,'' said agent Richie
Silverstein, who booked mounts for Gonzalez at Hollywood Park
earlier this year. ``He'd go to work at Santa Anita (in the morning
to exercise horses), then he'd go to Hollywood, then he'd drive to
Los Alamitos and qualify (quarterhorses).''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a happy kid, a good guy,'' Valenzuela said. ``Guys
respected him. He was really safe to ride with.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a very friendly young guy. Just a smiling person,''
Black said.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics on jockey deaths are as sketchy as the biographies of
some of the victims. On the Southern California thoroughbred
circuit _ Santa Anita, Hollywood Park, Del Mar, Fairplex _ they
used to happen about once a decade. Alvaro Pineda had been the last
local thoroughbred jockey to die in battle, slammed against the
then-lightly padded Santa Anita starting gate in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   The '80s went by without a fatality. The '90s too, almost.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess if you ride long enough, you're going to see something
like this,'' Black said.
</P>
<P>
   Fans saw Gonzalez and his horse go down on the far turn, and
they'd seen Danny Sorenson and his horse crash into them and fall.
But a hedge blocked the grandstand view of the scene.
</P>
<P>
   When the cancellation of seven races was announced at 3:25 p.m.,
nearly an hour after the accident, the horseplayers filed out in
silence, knowing something terrible had happened, unsure exactly
what and to whom. (Sorenson wasn't seriously hurt.)
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez's fellow jockeys weren't as lucky as the fans. They
knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in a spill with him two weeks ago at Del Mar,''
Valenzuela said. ``His horse broke a leg. It was almost the exact
same thing (as Thursday).
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing different was that we both came out of it OK.
We got up, hugged, and walked away.''

MARTIN SHORT, A VETERAN TALK SHOW GUEST, TRIES HIS HAND AS A HOST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BY BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's say you're an actor who enjoys steady employment in
feature films. You've conquered television and Broadway, having won
Emmys and a Tony Award, and you are universally thought of as
hilarious.
</P>
<P>
   What in the world are you doing hosting a TV talk show?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm all washed up,'' Martin Short, whose new talk show starts
Monday, said last week.
</P>
<P>
   He was kidding.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money ain't bad at all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't kidding. But he wasn't telling the whole truth,
either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why a talk show?'' he finally asked. ``Because I love to do
television. I think it is comedy-friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been to him. Short is a veteran of ``Second City
Television'' and was one of the casts of ``Saturday Night Live''
that didn't make you wince for 90 minutes every weekend.
</P>
<P>
   (On the glass-is-half-empty side of the ledger, ``The Martin
Short Show,'' an ill-fated comedy, lasted two weeks in the
mid-'90s.)
</P>
<P>
   Whatever his other talents and shortcomings, Short is an
excellent talk-show guest. Mind you, that doesn't guarantee success
as a host. If it did, Robin Williams would be Oprah. But it's a
good place to start.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went on these talk shows promoting everything under the
sun since '82 on, it was never daunting for me,'' he said. ``I
didn't get nervous. When I looked at myself, I didn't say, `Why am
I behaving that way? Who is that?' To me, it was just like me
sitting in the chair, slouched a little bit, comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He scores,'' Michael King, vice president of King World
Productions Inc., which is producing ``The Martin Short Show,''
said this summer. ``I've never seen a regular person that was able
to go on Regis and Kathie Lee, Rosie O'Donnell and also be a
regular on David Letterman, Jay Leno and Conan (O'Brien). Most of
the time, you'll see performers that usually do one or the other.
And I think that's because of his versatility. And we're going to
use that versatility.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently. Short's show will include, in addition to the usual
celebrity guests flogging their latest projects, a troupe of comedy
actors, sketch comedy, a recurring soap opera called ``Herbert
Hoover High'' and, of course, plenty of the wacky characters Short
is so gifted at creating (see his turns in ``Father of the Bride''
remakes and, especially, ``The Big Picture'' for evidence).
</P>
<P>
   ``You play to your strengths,'' Short said. For instance, no
desk, the traditional life raft for talk-show hosts. (As the
fictional Larry Sanders once noted, the talk-show host is a
mythical creature _ half man, half desk.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It allows me to bop up a little bit more,'' Short explained.
</P>
<P>
   Also look for trademark goofy songs and a monologue. And,
befitting someone who's been in the industry for almost 30 years, a
lot of high-powered friends as guests, at least at first.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, ``The Martin Short Show'' kicks off with Billy
Crystal. The first week will also find Steve Martin, Eric Idle, Tom
Hanks and Ted Danson stopping by. Can Short possibly hope to
maintain that pace?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, of course not,'' he said. ``If you were opening up a shoe
store, you'd say, `Half-price sale.' You've got to get people
looking at you. That's why every one of these shows starts with a
little fireworks at the beginning. But that won't sustain you.''
</P>
<P>
   Something will have to. Because Short's show is syndicated,
different markets will run it at different times. So King World
can't aim for a specific demographic. Short said this bothers him
not at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found that when I would be on Letterman or Leno and then I
would go on Rosie and Regis, it was the same suit, same material.
And same reaction. I wasn't reinventing myself for the time
slots.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Short is up against stiff competition locally. His show
will air at 11 p.m. Monday through Friday. That places him head to
head (to head) with Letterman, Leno and Ted Koppel on
``Nightline.'' Combine that with high-profile train wrecks, such as
Howie Mandel's show, and the possibility of failure must seem
daunting.
</P>
<P>
   Again, Short is optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``What doesn't fail?'' he said. ``Everything fails, it seems.
You could say the same thing if I'm going to go and do a Broadway
show: `Is it daunting to think that so many Broadway shows fail?'
Or if I was about to do a sitcom: `Does it bother you that most
sitcoms don't make it to the second year?'
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it's like there's no safe road in show business. So you
can't even go there. You just have to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bold words, as Ed Grimley would put it, I must say. &QL;

 By JEROME SOLOMON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
So you accepted the fact that the Internet would change our lives,
but no one figured it would change college football. However, it
is.
<TEXT>
<P>
   From upsetting players and their families with insults and
falsehoods, to bothering coaches by sharing practice information,
to playing a role in recruiting efforts, fans who log onto
interactive Internet sites and post messages are having an impact
on the college game.
</P>
<P>
   In one breath players say they ignore the stuff on the Internet,
then in the next they say it inspires them.
</P>
<P>
   As is the case with much of football's fanfare, quarterbacks get
the brunt of the Internet attention, and often it's negative.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't really bother me at all,'' Texas A&AMP;M quarterback
Randy McCown said. ``People have said I was horrible before.
Actually it kind of motivates me that somebody thinks I can't throw
the football.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we go out and throw for 250 yards (last week against
Louisiana Tech). I just go, `That makes you look real smart,
thinking we couldn't throw and we go have a great game on
offense.'''
</P>
<P>
   As the nation becomes more computer-dependent, players are
finding they can't get away from what's on the Net. Many of them
get class assignments via e-mail, and if one is not a computer
nerd, he surely knows someone who is.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors posted on the Internet that Texas quarterback Major
Applewhite was prepared to transfer because of the impending
arrival of recruit Chris Simms seemed legitimate enough that his
father called to ask if they were true.
</P>
<P>
   McCown would much rather spend his summer golfing, but the
computer beckoned him this offseason after friends told him,
``They're ragging you again on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the farthest thing from a computer guy you can get,''
McCown said. ``I've just come across it (an Internet bulletin
board) a time or two because a roommate or a couple friends would
tell me they saw some stuff on it. So I got on there and looked at
it.''
</P>
<P>
   McCown found open discussion about him and his ability, or lack
thereof. Amazingly, much of this comes from people who claim to be
A&AMP;M fans. A topic of a post on a Web site's bulletin board: ``Randy
McCown, thy name is overrated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bunch of people that think they know a lot about
football,'' McCown said. ``I'm sure some of them probably do, but
the majority of them just have their little opinions.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are entitled to their opinions. If they want to put it
on the thing, that's fine. But they never know if that person they
write about _ whether it's about me or somebody else _ might see
that. So the message in that is they ought to kind of watch what
they say.''
</P>
<P>
   But they don't.
</P>
<P>
   Opinions is the key word. Posts are not limited to assessing
players' talents, and often stray into alleged off-the-field
activities, academic status and personal matters.
</P>
<P>
   The authors are not bound by professional journalistic standards
and ethics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to let the fans voice as much of their opinions as they
like, whether it's positive or negative,'' said Peter Kuo, who runs
TexAgs.com, a Web site aimed at Texas A&AMP;M fans. ``We don't tolerate
racial remarks, and we really don't like to see someone accuse any
other program of NCAA violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to allow fans leeway to say what they want to say. If
I don't let the people speak their minds, they'll go elsewhere. The
community here at TexAgs does a good job of policing people who
post nothing but player criticism.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuo is correct in that on his board, for every negative assault
on a player, there are a number of follow-up attacks and
admonitions directed at the originator. But that doesn't take away
the original post.
</P>
<P>
   Most boards put a lock on posts that are considered in poor
taste. The posts are left for all to see, but no one can respond to
them.
</P>
<P>
   Kuo said TexAgs will lock a post and admonish a poster to return
with more facts if the information is of a personal nature or might
be just a rumor (such as a player's arrest); overtly racist posts
never make it onto the board.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that their identity is for the most part protected
allows people the freedom to say things they probably would not
have the courage to say in public.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is a great instrument for all of us,'' Texas
coach Mack Brown said. ``If it is used properly, it offers a lot of
positives. But I worry about things _ whether it is the Internet
chat rooms and bulletin boards or talk radio _ where people can
anonymously slander people without any accountability.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't just apply to sports. It applies to politics,
business or just life in general. People shouldn't be able to have
a forum where they can be inaccurate and hurtful without being
responsible and at least standing up and identifying who they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Web sites can't figure a way to police themselves, I
would favor regulations on subjects such as pornography, improper
language and out-and-out slander.''
</P>
<P>
   It is an even more special case when the criticism and slander
are directed at minors, as they often are when recruiting season
heats up.
</P>
<P>
   With high school players and their parents going to Web sites
for information about schools, an ill-timed post could affect their
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bulletin boards can have an impact on a football program,
because anything that is negative can affect recruiting,'' Brown
said. ``Every high school student and all of our players have
immediate access to the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Coaches sometimes use the Internet to their advantage. When
rumors spread on the Internet that a player is wavering on a
commitment, they adjust their plan of attack.
</P>
<P>
   McCown, whose brother Luke is a senior quarterback at
Jacksonville High School, said he has seen things on the Internet
about his younger sibling that were off-base.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I'll look on there to see where people think he's
going to go, and they'll say they know for sure he's definitely
going to someplace that he's not even considering going,'' McCown
said. ``It's funny.''
</P>
<P>
   To college football coaches, the World Wide Web is like the
prevent defense: Sometimes it's all right, sometimes they hate it,
but it's here to stay, so they have to deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches are closing practices to keep ``Internet spies'' from
posting information about workouts.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Tech coach Spike Dykes is one of the more relaxed coaches
in the country when it comes to media access to his team. Tech is
the only team in the Big 12 Conference to allow the media into the
team's locker room after games.
</P>
<P>
   But thanks to Internet raiders, Dykes had to reconsider his open
practices policy, which allowed fans to come watch the Raiders
anytime.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is the Internet,'' Dykes told the Lubbock
Avalanche-Journal. ``Everything we do at practice is read about on
the Internet. These are problems we have in college football that
we didn't have five or 10 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Dykes was stunned by an incident last year when Tech wide
receiver David Simmonds was injured at practice, suffering
temporary paralysis in his legs, and transported by ambulance to
the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the injury _ and before Simmonds' parents were
notified _ a report describing what happened appeared on an
Internet site. Dykes said Simmonds' father, who was in New
Braunfels, was seconds away from clicking onto the Internet when
the doctor's call got through.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been awful if he had read what was on there,''
Dykes said.
</P>
<P>
   Those types of incidents will only increase as the Internet
becomes more prevalent.

Emmitt Smith says he can carry the Cowboys back to the top 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Cowboys running back Emmitt Smith has never been
good at hiding his feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Not when he entered the league in 1990 amid doubts about being
too small and too slow.
</P>
<P>
   Not when he proved his naysayers wrong by winning four rushing
titles and helping the Cowboys to three Super Bowl titles from 1991
through 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Not last year when he rushed for 1,332 yards and 13 touchdowns
to quiet critics who again questioned his ability after subpar
seasons in 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   And not now, just days before the 1999 season opener Sunday
against the Washington Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   Here he sat in the players lounge outside the locker room at the
Cowboys' Valley Ranch headquarters on an emotional overload.
</P>
<P>
   In between bites of fruit Wednesday, Smith opened up about a
feeling of betrayal from inside the organization, chasing Walter
Payton's all-time rushing record, his excitement about the coming
season and most of all his desire to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning is the motivation to keep coming out here,'' said
Smith, 30. ``That's the only reason I play the game. I don't play
for the money. I don't play for the fame. I play to win
championships.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten years after being selected in the first round from the
University of Florida, that drive is more critical than ever to the
Cowboys. Contrary to the hype surrounding the impact free-agent
addition receiver Raghib Ismail will have on Cowboys coach Chan
Gailey's multifaceted attack this season, Smith said any Cowboys
success will be based on a successful running game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chan knows and everybody around here knows the importance of
the running game,'' Smith said. ``It would be naive for someone to
think that four and five wides and trips and all that stuff is
going to get you to the Super Bowl. You have to start with the
running game first. And with our offensive line, you can't help but
look forward to what we can achieve this season.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking forward would be a lot better than looking back for
Smith, who has endured a storm of skepticism the past couple years.
What has been most hurtful to him is that he believes it all began
inside the Cowboys organization. Last season's free-agent signing
of former Pro Bowl back Chris Warren to be his primary backup only
fanned the flames.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bringing in Chris only confirmed to people mentally that the
Cowboys believed themselves that I was on my way out,'' said Smith,
who said he has a great relationship with Warren. ``There were
doubts within our own coaching staff that I was on my way out.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he honestly believed that he wasn't getting full
support from the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh yeah,'' Smith said. ``Yes I do believe
that. I'm not going to call out any names. But I believe it because
I hear it. I hear the comments that were made today versus the
comments that were made last year. That tells me even in their mind
that I was on my way out.''
</P>
<P>
   How did it make him feel?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm only human,'' Smith said. ``How do you expect a human
being to feel when someone doubts you. I felt betrayed, especially
when you have been within the organization as long as I have.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith never had to worry about support from running-backs coach
Clarence Shelmon, who is in his second year with the Cowboys after
coming over from Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him when I got here that I didn't see any dropoff in
talent and I expected'' a big year, Shelmon said. ``He's always had
my support. I've come to find out that Emmitt has a tremendous
amount of pride. A lot of the talk about him being in decline
bothered him more from a professional standpoint than a personal
standpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   It's that same pride that also prevents Smith from saying I told
you so to all the critics after his resurgent performance in 1998.
He had rushed for only 1,204 yards in 1996 and 1,074 in '97.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't need redemption because he never doubted himself. He
knew the real reasons for his two-year slide, and it had nothing to
do with age.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, I was healthy for the first time in two years, and
the offensive line was better,'' Smith said. ``But those questions
are still there. All they are waiting for is for me to fall short
again. There is nothing I can do about that. My job is to just play
football.''
</P>
<P>
   Football has always been a place where Smith, who said he would
have been a coach if he wasn't a player, got his greatest
enjoyment.
</P>
<P>
   That fact holds especially true in 1999. Sources of Smith's
delight are the Cowboys' retooled offensive line, keyed by the
return of center Mark Stepnoski, and his continued good health.
</P>
<P>
   Smith _ whose personal life is better than ever, considering
that he plans to marry his fiance after the season _ reported to
training camp a day earlier than the rest of veterans. He's bent on
regaining his stature among the league's elite running backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a doubt, I'm strong as I ever was,'' Smith said. ``I
honestly believe that.''
</P>
<P>
   While Smith will talk openly about the season and his goal of
having a 1,500-yard campaign, he shies away from talk about
Payton's record. The sudden retirement of Barry Sanders makes
Smith, the league's fifth all-time leading rushing with 12,566
yards, the greatest threat to Payton's mark of 16,726.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he would like the record. But it's not what he goes to bed
dreaming about. And its not the reason he comes to work everyday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why think about it until I get closer,'' Smith said. ``I'm
more than 4,000 yards away. I can't get there this year. And you
never know what might happen in the next few years. ``I'm out here
for the same reason I've always been out here. You play the game to
win. And win as much as you can. I'd like to have five rings.''

Cochise County judge indicted Faces charges of fraud, conspir acy,
money laund    
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ronald ``Joe'' Borane, a Cochise County judge and former Douglas
police chief investigated repeatedly by state and federal agencies,
was arrested Thursday on fraud, conspiracy and money-laundering
charges after a two-year undercover drug operation.
</P>
<P>
   Borane, whose brother Ray serves as the mayor of Douglas, is a
powerful Cochise County businessman who has consorted with one of
northern Mexico's most notorious narcotics kingpins.
</P>
<P>
   Borane serves as Douglas City magistrate, as well as a Cochise
County justice of the peace. He was arrested Thursday at a Tucson
hotel while attending a judicial conference.
</P>
<P>
   A Superior Court indictment alleges that Borane fixed tickets
and conspired to help a purported drug trafficker hide profits.
</P>
<P>
   The judge could not be reached for comment. He was released from
a Tucson jail after an initial hearing in Pima County Superior
Court.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Borane, a former assistant superintendent of public
instruction for the state, said he was stunned by the criminal
allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very personal, sensitive, family situation,'' the
mayor added. ``Joe's my brother, and I love him. I pray to God this
is all a mistake. . . . He's been a community servant all his
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Attorney General John Evans said Borane, who is not a
lawyer, represented himself at the hearing, accompanied by his wife
and daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Borane, 63, has been a leader in the Democratic Party, served
with Arizona's Commission on Judicial Qualifications and headed the
state association for justices of the peace. He spent 22 years as a
Douglas police officer and chief, plus 19 more as a judge.
</P>
<P>
   But that service has sometimes been tainted by suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Borane was investigated as police chief for misuse of
public funds, but no charges were filed due to a lack of evidence.
He resigned and became a justice of the peace a year later.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, DPS investigators concluded that Borane was drunk when
he crashed his car, killing a passenger. The judge denied being
intoxicated, despite a blood-alcohol measurement of 0.17. Charges
were never filed, purportedly due to flawed evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, his friendship with Mexican drug trafficker
Francisco Rafael Camarena came under scrutiny with the discovery of
Camarena's infamous trans-border drug tunnel. The tunnel was on
property Borane had sold to Camarena for a 472 percent profit, and
Borane had been named godfather to Camarena's son.
</P>
<P>
   The latest investigation was headed by an FBI public corruption
squad based in Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   According to the four-count indictment, Joe Borane and an
undercover agent using the name ``Dave Moore'' struck up a
friendship in March 1998 when Borane stepped into Desert Surplus, a
downtown Douglas military gear outlet set up by the FBI
specifically for a drug and money-laundering sting.
</P>
<P>
   The agent, who rented the building from Borane, was posing as a
businessman who traded military surplus to Guatemalan narcotics
dealers in return for drugs that he later sold.
</P>
<P>
   In their first meeting, according to a four-count grand jury
indictment, Borane offered to sell the building to the undercover
agent. Then the talk turned to parking tickets that the agent
wanted fixed.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment alleges that their relationship progressed over
the ensuing months to the point that Borane repeatedly dismissed
parking and speeding tickets and suspended fines for the agent
while the two negotiated the sale of the building.
</P>
<P>
   During those discussions, the indictment alleges, Borane learned
how the agent proposed to pay for the building _ with drug money _
and discussed how the agent could launder the cash and hide his
ownership in the building.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the indictment says, Borane invested $5,000 in a
deal that involved trading military equipment to Guatemalan drug
rings in exchange for cocaine. When told later that he had made
$26,500 from the drug sales, Borane told the agent, ``Don't, don't,
I just want to know about the (surplus) uniform stuff.'' Later,
however, Borane deposited a $26,500 profit into his account.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the indictment says, Borane was told he'd made $25,000
more from a transaction involving marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Evans said, the Guatemalans and drugs never existed.
</P>
<P>
   Borane was suspended from his judicial duties Thursday by the
Arizona Supreme Court. His justice court was closed while DPS
investigators served search warrants there, at Douglas City Court
and at three other locations involving Borane's businesses and
associates.
</P>
<P>
   Evans, the state prosecutor, said the sting began two years ago,
and Borane ``was not a target'' even though federal agents have
investigated the judge on previous occasions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just happened to rent from the judge,'' Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   In the process of dealing with Borane, Evans added, FBI agents
developed additional suspects. He said investigators are asking
Cochise County residents who have concerns about Douglas court
operations to contact either the FBI or DPS office in Sierra Vista.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are other pending investigations with the possibility of
indictments,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Besides filing criminal charges, investigators seized one
building and filed a $350,000 civil racketeering lien against all
of Borane's 126 properties in Cochise County.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Davis, a Douglas City Council member and 50-year friend to
the Borane family, said he was flabbergasted when investigators
questioned him about the judge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe any of this,'' Davis added. ``It would be
totally out of character for Judge Borane. He doesn't need the
money. He's one of the wealthiest men in the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, a retired police lieutenant, said he worked with Borane
years ago, and saw how he built a vast property empire in Cochise
County.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took every dime he had and bought real estate _ just little
pieces of junk _ while the rest of us (cops) were out buying beer
and gambling.''
</P>
<P>
   The properties include homes, condominiums, warehouses, raw land
_ even a U.S. Customs office.
</P>
<P>
   While Borane managed to get rich, serve on the bench and become
``very powerful,'' Davis said, he was an ``extremely poor judge of
people'' who placed too much faith in business associates.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a very trusting person _ to my way of thinking, too
trusting,'' Ray Borane said.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Borane said he'd never spoken with his older brother about
local talk that linked the judge with drug dealing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always on a different (career) path,'' the mayor said.
``I never delved into his business, and he never delved into
mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the rumors were hard to ignore. More than a decade ago, a
man sent to prison by Judge Borane wrote a popular local ballad
titled, ``Joe Cocaine.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Borane attributed the song and other
rumors to political enemies and convicted criminals, adding that
he'd sent hundreds of drug offenders to jail during his career.
</P>
<P>
   `It doesn't bother me at all,'' he said. `If it weren't me, it
would be somebody else. Everyday they pick a new godfather.''
</P>
<P>
   Businessman Bill Wendt, owner of Wendy's Hallmark in Douglas,
said the arrest didn't surprise him in a city flooded with drug
proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where there is lots of money, there is lots of corruption,''
Wendt said.
</P>
<P>
   Borane is scheduled to appear for an arraignment in Cochise
County Superior Court on Sept. 20. &QL;

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
NEW YORK _ On Saturday, at least, the U.S. Open will be super. It
will be everything the U.S. Open should be.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Ashe Stadium figures to be full _ I mean really full _ of
loud, raucous New Yorkers reliving the Cold War with Andre Agassi
playing the Russian Yevgeny Kafelnikov for the No. 1 ranking and
probably a free pass to the men's title. A women's showdown between
the Williams sisters would be quite the co-attraction as well,
although it presents a dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   For whom to root? How do you side with Venus over Serena, or
vice versa?
</P>
<P>
   A pity today's semifinal between Venus and Martina Hingis can't
be for the championship. Put them on the card with Agassi and
Kafelnikov, and you would have Super-Duper Saturday, potentially
one of the more compelling days in U.S. Open history.
</P>
<P>
   But even such a day wouldn't fully cure what ails the Open in
its current state-of-the-art state. The tournament, comfortably
ensconced in the biggest, fanciest, most customer-coddling tennis
facility the world has ever seen, has lost its soul.
</P>
<P>
   It's too clean, too quiet, too spread out. It's not New York
anymore. No jostling. No jerks hurling insults. No juices flowing.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday evening, Todd Martin and Greg Rusedski went to war for
five sets in one of the most gripping matches of the Open's
Flushing Meadow era, yet they played to 20,000 empty seats. A day
later, Kafelnikov and Richard Krajicek staged a worthy five-set
encore but filled little over half of the downsized Louis Armstrong
Stadium next door.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the new National Tennis Center is getting
people to use their paid-for seats.
</P>
<P>
   For Agassi, who has inherited some of the magic that always
surrounded Jimmy Connors here, the fans will show up and get down,
particularly at the night sessions when the chardonnay buzz has
kicked in. Otherwise, this place offers all the electricity of a
corporate retreat.
</P>
<P>
   Which, of course, it is.
</P>
<P>
   Every good seat in the main stadium, meaning every seat in the
lower section save for the press-row freebies in one corner and the
players' box, is sold to the sponsoring companies or the
hyper-wealthy, decidedly non-rowdy box-seat patrons. Both groups
are, aside from lacking animation, notorious for their no-show
and/or short-attention-span tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   What, watch tennis when shrimp, crab claws and filet mignon are
there for the asking in the hospitality tents? There was a mass
exodus after two sets of the Gustavo Kuerten-Cedric Pioline
quarterfinal Thursday. At least two-thirds of the lower-section
customers up and fled a superbly played match tied at one set
apiece.
</P>
<P>
   (But that wasn't just about the hors d'oeuvres. Venus and Serena
were about to take the court for their doubles quarterfinal against
Monica Seles and Mary Joe Fernandez. It's a changing world when
women's doubles can trump men's singles.)
</P>
<P>
   The worst dead zone rings the middle of the 23,219-seat stadium,
where the dreaded luxury suites are. I say dreaded. They might
greatly subtract from the ambience of the venue, but they do help
pay the bills. They number 93, and at $100,000 per for the two
weeks, that's $9.3 million dedicated toward the debt service every
fortnight.
</P>
<P>
   What zany, boisterous and, God forbid, spontaneous behavior
remains can be found in the stratospheric reaches of the vast upper
deck. You might need a telescope to see the players' expressions
from there, but the small pockets of nationalistic fervor, such as
the samba-ing gaggle of Brazilians trying to help their man Guga
fight past Pioline, provide at least a modicum of honest
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, there's also a huge surfeit of elbow room. Unfortunately,
in an age of stadium downsizing, the United States Tennis
Association went in the opposite direction. A capacity of 18,000
would have been more than plenty. A capacity as small as 15,000
might have been perfect. The idea, as John McEnroe says, is to
create demand.
</P>
<P>
   The fans should be right on top of the action, practically in
the players' faces. Baseball figured this out a few years back. Why
the USTA, caretaker of another troubled sport, wasn't paying
attention is something of a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   A secondary reason for the stadium's oft-deserted look is,
ironically, the appeal of the outside grounds. There are bubbling
fountains and enticing open spaces. The hinterland courts offer the
intimacy the stadium lacks. You can smell, taste and feel the
tennis out there. No chance of that in Arthur's lovely, utterly
antiseptic arena.
</P>
<P>
   The Open's skewed scheduling is an entrenched negative. The
women's semis should be tonight, not this afternoon. Their final
should be Sunday, a show unto itself. As for the men, stage their
semis as a twi-night doubleheader Saturday, then move the final to
a prime-time slot Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The latter is another McEnroe suggestion, by the way. Say what
you want about Mac, he understands show business. And, as the
century turns, the U.S. Open is lamentably three-fourths business,
one-fourth show.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
PHILADELPHIA _ This is the way it was supposed to be all season for
Ken Caminiti. Late inning, big hit.
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti says he really didn't get a good cut at Steve
Montgomery's fastball in the eighth, which maybe was a good thing
for planes on their approach to nearby Philadelphia International
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   What part of the ball Caminiti did get, he launched over the
center-field wall for a two-run homer that gave the Astros a 3-1
win and the first sweep of a seven-game road trip in franchise
history.
</P>
<P>
   If you've just been reading the headlines or following the
scores, it looks so easy, as if all the Astros have to do is show
up each day and sprint to another victory.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, the Astros can't sprint. Limp, crawl or drag
themselves around the bases, maybe. But definitely not sprint in a
season when the disabled list has been practically a second home.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of Moises ``Oops'' Alou, nobody has been more
of a hood ornament on the painmobile than Caminiti, who missed 79
games from May through August with a strained calf muscle.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the way he envisioned his return to Houston after
making his offseason decision to leave free-agent money on the
table and walk back into the fold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected to contribute,'' he said. ``I wanted to contribute
all year long. It was a decision I made because it was the place
where I've always felt the most comfortable, and I was so excited
at the beginning of the season to be back with the Astros. You
envision what it's going to be like at the start of the year, and
it turned out to be nothing like that. I know they had a great team
last year, and I knew that the talent was there to do it all again,
and what I wanted to do was come in and help make some kind of
difference to take the next step.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Caminiti is playing and the opposition is paying. Since
coming off the DL on Aug. 16, he has found his stroke and on this
road trip has been at a full boil. He hit .364 in the back-to-back
sweeps of the Expos and Phillies with three homers and 10 RBIs. He
beat Montreal almost single-handedly to start the trip with a
two-homer game. Then Caminiti's ninth-inning single Tuesday night
brought in the winning runs in an 8-6 victory prior to Thursday's
heroics.
</P>
<P>
   The thought of Caminiti heating up as the NL Central race with
the Reds percolates is as big a reason as any for the Astros to
feel good.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, despite rolling seven on the road trip, they have
not suddenly transformed themselves into a juggernaut. They've gone
on this tear in part because the Expos and the Phillies are the
baseball equivalent of the Washington Generals, and because they
have learned throughout this tough season to scratch and claw for
wins.
</P>
<P>
   But if you look deeper than the numbers that show Jeff Bagwell
with 40 home runs and Craig Biggio with a 3-for-3 afternoon
Thursday, this looks like a club that is worn down and beaten up.
Which remains a cause for concern, not only for the stretch run but
for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Biggio at times looks like he can barely make it out to his
defensive position at second base but pridefully and stubbornly
refuses to come out of the lineup for a rest. Bagwell still will
put a ball into orbit, but he has cooled considerably from the
first half of the season and shows signs of struggling at the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   Which makes Caminiti a welcome shot of gamma globulin in a
jaundiced lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because he's a switch hitter with power from both sides of the
plate, he's never at a disadvantage, no matter who's pitching,''
said manager Larry Dierker. ``There are pitchers, I think, that
Bagwell and Biggio do have trouble with. With Caminiti, he just
doesn't give the other manager an opportunity to change pitchers,
left- or righthanded, to put him in some kind of hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's also a better hitter since the last time he wore an
Astros uniform. He's learned better pitch selection, he's become
more patient, and I think he hits with more power. The way he's
swinging the bat right now is definitely something we can use over
these last weeks of the season, because I think the race is going
to go right down to the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Flashing back to those final, painful at-bats last year in the
World Series, where a hobbled Caminiti fell to the ground
repeatedly while trying to deliver for San Diego against the
Yankees, who would have thought at this point a year later he could
be giving the Astros a fresh stick?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to think that after the time I've spent just watching
this team all year, that it could end up that way,'' Caminiti said.
``I'll tell you, though, to do that I've got to get over all the
aches I've got right now. I did that quick week of rehab in New
Orleans and hurried up here, and I think my body believes it's in
spring training. I've got bumps and bruises and pain all over.''
</P>
<P>
   But in this frustrating season they have all been through, for
the Astros, for Caminiti, right now, it hurts so good.

<P>
   POMONA, Calif. _ The 61st meeting at Fairplex Park opened with
tragedy Thursday when jockey J.C. Gonzalez, the defending Fairplex
riding champion, was killed in the fifth race of the opening-day
card.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez suffered massive head injuries when he was thrown from
his horse and trampled by trailing horses in the 1-1/16-mile race.
He was pronounced dead by Dr. Neal Archer at the Fairplex first-aid
station at 2:45 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The fatality was the first on the Fairplex Park track since a
training accident took the life of 34-year-old Burleigh Turetski
during a workout April 15, 1982. It was the first death during a
thoroughbred race on a Southern California track since Alvaro
Pineda was killed in a Santa Anita starting gate in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining seven races on Thursday's card were canceled after
the accident out of respect to the jockeys, said George Bradvica,
who manages the track operation at Fairplex.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're proud of the safety record Fairplex has, and we're very
sad that this had to happen,'' Bradvica said.
</P>
<P>
   Racing is scheduled to resume today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of respect, we called the program (Thursday),'' said Neil
O'Dwyer, the vice president for equine racing at Fairplex. ``When I
heard how serious this was, I knew right away we were going to stop
the program.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Dwyer said the Fairplex staff was obviously stunned.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time I've ever been involved with something
this tragic,'' O'Dwyer said. ``We see serious injuries _ we've all
been there _ but fatalities you don't expect. It does point out the
risks involved in this sport. They are there, just like they are
there in every sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, 23, was riding Wolfhunt, an English-bred 4-year-old
colt, and leading the race when his horse broke down about halfway
around the final turn. Gonzalez was thrown and trampled by trailing
horses.
</P>
<P>
   A second horse, Accomodator, ridden by Danny Sorenson, tripped
while trying to pass the fallen Wolfhunt. Sorenson also was thrown
and suffered minor injuries. Both jockeys were taken to the track's
first-aid station. Gonzalez's body was later examined by Los
Angeles County coroner's officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened so fast, I'm just assuming his horse broke down
and fell,'' Sorenson said. ``He was one of my closest friends. One
of our great losses in this industry is having (something like)
this happen. We're going to miss him.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfhunt broke both forelegs in the spill and was euthanized.
Accomodator was in good condition, a track veterinarian said.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, a native of Yuhaulica, Jalisco, Mexico, was a resident
of Arcadia. He won 28 races last year at Fairplex while riding as
an apprentice and became the first rider in Los Angeles County Fair
history to win on his first five horses during a day of races, on
Sept. 25, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   He had 181 career wins in 1,476 mounts with purse earnings of
$4,155,000. He had 23 victories in 235 mounts this year with
earnings of $365,310. Gonzalez was single and had no children.
</P>
<P>
   Ricardo Jaime, the winning jockey in the fourth race, riding
March on Selma, said he was a close friend of Gonzalez's and that
the two had spoken about the five-eighths-mile track, which Jaime
had never ridden on before. Jaime, who should have been celebrating
his first win at the track, instead was forced to mourn the death
of a fellow jockey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel bad about him,'' Jaime said. ``He's my friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Matt Garcia, another jockey in the race, pulled up his horse,
Royal Comando, during the accident. ``The horse in front of me went
down and I just pulled up, but I don't know exactly what happened
in front of me,'' Garcia said. ``I could see J.C. was badly
injured. It didn't look good. That's part of the business you don't

   Fairplex did not announce an attendance for Thursday's card. The
first five races had a ``handle'' _ or bets placed _ of $275,000.
Last year's on-track opening-day handle was $688,131. Included in
the part of the card that was canceled were a pair of stakes races,
the Bustles and Bows Stakes, and the Foothill Stakes. O'Dwyer said
there will be a meeting today to determine what will be done with
those two races.

CANADA BRACES FOR MORE ILLEGAL CHINESE IMMIGRANTS ABOARD SHIPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, B.C. _ Canadian officials on Thursday braced for the
arrival of more rusty boats jammed with illegal Chinese migrants,
monitoring an unmarked ship off the coast of Vancouver Island amid
unconfirmed reports that as many as 11 more boats are headed for
Canada's shores.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration Minister Elinor Caplan Thursday visited a site at
Esquimalt, west of Victoria, where about 150 of the Chinese are
being held and work crews are putting up fencing and installing
large trailers capable of handling an additional 450 people.
</P>
<P>
   The government official who talked about even more ships on the
way would not provide details nor allow himself to be quoted. But
if the report proves to be accurate, it would be a huge new
headache for a province swamped by both a rising tide of illegal
migrants and waves of anger over immigration policies.
</P>
<P>
   Three boats carrying more than 440 people have been spotted and
seized since mid-July. A fourth vessel, dubbed ``the ghost ship''
by Caplan, is believed to have dropped off its human cargo in the
Queen Charlotte Islands in early July before sinking.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 378 migrants, almost all from Fujian province, are
being held in Esquimalt and Vancouver, pending processing of
refugee applications by some of the Chinese and possible criminal
prosecution of those involved in the smuggling operations.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-eight people aboard the first boat, apprehended on July
20, were released from custody after filing applications for
refugee status.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration Canada is investigating reports that as many as 30
of them have disappeared, and that some may have ended up in New
York. The agency hopes to have information available Friday, said
Rob Johnson, chief of the Enforcement Office.
</P>
<P>
   Caplan said Thursday that smugglers with links to organized
crime ``mock our laws'' and endanger lives by `luring people onto
decrepit boats'' for the trans-Pacific voyage. The ultimate
destination of most migrants is believed to be New York, and an
illegal economy where they must work off a price of passage that
averages around $38,000.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting earlier this week at the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation summit in New Zealand, Canada's foreign minister Lloyd
Axworthy sought help from China in combatting what Caplan called
``the trafficking in human beings.''
</P>
<P>
   With thousands of miles of fjords, inlets and islands to patrol,
Canada also has turned to the United States for help in detecting
additional unmarked ships with human cargoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer is that international partners are working together
and that includes the United States,'' Caplan said Thursday. With
stepped up surveillance, she said Canada hopes to send smugglers a
message:
</P>
<P>
   ``You are not going to succeed. We will catch you.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Canada's federal government is catching it from
all sides over costs of caring for the illegal migrants, and the
perceived leniency of immigration laws. Those who apply for refugee
status upon arrival in Canada, an estimated 25,000 people a year,
are allowed to remain in the country while their cases are heard.
</P>
<P>
   The process takes an average of 11 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to change our laws so those who are not genuine
migrants can be sent home immediately,'' said Gary Lunn, a member
of parliament from the conservative opposition Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   Lunn has collected 4,000 signatures on a petition demanding the
toughening of Canada's immigration laws.
</P>
<P>
   A fellow Reform lawmaker, John Reyolds, added: ``In 25 years in
politics, I've never seen an issue that made people so mad.''
</P>
<P>
   The British Columbia government has ended up footing much of the
bill for taking care of the illegal migrants. The cost for group
home services, translators and English language lessors amounts to
as much as $8,200 a month (Canadian) for each of 70 children taken
from the boats. The cost for each adult being held runs to $8,600,
said B.C. Attorney General Ujjal Dosanjh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It becomes a couple million dollars a month for our
treasury,'' said Dosanjh, who met with Caplan Thursday night and
asked for financial help.
</P>
<P>
   The 378 Chinese migrants currently being held are likely to stay
in detention, along with those from any other boats off Canada's
shores. Stung by the disappearance of people from the first boat,
Immigration Canada has tightened procedures. It is holding migrants
who are undocumented and deemed ``uncooperative,'' as well as those
who may be at risk from smuggling rings.
</P>
<P>
   On the job just five weeks, Caplan on Thursday promised to do
everything she can to speed up processing of the Fujian Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there are legitimate refugees among them, they will be
allowed to stay in Canada,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rest we will seek to remove as quickly as possible.'' She
said most of the boat people, who tend to be poor and not well
educated, ``would never qualify as immigrants who meet our test.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we need to toughen our laws, we will,'' Caplan added during
a Canadian Club luncheon appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about reports of 11 more boatloads, and whether Canada
would turn back boats filled with refugees, she replied: ``I want
to be clear. I would never put human life at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Debate over whether to send home the Chinese illegals has struck
deep at this country's national identity.
</P>
<P>
   The latest ship is being shadowed by a Canadian navy frigate,
HMS Huron, off the coast of Vancouver Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``The information we have is that the ship has not yet entered
Canadian waters,'' Caplan said. ``We think it will.''
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Chris Henderson, a Canadian navy spokesman, refused to
disclose details of where the ship is located, other than that it
is unmarked. ``We have no reason to suspect that this ship knows it
is under surveillance,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Caplan noted Thursday that human smuggling has become an
international business. Australia has seen 21 boatloads of illegal
immigrants arrive on its shores in the past five months. The
Netherlands expects to receive 60,000 refugee claimants this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've seen here in Canada is just the tip of an
international iceberg,'' she said. ``It has become clear in recent
years that organized smuggling rings are expanding their
activities, not just in Canada but around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The immigration minister referred to people smugglers with a
word that is gaining general circulation here _ ``snakeheads.''

   ISRAEL-PRISONER-RELEASE (Jerusalem) _ The release 199
Palestinian prisoners was the first concrete step in the revival of
the Israeli-Palestinian peace effort. Coming five days after a new
peace agreement was signed in Egypt, the event kicks off a packed
schedule of changes, including an imminent land transfer and the
opening of a safe passage route between the West Bank and Gaza. For
Palestinians it was a day of dancing the debka and firing
celebratory gunshots into the air. But their joy was tempered by a
widespread disappointment with their leaders who, many think,
failed in negotiations to secure the release of enough prisoners.

photography has changed the history of art and infiltrated every
other contemporary art medium while diversifying exponentially

HASBRO ADDS TO TOY, GAME EMPIRE WITH WIZARDS DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BILL VIRGIN AND D. PARVAZ  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the nation's best-known old-line toy and game companies
is buying a Renton, Wash., company that has in less than a decade
made itself a leader in trading card and role-playing games.
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro Inc., whose properties include such American toy and game
icons as G.I. Joe, Tonka and Monopoly, said Thursday it will pay
$325 million for Renton-based Wizards of the Coast Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Wizards was ``a basement start-up,'' according to founder and
President Peter Adkison, that roared to prominence with its
role-playing card game Magic: The Gathering. Wizards then struck a
second hit by licensing as a card game characters from Nintendo's
Pokemon game and animated television series. It also produces cards
based on the role-playing game Dungeons &AMP; Dragons. Sales are
expected to hit $400 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   Wizards, with 1,200 employees worldwide, will remain based in
Renton and Adkison and other senior managers will continue with the
company, Hasbro said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very visionary group of people, a very creative group
of people,'' said Wayne Charness, senior vice president of
Pawtucket, R.I. -based Hasbro. ``We'll let them go out and run
their own business.''
</P>
<P>
   With more than 300 shareholders, some of whom were looking to
convert their stock to cash, Wizards was ``examining all of our
liquidity options,'' including acquisition or an initial public
offering, Adkison said.
</P>
<P>
   But the combination with Hasbro does a lot more than just allow
for a cash-out of stock. ``We'll have access to all their
intellectual properties for role-playing games,'' Adkison said.
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro's portfolio includes such names as Playskool, Milton
Bradley, Parker Brothers, Kenner and Galoob, and such games as
Clue, Risk and Trivial Pursuit as well as toys like Mr. Potato
Head, Furby and Play-doh; it also owns the old Atari game catalog.
</P>
<P>
   The company's sales reached $3.3 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro has been moving many of its games into an interactive
CD-ROM format, and plans to roll out an online game service called
games.com. Wizards games seem likely candidates for those formats.
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro gets a lot out of the deal, too, besides two of the
hottest properties in the trading and game card market. ``Wizards
of the Coast brings us a devoted gaming community,'' Charness said.
</P>
<P>
   It also gets a new format for its products. While Hasbro covers
most of the toy and game landscape, it has no presence in the
market in which Wizards dominates, collectible game cards.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of the two companies ``makes perfect sense
strategically,'' said Leah Stambler, an analyst with Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter.
</P>
<P>
   Other features of the combination are attractive, Stambler and
company executives added. Wizards has strong distribution among
smaller retailers and game and book sellers, while Hasbro's
strength is among larger general retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Wizards also brings its own chain of 70 game stores and a game
center in Seattle's University District. Hasbro also believes the
year-round sales of Wizards products will even out its own sales
which are concentrated in the holiday retailing season.
</P>
<P>
   Patrons at the University Way game center didn't seem too
concerned Thursday about the sale of Wizards to a massive company.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson Haupt and Aaron Olson, both 18, said they come to Wizards
of the Coast about once a week. They tend to stick to action games,
first-person shooter games, Mortal Kombat.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard for them to be worried about the sale of Wizards when
neither of them is particularly sure of what Hasbro is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hasbro, Hasbro, Hasbro ... ,'' said Haupt, trying to jog his
memory. ``I know they make something .... ''
</P>
<P>
   When informed about Hasbro's major role in the toy market, Olson
admitted ``I'm not really educated in those types of things, so I
can't give a good response to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Other customers are actually hoping that Hasbo's purchase of
Wizards will improve some of Wizards' products.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be interesting to see how they do ... maybe they
could fix some of the problems they've been having with game
ideas,'' said Charles Coonfield, 23. He's referring specifically to
Classic Magic, the most recent edition of the enormously popular
card game, Magic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really baaaaaad,'' he said, going back to his game of
MechWarrior 3.

   Adkison, 37, was a Boeing systems analyst when he founded
Wizards in 1990 with six other game players. Today the Wizards
empire extends from more than a dozen trading card games to books,
magazines and tournaments for Magic players.
</P>
<P>
   The history of the toy and game industry is littered with
companies that had one hit product but couldn't come up with a
successor after that product faded.
</P>
<P>
   Adkison said he doesn't see that happening with Wizards. Six
years after its introduction, Magic continues to be extremely
popular. ``It has proved itself to be a sustainable property,'' he
said. Pokemon, meanwhile, has increased Wizards' customer base and
opened new distribution channels, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Wizards isn't relying just on those products. Adkison said
the company plans to roll out a line of sports-oriented playing
games, as well as a third edition of Dungeons &AMP; Dragons.
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro said the deal has already cleared the waiting period for
antitrust review, and should close by the end of this month.

CANADA BRACES FOR MORE ILLEGAL CHINESE IMMIGRANTS ABOARD SHIPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, B.C. _ Canadian officials on Thursday braced for the
arrival of more rusty boats jammed with illegal Chinese migrants,
monitoring an unmarked ship off the coast of Vancouver Island amid
unconfirmed reports that as many as 11 more boats are headed for
Canada's shores.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration Minister Elinor Caplan Thursday visited a site at
Esquimalt, west of Victoria, where about 150 of the Chinese are
being held and work crews are putting up fencing and installing
large trailers capable of handling an additional 450 people.
</P>
<P>
   The government official who talked about even more ships on the
way would not provide details nor allow himself to be quoted. But
if the report proves to be accurate, it would be a huge new
headache for a province swamped by both a rising tide of illegal
migrants and waves of anger over immigration policies.
</P>
<P>
   Three boats carrying more than 440 people have been spotted and
seized since mid-July. A fourth vessel, dubbed ``the ghost ship''
by Caplan, is believed to have dropped off its human cargo in the
Queen Charlotte Islands in early July before sinking.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 378 migrants, almost all from Fujian province, are
being held in Esquimalt and Vancouver, pending processing of
refugee applications by some of the Chinese and possible criminal
prosecution of those involved in the smuggling operations.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-eight people aboard the first boat, apprehended on July
20, were released from custody after filing applications for
refugee status.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration Canada is investigating reports that as many as 30
of them have disappeared, and that some may have ended up in New
York. The agency hopes to have information available Friday, said
Rob Johnson, chief of the Enforcement Office.
</P>
<P>
   Caplan said Thursday that smugglers with links to organized
crime ``mock our laws'' and endanger lives by `luring people onto
decrepit boats'' for the trans-Pacific voyage. The ultimate
destination of most migrants is believed to be New York, and an
illegal economy where they must work off a price of passage that
averages around $38,000.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting earlier this week at the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation summit in New Zealand, Canada's foreign minister Lloyd
Axworthy sought help from China in combatting what Caplan called
``the trafficking in human beings.''
</P>
<P>
   With thousands of miles of fjords, inlets and islands to patrol,
Canada also has turned to the United States for help in detecting
additional unmarked ships with human cargoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer is that international partners are working together
and that includes the United States,'' Caplan said Thursday. With
stepped up surveillance, she said Canada hopes to send smugglers a
message:
</P>
<P>
   ``You are not going to succeed. We will catch you.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Canada's federal government is catching it from
all sides over costs of caring for the illegal migrants, and the
perceived leniency of immigration laws. Those who apply for refugee
status upon arrival in Canada, an estimated 25,000 people a year,
are allowed to remain in the country while their cases are heard.
</P>
<P>
   The process takes an average of 11 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to change our laws so those who are not genuine
migrants can be sent home immediately,'' said Gary Lunn, a member
of parliament from the conservative opposition Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   Lunn has collected 4,000 signatures on a petition demanding the
toughening of Canada's immigration laws.
</P>
<P>
   A fellow Reform lawmaker, John Reyolds, added: ``In 25 years in
politics, I've never seen an issue that made people so mad.''
</P>
<P>
   The British Columbia government has ended up footing much of the
bill for taking care of the illegal migrants. The cost for group
home services, translators and English language lessors amounts to
as much as $8,200 a month (Canadian) for each of 70 children taken
from the boats. The cost for each adult being held runs to $8,600,
said B.C. Attorney General Ujjal Dosanjh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It becomes a couple million dollars a month for our
treasury,'' said Dosanjh, who met with Caplan Thursday night and
asked for financial help.
</P>
<P>
   The 378 Chinese migrants currently being held are likely to stay
in detention, along with those from any other boats off Canada's
shores. Stung by the disappearance of people from the first boat,
Immigration Canada has tightened procedures. It is holding migrants
who are undocumented and deemed ``uncooperative,'' as well as those
who may be at risk from smuggling rings.
</P>
<P>
   On the job just five weeks, Caplan on Thursday promised to do
everything she can to speed up processing of the Fujian Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there are legitimate refugees among them, they will be
allowed to stay in Canada,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rest we will seek to remove as quickly as possible.'' She
said most of the boat people, who tend to be poor and not well
educated, ``would never qualify as immigrants who meet our test.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we need to toughen our laws, we will,'' Caplan added during
a Canadian Club luncheon appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about reports of 11 more boatloads, and whether Canada
would turn back boats filled with refugees, she replied: ``I want
to be clear. I would never put human life at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Debate over whether to send home the Chinese illegals has struck
deep at this country's national identity.
</P>
<P>
   The latest ship is being shadowed by a Canadian navy frigate,
HMS Huron, off the coast of Vancouver Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``The information we have is that the ship has not yet entered
Canadian waters,'' Caplan said. ``We think it will.''
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Chris Henderson, a Canadian navy spokesman, refused to
disclose details of where the ship is located, other than that it
is unmarked. ``We have no reason to suspect that this ship knows it
is under surveillance,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Caplan noted Thursday that human smuggling has become an
international business. Australia has seen 21 boatloads of illegal
immigrants arrive on its shores in the past five months. The
Netherlands expects to receive 60,000 refugee claimants this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've seen here in Canada is just the tip of an
international iceberg,'' she said. ``It has become clear in recent
years that organized smuggling rings are expanding their
activities, not just in Canada but around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The immigration minister referred to people smugglers with a
word that is gaining general circulation here _ ``snakeheads.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The buzz over Arnold Schwarzenegger's next movie,
``End of Days,'' got a bit too loud for Universal Studios.
</P>
<P>
   The studio took the unusual step of canceling test screenings at
the Pacific Winnetka 21 on Wednesday and Thursday evenings after
advance word about the showings hit the Internet and a local
television station.
</P>
<P>
   Those who showed up with passes were handed a flier saying the
circumstances amounted to a ``corruption'' of the test process and
were offered free admission to any other movie at the theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of people who had gotten wind of the
screening,'' said Gary Frost, a manager at the theater. ``There
were even rumors going around that Schwarzenegger was going to show
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Universal spokeswoman Terry Curtin said the studio canceled the
screenings after hosts on KTTV-TV's ``Good Day L.A.'' show
suggested Wednesday morning that viewers attend the screenings and
then phone or fax in reviews. Curtin pointed out that attendees are
required to sign a confidentiality waiver prior to seeing a test
screening.
</P>
<P>
   ``The films shown at test screenings are not ready for public
presentation,'' she added. ``They're a tool that makes the product
better. We think this is an unethical breach of a private
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Curtin said Universal has been forced to cancel screenings in
the past on occasion but never for anything similar to the ``End of
Days'' circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   The incident highlights how increasingly difficult it has become
to keep secrets in the entertainment industry amid growing news
coverage and surging interest on the Internet, where dozens of Web
sites are updated daily with the latest rumors and developments
around Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Devlin, an executive with Montana-based Clark Film Buying,
said the cancellation was not a total surprise, given the need for
filmmakers to obtain unbiased reaction from test audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``The screenings are supposed to be secret in order to get a
valid cross-section without the fanatics who have to see the movie
before anyone else,'' Devlin said. ``So I'd say that canceling a
screening is unusual but not unprecedented.''
</P>
<P>
   As is typical for test screenings, those recruited for the ``End
of Days'' showings had not been told the title of the movie and
were given little detail other than it would be an action-adventure
starring Schwarzenegger. Recruiting had taken place earlier in the
week at nearby retail areas such as the Northridge Fashion Center.
</P>
<P>
   Universal clearly has high hopes for ``End of Days,'' since the
star's most successful films _ ``Total Recall,'' ``Terminator 2,''
``True Lies'' and ``Eraser'' _ have been action-adventures. It has
been given the choice release date of Nov. 24, the day before
Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   In ``End of Days,'' Schwarzenegger plays a police officer trying
to prevent an end-of-the-millennium global catastrophe by stopping
the devil (played by Gabriel Byrne) from finding a bride. Kevin
Pollak and Robin Tunney also star and Peter Hyams directs.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source forecasting
service, said the proliferation of Web sites means it's become
virtually impossible to keep local test screenings a secret. ``You
can't do it in Los Angeles without being infiltrated,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum also said an earlier test screening for ``End of
Days'' had gone well but he added that such data can be deceptive.
```The Iron Giant' had test scores that were through the roof, so
it doesn't mean a lot,'' he said. ``When people are seeing the film
for free and then they're forced to fill out a questionnaire,
they're not going to give an honest reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   To obtain passes to test screenings, prospective audience
members must sign a confidentiality agreement, promise they are not
affiliated with the movie industry or the media, and agree to rate
the movie after they've watched it. Studios and directors often
rely on how a test audience reacts to reach final decisions on how
to cut the film.
</P>
<P>
   Fan-based Web sites such as aint-it-cool-news.com also try to
get test audience reaction _ and descriptions of plot lines _ to
draw fans and the curious to their site. Although these Web sites
have been around for years, their popularity has jumped in recent
months as their ability to get early buzz _ and key plot twists _
has improved.
</P>
<P>
   In ``End of Days,'' the Mr. Showbiz Web site included a
one-sentence mention of ``supposedly top-secret recruited
screenings'' at the Winnetka in its Showbiz Confidential column
Tuesday. Cinescape Online ran an item Wednesday, sourcing the Mr.
Showbiz site, and proclaiming, ``If you can get in, let me know
about it!''
</P>
<P>
   The Movie View recruiting firm distributed a flier Wednesday to
those turned away at the Winnetka theater that said, in part, ``Due
to the corruption of a private process, Universal has been forced
to shut down its screening of `End of Days.'''
</P>
<P>
   The flier also took a potshot at those who had blown the cover
of secrecy off the screening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Filmmakers rely on research screenings to help fine-tune edit
their movies,'' it said. ``This is a critical part of the process.
The only new dimension to the process is the lack of respect for
the film and its makers demonstrated by some opportunistic news
sources, mostly anonymous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the hope of us all that films and their makers will be
treated with more respect for their privacy in the future,'' Movie
View also asserted. ``We appreciate your concern and help in this
important matter.''

REPUBLICANS WIN PROVISION EASING TIMBER-SALE RESTRICTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A coalition of irate Northwest Republicans,
claiming that radical environmentalists and out-of-touch judges
want to end all logging on public lands, on Thursday persuaded the
Senate to approve a provision that could make it easier to harvest
timber in national forests.
</P>
<P>
   The debate was significant not only for its potential impact on
public policy but also because it signaled a rekindling of the
timber wars that divided the Northwest in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted 52-45 to uphold a provision written by Sen.
Slade Gorton, R-Wash., that would effectively override the
decisions of two federal judges by allowing the Clinton
administration to sell federal land for logging without conducting
comprehensive wildlife surveys.
</P>
<P>
   Timber groups hailed the vote as the first step toward stopping
new logging restrictions that could transform rural parts of the
Pacific Northwest into what Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., called ``a
new Appalachia with chronic poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups blasted the Senate action, with an Audubon
Society official comparing the vote to book-burning because, he
said, the Senate was promoting ignorance by asking the federal
government not to learn about the impacts of logging on wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is whether the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land
Management should be required to conduct surveys for nearly 80
different species before allowing activities such as logging. Two
federal judges, one in the Southeast and one in the Northwest, have
ruled that the surveys must be conducted, blocking seven timber
sales in the southern Appalachian forest in Georgia and more than
25 timber sales in the Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our immediate concern is the future of a number of small,
family-owned mills who have assumed that timber sales would be
available in the coming months and years, but at stake is the
long-term ability of the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land
Management to maintain their forests,'' said Jim Geisinger,
president of the Northwest Forestry Association. ``Without this
provision, we're on the road to zero cut in the national forests.''
</P>
<P>
   Logging in the Northwest had already dropped by more than 80
percent since President Clinton announced his Northwest Forest Plan
in 1994. That plan was an effort to restart logging in the
Northwest after it had ground to a halt in 1991 over concern about
protection of the northern spotted owl.
</P>
<P>
   ``The effect of these present lawsuits is to make de facto
wilderness areas out of all of our national forest areas,'' Gorton
said. ``It is an extraordinary set of policies ... based on the
proposition from some national environmental organizations that
there should be no ... economically productive use, of our national
forest system whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   Timber companies and their allies in the Senate argued that the
wildlife surveys are extraordinarily expensive _ costing as much as
$5 billion to $9 billion _ and in some cases not possible given the
current state of science. Environmentalists said those figures are
wildly overstated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is reasonable to ask what are the impacts associated with
timber sales,'' said Daniel Beard, vice president of the National
Audubon Society. ``The thrust of this vote is `we don't want to
know. We're legislating ignorance.'''
</P>
<P>
   The primary critic of Gorton's provision was Sen. Charles Robb,
D-Va., who insisted that the studies are necessary because ``after
decades of managing our forests primarily for the production of
logs, we are now managing forests for a variety of uses. But we
cannot do that without baseline data on threatened and endangered
species.''
</P>
<P>
   But a number of senators from the Northwest delivered
impassioned speeches in which they argued that timber towns have
suffered enough from cutbacks in logging.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have recently come from a town hall meeting in Roseburg,
Oregon, where people are finally looking at oblivion because their
jobs are directly dependent upon the sales that have now been
enjoined,'' said Smith, the senator from Oregon. ``If you distill
this down, this is about pitting a survey of fungus, snails, and
slugs against children and families who need streets and schools.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration opposes the Gorton provision, which
was added to the budget for the Interior Department.
Environmentalists hope the provision will be deleted during a
House-Senate conference committee or will be vetoed by the
president. Among those voting against the provision Thursday were
Sens. Patty Murray, D-Wash., and Ron Wyden, D-Ore.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the measure becomes law, it is likely to have little
impact during the Clinton administration, and is slated to expire
next year. But both sides are clearly already thinking about the
next administration and the possibility that this provision could
be renewed and used to permit more logging if the White House is
won by a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``This language will have little effect if there is a
continuation of the Clinton administration or something similar,
but if the administration were to change, the discretion could be
used in an entirely destructive way,'' warned Bill Arthur,
Northwest director of the Sierra Club.

DREAMCAST SYSTEM OFF TO SLOW START

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The launching Thursday of Dreamcast, Sega's video
game system, had been heavily hyped as the biggest opening day ever
in entertainment, with sales forecast at $45 million to $90
million, but game players in L.A. were not beating paths to local
dealers as retailers had hoped they would.
</P>
<P>
   While a Sega spokeswoman said about 1,000 people lined up
outside a San Jose store at midnight to get their reserved
Dreamcasts, stores in L.A.'s San Fernando Valley reported sales at
or below expected levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far our sales are kind of disappointing,'' Derek Young at a
Best Buy said late Thursday afternoon. ``I'd say probably in the
last few hours I've been here, we've had a handful sold. The games
are moving well, but not the systems.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Sega might have done better by offering more game titles
and releasing the system on Labor Day weekend, rather than on a
school day. He acknowledged, however, that Dreamcast's unsurpassed
graphics make game development more complex, like sophisticated
Disney animation compared with TV's more primitive-looking ``South
Park.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dreamcast display at a Toys `R' Us bore a sign announcing a
temporary limit of one to a customer, even as about 20 boxes went
unclaimed on the surrounding shelves by early afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Response was better at the small Software Etc. store in Topanga
Plaza, where employees said about 50 people were ready to buy when
the doors opened at 8 a.m. Traffic slowed during school hours, but
picked up again in late afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   David Bedran of North Hollywood, a 21-year-old computer
technician, had stopped in that store looking for computer
equipment but found himself taken in by the Dreamcast display near
the entrance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the game that got me going,'' he said, manipulating
the controller through higher and higher levels of Soul Caliber, a
hand-to-hand combat game with a variety of characters and
backgrounds and an even wider range of weapons but, mercifully, no
blood.
</P>
<P>
   The basic system runs $199 for the box and a single controller,
and game disks sell for about $50 each. At those prices, the
typical Dreamcast customer is a male in his late teens or early
20s, area retailers say, or the generous parent of a lucky kid.
</P>
<P>
   Mindy Hibler of West Hills purchased a system and a Sonic
Adventure game for her son, Max, for his ninth birthday Saturday.
She also picked up four controllers so his buddies can get in on
the action.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a Nintendo 64, PlayStation, all the Gameboys,'' Hibler
said. She expects Dreamcast will be very popular with Max, his
cousins, his father and other gamers who come by. ``We have a fun
house,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At another Toys `R' Us, the Dreamcast demonstrator was set up
beside an older rival system. It was Dreamcast's new Sonic
Adventure game that drew the attention of 6-year-old Michael Olsey.
He watched appreciatively even as his grandmother, Fran Olsey,
visiting from Chesterfield, Mo., balked at the asking price.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to send us to the poorhouse, don't they?'' she said.
``And I'm the grandma who buys these things.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Harbert, head of electronics at Toys `R' Us in Van Nuys,
said customers ordered about 80 of his 150 systems before they
arrived, and some of these buyers were waiting outside when doors
opened at 9:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   His store rode the tide of Dreamcast hype, setting up demos
about three weeks ago to whet players' appetites. At times, Harbert
said, he feels like an arcade manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids come in and try to stay there all day,'' he said.
``You have to regulate it and make sure everybody's taking turns.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Richardson, 33, of Reseda picked up the system he ordered a
month ago and tinkered with it at home for 30 minutes before going
to work as a computer operator at a printing company.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the basic system, he bought a second controller and
the Soul Caliber game. He looks forward to using the system's
unique Internet capabilities, which will allow for interactive play
and downloading different game features and levels.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Jones, a 14-year-old high school sophomore, said he took a
job as a summer camp counselor with the aim of earning enough for a
Dreamcast setup.
</P>
<P>
   He took home the basic system, a second controller at $25, six
of the seven games he wanted for $300 and a memory card, $20. For
all that, he worked 8 1/2-hour days for eight weeks, baby-sat and
squirreled away his allowance.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a peer-pressure chain reaction at school, Jones
admits to starting it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reserved it the first day it was available, so I pressured a
lot of people into buying it,'' he said.

BORDER JUDGE ARRESTED IN DRUG INVESTIGATION
</HEADLINE>
   (resending to correct slug) 
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAT FLANNERY  
 and DENNIS WAGNER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ronald ``Joe'' Borane, a Cochise County judge and former Douglas
police chief investigated repeatedly by state and federal agencies,
was arrested Thursday on fraud, conspiracy and money-laundering
charges after a two-year undercover drug operation.
</P>
<P>
   Borane, whose brother Ray serves as the mayor of Douglas, is a
powerful Cochise County businessman who has consorted with one of
northern Mexico's most notorious narcotics kingpins.
</P>
<P>
   Borane serves as Douglas City magistrate, as well as a Cochise
County justice of the peace. He was arrested Thursday at a Tucson
hotel while attending a judicial conference.
</P>
<P>
   A Superior Court indictment alleges that Borane fixed tickets
and conspired to help a purported drug trafficker hide profits.
</P>
<P>
   The judge could not be reached for comment. He was released from
a Tucson jail after an initial hearing in Pima County Superior
Court.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Borane, a former assistant superintendent of public
instruction for the state, said he was stunned by the criminal
allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very personal, sensitive, family situation,'' the
mayor added. ``Joe's my brother, and I love him. I pray to God this
is all a mistake. . . . He's been a community servant all his
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Attorney General John Evans said Borane, who is not a
lawyer, represented himself at the hearing, accompanied by his wife
and daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Borane, 63, has been a leader in the Democratic Party, served
with Arizona's Commission on Judicial Qualifications and headed the
state association for justices of the peace. He spent 22 years as a
Douglas police officer and chief, plus 19 more as a judge.
</P>
<P>
   But that service has sometimes been tainted by suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Borane was investigated as police chief for misuse of
public funds, but no charges were filed due to a lack of evidence.
He resigned and became a justice of the peace a year later.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, DPS investigators concluded that Borane was drunk when
he crashed his car, killing a passenger. The judge denied being
intoxicated, despite a blood-alcohol measurement of 0.17. Charges
were never filed, purportedly due to flawed evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, his friendship with Mexican drug trafficker
Francisco Rafael Camarena came under scrutiny with the discovery of
Camarena's infamous trans-border drug tunnel. The tunnel was on
property Borane had sold to Camarena for a 472 percent profit, and
Borane had been named godfather to Camarena's son.
</P>
<P>
   The latest investigation was headed by an FBI public corruption
squad based in Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   According to the four-count indictment, Joe Borane and an
undercover agent using the name ``Dave Moore'' struck up a
friendship in March 1998 when Borane stepped into Desert Surplus, a
downtown Douglas military gear outlet set up by the FBI
specifically for a drug and money-laundering sting.
</P>
<P>
   The agent, who rented the building from Borane, was posing as a
businessman who traded military surplus to Guatemalan narcotics
dealers in return for drugs that he later sold.
</P>
<P>
   In their first meeting, according to a four-count grand jury
indictment, Borane offered to sell the building to the undercover
agent. Then the talk turned to parking tickets that the agent
wanted fixed.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment alleges that their relationship progressed over
the ensuing months to the point that Borane repeatedly dismissed
parking and speeding tickets and suspended fines for the agent
while the two negotiated the sale of the building.
</P>
<P>
   During those discussions, the indictment alleges, Borane learned
how the agent proposed to pay for the building _ with drug money _
and discussed how the agent could launder the cash and hide his
ownership in the building.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the indictment says, Borane invested $5,000 in a
deal that involved trading military equipment to Guatemalan drug
rings in exchange for cocaine. When told later that he had made
$26,500 from the drug sales, Borane told the agent, ``Don't, don't,
I just want to know about the (surplus) uniform stuff.'' Later,
however, Borane deposited a $26,500 profit into his account.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the indictment says, Borane was told he'd made $25,000
more from a transaction involving marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Evans said, the Guatemalans and drugs never existed.
</P>
<P>
   Borane was suspended from his judicial duties Thursday by the
Arizona Supreme Court. His justice court was closed while DPS
investigators served search warrants there, at Douglas City Court
and at three other locations involving Borane's businesses and
associates.
</P>
<P>
   Evans, the state prosecutor, said the sting began two years ago,
and Borane ``was not a target'' even though federal agents have
investigated the judge on previous occasions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just happened to rent from the judge,'' Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   In the process of dealing with Borane, Evans added, FBI agents
developed additional suspects. He said investigators are asking
Cochise County residents who have concerns about Douglas court
operations to contact either the FBI or DPS office in Sierra Vista.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are other pending investigations with the possibility of
indictments,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Besides filing criminal charges, investigators seized one
building and filed a $350,000 civil racketeering lien against all
of Borane's 126 properties in Cochise County.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Davis, a Douglas City Council member and 50-year friend to
the Borane family, said he was flabbergasted when investigators
questioned him about the judge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe any of this,'' Davis added. ``It would be
totally out of character for Judge Borane. He doesn't need the
money. He's one of the wealthiest men in the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, a retired police lieutenant, said he worked with Borane
years ago, and saw how he built a vast property empire in Cochise
County.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took every dime he had and bought real estate _ just little
pieces of junk _ while the rest of us (cops) were out buying beer
and gambling.''
</P>
<P>
   The properties include homes, condominiums, warehouses, raw land
_ even a U.S. Customs office.
</P>
<P>
   While Borane managed to get rich, serve on the bench and become
``very powerful,'' Davis said, he was an ``extremely poor judge of
people'' who placed too much faith in business associates.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a very trusting person _ to my way of thinking, too
trusting,'' Ray Borane said.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Borane said he'd never spoken with his older brother about
local talk that linked the judge with drug dealing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always on a different (career) path,'' the mayor said.
``I never delved into his business, and he never delved into
mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the rumors were hard to ignore. More than a decade ago, a
man sent to prison by Judge Borane wrote a popular local ballad
titled, ``Joe Cocaine.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Borane attributed the song and other
rumors to political enemies and convicted criminals, adding that
he'd sent hundreds of drug offenders to jail during his career.
</P>
<P>
   `It doesn't bother me at all,'' he said. `If it weren't me, it
would be somebody else. Everyday they pick a new godfather.''
</P>
<P>
   Businessman Bill Wendt, owner of Wendy's Hallmark in Douglas,
said the arrest didn't surprise him in a city flooded with drug
proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where there is lots of money, there is lots of corruption,''
Wendt said.
</P>
<P>
   Borane is scheduled to appear for an arraignment in Cochise
County Superior Court on Sept. 20. &QL;

METS DEFEAT DODGERS, 3-1 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ This was the most unexpected of pitchers' duels.
In one dugout one of the premier pitchers over the last four
seasons; in the other, a former superstar who has become a reliable
starter as he nears retirement.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, the glory days of Dodgers past won out, as
the New York Mets' Orel Hershiser gave another slap in this season
of insults to his high-priced former team. Hershiser, who will be
41 next week and spent the most spectacular years of his career in
Los Angeles, outpitched the Dodgers' current ace Kevin Brown,
allowing just two hits _ one a solo home run by Gary Sheffield _
and walking none in eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   Inducing grounder after grounder and retiring the last 15 he
faced, Hershiser, who regularly loses his effectiveness after six
innings, was buoyed by a two-run Mike Piazza home run as the Mets
went on to win, 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   This victory was particularly critical for the Mets. Although
the Atlanta Braves were idle _ the Mets are now three back in the
East _ the Cincinnati Reds won on Thursday, so the Mets remained
three games ahead in the National League wild-card race. One more
thing: The sagging bullpen, which has lost five games in the Mets'
last 14, got another save from flame-throwing Armando Benitez.
</P>
<P>
   The first Mets run reached base on an astounding error by Dodger
shortstop Mark Grudzielanek. With one out in the top of the sixth,
John Olerud hit a roller that was destined for a groundout. But as
Grudzielanek charged the ball, he seemed to forget to bend down.
Perhaps expecting the ball to take a hop into his glove,
Grudzielanek, who has committed 10 errors this season, instead ran
right by it, he heading for the pitcher's mound, where Brown stood
looking shocked, while the ball rolled onto the infield dirt.
</P>
<P>
   With the next batter, that error became enormous. On a 2-2
count, Brown left the pitch up and Piazza murdered the ball. He
swung so hard he nearly tipped over as he watched the shot sail
like a missile into the left field seats for the Mets lead. Piazza
had struggled during the recent homestand, batting just .167. But
Wednesday, he hit a three-run homer to insure the victory over the
Giants and on Thursday night, with his 34th homer of the season,
Piazza salvaged for the Mets what had begun to look like a wipeout.
</P>
<P>
   The pitch was a rare mistake by Brown, one of the best pitchers
in the game over the last four seasons. Entering the game, he was
behind only Greg Maddux and Pedro Martinez in wins in that time,
and ahead of both of them _ and in first place _ in earned run
average and innings pitched. Despite playing for one of baseball's
most noteworthy _ and expensive _ failures, Brown has done all he
could to earn the seven-year, $105 million deal the Dodgers gave
him.
</P>
<P>
   He has been one of the National League's dominant pitchers,
combining an intimidating persona with explosive pitches to compile
a 16-6 record with a 3.10 era entering the game. He has been
especially strong even as the Dodgers have languished near the
bottom of the West, with no hope of making the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   He was 6-0 with a 1.68 era in his last nine starts and he had
won seven straight decisions. In his last nine appearances, he had
humiliated batters, holding them to a .176 average. In his previous
start against the Mets this season, in the third of the three
consecutive games the Dodgers won at Shea, Brown pitched seven
shutout innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets managed little more until Grudzielanek's error on
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser, who has been a consistent if limited starter this
season, matched Brown for much of the game. After allowing a solo
Gary Sheffield homer in the first, Hershiser retired 18 of the next
19 batters he faced through the seventh inning _ usually at the
outside limit of his effectiveness _ yielding only a leadoff
chopper to Grudzielanek in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The closest Hershiser came to giving up another run came when
Sheffield was again at the plate. He sent a 2-1 pitch toward the
right field wall. Cedeno backed up, looking skyward. At the last
moment, he extended and leaped above the wall, but the ball
appeared gone and the crowd cheered what would have been the tying
run. Instead, Cedeno came down and cooly threw the ball back into
the infield, a simple flyout recorded.

EX-DODGERS BEAT CURRENT ONES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sixteen months ago the new regime put their stamp
on the Los Angeles Dodgers' organization by trading away perhaps
the best offensive catcher to play the game since ... ever.
</P>
<P>
   Reminders have been dropped since then as to what's gone wrong
with the Dodgers. Airwaves have burned. Newspapers singed with
verbiage about it. And the fans made their feelings known.
</P>
<P>
   Public perception remains that the day the Dodgers traded Mike
Piazza was the day the organization went south.
</P>
<P>
   More than half the 33,954 at Dodger Stadium served another
reminder. They cheered Piazza wildly when he crushed a two-run
homer off Kevin Brown in the sixth inning of the Mets' 3-1 win
Thursday in the opener of a four-game series.
</P>
<P>
   It was Piazza's 34th homer. He has 106 RBI. Both would lead the
Dodgers. He entered the night hitting .316, which would be second
among Dodgers regulars.
</P>
<P>
   In a season that seems to never end but always get worse,
watching Piazza deliver a clutch hit in the midst of a pennant race
in his old stomping grounds isn't exactly what the Dodgers had in
mind.
</P>
<P>
   Watching him do it off the $105 million man, who hadn't lost
since July 5, only drove home the point of what type of season it's
been.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that onetime Dodgers ace Orel Hershiser pitching eight
innings of one-run ball for the Mets. He allowed two hits, struck
out one and didn't walk a batter.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and just to rub a shaker full of salt into any wounds the
Dodgers may be licking, Roger Cedeno, _ whom the Dodgers traded
during the offseason along with Gold Glove catcher Charles Johnson
for catcher Todd Hundley _ robbed Gary Sheffield of a
seventh-inning homer with a leaping catch above the right-field
wall.
</P>
<P>
   It helped Hershiser (13-10) retire the last 15 batters he faced.
Armando Benitez pitched the ninth for this 19th save. The Dodgers
have lost four straight.
</P>
<P>
   The only leftover from the Piazza-to-Florida deal for the
Dodgers is Sheffield, who, of course, was overshadowed. Sheffield
hit his 24th homer of the season with two outs in the first to give
the Dodgers a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, that's been enough for Brown, but this time it didn't
hold. Brown last lost more than two months ago and he was coming
off back-to-back complete games in which he allowed one run.
</P>
<P>
   Not only had Brown won seven straight decisions to make a 20-win
season again possible, but the Dodgers won eight of his last 10
starts.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Brown was 6-0 with a 1.68 ERA in his last nine starts.
Opponents were hitting .176 against him, punctuated by his two-hit
shutout of Chicago in his last start. Brown, indeed, was rounding
into playoff form, though it isn't necessary with this bunch.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Mets, it was heading that way again for Brown. He
gave up a few hits (three through five innings) but never had a
real threat against him. Then Grudzielanek, who's been better than
anyone could have imagined defensively, booted John Olerud's slow
grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza, criticized heavily in New York during his year-plus stay
for not producing in the clutch, then helped the Mets creep within
three games of idle Atlanta when he lined Brown's 2-2 pitch into
the left-field bleachers to give the Mets a 2-1 lead in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   During the Mets' battle to unseat the Braves from their familiar
throne in the NL East, nobody's produced more than Piazza. In his
last 36 games with an official at-bat, he has 14 homers, 43 RBI and
32 runs. He had one stretch where he drove in a run a club-record
10 straight games, including a homer in four straight games to tie
a club mark.
</P>
<P>
   Brown (16-7) allowed one earned run on five hits in eight
innings. He struck out seven and walked one, but like most of the
season, whatever the Dodgers did wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets pushed their lead to 3-1 in the ninth off Pedro Borbon
on doubles by Benny Agbayani and Jay Payton.

ABDUL-MALIK SWITCH WILL FINALLY COME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The much-awaited move of USC's Sultan Abdul-Malik
from defensive end to linebacker will happen a week later than
expected.
</P>
<P>
   With the Trojans in a nickel defense against Hawaii, Abdul-Malik
was back at his familiar position in last weekend's 62-7 rout of
the Rainbow Warriors.
</P>
<P>
   Abdul-Malik, who requested the move to strongside linebacker
last spring, will start at the position next Saturday against San
Diego State.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was frustrating to a point,'' Abdul-Malik said. ``I never
played standup linebacker against Hawaii. But it was basically a
scrimmage. My debut will be next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Abdul-Malik didn't have any tackles or sacks in his final game
at defensive end, as Hawaii decided to double-team him and allowed
more opportunities for defensive end Lonnie Ford.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't play that much. I maybe got in 30 plays,''
Abdul-Malik said. ``It was a game where we were rotating a lot of
young guys and I didn't get many plays. I'm looking forward to San
Diego State.''
</P>
<P>
   USC coach Paul Hackett said he expected Abdul-Malik's conversion
to linebacker to take a few games, but he was reluctant to lose his
pass-rushing skills for the Hawaii game, because the Trojans did
not need a strongside linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was his decision (to switch positions) but we're not going
to lose out on our best pass rusher,'' Hackett said. ``Our idea is
by midseason he would have grown into the strongside linebacker
position.''
</P>
<P>
   Rideaux hopeful: Cornerback Darrell Rideaux is optimisitic he
can return to practice by Sunday, when he finally tests his injured
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's holding up. I think I'm making tremendous strides,''
Rideaux said. ``The true test will be Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Rideaux dismissed speculation he has a stress fracture in his
spinal column as a ``rumor,'' but has not ruled out the idea that
he will redshirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have to, I will, but the thought doesn't cross my mind,''
Rideaux said.
</P>
<P>
   Rideaux's father met with Hackett last week, but Rideaux said
the meeting was just to about Hackett's plans for the former Long
Beach Poly star.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think coach Hackett and my dad agreed rest was the best
thing,'' Rideaux said.
</P>
<P>
   Soward returns: Wide receiver R. Jay Soward returned to practice
Thursday, after being bothered by food poisoning for two days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fine. I'm over the food poisoning,'' Soward said. ``My
chest kind of clogged up.''
</P>
<P>
   Virus update: Center Eric Denmon and defensive tackle Ryan
Nielsen were bothered by a virus that has affected the team. The
entire team received flu shots this week to head off problems
before next week's game with San Diego State.

JOCKEY, 23, KILLED AT HORSE RACE

<TEXT>
<P>
   POMONA, Calif. _ The 61st meeting at Fairplex Park opened with
tragedy Thursday when jockey J.C. Gonzalez, the defending Fairplex
riding champion, was killed in the fifth race of the opening-day
card.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez suffered massive head injuries when he was thrown from
his horse and trampled by trailing horses in the 1-1/16-mile race.
He was pronounced dead by Dr. Neal Archer at the Fairplex first-aid
station at 2:45 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The fatality was the first on the Fairplex Park track since a
training accident took the life of 34-year-old Burleigh Turetski
during a workout April 15, 1982. It was the first death during a
thoroughbred race on a Southern California track since Alvaro
Pineda was killed in a Santa Anita starting gate in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining seven races on Thursday's card were canceled after
the accident out of respect to the jockeys, said George Bradvica,
who manages the track operation at Fairplex.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're proud of the safety record Fairplex has, and we're very
sad that this had to happen,'' Bradvica said.
</P>
<P>
   Racing is scheduled to resume today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of respect, we called the program (Thursday),'' said Neil
O'Dwyer, the vice president for equine racing at Fairplex. ``When I
heard how serious this was, I knew right away we were going to stop
the program.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Dwyer said the Fairplex staff was obviously stunned.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time I've ever been involved with something
this tragic,'' O'Dwyer said. ``We see serious injuries _ we've all
been there _ but fatalities you don't expect. It does point out the
risks involved in this sport. They are there, just like they are
there in every sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, 23, was riding Wolfhunt, an English-bred 4-year-old
colt, and leading the race when his horse broke down about halfway
around the final turn. Gonzalez was thrown and trampled by trailing
horses.
</P>
<P>
   A second horse, Accomodator, ridden by Danny Sorenson, tripped
while trying to pass the fallen Wolfhunt. Sorenson also was thrown
and suffered minor injuries. Both jockeys were taken to the track's
first-aid station. Gonzalez's body was later examined by Los
Angeles County coroner's officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened so fast, I'm just assuming his horse broke down
and fell,'' Sorenson said. ``He was one of my closest friends. One
of our great losses in this industry is having (something like)
this happen. We're going to miss him.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfhunt broke both forelegs in the spill and was euthanized.
Accomodator was in good condition, a track veterinarian said.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, a native of Yuhaulica, Jalisco, Mexico, was a resident
of Arcadia. He won 28 races last year at Fairplex while riding as
an apprentice and became the first rider in Los Angeles County Fair
history to win on his first five horses during a day of races, on
Sept. 25, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   He had 181 career wins in 1,476 mounts with purse earnings of
$4,155,000. He had 23 victories in 235 mounts this year with
earnings of $365,310. Gonzalez was single and had no children.
</P>
<P>
   Ricardo Jaime, the winning jockey in the fourth race, riding
March on Selma, said he was a close friend of Gonzalez's and that
the two had spoken about the five-eighths-mile track, which Jaime
had never ridden on before. Jaime, who should have been celebrating
his first win at the track, instead was forced to mourn the death
of a fellow jockey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel bad about him,'' Jaime said. ``He's my friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Matt Garcia, another jockey in the race, pulled up his horse,
Royal Comando, during the accident. ``The horse in front of me went
down and I just pulled up, but I don't know exactly what happened
in front of me,'' Garcia said. ``I could see J.C. was badly
injured. It didn't look good. That's part of the business you don't
like to see. He was a good rider. I hope to God he's in a better
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Fairplex did not announce an attendance for Thursday's card. The
first five races had a ``handle'' _ or bets placed _ of $275,000.
Last year's on-track opening-day handle was $688,131. Included in
the part of the card that was canceled were a pair of stakes races,
the Bustles and Bows Stakes, and the Foothill Stakes. O'Dwyer said
there will be a meeting today to determine what will be done with
those two races.

MARTIN AND PIOLINE ARE SURPRISING SEMIFINALISTS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating, rewriting throughout)   (sw) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's not quite true that seventh-seeded Todd Martin,
the U.S. Open's medical miracle man, has used an intravenous bag
for a pillow since his feverish comeback from dehydration _ and a
two-sets-to-none deficit against Greg Rusedski _ in the Round of
16.
</P>
<P>
   But Martin, who claimed he felt ``like a ton of bricks'' when he
hoisted himself out of bed on Thursday, soldiered into his second
career Open semifinal on Thursday night thanks to a 6-3, 5-7, 6-4,
6-4 victory against a man with a hardcourts phobia, 95th-ranked
Slava Dosedel of the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty tired,'' Martin said, ``but the good news is I
didn't deplete myself as much as I did the other night. Once you
get into any match and start trying to think your way through the
match, you think more about making your shots than how you feel.''
</P>
<P>
   In the men's semifinals on Saturday, where second-seeded Andre
Agassi and third-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov will vie for the No. 1
ranking and a berth in the final, the 29-year-old Martin will face
a fellow veteran who also has yet to capture a Grand Slam, the
unseeded Cedric Pioline.
</P>
<P>
   Pioline, 30, who is the oldest man left in the tournament,
arrived in his first Open semifinal in six years by upsetting
fifth-seeded Gustavo Kuerten on Thursday. The Frenchman, who has
defeated Martin in five of the eight times they have played,
outdashed the spirited Brazilian, 4-6, 7-6 (8-6), 7-6 (16-14), 7-6
(10-8), in a match that hinged on its three tenuous tie breakers.
</P>
<P>
   Though it was Dosedel, who prefers to play on clay, doing all
the skipping and Martin, a hardcourts specialist, doing all the
wincing, the American used 22 aces to limit the 29-year-old Czech's
belated Grand Slam breakthrough to a quarterfinal finish. ``I made
an extra focus tonight on my serve,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin's canny breaking of Dosedel's serve in the ninth games of
the third and fourth sets saved him from putting in the aggravation
of a third five-setter at the Open, an overtime jaunt he definitely
wished to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   When Pioline connected with a spectacular running forehand pass
that put him ahead by 10-9 in the third-set tie breaker, Kuerten
dropped his racquet, genuflected and moved over to Pioline's side
of the court to pay his respects with a handshake. That's his
version of man-to-man combat.
</P>
<P>
   Kuerten, a Brazilian who turns 23 on Friday, had youth on his
side and, unlike the well-seasoned Frenchman across the net, an
inspirational Grand Slam trophy on his mantel at home in surf-happy
Florianopolis. But with Pioline _ a two-time Grand Slam runner-up
who reached this event's finale in 1993 _ rolling toward the net at
every opportunity, Kuerten finally succumbed to the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Kuerten, who tried and failed to become the first Brazilian man
to make it into the Open semifinals, won the entertainment stakes
by acclamation inside the half-empty Arthur Ashe Stadium, where the
fans chanted his nickname as if they had entered a trance and booed
each time his big, shiny black sneaker drew a foot fault. But
Kuerten failed to reach his first Grand Slam semifinal since his
breakthrough at the 1997 French Open.
</P>
<P>
   Pioline described his winning tactics this way: ``I tried to
come in, go to the net, come in and put the pressure on his
shoulders, don't let him play his game what he likes to play, and
it worked. I was like smelling which side he was going to make the
passing shot on.''
</P>
<P>
   After losing in the first round of four of his last five Grand
Slams, Pioline began his comeback in a bizarre way in the first
round of this one when the two-time defending champion Patrick
Rafter, hampered by shoulder pain that was later diagnosed as a
rotator-cuff tear, defaulted to give Pioline a victory.
</P>
<P>
   Pioline's flawless performance in three tie breakers _ which
Thursday's quarterfinal rose, fell and turned on _ improved his
1999 record to 26-9 in tie breakers.
</P>
<P>
   Although Kuerten equaled Pioline ace for ace with 19, the
Frenchman guarded the net like a Doberman, and too many of
Kuerten's looping passes barely found their way over it before
being crushed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's unbeatable, especially me; I'm still growing,
improving my game,'' said Kuerten, whose sunny disposition was
unspoiled by the outcome. So far, all five of his titles have come
on clay, the surface that allows him time to settle into a rhythm
and topspin opponents into submission.
</P>
<P>
   While Kuerten hoped his quarterfinal finish at Wimbledon _ a
leap that moved his longtime coach, Larri Passos, to shave his head
in homage _ would bode for a better finish here. But at the Open he
had to settle for an entertaining run to the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just a little frustrated because I really played well, I
should have deserved to win, maybe,'' said Kuerten, the man whose
beefed-up serve put the four-time champion Pete Sampras out of
commission with a herniated disk in his lower back the day before
the Open started.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of winning, Kuerten saved seven Pioline-owned set
points, only to squander three of his own in the third set's tie
breaker, then blew three more set points in the critical fourth-set
tie breaker. A swashbuckling backhand volley took Pioline to match
point at 9-8, and Kuerten surrendered the quarterfinal with a shrug
and a blooping forehand error.
</P>
<P>
   The 3-hour-22-minute contest began on a beach day, but by the
time they had ventured into the fourth set, the stadium lights were
cranked up and a light rain had started to make the court slick.
Pioline slipped and fell twice, and in the 10th game Kuerten
requested a visit from the trainer, who later rubbed hot cream into
his fatigued legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the control of the match in the beginning,'' said
Kuerten, who kept his topspin so penetrating early on that Pioline
couldn't vacate the baseline for the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``I let it escape. Then I was fighting, hanging on, trying to do
my job, trying to get all the chance if I had it, but I didn't get
it. That was critical for the result.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuerten also was haunted by a few questionable calls on an
increasingly dim day. ``I had a passing shot to win the second
set,'' he said. ``For me, it was good; for the line umpire, it
wasn't. Maybe for us in Brazil, for sure it was good. If it was in
Brazil, this tournament, maybe I have a chance to win more than
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuerten relinquished the second set with a most unpopular double
fault. His first serve was nullified by a foot fault, and his
second, designed to be an ace down the middle line, was ruled wide.
</P>
<P>
   Though Kuerten called the atmosphere of their quarterfinal
``great; we were hitting unbelievable shots,'' he refused to
handicap Pioline's chances of advancing further.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nostrodamus,'' he said. ``It's wait and see.'' &QL;

GAGNE CREATES OPTIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was one start, but nearly everyone associated
with the Los Angeles Dodgers understood the significance of
right-hander Eric Gagne's major-league debut Tuesday against the
Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   Gagne showcased his pitching ability and his tenacity and
toughness. And in allowing two hits and striking out eight in six
shutout innings, Gagne offered the hope of something the Dodgers
have been searching for all season _ flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   That flexibility can lead to more competition for a roster spot
in the spring, but it can also mean the Dodgers now have the
ability to trade one of their current starters, either Chan Ho Park
or Ismael Valdes, during the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, that could lead to the packaging of another player with
a few years left on a hefty contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like we're creating more options for ourselves,''
Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone said.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just Gagne. Malone cited the performances of Mike Judd
and Matt Herges as a way as possible ways to create more
flexibility. The Dodgers also liked what they saw out of Robinson
Checo before his groin injury in late July.
</P>
<P>
   Mulling Masaoka: The Dodgers haven't decided if left-hander Onan
Masaoka is better suited to remain in the bullpen or return to the
starting rotation, so they've asked him to pitch in Venezuela
during the winter, where he would start.
</P>
<P>
   That could also lead to Masaoka beginning next season in the
minors to work as a starter, but Masaoka hasn't decided if he's
going to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never pitched in September before so I'm just seeing how
this last month goes,'' said Masaoka, who worries about his arm
strength pitching year-round.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Masaoka's going to pitch in September for the first
time in his career, his innings are down considerably from his
minor-league days as a starter. The 21-year-old rookie has pitched
572/3 innings, going 2-4 with a 4.21 ERA. He threw 2582/3 innings
in his last two minor-league seasons, primarily as a starter.
</P>
<P>
   But the chance to have a more defined role than middle reliever
or mop-up man is intriguing to Masaoka.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not complaining about what I'm doing right now, but it can
be tough not knowing what day you're pitching all the time,''
Masaoka said. ``I don't like the part about stepping back (to the
minors), but if that's what they want, you have to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   FYI: Three weeks ago Gagne, the Texas League pitcher of the
year, dropped Craig Landis as his agent and picked up super-agent
Scott Boras, who has Dodgers teammates Kevin Brown, Darren Dreifort
and Adrian Beltre as clients.... Former Dodgers catcher Mike Piazza
received a healthy mixture of cheers and jeers when he was
introduced before his first at-bat. Dodgers right fielder Raul
Mondesi got the same reception.... Ex-Dodgers pitcher Orel
Hershiser is one of six Cy Young award winners to start a game at
the age of 40. Hershiser, who won the Cy Young in 1988 in leading
the Dodgers to their last World Series title, joins Warren Spahn,
Early Wynn, Tom Seaver, Steve Carlton and Gaylord Perry.

PRO GOLFER, ENGINEERING FIRM FORGE GOLF COURSE PARTNERSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK P. COUCH  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY _ Golfer Jim Colbert and engineering firm Burns &AMP;
McDonnell are creating new links.
</P>
<P>
   The $9.8 million Sycamore Ridge Golf Course, being built in
Spring Hill, Kan., is the first venture in a budding relationship
between a hometown pro and hometown engineers.
</P>
<P>
   As a player on the Senior Professional Golf Association Tour,
Colbert tees off at some of the country's elite clubs. Sycamore
Ridge will be for the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is to develop high-quality courses but to do it at
public prices,'' said Colbert, who attended Bishop Miege High
School in Kansas City and Kansas State University. ``That means the
course has to play more people, and that has to be considered in
the design from day one.''
</P>
<P>
   Sycamore Ridge, at U.S. 169 and 199th Street, is the
partnership's first shot at developing and running a golf course.
Ground was broken for the 18-hole, par-72 course in November, and
it is to open in fall 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The team recently won a contract to study the feasibility of a
seven-course system in state parks in Kentucky, Colbert said last
week in an interview before the TD Waterhouse Championship at
Tiffany Greens Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   Designing a course is the fun part for most golfers, but Colbert
said he enjoyed the challenge of maintaining a topnotch course that
could withstand the rigors of everyday duffers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pros play the game 90 percent in the air. The customer
plays the game 50 percent on the ground,'' Colbert said.
</P>
<P>
   That means building courses with multiple tees, with fewer
bunkers in front of the holes and with golf-cart trails that run
parallel to the tees and greens.
</P>
<P>
   Such designs are to reduce the wear and tear caused by the
increased traffic on a public course, a niche that Colbert
considers perfect for his new business partnership.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can save a lot of money over time if you don't have to
replace grass because of creating wear patterns,'' Colbert said.
</P>
<P>
   Burns &AMP; McDonnell is a Kansas City-based engineering and
construction management firm that notched $170 million in revenues
in 1998. The company works with cities to design water supply
systems, roads, bridges, airports and electric power generation.
</P>
<P>
   The inspiration for the new company, Colbert-Burns &AMP; McDonnell,
was the engineering firm's municipal connections paired with
Colbert's expertise in course design and management.
</P>
<P>
   Colbert is no stranger to golf course development. In 1980, he
started a company that grew into the third-largest golf course
ownership company in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Colbert sold a majority of his stock in the company to
management and shareholders. He joined the Senior Tour and racked
up a successful record.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 and 1996, Colbert was named Senior Tour Player of the
Year. Since 1991 he has won 19 events and captured purses of more
than $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   But success on the course didn't replace success in the board
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had this expertise, and I wanted to use it,'' Colbert said.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership approached Spring Hill officials about
developing and running Sycamore Ridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't really on our radar screen,'' said Eric Berlin,
Spring Hill's city administrator.
</P>
<P>
   The city's population is 2,533, but studies showed that the
demand for the course would justify the project. The city issued
$9.8 million in bonds to cover the costs of building the 256-acre
course, Berlin said.
</P>
<P>
   City leaders concluded that the course would attract additional
development, and the partnership won a 15-year management contract.
</P>
<P>
   The daily green fee for the course, including a cart, is to be
$48 Mondays through Thursdays and $55 on weekends. Discounted rates
will be available to Spring Hill residents.
</P>
<P>
   Colbert-Burns &AMP; McDonnell will be paid $175,000 to operate the
course the first year it is open, Berlin said.
</P>
<P>
   The operation fee increases with inflation, and the partners
will share income after paying costs, including the debt service on
the 30-year bonds, Berlin said.

UTILICORP ANNOUNCES SALE OF WEST VIRGINIA POWER DIVISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE EVERLY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY _ UtiliCorp United Inc. on Thursday announced the
sale of its West Virginia Power division for $75 million to
Allegheny Energy Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The sale, which needs state and federal regulatory approval, is
expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2000. West
Virginia Power delivers natural gas and electricity to 50,000
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Richard C. Green Jr., UtiliCorp's chairman and chief executive
officer, said options were explored to make West Virginia Power
larger. In the end, the offer from Allegheny Energy was the best
solution, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Allegheny is a strong player in Eastern energy markets, and
we're confident West Virginia Power will play an important role in
its plans for growth in the state and the region,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Cosley, a spokesman for Kansas City-based UtiliCorp, said
that the company looked at making other acquisitions in the region
to satisfy the need to become bigger but that nothing came of it.
The energy business requires size to compete, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Allegheny Energy, which is based in Hagerstown, Md., delivers
electricity to 3 million customers in Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania,
Virginia and West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement to sell West Virginia Power includes the sale of
Appalachian Electric Heating, a heating and air-conditioning
service owned by UtiliCorp in West Virginia. There also are
provisions for Aquila Energy, a UtiliCorp unit, to provide natural
gas to Allegheny Energy for 20 years.

ASSESSMENT TEST SCORES FOR WORST-PERFORMING STUDENTS IMPROVE IN
KC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PHILLIP O'CONNOR  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY _ Some of the Kansas City School District's
worst-performing students improved on the latest state assessment
tests, but it remains unlikely that the district will win full
accreditation.
</P>
<P>
   The district released scores this week on Missouri Assessment
Program tests taken last spring by certain grades in mathematics,
science, communication arts and social studies.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the gains by low-performing students, the number of
students scoring at proficient or advanced levels continues to be
dismally low.
</P>
<P>
   The district needed to show improvement in both areas to rid
itself of the provisional accreditation it has held since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's an improvement in that we focused on bringing the
lowest-scoring students up so that they could be at a level where
they could actually benefit from the instruction,'' said Mickey
Seever, who oversees research, evaluation and assessment for the
district. ``We also recognize we have a long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Missouri Education Commissioner Robert Bartman said Thursday his
department still was analyzing the Kansas City results and would
make a recommendation to the state Board of Education in October
regarding accreditation. The board will decide whether to grant the
district full accreditation, provisional accreditation or no
accreditation.
</P>
<P>
   At worst, failure to receive accreditation could lead to a state
takeover and dismantling of the district, but Bartman said he did
not expect that to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not in the bottom of the ninth yet, so it's premature to
make any statements about that happening,'' Bartman said.
</P>
<P>
   If the district loses accreditation, it would have two years to
improve test scores before more drastic measures were taken.
</P>
<P>
   Bartman said he was troubled by the lack of Kansas City students
scoring at proficient and advanced levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not substantial movement, and in some places they've
actually lost some ground,'' Bartman said. ``That's not what we
like to see. We would much prefer to see stronger scores. It
doesn't appear to have materialized based on these results.''
</P>
<P>
   Statewide averages on the tests won't be available until later
this month. But Missouri students generally have performed poorly
on the new battery of tests designed to better gauge students'
knowledge and performance.
</P>
<P>
   Accreditation concerns aside, Kansas City district officials
were upbeat about some aspects of the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it shows genuine progress at a time when we lost a
substantial number of middle-class kids,'' board member Lance
Loewenstein said.
</P>
<P>
   The tests last school year were taken after the dismantling of
many magnet schools. Many of those schools were popular with
middle-class parents, who pulled their children out of Kansas City
schools after the district changed to a system under which most
children attend schools in their neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the gains among low-performing students came
despite the participation of an unusually high number of
academically at-risk students, who typically do poorly on
standardized tests.
</P>
<P>
   More than 90 percent of eligible students took the test last
spring, an increase of about 20 percentage points from the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year we made an attempt to test everyone we could,''
Seever said. ``We went out and found kids who were suspended,
truant or had been skipping, and made arrangements and got them
in.''
</P>
<P>
   The district, also for the first time, tested large numbers of
its special education students and those who speak English as their
second language. In previous years the district exempted many of
those students from the tests.
</P>
<P>
   The lowest-scoring students showed the greatest improvement in
eighth-grade mathematics, seventh-grade communication arts and
10th-grade science.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur A. Benson II, attorney for the plaintiff schoolchildren
in the school desegregation lawsuit, said he was especially
disappointed to see no increase in the number of third-graders
scoring at proficient or advanced levels. The district declared the
last school year the ``Year of the Reader'' and concentrated on the
lower grades in literacy initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the critical area where they were focusing the most
attention, there's a huge amount of work that remains to be done,''
Benson said. ``Very little progress is shown.''
</P>
<P>
   Benson said he also wanted to see the test results broken down
by race. Those figures were not available Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Dean Whipple has scheduled a court hearing
for January to determine whether the district will be freed from
the long-running desegregation lawsuit. His decision, in part, will
be based on whether the district is doing everything it can to
close the achievement gap between black and white students.
</P>
<P>
   Desegregation Monitoring Committee Chairman John Murphy said he
was encouraged by the slight progress among the lowest-performing
students but added there was much room for improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly am disappointed that there are not more kids at
the upper ranges, but by the same token I'm not discouraged by that
fact,'' Murphy said. ``Because I think that the system is just now
getting organized and getting ready to move in a positive
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said he also thought the recent appointment of
Superintendent Benjamin Demps Jr. would provide the district with
long-sought stability that could lead to steady improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not expecting miracles,'' Murphy said. ``We're expecting
modest growth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's still a lot of reason for optimism in Kansas
City,'' Murphy said. ``The fact that there wasn't a miraculous
turnaround in a given year should not be a factor that would add
pessimism in the community.''

FARMLAND PLANS TO KEEP KC BASE AFTER MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK DAVIS  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY _ Farmland Industries Inc. will take on a new name
and top officer but keep its headquarters in Kansas City under a
new agreement to merge March 1 with Minnesota-based Cenex Harvest
States Cooperatives.
</P>
<P>
   The farm cooperatives said Thursday that they would become
United Country Brands if their member-owners approve the merger in
a November vote. United Country Brands would be the country's
largest farmer-owned co-op and rank among the Fortune 100 largest
U.S. corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're delighted, obviously, with that news. Farmland's a great
asset to the city,'' said Joe Serviss, chief of staff to Kansas
City Mayor Kay Barnes, who was not available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The merger plan announced Thursday also calls for new top
executives to run the co-op. In May, Farmland and Cenex announced
their intention to merge but said their current top officers would
jointly run the merged co-op.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Harry Cleberg, Farmland's 61-year-old president and
chief executive officer, is to serve as an adviser and retire from
that job at the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   Under the previous plan, Cleberg was to serve as co-chief
executive with Noel Estenson, his counterpart at Cenex Harvest
States. Now Estenson, 61, also is to become an adviser to United
Country Brands and retire at the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Cleberg nor Estenson were available for comment
Thursday. Each would remain as head of his respective co-op until
the March 1 merger.
</P>
<P>
   On March 1, Bob Honse, Farmland's chief operating officer, is to
become chief executive officer of United Country Brands. The
agreement, however, calls for Honse, 56, to retire at the end of
2003.
</P>
<P>
   His successor would be John Johnson, currently president and
second in command at Cenex. Meantime, Johnson would be president of
United Country Brands under Honse.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Honse nor Johnson were available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement statement said Farmland's plans to build a new
headquarters near Kansas City International Airport ``played an
important role'' in choosing Kansas City as the merged co-op's
headquarters. Farmland broke ground in June on the first building
of a 122-acre headquarters campus. The co-op this summer won sales
and property tax breaks from the city on the $80 million office
building.
</P>
<P>
   Serviss said the tax agreement helped protect local employment
with Farmland.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Farmland proposal had jobs tied to the incentive,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Spokeswoman Sherlyn Manson said the building was intended to
consolidate area Farmland employees not working at the headquarters
on North Farmland Trafficway, a renamed stretch of North Oak
Trafficway. Farmland has sold the headquarters building, Manson
said, and is leasing it back. The buyer was Eagle Ridge Partners in
Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   United Country Brands' headquarters would be in the leased
building until the second phase of the Northland campus is
complete, Manson said.
</P>
<P>
   The merger is not expected to reduce employment in the Kansas
City area or in Inver Grove Heights, Minn., the home of Cenex, the
co-ops said. Nor do they expect many employee transfers.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the goals in this has been to minimize employee
relocations,'' Manson said.
</P>
<P>
   Such moves are disruptive to employees and expensive for the
company, she said. The merger is expected to save about $500
million over six years.
</P>
<P>
   Farmland has about 2,000 area employees among its 16,000 workers
worldwide. Cenex has 5,600 employees in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Although the merged co-op isn't to be called Farmland, shoppers
still will see Farmland brand bacon, hot dogs, hams other consumer
food products in grocery stores.
</P>
<P>
   Manson said the Farmland name came into use in 1966. Previously,
the co-op was called Consumers Cooperative Association, beginning
in 1935. It was formed in 1929 as the Union Oil Co., a small
petroleum co-op based in North Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   United Country Brands' livestock and refrigerated-foods
operations are to be based in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   The merged co-op would use the name Cenex//Ampride for its
energy operations and the name Harvest States for its grain
operations. Both operations are to be based in Inver Grove Heights.
</P>
<P>
   The co-ops haven't chosen a name or headquarters for the feed
operations. Nor have they chosen a name for the combined agronomy
operations, which are to be split between Kansas City and
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Farmland and Cenex agreed to merge their agronomy
operations with those of Land O'Lakes Inc. in a joint venture. Land
O'Lakes is a co-op based in Arden Hills, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   Manson said the name United Country Brands was chosen by an
internal committee. Farmland and Cenex had agreed early not to
adopt either co-op's name, or a melding of their names, for the
merged entity, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest part was finding a name that wasn't already
taken,'' Manson said.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement announced Thursday followed meetings this week in
Denver. Formal merger agreements are expected to be signed Sept.
22.
</P>
<P>
   The co-ops plan to hold information meetings next month and in
early November for their farmer, rancher and local co-op owners.
The owners will receive ballots in the mail to vote on the merger.
The ballots will be counted Nov. 23.

NATO'S FOCUS SHOULDN'T STRAY FROM RUSSIA, RETIRED ADMIRAL SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM PERRIN  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY _ The Cold War is over, but retired Adm. William
Crowe says he believes that NATO's focus shouldn't stray from
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   If the alliance ignores Russia, he said, it does so at its own
peril.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia will rejoin the ranks of world powers when it sorts
out,'' Crowe told reporters Thursday morning before a speech to
about 200 people at Johnson County Community College in Overland
Park, Kan. ``We should be concerned with how it sorts out.''
</P>
<P>
   Crowe, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 1985 to 1989
and ambassador to the United Kingdom from 1994 to 1997, was a
featured speaker at a conference commemorating NATO's 50th
birthday.
</P>
<P>
   The conference continues with events from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.
today in the Kansas Union at the University of Kansas, and from 8
a.m. to 4:45 p.m. Saturday in the Carlsen Center at JCCC. A
reception for participants is scheduled for 5:15 to 7 p.m. Saturday
at the Doubletree Hotel in Overland Park. Today's program is free,
but a registration fee is required for Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   While U.S.-Russian relations might be better now than during the
Cold War, Crowe is concerned what the future might hold, given
Russia's recent political and economic instability.
</P>
<P>
   While in the military, Crowe said, he gained a valuable window
on the Russian mindset through his friendship with the late Marshal
Sergei F. Akhromeyev, chief military adviser to former Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev.
</P>
<P>
   Conversations with Akhromeyev helped Crowe understand the depth
of the Kremlin's mistrust of the United States and NATO.
Akhromeyev, a man Crowe respected, called NATO ``the most offensive
alliance in world history.''
</P>
<P>
   The passing of communism hasn't caused Russian suspicions to
dissipate. Crowe said he believed that NATO's relationships with
Russia and China were damaged by the Kosovo airstrikes, emphasizing
that both countries have nuclear weapons pointed at the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   He half-jokingly referred to the so-called New World Order as
``long on new and short on order.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The disintegration of the Soviet empire was welcome, but it
has left the international world in a state of flux,'' Crowe said,
comparing the present time with the period that followed World War
II.
</P>
<P>
   Russia isn't pleased with this year's admission to NATO of
Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary _ all former Soviet allies.
Crowe said he believed that NATO should be cautious about adding
more members, assessing the effect it would have on the
organization and its relationship with Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Crowe also said he thought that NATO remained important to U.S.
interests because membership allows Americans a place at the table
to influence events in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   He was accompanied to the speech by his wife of 45 years,
Shirley. Both are Oklahoma natives and were hoping to stop there on
their way back home to Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Crowe, 74, said he makes about 25 speeches a year. He also
teaches a twice-weekly political science class at the U.S. Naval
Academy, his alma mater.
</P>
<P>
   Crowe has been retired from the military since 1989, but people
still address him with a courtesy title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind my first name of Bill, but I seem to be tagged
with Admiral,'' he said, smiling.

STATE SAYS SUNFLOWER CLEANUP WILL COST MUCH MORE THAN ESTIMATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GRACE HOBSON and JOHN L. PETTERSON  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY _ Kansas officials estimate the cost of cleaning up
environmental hazards at the Sunflower Army Ammunition Plant is two
to three times what Oz Entertainment Co. had planned to spend,
according to documents obtained Thursday by The Kansas City Star.
</P>
<P>
   The Oz company is negotiating to buy the dormant munitions plant
near De Soto, Kan., in exchange for cleaning it up. The company
plans to spend $32 million to $40 million on the cleanup, according
to an Oz feasibility study. The study said the company would spend
an additional $8.8 million to buy insurance to guarantee the
cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kansas Department of Health and Environment estimates
the cost of the cleanup, known as remediation, at $91 million to
$130 million.
</P>
<P>
   The state estimate was contained in a letter that Secretary
Clyde Graeber wrote Tuesday to Oz Chairman Robert Kory. Graeber's
letter was accompanied by an agency report on the cleanup costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we here at (the department) fully realize that these
figures and our methodology no doubt will be criticized, even if we
are just somewhat correct, the projections of the cost of
remediation are going to run a great deal more than your current
estimates,'' Graeber wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Oz spokesman David Westbrook said Thursday that Kory had not yet
seen the letter. Kory learned of the letter late Thursday
afternoon, Westbrook said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not alarmed,'' Westbrook said. ``Nor are we unmindful of
our need to work cooperatively with'' the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Oz and state environmental officials are negotiating a ``consent
order'' under which Oz would clean up the Sunflower site. An
agreement must be reached before the state allows Oz to take title
to the land.
</P>
<P>
   The consent order is part of the negotiations between Oz, the
state and the federal government. The state would take title to the
land and immediately transfer it to Oz with the condition that it
clean up the acreage.
</P>
<P>
   Oz plans a $761 million theme park and resort development at
Sunflower.
</P>
<P>
   What an increase in the cleanup costs would do to that plan is
unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to dispute or confirm the figures,'' Westbrook
said. ``We're going to collaborate, and if it is determined the
number is higher, that is a challenge we'll have to accept. It
would be premature for us to assume this is the precise number the
state is suggesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Randy Carlson, the environmental official who prepared the
estimate, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Graeber declined to discuss whether he had provided the Oz
developers with new cleanup cost estimates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really can't comment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Graeber said he probably wouldn't be able to comment until the
consent order was agreed to. That could take two to four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Graeber's agency refused to make public its letter to Kory.
</P>
<P>
   Board members of the Kansas Development Finance Authority, which
is handling the land transaction and is considering issuing
sales-tax bonds for the project, did not receive the letter.
</P>
<P>
   The board will meet today in Topeka to hear an Oz presentation
on the project. It does not plan to vote on any aspect of the
project.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Floyd, the chief counsel at the authority, said she had
seen the letter but had not given it to the board because the
environmental agency had asked that it not be made public. The
agency wanted to give Oz a chance to respond, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The new estimate ``does raise questions for all the parties in
the transaction that will have to be answered and resolved in some
manner,'' Floyd said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Page, the chairman of the authority's board, said Oz would
have to amend its project feasibility study, which was submitted to
the board recently.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the higher cleanup costs, Oz had counted on $25
million in tax abatements from the De Soto School District that it
later learned state law prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   Page also noted that the Johnson County Commission had had a
``less than lukewarm'' response to an Oz request for a property tax
abatement from the county.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those things are going to have to be factored in, because
neither (the abatements nor the new cleanup estimate) are factored
in there now,'' Page said.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Johnna Lingle said the Oz executives' ``cost
calculations are millions and millions off.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think they would rethink their options of whether or
not they want to continue with the possible development of a theme
park,'' Lingle said. ``I would if I were in their shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Westbrook said the new estimate did nothing to the company's
financial structure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't read Mr. Graeber's letter as an ultimatum,''
Westbrook said. ``We read it as a letter from a report of what his
staff has determined at this point. We're interested in making sure
we have a remediation plan that is responsible to the public and is
driven by standards that are set no higher nor lower than would be
applied to any other environmental issue in the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Graeber's letter included a report from Carlson listing major
differences between the Oz cleanup estimate and the agency's. Among
them:
</P>
<P>
   - A $7 million to $9 million difference in the cost to treat and
remove sludge in closing two wastewater treatment ponds.
</P>
<P>
   - A $9.5 million to $14.7 million difference in the cost for
potential groundwater cleanup in some areas.
</P>
<P>
   - $2 million to $3 million for the environmental agency's
oversight of the cleanup, which Oz did not include.
</P>
<P>
   - A $4 million to $6 million difference in the cost of drilling
new wells and the long-term monitoring of hazardous areas and
landfills.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I am sure these figures no doubt will be severely
criticized by your consultants,'' Graeber wrote, ``I feel getting
them to you could possibly help you in your future
considerations.''

   WASHINGTON _ on several fronts.
</P>
<P>
   House Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde, an Illinois Republican,
said he has drafted legislation for a special congressional
commission, but will stand down unless Danforth runs into problems
with his own probe. Another committee led by Republican Rep. Dan
Burton of Indiana has already issued subpoenas to the FBI and Texas
Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Dick Armey, a Texas Republican, said he
thought the other hearings could range further than Danforth's. ``I
want to know it all,'' he said, including why the FBI ``needed to
come to this area and investigate these people.'' The standoff
started after a botched raid by agents of the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms that led to a gunbattle.
</P>
<P>
   Orrin Hatch, Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, said Congress
should not defer to the executive branch in delving into Waco
because ``after all, Congress was misled by the executive branch.''
</P>
<P>
   Danforth left for Capitol Hill after his news conference to meet
with the leadership and several chairmen to outline his authority
and possibly calm the roiling political waters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not going to try and tell Congress what to do or what not
to do or what I think they should be doing,'' he said. ``I'm
certainly going to consult with them and talk to them and tell them
what I intend to do...and ask them if they have any information
that they think that we should be pursuing.''
</P>
<P>
   The 63-year-old Danforth, who serves as associate priest in the
St. Louis suburbs, said he had some qualms about taking the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a friend of mine said, this is not what you call a good
career move,'' he said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got out of government for the reason that I wanted to go
home and I wanted to be in the private sector, so this goes against
that. On the other hand, this is a really big thing, and I think
that it is very important to get answers to questions that are
important to the whole integrity of our government.''

DANFORTH SAYS WACO INQUIRY WILL FOCUS ON `BAD ACTS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Calling them ``the dark questions,'' former
Missouri Sen. Jack Danforth said Thursday that his job as the
special counsel for the Waco investigation will be to determine two
things:
</P>
<P>
   Did federal officials kill people?
</P>
<P>
   And did the government cover up?
</P>
<P>
   Those are the possible ``bad acts'' he will investigate and, if
necessary, prosecute. He added that his charter did not include
what he distinguished as ``bad judgment'' surrounding the 51-day
standoff in 1993 between the FBI and the Branch Davidian religious
group that left about 80 followers, including about 20 children,
dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our country can survive bad judgment,'' he said at a news
conference with Attorney General Janet Reno. ``But the thing that
really undermines the integrity of government is whether there were
bad acts...''
</P>
<P>
   Reno chose Danforth, an ordained Episcopal priest whose
reputation for evenhandedness has been praised by leaders in both
parties, to remove any taint of bias as the government looks into
recent revelations concerning Waco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have tried to find someone with impeccable credentials,
someone with bipartisan support in Washington who is widely
regarded throughout the country, someone who is independent and
someone who has the wisdom and determination to do the job the
right way,'' Reno said. ``I have found that person in Senator John
Danforth.''
</P>
<P>
   Danforth's first act after accepting the job was to name Edward
L. Dowd Jr., the U.S. attorney for the eastern district of
Missouri, as his deputy special counsel. Dowd expects to resign his
post to work with Danforth.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation stems from a storm of criticism as new
evidence has emerged that the FBI, contradicting six years of
denials, used incendiary devices when it tried to end the siege at
the Branch Davidian compound near Waco, Texas, on April 19, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   FBI videotapes, which were unavailable until recently, show that
two potentially incendiary tear gas canisters were fired near the
Branch Davidian compound several hours before the blaze broke out
that led to the deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI and Justice Department maintain that even with the new
information, no evidence exists that the canisters ignited the
fire. They say cult leader David Koresh and his followers were
responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, who testified six years ago that the FBI did not use
incendiary devices, has since said she was misled. But on
Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said the attorney
general should resign because of ``a pattern of not showing
competence or probity.''
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt said of the Republicans
on Thursday, ``I think it's wrong to be calling for the attorney
general's resignation. They seem to do this every other week.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno insisted Thursday that she would not resign. ``I don't run
from controversy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general recused herself from any overall
supervisory role of Danforth's work, instead naming Deputy Attorney
General Eric Holder because he was not involved in Waco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will obviously be a witness,'' she said. ``And I think it's
important that it be conducted without influence of those who have
been involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Danforth is expected also to question FBI Director Louis Freeh,
who said in a statement that he welcomed the selection.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth is in the odd position _ unlike other Justice
Department-appointed special counsels _ of not wanting to use FBI
agents as his chief investigatory tools. He said he hopes to draw
on other federal investigators and the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe the FBI should be investigating the FBI,''
Danforth said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has granted him broad authority for the Waco review,
including the power to subpoena witnesses and impanel a grand jury.
Under her order, he will investigate whether government employees
attempted to cover up events related to Waco through false or
misleading statements, or through the withholding or the
destruction of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   He also will look into whether federal agents' use of incendiary
or pyrotechnic devices could have caused the deadly fire at the
compound, whether they engaged in gunfire on the fatal day, or
whether U.S. armed forces were used illegally in connection with
the deaths of the cult members.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my job is to answer the dark questions,'' Danforth
said. ``How did the fire start? Were there shootings?''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his ability to oversee an independent inquiry,
Danforth said, ``I know I'll be given the independence because I
wouldn't have done this without it.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Danforth said his investigation would maintain a presence
in Washington, he said its headquarters would be in St. Louis,
where he returned after leaving the Senate in 1994. He is a partner
with the law firm of Bryan Cave, which also has offices in Kansas
City.
</P>
<P>
   He said he has no idea how long the investigation could take _
``I think it would be a mistake to set a fixed time limit'' _ but
expressed the hope that it would be completed by the end of next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth is expected to devote most of his time to the
investigation, while Dowd will be involved full time.
</P>
<P>
   Dowd comes from a political family; his father was Democratic
nominee for Missouri governor in 1972. President Clinton appointed
the younger Dowd to the U.S. attorney's post in 1993, on the
recommendation of Gephardt, a St. Louis Democrat. ``I think they've
found two outstanding people to do this,'' Gephardt said.
</P>
<P>
   Even as they begin to gear up the investigation, Danforth faces
competition from his former colleagues on Capitol Hill, who are
discussing Waco probes on several fronts. MORE

STUNNED JOCKEYS MOURN DEATH OF `A GOOD GUY'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Fixes sixth graph) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   POMONA, Calif. _ At the Los Angeles County Fairgrounds stables
early Thursday morning, J.C. Gonzalez gave Ricardo Jaime a racing
saddle, a !ital!bon voyage!off! gift to a younger man embarking on
a career as a jockey.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me, `Take care on this racetrack,''' Jaime said later,
gesturing toward the little five-eighths-mile oval that most of the
big-money riders avoid. `` `It's dangerous.'''
</P>
<P>
   A few hours after their conversation, in the fourth race of
opening day at Fairplex Park, Ricardo Jaime negotiated the sharp
turns safely and rode the first thoroughbred winner of his life.
</P>
<P>
   In the very next race, 30 minutes after that, J.C. Gonzalez fell
from a breaking-down front-runner, hit the ground head-first, was
trampled by trailing horses and died.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, with massive head injuries, didn't even make it to the
hospital. He was 23 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Jaime, a Mexican countryman of Gonzalez, rode the second-place
finisher in the fateful race, the fifth of the scheduled 12. He was
back in the jockeys' room by the time track workers walked in with
the first ominous reports.
</P>
<P>
   Standing outside that jockeys' room about an hour and a half
later, Jaime seemed composed if stunned by the sudden death of a
man he called ``a nice person.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the apprentice handled the tragedy better than
many of the veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Pedroza, a former Fairplex champion, dissolved in tears
against a chain-link fence.
</P>
<P>
   Vic Lipton, Gonzalez's agent, slumped on a bench, his face
flush, crying.
</P>
<P>
   Corey Black, a four-time leading Fairplex rider, walked away
with a barely audible word: ``Wow.''
</P>
<P>
   Other jockeys _ including Hall of Famer Chris McCarron, here
Thursday not to ride but to sign autographs _ spewed their emotion
at track officials, voicing long-standing complaints about the
Fairplex ambulance service (though nobody seemed to blame the
ambulance service for what happened to Gonzalez, who never had a
chance after such catastrophic injuries).
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Valenzuela walked out of the jockeys' room hollow-eyed,
moving ever so slowly, as if he didn't know where to go from here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been racing on a day when something like this
happened,'' Valenzuela said. ``I've never seen this kind of emotion
in a jockeys' room. Everybody broke down in tears.''
</P>
<P>
   The jockeys voted to cancel the rest of the day's races, out of
respect for Gonzalez and in recognition of their own shaken
psyches.
</P>
<P>
   J.C. Gonzalez wasn't a well-known jockey. He won all of 181
races in a three-year career, the highlight coming in 1998 at
Fairplex, where he was the champion rider, helped by the
apprentice's weight allowance.
</P>
<P>
   In the hour after his death, fellow jockeys admitted they knew
little about him, couldn't even agree on what the ``J.C.'' stood
for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juan Carlos,'' said his young friend, Ricardo Jaime.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' an agent said, ``Jose Carlos.''
</P>
<P>
   Jose it was.
</P>
<P>
   This is what they knew for sure about him. Beyond the fact it
could have been one of them.
</P>
<P>
   He was from Yahualica, Jalisco, Mexico. He would have turned 24
on Oct. 5. He rode his first winner at Los Alamitos Race Course in
Orange County in 1996. All of those things are in the media guides.
</P>
<P>
   He was single with no children. He'd been dating Elena Aquino,
daughter of Los Alamitos trainer Betsy Aquino. He'd been living in
Reseda when he wasn't off in Northern California or at Del Mar
pursuing the vagabond life of a journeyman jockey.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very quiet. He kept to his task,'' said agent Richie
Silverstein, who booked mounts for Gonzalez at Hollywood Park
earlier this year. ``He'd go to work at Santa Anita (in the morning
to exercise horses), then he'd go to Hollywood, then he'd drive to
Los Alamitos and qualify (quarterhorses).''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a happy kid, a good guy,'' Valenzuela said. ``Guys
respected him. He was really safe to ride with.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a very friendly young guy. Just a smiling person,''
Black said.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics on jockey deaths are as sketchy as the biographies of
some of the victims. On the Southern California thoroughbred
circuit _ Santa Anita, Hollywood Park, Del Mar, Fairplex _ they
used to happen about once a decade. Alvaro Pineda had been the last
local thoroughbred jockey to die in battle, slammed against the
then-lightly padded Santa Anita starting gate in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   The '80s went by without a fatality. The '90s too, almost.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess if you ride long enough, you're going to see something
like this,'' Black said.
</P>
<P>
   Fans saw Gonzalez and his horse go down on the far turn, and
they'd seen Danny Sorenson and his horse crash into them and fall.
But a hedge blocked the grandstand view of the scene.
</P>
<P>
   When the cancellation of seven races was announced at 3:25 p.m.,
nearly an hour after the accident, the horseplayers filed out in
silence, knowing something terrible had happened, unsure exactly
what and to whom. (Sorenson wasn't seriously hurt.)
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez's fellow jockeys weren't as lucky as the fans. They
knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in a spill with him two weeks ago at Del Mar,''
Valenzuela said. ``His horse broke a leg. It was almost the exact
same thing (as Thursday).
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing different was that we both came out of it OK.
We got up, hugged, and walked away.''
</P>

NFL CONSIDERS CARSON, HOLLYWOOD PARK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the Coliseum all but dead, NFL officials have
turned their attention to Carson and Hollywood Park as last-hope
sites for returning to Los Angeles, officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL expansion committee took no action when it met here
Thursday for an update on the alternative stadium sites in the Los
Angeles area.
</P>
<P>
   A day earlier Commissioner Paul Tagliabue and the co-chairs of
the committee met privately with officials from Carson, and they
have invited representatives of Carson, Hollywood Park and the
Coliseum to a meeting in New York next week for a final update
before the 31 team owners decided on a Los Angeles site _ or as
increasingly likely, award the new franchise to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with the Coliseum is the cost,'' Tagliabue said.
``When we undertook the approach to the Coliseum in April, we
recognized there would be substantial additional construction cost
because of the need to build a state-of-the-art stadium within the
historic elements of the Coliseum.''
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue said renovating the Coliseum could cost up to $100
million more than simply building a new stadium elsewhere, and
parking garages and new infrastructure could cost close to $200
million.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles has until Wednesday to complete an acceptable
stadium and financing plan for the 32nd franchise, or the league
has said it will be awarded to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The committee gave the Coliseum group four months to finalize
its expansion proposal, but after the NFL pledged $150 million
toward stadium renovation and the state said it would not offer any
public funding, the league withdrew the offer last month and said
it would explore other potential Los Angeles sites.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas has been promoting a Coliseum
tax-increment plan to help pay for the project, but has been unable
to win support from the city or state, leaving the Coliseum effort
stagnant and a belated expansion outsider.
</P>
<P>
   Carson previously proposed a stadium-mall complex that included
$180 million in bonds. Because of an abundance of land, no parking
garages would be necessary around its site.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue and expansion co-chairs Bob Kraft, the New England
Patriots owner, and Jerry Richardson, the Carolina Panthers owner,
met with Carson Councilman Daryl Sweeney and city manager Jerry
Groomes on Wednesday. Sweeney and Groomes were flying back to Los
Angeles Thursday and unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Groomes said last week, when NFL executives visited with
representatives of each of the four potential sites _ including
Anaheim, not considered as serious an expansion candidate _ that if
Carson had been given the same time as the Coliseum group, it would
have closed the deal by now.
</P>
<P>
   ``They basically got two months,'' Tagliabue said. ``That was
one of the points they made (Wednesday), and that was discussed
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Carson would prefer more time to complete its plan for a former
toxic dump site, which has led to speculation the committee might
extend its Sept. 15 deadline. The full NFL ownership is not
scheduled to meet until Oct. 6 in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NFL has been known to go into overtime, but certainly the
sentiment is to get it resolved on Oct. 6,'' Tagliabue said.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft said despite a consensus, the owners would prefer to make
their expansion decision at the October meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way everyone is thinking,'' Kraft said. ``People
have spent a lot of time on this. We'd like to see this end and let
us get on with our other business.''
</P>
<P>
   Some owners on the expansion committee had hoped to reach a
resolution on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty clear, there was no way that could happen
today,'' Kraft said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that surprised me today was, there were so many
divergent opinions. Hopefully the meeting on Monday will allow us
to zero in and clarify a number of issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue said Ridley-Thomas, potential Los Angeles franchise
owners Eli Broad-Ed Roski Jr., Michael Ovitz-Ron Burkle and Marvin
Davis _ who has an option on the Hollywood Park site _ have been
invited to New York on Monday to give a final update to Tagliabue,
Kraft and Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood Park previously prepared a stadium plan for the
Raiders, while they still played at the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue denied speculation the league would award a team to
Houston on Oct. 6 without indicating whether it would be an
expansion team or a relocated team, as it did in Cleveland, giving
Los Angeles a final opportunity to capture the new franchise.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner refused to speculate which expansion site had
made the most progress heading into the deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like announcing the Indianapolis 500,'' he said.
``Different people have different perspectives. It's a business
judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone recognizes this is a critically important decision.
There are two very important markets. And this is the last
expansion team we're going to have for quite awhile.''

EX-DODGERS BEAT CURRENT ONES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(OPTIONAL: Adds quotes, details) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sixteen months ago the new regime put its stamp on
the Los Angeles Dodgers' organization by trading away perhaps the
best offensive catcher to play the game since ... it was invented.
</P>
<P>
   As much as Pedro Martinez being dealt for Delino DeShields, the
Dodgers' willingness to part with Mike Piazza has been blamed for
the demise of the franchise under Fox's guidance.
</P>
<P>
   Public perception remains that the day the Dodgers traded Mike
Piazza was the day the organization went south.
</P>
<P>
   More than half the 33,954 at Dodger Stadium served another
reminder. They cheered Piazza wildly when he crushed a two-run
homer off Kevin Brown in the sixth inning to help the New York Mets
to a 3-1 win over the hometown Dodgers on Thursday in the opener of
a four-game series.
</P>
<P>
   It was Piazza's 34th homer. He has 106 RBI. Both would lead the
Dodgers. He entered the night hitting .316, which would be second
among Dodgers regulars.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a tremendous honor,'' Piazza said of the vociferous
response from the crowd. ``It's awesome. I was in awe. It's nice to
know they appreciate the effort you made when you were here, and to
me, that's very emotional.''
</P>
<P>
   In a season that seems to never end but always get worse,
watching Piazza deliver a clutch hit in the midst of a pennant race
in his old stomping grounds isn't exactly what the Dodgers had in
mind.
</P>
<P>
   Watching him do it off the $105 million man, who last lost July
5, only drives home the point of what type of season it's been.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that onetime Dodgers ace Orel Hershiser pitching eight
innings of one-run ball for the Mets and the pain increases. He
allowed two hits, struck out one and didn't walk a batter.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and just to rub a shaker full of salt into any wounds the
Dodgers may be licking, Roger Cedeno _ whom the Dodgers traded
during the offseason along with Gold Glove catcher Charles Johnson
for catcher Todd Hundley _ robbed Gary Sheffield of a
seventh-inning homer with a leaping catch above the right-field
wall. It was the 10th out in a string of 15 straight that Hershiser
(13-10) recorded before leaving after the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The battle was to concentrate on the right things, pitch
execution, not facing Kevin Brown in your old stomping grounds on a
beautiful L.A. night,'' Hershiser said. ``The fight was to stay
focused on the job and not the deja vu. I figured I was going out
there against the best guy in baseball. I have to give up two or
less runs to win.''
</P>
<P>
   To finish off the evening, the Mets went to newly anointed
closer Armando Benitez. He pitched the ninth for his 19th save. And
to round out just what type of hand the Dodgers had on both sides
in this defeat, Benitez was acquired from Baltimore for Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always nice to come back, but reality hits you when Kevin
Brown throws one 94 mph right past you,'' said Piazza, who struck
out twice and grounded out. ``Then, forget about reflecting.''
</P>
<P>
   The only leftover from the Piazza-to-Florida deal for the
Dodgers is Sheffield, who, of course, was overshadowed. Sheffield
hit his 24th homer of the season with two outs in the first to give
the Dodgers a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, that's been enough for Brown, but this time it didn't
hold. Brown last lost more than two months ago and he was coming
off back-to-back complete games in which he allowed one run.
</P>
<P>
   Not only had Brown won seven straight decisions to make a 20-win
season again possible, but the Dodgers had won eight of his last 10
starts.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Brown (16-7) was 6-0 with a 1.68 ERA in his past nine
starts, punctuated by his two-hit shutout of Chicago in his last
start.
</P>
<P>
   This one was going that way as well, until John Olerud reached
on Mark Grudzielanek's error and Piazza followed by drilling a
fastball into the left-field bleachers to give the Mets a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made that one little error and (Brown) threw that one a
little too good to Piazza and he crushed it,'' Dodgers manager
Davey Johnson said. ``He just made it too good. That's where the
big guy likes it.''

FINAL COMEBACK BELONGS TO BYU 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TED MILLER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVO, Utah _ Improbable is the only way to describe Brigham
Young's season-opening, 35-28 victory over Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Cougars thoroughly dominated the Huskies Thursday night at
Cougar Stadium, yet found themselves staring a one-point deficit
with time ticking away.
</P>
<P>
   Facing fourth-and-10 from their own 42-yard line with 1:50 left,
the Cougars converted to keep a desperation drive alive.
</P>
<P>
   Then BYU quarterback Kevin Feterik, who was in danger of
transforming from hero to goat because his interception led to the
Huskies' go-ahead score with less than six minutes remaining, found
Chris Hale for a 38-yard touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Hale, a freshman from just down the road in Orem, used his first
career reception to give the Cougars a heart-stopping victory.
</P>
<P>
   You want improbable? How often do BYU fans celebrate when their
team goes to Hale?
</P>
<P>
   And it wasn't over until a Marques Tuiasosopo pass sailed over
BYU's end zone as the clock hit zero.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no consolation in losing,'' Rick Neuheisel said after
his first game as Washington's head coach. ``But everyone fought.''
</P>
<P>
   The 65,726 fans, many garbed in new Cougar dark blue, didn't
expect a tension-packed conclusion. After all, Feterik, who
completed 39 of 59 passes for 500 yards and three touchdowns, and
his passing attack were running up and down the field on a
beleaguered UW defense, while the Husky offense floundered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a hunch we would make it,'' BYU head coach LaVell
Edwards said. ``It's been a while since we threw the ball that
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Feterik's 500 passing yards were the most ever registered
against Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Feterik executed the BYU game plan with uncanny precision. When
the Huskies dropped as many as seven defensive backs into coverage,
he settled into the pocket and patiently waited until a receiver
found a gap. When the Huskies blitzed, he quickly dumped the ball
to receivers benefiting from 10-yard coverage cushions or
orchestrated screen passes to his running backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we got pressure, he got it off,'' Neuheisel said.
``And it seemed like they caught everything that was thrown.''
</P>
<P>
   Margin Hooks did. He caught eight passes for 141 yards, leading
the 12 Cougars who caught passes.
</P>
<P>
   When BYU's lead swelled to 20-7 after the Cougars took the
second-half kickoff 80 yards in 12 plays for a score, it looked
like a blowout was at hand.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the Cougars had out-gained the Huskies 375 yards to 80.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuiasosopo, who ran for two touchdowns and threw for
another, rallied the Huskies. He completed 22 of 36 passes for 237
yards, including a 35-yard touchdown to Todd Elstrom. He ran 13
times for 35 yards, which led the Huskies' feeble ground game.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Tuiasosopo) emerged in the second half,'' Neuheisel said.
``In the second half, he showed why he's going to be one of the
better quarterbacks in the country _ hopefully sooner rather than
later.''
</P>
<P>
   Momentum turned to the Huskies after BYU, holding a 27-14 lead,
fumbled on the UW 12-yard line with 12:25 remaining in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies _ who didn't reach BYU territory until midway
through the third quarter _ rolled down the field. Tuiasosopo faked
a dive and ran a bootleg to his right for a 5-yard score.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the Huskies were within 27-21.
</P>
<P>
   Up to that point, Feterik had been almost perfect. But on the
ensuing drive, Anthony Vontoure snagged an errant pass and
scampered 26 yards to BYU's 11 as a stunned crowd looked on. Four
plays later, on fourth-and-2 from the BYU 3-yard line, another
Tuiasosopo keeper put the Huskies ahead.
</P>
<P>
   For the game, BYU outgained Washington 575 yards to 323.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's defense, which yielded the most passing yards in
the Pac-10 last season, is off to an inauspicious start. It
registered only two sacks on the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get to the quarterback more,'' defensive end Mac
Tuiaea said. ``That's something we've got to concentrate on.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies struck first, but not with their offense. Ben
Mahdavi, the Huskies' long snapper on punts, recovered a muffed
punt in the end zone to make it 7-0.
</P>
<P>
   That and Ryan Fleming's 73-yard punt in the second quarter,
which tied a school record, were the Huskies' only highlights, and
the 13-7 halftime score was not indicative how much the Cougars had
dominated. For one, BYU missed two field goals and an extra point.
More telling: BYU outgained the Huskies 295 yards to 80.

UW COMEBACK HELPS RESTORE PURPLE PRIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVO, Utah _ More than an hour after the Huskies had lit up the
Wasatch Mountains backdrop with some improbable fireworks, Keith
Gilbertson was on a slow shuffle to the team bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been around some teams who would have packed it in,''
said Washington's assistant head coach and a longtime figure around
Pac-10 football. ``I can't wait to coach these guys tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilbertson didn't look excited, because Washington had lost a
35-28 fire drill of a game to the Brigham Young University
Sub-Orbital Circus. But as a coach well experienced in fetching the
good from the bad, Gilbertson had to be thrilled.
</P>
<P>
   For 2{ quarters, the Huskies couldn't have been deader if they
had drank the entire Great Salt Lake. Inept offensively and stunned
defensively, Washington was down 20-7 in a game far more distant
than the ledger.
</P>
<P>
   Then, giving a more positive spin to the phrase Slick Rick,
Washington went deep on offense and got a little smarter on
defense. Thirteen minutes and 21 points later, the Huskies were up
28-27 and the faces of 65,726 Cougar Stadium fans couldn't have
been longer if they had found coffee in their tap water.
</P>
<P>
   Although the lead failed to hold, and no coaches ever admit to
taking moral victories, the Huskies nevertheless accomplished in
less than an hour what the last nine months of controversy and
convulsiveness had been about _ a regaining of respectability.
</P>
<P>
   Washington won't be a great team this year, probably not a bowl
team, but if this under-aged and under-talented team can
consistently muster the gumption it showed Thursday night, well,
pride and amusement will go for the ride along with respectability.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Neuheisel's UW debut was going sideways about half-a-dozen
different times until the light bulb went on halfway though the
third quarter. Until then, Washington hadn't even been in BYU
territory, giving the cable-TV nation the impression it was
watching replays of last year's Husky games against Nebraska and
Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game was getting too late for ball possession offense,''
said Gilbertson. ``We realized we had been getting pretty decent
protection (for quarterback Marques Tuiasosopo), so we decided what
the heck, let's throw the ball up the field.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first half, Washington's tiptoe offense was on the field
for just 23 plays, good for 80 yards. Tuiasosopo, inheriting the
starter's job and captaincy from Brock Huard, was quick to take
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``At halftime I thought, `I can't do this this. The team is
working too hard for me not to be on my game.'
</P>
<P>
   ``We were putting too much pressure on our defense. It was time
to step up and and time to do it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the statistical domination, BYU left an opening for
Tuiasosopo because it had missed two field goals in the first half,
had a PAT blocked and butchered clock management on another drive.
</P>
<P>
   So when the Husky QB, on third-and-18 at his own 12-yard line,
threw upfield hard, he found Dane Looker for a 29-yard completion.
</P>
<P>
   Game on. Five plays later, it was 20-14.
</P>
<P>
   The UW defense, shredded by far lesser passing attacks last
season, appeared on the verge of coming apart against senior Kevin
Feterik, whom they dominated a year ago in Husky Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps recalling the nightmare of last season when they had
trouble defending a stationary goalpost, Husky pass defenders
played so far off the BYU receivers that there was some question
whether they would make the Washington plane after the game.
</P>
<P>
   The entire defense seemed at times baffled by BYU's short
passing game. Almost every BYU screen pass seemed to catch the
Huskies in a blitz, making one wonder if the temple-topping trumpet
of Angel Moroni was actually a listening device for the Husky
defensive huddle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to get the corners up on them,'' said Neuheisel of the
second-half defensive changes. ``They were picking us apart up
front.''
</P>
<P>
   After surrendering another touchdown for a 27-14 deficit
entering the fourth quarter, the defense came up with a fumble and
an interception on consecutive BYU possessions. Tuiasosopo drove
the team to touchdown drives that ended with his short scoring
runs.
</P>
<P>
   It was 28-27 with 5:04 left and no matter what happened
thereafter, some purple pride was back.
</P>
<P>
   After Feterik put up the last of his remarkable 500 yards with a
38-yard touchdown heave for what proved to be the game-winner,
Tuiasosopo had 1:16 to perpetrate a final miracle. The fact it
ended 11 yards short, his final pass blowing through the end zone
at 00:00, was the least noteworthy development of a sterling
recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't find a lane,'' Tuiasosopo lamented. ``I scrambled
to my right to buy time. I saw Jerramy (Stevens, the tight end),
but I didn't give him a chance because I threw it out of the end
zone.''
</P>
<P>
   For the million-dollar coach, it wasn't a million-dollar game.
But Neuheisel and the Huskies made a very respectable down payment
on the new regime.

BATTERED HUSKIES RESPOND TO NEUHEISEL'S CHARGE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVO, Utah _ Rick Neuheisel waxed sentimental after his first
game as Washington's head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of things have happened since I arrived in January,'' he
said. ``A lot was said that was more than deserved, some of it
good, some of it not so good. I was anxious to get out there ... to
let the kids know I'm in the trenches with them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies' 35-28 defeat could have been much worse. Early in
the second half, it looked like a potential blowout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I implored the guys to keep believing and to find a way
because you never know,'' Neuheisel said.
</P>
<P>
   The comeback fell short. But Neuheisel tried to put a positive
spin on it to his dispirited crew.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is hope and a lot of it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   NO RUN: Starting tailback Willie Hurst gained 17 yards on eight
carries; Braxton Cleman had 21 yards on two carries; and Paul
Arnold had 10 yards on two carries. With Tuiasosopo's team-high 35
yards on 13 carries, the Huskies gained 86 yards and averaged 3.1
per carry _ even worse than they did last year when they finished
sixth in the Pac-10 with 136.5 yards per game (3.8 average).
</P>
<P>
   PASS ON DEFENSE: Last year UW's pass defense yielded nearly
3,000 yards, worst in the Pac-10. Quarterbacks Jonathan Smith of
Oregon State and Akili Smith of Oregon produced the two biggest
passing performances against the Huskies when they threw for 469
and 442 yards, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   BYU quarterback Kevin Feterik rewrote the record book on that.
He threw for 500 yards and set new standards for completions (39)
and attempts (59).
</P>
<P>
   NOTES: You know it's been a long night when one of the players
of the game is the punter. Ryan Fleming boomed several spirals, the
best of which put him in the Husky record book. His second-quarter
punt of 73 yards tied Don Feleay, who rocketed his 73-yarder
against Navy in 1975. Fleming also saved the Huskies early,
corraling a high snap and getting his kick away, pinning BYU inside
the 20-yard line. Fleming punted five times for a 51.4-yard
average. ... Mercer Island graduates figured into the action for
both teams. For Washington, freshman Ben Mahdavi recovered a muffed
punt in the end zone to give the Huskies an early 7-0 lead. ``I
didn't know what to do,'' Mahdavi said. ``I was kind of confused. I
didn't hear the whistle so I jumped on the ball.'' The ball
ricocheted off BYU returner Heshi Robertson. For BYU, former
Islander Owen Pochman blew both of his field-goal attempts but
prevented Joe Jarzynka and Harris from returning any kickoffs by
hitting every one of them into or through the end zone.

<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKBRIDGE, Mass. _ It's very much a New England story. A
folksy American success story.
</P>
<P>
   A simple story, really, starting with a simple idea: Sell
unbleached cotton muslin ruffled curtains through the mail. Market
them by placing handwritten and handdrawn ads in local newspapers
and national magazines. Distribute them by wrapping them on the
dining room table, loading them into the family station wagon and
mailing them at the local post office.
</P>
<P>
   The year was 1956. The dining room belonged to Jane and Jack
Fitzpatrick. The post office was in Whitman. And the business was
the nation's first mail-order curtain company _ Country Curtains.
</P>
<P>
   Today, this former mom-and-pop company is based in picturesque
Norman Rockwell country and has grown into a multimillion-dollar
catalog business with 21 retail stores. The inventory has grown far
larger than the initial muslin curtains to include all types of
curtains and fabrics, top treatments, shades, sheers, lots of lace,
matching shower curtains, bed covers, canopy covers, dust ruffles,
and rods and home accessories. The catalog, too, has matured from a
flier to a booklet of sketches to a 68-page, four-color book with a
circulation in the millions. And unlike other wildly successful but
small entrepreneurial businesses, Country Curtains remains in the
hands of its founders.
</P>
<P>
   The leadership mantle has been passed to daughter Nancy
Fitzpatrick. But the driving force behind the company, the
implementor extraordinaire of her husband's ideas, remains very
much a presence. Jane Fitzpatrick may have slowed down since her
hip operations four years ago but her impeccable taste and style,
her no-nonsense, tell-it-like-it-is way of doing business is set in
concrete. Employees still quake when ``Mrs. Fitz'' rounds the
corner, but they stay on year after year because they know she
knows what she's doing, plays fair, and is generous. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Vision and energy &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Country Curtains may have been her husband's idea and he may
have been the stabilizing rudder on an ever-expanding ship, but
it's been Jane's vision and energy that kept the business afloat
and also turned two ramshackle buildings _ the 100-room Red Lion
Inn and Blantyre, a Tudor-style mansion built in 1902 _ into
moneymaking, internationally known hotels. Blantyre is a member of
Relais &AMP; Chateaux, the prestigious and selective worldwide hotel
association.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother may say she is not that involved anymore,'' says
Nancy Fitzpatrick, 52, during lunch in the courtyard of the Red
Lion Inn. ``But she still has the last word on major decisions.
She's relatively reasonable on the little things,'' she says with a
smile. ``But when it comes to a merger or acquisition or what
curtains to hang in the lobby of the inn, she has the last say.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, mother and daughter are working soul mates. There's one
other Fitzpatrick offspring, Ann Brown, but she lives in Manhattan
with a second home here in the Berkshires and is not involved in
day-to-day operations. Her major contribution was to Blantyre. She
did extensive research on Scottish manor houses, helped her mother
purchase antiques and accessories for the 1902 Tudor-style mansion
with turrets, carved friezes, and stone gargoyles, and created an
atmosphere of quiet yet sumptuous European elegance on 85 exquisite
acres. Today Ann buys the gifts and accessories for the catalog and
Country Curtains stores, the first of which opened in 1979 in
Salem.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother is detail-oriented and my father always had the good
sense to let her do what she had to do,'' says Nancy, who is as
outspoken, blunt, and forceful as her mother, although her friends
say she would bristle at such a comparison. ``He was the one who
was good at dreaming up projects. My mother was the one to
implement them. And he had great ideas, huge ideas, and Mum made
them happen. My dad retired in 1996 and sold his share of stock to
employees, so there's stock now that's not in our control, that's
not ours to sell.''
</P>
<P>
   The family also owns the Elm Street Market in Stockbridge,
Housatonic Curtains and Jacks Grill &AMP; Restaurant in Housatonic, and
an interest in Evviva, a women's clothing store in Lenox. Evviva
was Nancy's idea. She was tired of traveling to New York and Boston
for stylish clothes, so she found a partner and opened this upscale
shop. The family employs about 1,200 people, with between 700 and
800 working directly for Country Curtains. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Patron of the arts &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the indefatigable Jane devoted considerable time
to the arts. She was elected to the board of overseers of the
Boston Symphony Orchestra in 1978 and then served 14 years as a
trustee. ``I was the only trustee from this area for years; I felt
like the unofficial hostess of Tanglewood, especially when the
other board members came out,'' says Jane.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, she stepped down after 22 years as president of the
board of the Berkshire Theater Festival. Again she felt relief _
free of the obligation of attending every performance, although she
had seen ``Moby Dick-Rehearsed'' the night prior to this interview.
She called the performance astounding but wouldn't say whether it
was a good or bad kind of astounding.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't hold back when the subject turns to Seiji Ozawa.
``I'm a big Seiji fan,'' says Jane. ``I'm sorry he's leaving but I
understand why. I only hope we can find a replacement who is as
open a person and as fine a musician.''
</P>
<P>
   She says the conductor at her first BSO performance was a ``kid
named Leonard Bernstein,'' and she became hooked on the Symphony
from the start. Nancy has carried on this interest along with the
awareness that the arts are an economic staple in the Berkshires.
Nancy is not only a trustee of the BSO but also of the Mass MOCA
Foundation and Interlaken School of Art and a member of the
Massachusetts Cultural Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up with Tanglewood and became a lot more involved with
the BSO when Mom retired,'' says Nancy, who has a son by her first
marriage and is presently married to Lincoln Russell, a
photographer whom she met on a BSO concert tour. ``The Symphony has
such an impact out here because it's such a little town. It's also
a more intimate experience here compared to Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   Jane's initial lack of musical sophistication came from growing
up in a small town in Vermont, Cuttingsville, and attending a
one-room schoolhouse. Jack was far more sophisticated, having spent
several years as a child in Rome, where his mother was studying
voice. Then he returned to Vermont and went to high school with
Jane. They had their first date on her 15th birthday and married in
1944. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Hooked on curtains &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After Jack's discharge from the Army, he completed his college
education at Middlebury and then entered Boston University Law
School. His first job after graduation was at Lincoln Stores, a
regional dry goods department store chain. Watching how well
curtains were selling in the stores, he conceived of selling plain
muslin curtains (which Jane had put up in their living room) by
mail out of their home in Whitman. In 1958 Jack was transferred to
Pittsfield and moved his family to Stockbridge. A year later he
quit his job and devoted himself full time to Country Curtains. The
couple eventually moved the business out of their home and into a
building down the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all very simple,'' says Jane. ``People would send us
the money; we would send them the merchandise. I loved it all from
the very beginning, even when I didn't have a typewriter and was
doing everything by hand. I did know a little about numbers because
I'd worked in the accounting department of an Army Air Force
storage depot during the war.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, the couple and their two daughters, then 14 and 11,
spent the year in Europe, leaving Country Curtains in the capable
hands of Jane's sister, Zoa Campetti, who remained a key manager
until her death in 1996. They rented a chalet in Switzerland, and
the girls went to an American school while Jane and Jack traveled
throughout continental Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was there that my mother learned about hotels,''
says Nancy. ``She came back to the States able to visualize what
makes a place hospitable and charming. She parlayed all she'd
learned into the flower boxes here at the Red Lion, the details in
the rooms, and introduced outdoor dining when no one was eating
alfresco _ yet.
</P>
<P>
   The Fitzpatricks bought the inn in 1968 _ saving it from
demolition and giving Jane new challenges. It didn't show a profit
for seven years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never worried about it,'' says Jane, picking at her fruit
salad plate, a plate she thinks is too small for the amount being
served. ``I knew we were doing the best job we could, so why worry?
And the curtain business was carrying us. My husband did worry.
He's got a short fuse but that's offset by a great Irish wit.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Mill on the Housatonic &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The next company purchase, in 1976, was an old textile mill on
the Housatonic River. The Fitzpatricks restored the mill and
created the Housatonic Curtain Co. where 40 to 50 percent of their
curtains are made. They also employ 25 home stitchers, who sew the
edgings and fringes on curtains. The biggest challenge facing Nancy
is the new way of doing business _ maintaining their Web site,
filling e-mail orders, and bar coding their inventory at the
stores. She also keeps an eye on the competition, the bigggest of
which is J. C. Penney.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, they bought Blantyre and in 1994 opened Jacks Grill.
Jacks serves old-timey food that appeals to Jack's palate _ pot
roast, spaghetti, Jello and chocolate pudding. It's a popular stop
for bus-traveling elders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The food here at the inn can be a little pretentious,'' says
Jane. ``I don't much like my food stacked like a steeple on my
plate.''

   EAST TIMOR
</P>
<P>
   Appears certain to top a crowded security agenda at APEC.
Hundreds have been killed and more than 200,000 left homeless by
bloodshed since Timor's 900,000 residents voted overwhelmingly for
independence from Indonesia in a U.N.-sponsored referendum August
30. Indonesia invaded the former Portuguese colony in 1975, in a
takeover never endorsed by the United Nations. An estimated 200,000
people have been killed there since then, as part of Jakarta's
iron-fisted attempts to thwart secessionist movements. With more
than 200 million people, Indonesia is the world's fourth most
populous nation. Elements within its government and military fear
that independence for East Timor could lead to an unraveling of the
country, a collection of hundreds of islands and disparate groups
speaking more than 100 distinct languages.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-TAIWAN
</P>
<P>
   Relations have been tense ever since Mao Zedong's Communists won
a civil war over Nationalists and founded the People's Republic of
China in 1949. The Nationalists retreated to Taiwan, at that time a
province of China, and set up their own government in Taipei.
Beijing still claims Taiwan as part of China. Though it prefers a
peaceful evolution toward reunification, Beijing also asserts the
right to use force, if necessary, to bring the island under its
control. Taipei conducts itself, however, as if it were a sovereign
state. The on-again, off-again nature of relations between the two
entities got prickly in July, after Taiwan's President Lee Tung Hui
characterized Beijing-Taipei ties as ``special state-to-state
relations.'' That smacked of a declaration of independence and set
off alarm bells in Beijing, which promptly denounced the remarks as
``a dangerous step.'' Beijing began flying increasingly aggressive
fighter-jet missions testing Taiwan's air space. That resulted in
several near-dogfights and sowed fears that a miscalculation by one
side or another could spark a war. Tempers have moderated but
analysts remain watchful, particularly in the lead-up to Beijing's
plans for a festive 50th anniversary celebration Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   NORTH KOREA
</P>
<P>
   Divided North and South during the dawn of the Cold War, the
Korean Peninsula remains one of the most tense pieces of real
estate on Earth. Some one million combat-ready troops _ North
Koreans faced off against South Koreans and Americans _ are arrayed
within 60 miles of the craggy border dividing the two countries,
the badly failing communist North and the prospering, Democratic
capitalist South. The two countries remain technically at war 46
years after a cease-fire halted fighting in a three-year conflict
that killed nearly two million people _ 37,000 of them Americans.
The United States suspects the North of building at least one
nuclear weapon. U.S. diplomats have worked in recent weeks to try
to defuse tensions after the North _ which a year ago fired a
three-stage test rocket over Japanese air space _ threatened to
test a missile capable of reaching the western United States. On
the eve of last week's U.S.-North Korean talks in Berlin, Pyongyang
loosed another zinger: unilaterally declaring that its territorial
waters extended some 35 miles southward, into South Korea's own
seas, and threatening to fire on any South Korean vessel that
violates the North's dictate. The issue sparked a Naval battle in
June, when North Korean warships repeatedly tested South Korean
waters. The two navies finally exchanged gunfire in a skirmish that
ended with the sinking of a North Korean torpedo boat and the
reported loss of about 30 North Korean sailors.
</P>
<P>
   INDIA-PAKISTAN
</P>
<P>
   Centuries of Muslim-Hindu rivalry came to a boil in 1947, when
India won its independence from Britain. The former colony was
partitioned into India, predominantly Hindu, and Pakistan,
predominantly Muslim. The province of Kashmir, along the southern
rim of the Himalayas, got caught in the middle. Though the region
is predominantly Muslim, Kashmir's Hindu Maharaja, or prince, chose
in 1947 to place Kashmir under Indian control. Pakistan contends
that the Kashmiri people have a right to vote on whether to be part
of Pakistan, India or fully independent. Such a referendum has been
endorsed by past governments of India as well as the United
Nations. The two countries have fought wars over Kashmir, in 1947
and again in 1965. Indian control over the region has been fraught
with accusations of decades of human rights abuses. Last spring the
issue erupted again. Pakistan, claiming provocations, attacked
India, sparking a counterattack, in fighting that left more than
1,000 dead on both sides. Frequent shelling by both sides
continues. The nightmare scenario for strategists is all-out war
between the two countries, both of which tested nuclear weapons, in
defiance of U.S. appeals, in May 1998.

   BEIJING _ One of the world's longest-running diplomatic
melodramas, China's pursuit of membership in the World Trade

<P>
   But for the next 5 to 10 years, Chinese businessmen also want to

agriculture from investment by foreign capitalists. That's why
China insisted this month that it must be admitted to the WTO as a
``developing'' nation, just as it did when it first sought

</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese market would not open up in a day and China would
not move with alarming speed to an entirely free market,'' the
chief Chinese negotiator, Vice Trade Minister Long Yongtu, has
assured Chinese businessmen.
</P>
<P>
   The expected Clinton-Jiang talks on China's WTO status could of
course, go nowhere or even fail to materialize. The United States,
after all, is just as concerned with China's current tensions with
Taiwan, restoring relations disrupted by the May 7 embassy bombing
and Beijing's suspension of human rights, military and security
contacts with Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But since China began experimenting with an ``open door'' trade
policy in the mid-1980s, almost every major trading country _
including the United States _ has wanted to include China in the
WTO, the body that is the world's traffic cop and rule-setter on
exports and imports.
</P>
<P>
   But China's application needs the approval of all 134 member
nations and regions that make up the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the 1989 Tiananmen Square uprising, something has
always popped up at the last minute to block China's admission.
This spring, the accidental American bombing of the Chinese embassy
in Belgrade during the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia caused China to
break off expert-level talks with the United States on the issue
for five months.
</P>
<P>
   While American businesses are cheerleading for China's
admission, Clinton must face the political realities of an
anti-China bias in the run-up to the next presidential election.
The Democrats risk continued bashing by Republicans _ on
allegations of Chinese government spying and illegal political
contributions _ if China gains entry to the WTO on what look like
too-favorable terms.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Jiang cannot come home with an agreement that
looks like a cave-in to America. Especially now, on the eve of the
50th anniversary of the communist revolution on Oct. 1, he cannot
afford the appearance that Chinese pride and power have been
punctured.
</P>
<P>
   That's why his foreign affairs spokesman Zhu Bangzao said this
month, ``China will never sacrifice national interests for WTO
membership.''

   EAST TIMOR
</P>
<P>
   Appears certain to top a crowded security agenda at APEC.
Hundreds have been killed and more than 200,000 left homeless by
bloodshed since Timor's 900,000 residents voted overwhelmingly for
independence from Indonesia in a U.N.-sponsored referendum August
30. Indonesia invaded the former Portuguese colony in 1975, in a
takeover never endorsed by the United Nations. An estimated 200,000
people have been killed there since then, as part of Jakarta's
iron-fisted attempts to thwart secessionist movements. With more
than 200 million people, Indonesia is the world's fourth most
populous nation. Elements within its government and military fear
that independence for East Timor could lead to an unraveling of the
country, a collection of hundreds of islands and disparate groups
speaking more than 100 distinct languages.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-TAIWAN
</P>
<P>
   Relations have been tense ever since Mao Zedong's Communists won
a civil war over Nationalists and founded the People's Republic of
China in 1949. The Nationalists retreated to Taiwan, at that time a
province of China, and set up their own government in Taipei.
Beijing still claims Taiwan as part of China. Though it prefers a
peaceful evolution toward reunification, Beijing also asserts the
right to use force, if necessary, to bring the island under its
control. Taipei conducts itself, however, as if it were a sovereign
state. The on-again, off-again nature of relations between the two
entities got prickly in July, after Taiwan's President Lee Tung Hui
characterized Beijing-Taipei ties as ``special state-to-state
relations.'' That smacked of a declaration of independence and set
off alarm bells in Beijing, which promptly denounced the remarks as
``a dangerous step.'' Beijing began flying increasingly aggressive
fighter-jet missions testing Taiwan's air space. That resulted in
several near-dogfights and sowed fears that a miscalculation by one
side or another could spark a war. Tempers have moderated but
analysts remain watchful, particularly in the lead-up to Beijing's
plans for a festive 50th anniversary celebration Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   NORTH KOREA
</P>
<P>
   Divided North and South during the dawn of the Cold War, the
Korean Peninsula remains one of the most tense pieces of real
estate on Earth. Some one million combat-ready troops _ North
Koreans faced off against South Koreans and Americans _ are arrayed
within 60 miles of the craggy border dividing the two countries,
the badly failing communist North and the prospering, Democratic
capitalist South. The two countries remain technically at war 46
years after a cease-fire halted fighting in a three-year conflict
that killed nearly two million people _ 37,000 of them Americans.
The United States suspects the North of building at least one
nuclear weapon. U.S. diplomats have worked in recent weeks to try
to defuse tensions after the North _ which a year ago fired a
three-stage test rocket over Japanese air space _ threatened to
test a missile capable of reaching the western United States. On
the eve of last week's U.S.-North Korean talks in Berlin, Pyongyang
loosed another zinger: unilaterally declaring that its territorial
waters extended some 35 miles southward, into South Korea's own
seas, and threatening to fire on any South Korean vessel that
violates the North's dictate. The issue sparked a Naval battle in
June, when North Korean warships repeatedly tested South Korean
waters. The two navies finally exchanged gunfire in a skirmish that
ended with the sinking of a North Korean torpedo boat and the
reported loss of about 30 North Korean sailors.
</P>
<P>
   INDIA-PAKISTAN
</P>
<P>
   Centuries of Muslim-Hindu rivalry came to a boil in 1947, when
India won its independence from Britain. The former colony was
partitioned into India, predominantly Hindu, and Pakistan,
predominantly Muslim. The province of Kashmir, along the southern
rim of the Himalayas, got caught in the middle. Though the region
is predominantly Muslim, Kashmir's Hindu Maharaja, or prince, chose
in 1947 to place Kashmir under Indian control. Pakistan contends
that the Kashmiri people have a right to vote on whether to be part
of Pakistan, India or fully independent. Such a referendum has been
endorsed by past governments of India as well as the United
Nations. The two countries have fought wars over Kashmir, in 1947
and again in 1965. Indian control over the region has been fraught
with accusations of decades of human rights abuses. Last spring the
issue erupted again. Pakistan, claiming provocations, attacked
India, sparking a counterattack, in fighting that left more than
1,000 dead on both sides. Frequent shelling by both sides
continues. The nightmare scenario for strategists is all-out war
between the two countries, both of which tested nuclear weapons, in
defiance of U.S. appeals, in May 1998.

   BEIJING _ One of the world's longest-running diplomatic
melodramas, China's pursuit of membership in the World Trade
Organization, may be approaching its final act this weekend at a
summit in New Zealand between Presidents Bill Clinton and Jiang
Zemin.
</P>
<P>
   American agribusiness firms, telecommunications companies and

bucks in China's 1.2 billion-consumer domestic market if the talks
Sunday result in a Clinton-Jiang agreement to let China join the

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When President Clinton meets with his counterparts
from 20 other Asia-Pacific powers on Sunday in New Zealand, the
leaders will doubtless try to cast their gaze to the future.
</P>
<P>
   First, though, they must deal with some troubling history.
</P>
<P>
   In three parts of Asia the enduring legacy of five decades of
simmering conflict _ between China and Taiwan; Pakistan and India;
and North and South Korea _ continue to pose the threat of war.
</P>
<P>
   In a fourth _ Indonesia's East Timor _ a quarter-century of
strife has erupted in a week of bloodshed and destruction that has
left hundreds dead and forced up to 200,000 others to flee their
homes.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders will use the summit _ the annual meeting of the leaders
of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, or APEC _ to
spotlight the patchy turnabout in the economies of nations that
together will do more than $1 trillion in two-way trade with the
United States this year, roughly 40 percent of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
   This year's agenda, however, has been hijacked by security
concerns roiling a region where the United States has fought three
wars in this century alone and still maintains nearly 100,000
military forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lasting economic recovery in Asia depends on more than open
markets. It will also require continued stability in the region,
which can never be taken for granted,'' said Clinton's National
Security Adviser, Samuel Berger. ``This is where the United States
plays an especially vital role, and it will be an important part of
our agenda at APEC.''
</P>
<P>
   The crisis in East Timor appears certain to dominate the two-day
leaders' summit, Sunday and Monday in Auckland, New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   Like other regional conflicts, the troubles in East Timor stem
from unfinished business with deep roots in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The island of Timor, in the eastern half of the 3,000-mile-long
archipelago that makes up Indonesia, was once divided between Dutch
and Portuguese colonists. The Netherlands ceded West Timor, the
Dutch-controlled portion, to Indonesia in 1950. Twenty-five years
later, Indonesia invaded East Timor, evicting the Portuguese in an
annexation never recognized by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's military has ruled East Timor with an iron fist,
drawing two decades of criticism from the United States and
standing as a formidable obstacle to U.S.-Indonesian relations.
</P>
<P>
   On August 30, under U.N. auspices, East Timor's 900,000
residents voted overwhelmingly (78.5 percent) in favor of
independence.
</P>
<P>
   When U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan announced the results
last weekend, militia groups, police and thugs loyal to the
government in Jakarta took to the streets armed with assault
rifles, machetes and clubs on a murderous rampage targeting anyone
suspected of backing independence.
</P>
<P>
   In violation of its commitment to maintain order, Indonesia's
military has largely stood by and watched as hundreds have been
killed and hundreds more wounded in an orgy of horror, bloodshed
and destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, right now the Indonesian military has not done what
it said it would do and has
</P>
<P>
   failed in certain cases, if not participated in some of the
violence,'' State Department spokesman Jamie Rubin said Wednesday.
``Indonesia's relations with the international community, including
the United States, are at risk here.''
</P>
<P>
   With the government of Indonesian President B.J. Habibie unable,
or unwilling, to halt the terror, APEC's members are split over
whether to send in a U.N. peacekeeping force to restore order.
</P>
<P>
   Without Jakarta's approval _ so far, denied _ it would take a
U.N. Security Council resolution, a measure no one was anticipating
as of last week, to deploy such a force.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very, very tough choice in front of the international
community, and it's not just a question of sending in the Blue
Helmets,'' as U.N. peacekeepers are called, said Indonesian scholar
James Clad, who teaches Southeast Asian studies at Georgetown
University in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard to see how they would be able to win the
agreement of all the elements of the Indonesian government, get in
there and not be seen as taking sides,'' Clad said in a telephone
interview from Indonesia, where he's been monitoring developments.
``It is very grim.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration was still shaping its views on the
issue as the president boarded Air Force One late Thursday for the
long trans-Pacific flight.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the U.S.-led NATO air campaign over the Yugoslav
province of Kosovo, the administration appeared prepared to see
another country _ Australia has volunteered _ take the lead in any
U.N. operation in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   With huge economic and strategic stakes across Asia, however,
the United States is expected to play some role in trying to arrest
the anarchy in East Timor, much as it has a hand in efforts to
manage other hotspots across one of the world's most volatile
regions.
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear what, if anything, Clinton and his APEC partners
might do to allay regional security concerns, apart from
demonstrating that they are paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   That's preferable, though, to simply ignoring festering
situations and allowing risks to escalate unattended, said
international affairs analyst Stephen Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   A senior fellow in the foreign studies program at the
Washington-based Brookings Institution, Cohen faults the
international community for not building a framework for
Mideast-style peace talks aimed at finding a resolution to the
Indian-Pakistani dispute over Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   It will take, at best, years to find a solution, said Cohen, but
the international community could help nudge a peace process
forward with a combination of incentives and sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are about 10 solutions,'' said Cohen. ``But a solution
that everybody can agree on is impossible to find at the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   The parties themselves, moreover, are at odds over how to
proceed. Dwarfed by its giant neighbor, Pakistan is combing the
Muslim world _ including Indonesia, the home to the largest Islamic
population on Earth _ for diplomatic support on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   India, for its part, wants no outside mediators fouling the
current balance of power. That equation is tilted heavily in favor
of India, home to the world's third-largest army, with 1.1 million
men in arms, and the fourth largest air force, with 600 warplanes
and nearly as many transport craft and helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   Neither India nor Pakistan is an APEC member, but Cohen said
it's likely the forum will issue some sort of statement calling on
the two countries to rely on dialogue to try to resolve the dispute
over time.
</P>
<P>
   A statement is also expected _ perhaps issued jointly by
Clinton, South Korean President Kim Dae Jung and Japanese Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi following their trilateral meeting schedule
for Sunday _ appealing to North Korea for restraint and cooperation
in exchange for increased diplomatic contacts and assistance from
the industrialized world.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea has taken a series of steps the South has regarded
as provocative over the past year. Pyongyang fired a multi-stage
missile over Japan a year ago; engaged in a naval shoot-out with
South Korean ships in June; has threatened to test a new long-range
rocket that could reach the western United States; and has
announced that it would no longer honor the dividing line between
its territorial waters and those of the South .
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, though, North Korea is escalating its contacts
with the United States and South Korea, as evidenced by meetings
with U.S. diplomats in Berlin earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does seem as if the North is continuing to be interested in
some kind of improvement (in relations) with the South,'' said
Korean analyst Stephen Costello, president of ProGlobal Inc., a
Washington consulting firm. ``The South, Japan and the United
States want to take this momentum and see what they can do with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was scheduled to use a Saturday meeting with Chinese
President Jiang Zemin to try to build momentum in Sino-American
relations, sorely tested this year by trade quarrels and war in the
Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing opposed NATO's Balkans campaign even before U.S. bombs
destroyed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade last spring. That
debacle, blamed by an apologetic Pentagon on faulty intelligence,
plumbed the lowest mark in U.S.-China relations since the Tiananmen
Square massacre a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ties were further frayed in July, when Taiwan's president, Lee
Teng Hui, insisted during an press interview that Taiwan be
accorded ``special state to state relations,'' with China.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing bristled at the suggestion that Taiwan _ which China
regards as an outlaw province _ should be accorded equal standing
with China during talks over Taiwan's future.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something that the 1.2 billion Chinese people cannot
accept,'' Jiang told reporters this month during a trip to
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The casual observer might wonder why all the fuss.
</P>
<P>
   To China, though, Lee's words represented not simply an
unacceptable escalation in independence rhetoric, but a marked
shift in attitude in Taipei. With Taiwan slated to hold
presidential elections next March _ only the second such vote in
the 5,000-year history of the Chinese people, Beijing is looking to
nip any change in tone in the bud.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has changed is that Taiwan has finally gone out of its
way to make the point that it is a sovereign, independent state and
is going out of its way to publicize that fact,'' said former U.S.
diplomat John Tkacik Jr., president of China Business Intelligence,
an Arlington, Va.-based consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past,'' he said, ``it has played it down out of fear of
offending Beijing.''

   Like other regional conflicts, the troubles in East Timor stem
from unfinished business with deep roots in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The island of Timor, in the eastern half of the 3,000-mile-long
archipelago that makes up Indonesia, was once divided between Dutch
and Portuguese colonists. The Netherlands ceded West Timor, the
Dutch-controlled portion, to Indonesia in 1950. Twenty-five years
later, Indonesia invaded East Timor, evicting the Portuguese in an
annexation never recognized by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's military has ruled East Timor with an iron fist,
drawing two decades of criticism from the United States and
standing as a formidable obstacle to U.S.-Indonesian relations.
</P>
<P>
   On August 30, under U.N. auspices, East Timor's 900,000
residents voted overwhelmingly (78.5 percent) in favor of
independence.
</P>
<P>
   When U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan announced the results
last weekend, militia groups, police and thugs loyal to the
government in Jakarta took to the streets armed with assault
rifles, machetes and clubs on a murderous rampage targeting anyone
suspected of backing independence.
</P>
<P>
   In violation of its commitment to maintain order, Indonesia's
military has largely stood by and watched as hundreds have been
killed and hundreds more wounded in an orgy of horror, bloodshed
and destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, right now the Indonesian military has not done what
it said it would do and has
</P>
<P>
   failed in certain cases, if not participated in some of the
violence,'' State Department spokesman Jamie Rubin said Wednesday.
``Indonesia's relations with the international community, including
the United States, are at risk here.''
</P>
<P>
   With the government of Indonesian President B.J. Habibie unable,
or unwilling, to halt the terror, APEC's members are split over
whether to send in a U.N. peacekeeping force to restore order.
</P>
<P>
   Without Jakarta's approval _ so far, denied _ it would take a
U.N. Security Council resolution, a measure no one was anticipating
as of last week, to deploy such a force.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very, very tough choice in front of the international
community, and it's not just a question of sending in the Blue
Helmets,'' as U.N. peacekeepers are called, said Indonesian scholar
James Clad, who teaches Southeast Asian studies at Georgetown
University in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard to see how they would be able to win the
agreement of all the elements of the Indonesian government, get in
there and not be seen as taking sides,'' Clad said in a telephone
interview from Indonesia, where he's been monitoring developments.
``It is very grim.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration was still shaping its views on the
issue as the president boarded Air Force One late Thursday for the
long trans-Pacific flight.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the U.S.-led NATO air campaign over the Yugoslav
province of Kosovo, the administration appeared prepared to see
another country _ Australia has volunteered _ take the lead in any
U.N. operation in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   With huge economic and strategic stakes across Asia, however,
the United States is expected to play some role in trying to arrest
the anarchy in East Timor, much as it has a hand in efforts to
manage other hotspots across one of the world's most volatile
regions.
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear what, if anything, Clinton and his APEC partners
might do to allay regional security concerns, apart from
demonstrating that they are paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   That's preferable, though, to simply ignoring festering
situations and allowing risks to escalate unattended, said
international affairs analyst Stephen Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   A senior fellow in the foreign studies program at the
Washington-based Brookings Institution, Cohen faults the
international community for not building a framework for
Mideast-style peace talks aimed at finding a resolution to the
Indian-Pakistani dispute over Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   It will take, at best, years to find a solution, said Cohen, but
the international community could help nudge a peace process
forward with a combination of incentives and sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are about 10 solutions,'' said Cohen. ``But a solution
that everybody can agree on is impossible to find at the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   The parties themselves, moreover, are at odds over how to
proceed. Dwarfed by its giant neighbor, Pakistan is combing the
Muslim world _ including Indonesia, the home to the largest Islamic
population on Earth _ for diplomatic support on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   India, for its part, wants no outside mediators fouling the
current balance of power. That equation is tilted heavily in favor
of India, home to the world's third-largest army, with 1.1 million
men in arms, and the fourth largest air force, with 600 warplanes
and nearly as many transport craft and helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   Neither India nor Pakistan is an APEC member, but Cohen said
it's likely the forum will issue some sort of statement calling on
the two countries to rely on dialogue to try to resolve the dispute
over time.
</P>
<P>
   A statement is also expected _ perhaps issued jointly by
Clinton, South Korean President Kim Dae Jung and Japanese Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi following their trilateral meeting schedule
for Sunday _ appealing to North Korea for restraint and cooperation
in exchange for increased diplomatic contacts and assistance from
the industrialized world.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea has taken a series of steps the South has regarded
as provocative over the past year. Pyongyang fired a multi-stage
missile over Japan a year ago; engaged in a naval shoot-out with
South Korean ships in June; has threatened to test a new long-range
rocket that could reach the western United States; and has
announced that it would no longer honor the dividing line between
its territorial waters and those of the South .
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, though, North Korea is escalating its contacts
with the United States and South Korea, as evidenced by meetings
with U.S. diplomats in Berlin earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does seem as if the North is continuing to be interested in
some kind of improvement (in relations) with the South,'' said
Korean analyst Stephen Costello, president of ProGlobal Inc., a
Washington consulting firm. ``The South, Japan and the United
States want to take this momentum and see what they can do with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was scheduled to use a Saturday meeting with Chinese
President Jiang Zemin to try to build momentum in Sino-American
relations, sorely tested this year by trade quarrels and war in the
Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing opposed NATO's Balkans campaign even before U.S. bombs
destroyed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade last spring. That
debacle, blamed by an apologetic Pentagon on faulty intelligence,
plumbed the lowest mark in U.S.-China relations since the Tiananmen
Square massacre a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ties were further frayed in July, when Taiwan's president, Lee
Teng Hui, insisted during an press interview that Taiwan be
accorded ``special state to state relations,'' with China.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing bristled at the suggestion that Taiwan _ which China
regards as an outlaw province _ should be accorded equal standing
with China during talks over Taiwan's future.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something that the 1.2 billion Chinese people cannot
accept,'' Jiang told reporters this month during a trip to
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The casual observer might wonder why all the fuss.
</P>
<P>
   To China, though, Lee's words represented not simply an
unacceptable escalation in independence rhetoric, but a marked
shift in attitude in Taipei. With Taiwan slated to hold
presidential elections next March _ only the second such vote in
the 5,000-year history of the Chinese people, Beijing is looking to
nip any change in tone in the bud.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has changed is that Taiwan has finally gone out of its
way to make the point that it is a sovereign, independent state and
is going out of its way to publicize that fact,'' said former U.S.
diplomat John Tkacik Jr., president of China Business Intelligence,
an Arlington, Va.-based consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past,'' he said, ``it has played it down out of fea of
offending Beijing.''

 &HT;    MEXICO GETS COMIC RELIEF AS PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES HIT
TELEVISION TALK SHOW CIRCUIT
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    For Use Sat., Sept. 11 And Thereafter.

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Manuel Bartlett confessed to cheating on a French
exam so he could get a college scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   Vicente Fox took off his trademark belt buckle to screams of joy
from the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Porfirio Munoz Ledo shook his shoulders in a shimmy to
demonstrate that he's got rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   These men are all competing to become the next president of
Mexico. And for the first time in the history of this country's
normally stodgy political culture, they're willing to do the
unthinkable to get votes. With two notable exceptions who fear for
their dignity, all candidates vying for next year's highly
competitive presidential election are reaching out by appearing on
David Letterman and Jay Leno-style talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of offering canned speeches, they're talking about their
families and foibles and engaging in snappy repartee. They're
guffawing at off-color jokes and participating in unscripted
hijinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``A president should be able to handle a talk show appearance as
well as he handles a guerrilla uprising in Chiapas,'' said Adal
Ramones, a comic and television host whose freewheeling live chats
with candidates this month have electrified the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the candidates who've appeared on the show have said this
is another Mexico now. Things have changed and the president can't
be untouchable, even when it comes to gags,'' said Ramones, whose
show ``Otro Rollo,'' or ``A Different Thing,'' reaches tens of
millions of viewers tuned into the Televisa network.
</P>
<P>
   All this is happening in a country where just a year and a half
ago police commandos stormed factories producing rubber masks of
President Ernesto Zedillo. The Attorney General said the factories
were violating copyright laws, but everybody knew the crackdown was
because Mexico has unwritten rules that no one dare mock the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Slapstick comic Eugenio Dervez, who also invited Fox to appear
on his show, chalked up today's more relaxed mood to a big thaw
melting down Mexico's rigid political system.
</P>
<P>
   ``This type of campaigning has never happened before in
Mexico,'' Dervez said. ``I think this is a great opening of
democracy and freedom of expression in this country. And what the
candidates want now is a big screen and big ratings.''
</P>
<P>
   The rash of television appearances precedes the first ever
primary election to be held on Nov. 7 by Mexico's ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI. All of Mexico's
presidents for the past 70 years have been PRI apparatchiks. And
presidents have always hand-picked who would run as their
successors.
</P>
<P>
   Up to now, it was common for the PRI's candidates to never
before have run for office. They were often fairly unknown to the
Mexican people and the press usually shied away from digging beyond
the candidate's official portrayal.
</P>
<P>
   But competitors for the PRI's upcoming nomination _ especially
the two front runners _ are locked in a fierce media battle.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, who belongs to the conservative National Action Party, is
already in the mix because he is running such a competitive
campaign in a bid to win Mexico's July 2000 general election.
</P>
<P>
   The only two prominent presidential contenders who have so far
snubbed Ramones' invitation to ``Otro Rollo'' are Francisco
Labastida, who is widely regarded as the PRI elite's favorite
choice for the party's nomination, and Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, who is
expected to be the left's candidate. The two are basing their
campaigns on an image of solemn character and analysts say they
fear doing comedy would undermine their strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Ramones said Labastida was the first to be invited to ``Otro
Rollo,'' but he declined after his campaign advisers found out he'd
be on the same show as his chief rival in the PRI, Roberto Madrazo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he missed a great opportunity,'' Ramones said, noting
that all the candidates on his show have received mostly favorable
press coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting aside the Lewinsky matter,'' Ramones added, ``(U.S.)
President Clinton didn't lose any of his seriousness by going on a
talk show and playing the sax. He showed he was versatile and that
he was close to the people he would govern.''
</P>
<P>
   Labastida is still considering Ramones' offer, according to
sources in his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, who appeared on ``Otro Rollo'' on last Tuesday, used the
show to trash his rivals for turning down Ramones' invitation.
After talking about his children and his beloved ranch _ and
strapping his belt around his leg like a gun holster _ Fox pulled
out two pairs of jeans decorated with his own campaign slogans.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are for those two who wouldn't go on the show,'' he
said, prompting gales of laughter from the studio audience.
</P>
<P>
   The week before his appearance on ``Otro Rollo,'' Fox appeared
on Dervez's show in a prepared comedy sketch _ something no other
candidate has dared to do. Fox was ``interviewed'' by a character
Dervez plays who resembles Jerry Lewis' nutty professor.
</P>
<P>
   ``When are you going to stop already? It sounds like you're
already rehearsing your state-of-the-union speech,'' Dervez yelled
at Fox, interrupting him as the candidate, feigning seriousness,
introduced himself to viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, the same night that Dervez's show aired
President Zedillo gave his annual state-of-the-union address. While
Zedillo's speech captured only about 6.5 percent of Mexico's
television audience, Fox attracted more than 40 percent of all
viewers a couple of hours later.
</P>
<P>
   ``All interviews are valuable,'' Fox said when asked why he
submitted to doing comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's appearance on Dervez's show was so unusual for a
politician that Mexico City's Reforma newspaper conducted a poll to
gauge public reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Respondents were slightly in favor of politicians going on
comedy shows. But regardless of their opinions, most admitted
they'd opted to tune in to Dervez's show that night while skipping
their president.
</P>
<P>
   Only 29 percent respondents told Reforma they'd seen Zedillo's
speech while 51 percent said they'd seen Fox on Dervez's show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that there's real political competition in Mexico,
politicians will have to go to the people rather than expecting the
people to come to them,'' said Sergio Sarmiento, news director for
TV Azteca, a Televisa rival network.
</P>
<P>
   Ramones thinks the candidates' eagerness for exposure is a
healthy sign for the media to get more aggressive with politicians.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates all bounded onto his show like celebrities,
entering though a door to a fanfare of flashing lights and a burst
of rock music. Ramones engaged them in small talk and jokes.
Finally, with exaggerated respect, he asked each candidate if he
could break with tradition and poke fun at him should he become
president.
</P>
<P>
   Cornered by Ramones, every candidate who has appeared on ``Otro
Rollo'' has instantly agreed to be the butt of gags and sketches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course!'' said Madrazo, a 47-year-old PRI candidate who is
running as an alternative to the old-fashioned PRI. ``Go ahead.
Your humor brings us closer to the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo showed Ramones a few karate moves on the show. Then,
without Madrazo knowing what he was about to do, Ramones asked the
candidate to grab a blender on a coffee table and whip up a
smoothie using milk, sugar, chocolate and eggs.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexican slang, eggs, or ``huevos'' means testicles. Ramones
used the eggs as a prop to make a humorous reference to Madrazo's
audacious attacks on his rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the others think they can compete with me!'' Madrazo said
gamely, as he blended the ingredients into froth.
</P>
<P>
   Ramones had other plans for Porfirio Munoz Ledo, Cardenas'
underdog competitor for the leftist nomination. He forced a
chortling Munoz Ledo to watch a parade of bikini-clad women
modeling various jackets and shirts Mexican presidents
traditionally wear.
</P>
<P>
   When PRI contender Manuel Bartlett appeared, Ramones made him
demonstrate on slow-motion camera how a politician properly grips
hands and slaps backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics aren't the way they used to be here,'' Ramones said,
explaining his ground-breaking show. ``Television is no longer
simply a means of communicating the official line.''

 &HT;    RUSSIA LACKING IN TIME, MONEY TO TACKLE Y2K COMPLIANCE
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (f) Financial categories.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ World War III will not be launched when clocks strike
midnight on Jan. 1. A Chernobyl-style meltdown will not occur at
the country's power plants. Banks and businesses will continue to
operate. Russians will have heating and lights.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in Moscow have offered repeated assurances that Y2K,
the millennium computer bug, will not disrupt life in Russia or
cause problems for the world.
</P>
<P>
   Then why are so many people so worried?
</P>
<P>
   Russia's declarations may be conspicuous, but the extent to
which the cash-strapped government has addressed the potential Year
2000 glitch is far from certain. Russian computer experts say
Moscow is talking a good game, but in deep denial about the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Time and money are running out, they warn.
</P>
<P>
   ``The period from noon on Dec. 31st and for the next 24 hours, I
prefer to lay very still in my bed and do nothing,'' said Jahn
Han-Magamedov, technical director of the Russian Regional Center
for Internet Technologies, a computer-industry think tank in
Moscow. ``When is Russia going to start paying attention to this
problem? Until it costs lives and money?''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the British embassy in Moscow issued an
internal memo to its staff suggesting that their families and
relatives not visit Russia between late December and early January
because of fears of potential computer-bug difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   A memo produced by the defense attache's office in the U.S.
embassy in Moscow _ and leaked last week to the press _ said
Russia's military was neglecting safeguards in 100 systems
designated ``mission critical'' of the 1,000 systems in use by the
Russian Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has been anxious to cooperate with Moscow on
Y2K _ particularly in safeguarding nuclear warheads and each
country's early-warning defense system _ to protect against a New
Year's Eve glitch that could mistakenly signal a nuclear attack.
</P>
<P>
   Talks are back on track after a five-month suspension when
Russia froze relations in protest of the U.S.-led NATO bombing
campaign against Serb-led Yugoslavia, a traditional Russian ally.
U.S.-Russian negotiations resumed in August, two months after the
Kosovo war ended.
</P>
<P>
   United States and Russian officials are confident that
catastrophe will be avoided, if for no other reason than both are
acutely aware of the need to pick up a telephone and talk to the
other should early-warning computers detect something unusual.
</P>
<P>
   But there are plenty of other pitfalls for Russia's aging
computers, which like computers worldwide may or may not go on the
blink by misreading the year 2000 as the double-zero date of 1900:
power plants and heating systems, air and train travel, oil and gas
pipelines, banking and telephones.
</P>
<P>
   As one U.S. official in Russia put it, get ready for
``breakdowns rather than blow-ups.''
</P>
<P>
   While many businesses that have sprouted in the post-Soviet
economy are on-line and automated, few government services are
computerized.
</P>
<P>
   Functions such as welfare rolls and Russia's military draft are
still carried out on paper and by hand. In Moscow, even many of the
traffic signals are still controlled by cops stationed at the
intersection.
</P>
<P>
   Even Russia's chief communications regulator has suggested that
the country may have to curtail the number of commercial air
flights and temporarily shut down some hazardous industries ``just
in case.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials insist that their Soviet-era missile complex
simply is not designed to rely on computers that measure time in
such a way as to be affected by the millennium bug. Likewise, they
say, their nine major nuclear power plants are protected, though
some private experts are not so sure about the utility grids that
supply electricity to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other major
cities.
</P>
<P>
   Various warnings have come in reports from the CIA, the European
Union and private analysts who predict the first few months of 2000
could be rough for Russia _ with abrupt power-plant shutdowns,
transportation delays and possible interruptions in the flow from
Russia's natural gas pipelines. Europe depends on roughly one-third
of its natural gas from Russia to run heating and electrical
plants.
</P>
<P>
   If telephones go out or the power is interrupted, most Russians
all-too accustomed to things not working may consider it is just
another day in their faulty post-Soviet society.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has been plagued by economic and political instability
since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. So it is not
surprising that a difficult-to-understand computer glitch _ whose
effects are even more difficult to predict _ would not cause much
public concern.
</P>
<P>
   But computer experts warn that more must be done to tackle the
problem and they accuse government officials of purposely
downplaying the potential risks. In July, the country's finance
ministry estimated that Russia's government agencies need at least
$187 million to solve its Y2K problems _ inexplicably down from
previous government estimates of a need for as much as $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the government estimated that its agencies have about
28,000 vital computer systems, only a third of which are ready for
the Year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But officials insist that the government in just the past few
months has made strides.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is well-known that Russia was very late in addressing this.
The attitude is if we can not solve the problem, let's do what we
can to minimize the risks. That is being accomplished,'' Natalya
Cherneh, a government consultant who organized a July conference on
the Y2K problem for Russian lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Russia does have one thing going for it _ it's lagging progress
compared to the rest of the industrialized world. The country of
146 million people has relatively few computers. Personal computers
were strictly limited during Soviet times and the large, centrally
planned industries were slow to convert to automation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the flip-side of Russia's backwardness in the world.
We can probably expect fewer problems because we have fewer
computers controlling things,'' said Dmitri Kuvalin of the Russian
Academy of Science's Institute of Economic Forecasting, which has
studied the Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
   Experts predict the big problems may hit small and medium-sized
companies who have joined the computer age on the cheap _ buying
knock-off personal computers and pirated software.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not likely to affect that average Russian,'' said
Kuvalin, ``simply because the lives of most people here still are
not dependant on the computer.''

internal memo to its staff suggesting that their families and
relatives not visit Russia between late December and early January
because of fears of potential computer-bug difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   A memo produced by the defense attache's office in the U.S.
embassy in Moscow _ and leaked last week to the press _ said
Russia's military was neglecting safeguards in 100 systems
designated ``mission critical'' of the 1,000 systems in use by the
Russian Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has been anxious to cooperate with Moscow on
Y2K _ particularly in safeguarding nuclear warheads and each
country's early-warning defense system _ to protect against a New
Year's Eve glitch that could mistakenly signal a nuclear attack.
</P>
<P>
   Talks are back on track after a five-month suspension when
Russia froze relations in protest of the U.S.-led NATO bombing
campaign against Serb-led Yugoslavia, a traditional Russian ally.
U.S.-Russian negotiations resumed in August, two months after the
Kosovo war ended.
</P>
<P>
   United States and Russian officials are confident that
catastrophe will be avoided, if for no other reason than both are
acutely aware of the need to pick up a telephone and talk to the
other should early-warning computers detect something unusual.
</P>
<P>
   But there are plenty of other pitfalls for Russia's aging
computers, which like computers worldwide may or may not go on the
blink by misreading the year 2000 as the double-zero date of 1900:
power plants and heating systems, air and train travel, oil and gas
pipelines, banking and telephones.
</P>
<P>
   As one U.S. official in Russia put it, get ready for
``breakdowns rather than blow-ups.''
</P>
<P>
   While many businesses that have sprouted in the post-Soviet
economy are on-line and automated, few government services are
computerized.
</P>
<P>
   Functions such as welfare rolls and Russia's military draft are
still carried out on paper and by hand. In Moscow, even many of the
traffic signals are still controlled by cops stationed at the
intersection.
</P>
<P>
   Even Russia's chief communications regulator has suggested that
the country may have to curtail the number of commercial air
flights and temporarily shut down some hazardous industries ``just
in case.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials insist that their Soviet-era missile complex
simply is not designed to rely on computers that measure time in
such a way as to be affected by the millennium bug. Likewise, they
say, their nine major nuclear power plants are protected, though
some private experts are not so sure about the utility grids that
supply electricity to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other major
cities.
</P>
<P>
   Various warnings have come in reports from the CIA, the European
Union and private analysts who predict the first few months of 2000
could be rough for Russia _ with abrupt power-plant shutdowns,
transportation delays and possible interruptions in the flow from
Russia's natural gas pipelines. Europe depends on roughly one-third
of its natural gas from Russia to run heating and electrical
plants.
</P>
<P>
   If telephones go out or the power is interrupted, most Russians
all-too accustomed to things not working may consider it is just
another day in their faulty post-Soviet society.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has been plagued by economic and political instability
since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. So it is not
surprising that a difficult-to-understand computer glitch _ whose
effects are even more difficult to predict _ would not cause much
public concern.
</P>
<P>
   But computer experts warn that more must be done to tackle the
problem and they accuse government officials of purposely
downplaying the potential risks. In July, the country's finance
ministry estimated that Russia's government agencies need at least
$187 million to solve its Y2K problems _ inexplicably down from
previous government estimates of a need for as much as $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the government estimated that its agencies have about
28,000 vital computer systems, only a third of which are ready for
the Year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But officials insist that the government in just the past few
months has made strides.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is well-known that Russia was very late in addressing this.
The attitude is if we can not solve the problem, let's do what we
can to minimize the risks. That is being accomplished,'' Natalya
Cherneh, a government consultant who organized a July conference on
the Y2K problem for Russian lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Russia does have one thing going for it _ it's lagging progress
compared to the rest of the industrialized world. The country of
146 million people has relatively few computers. Personal computers
were strictly limited during Soviet times and the large, centrally
planned industries were slow to convert to automation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the flip-side of Russia's backwardness in the world.
We can probably expect fewer problems because we have fewer
computers controlling things,'' said Dmitri Kuvalin of the Russian
Academy of Science's Institute of Economic Forecasting, which has
studied the Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
   Experts predict the big problems may hit small and medium-sized
companies who have joined the computer age on the cheap _ buying
knock-off personal computers and pirated software.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not likely to affect that average Russian,'' said
Kuvalin, ``simply because the lives of most people here still are
not dependant on the computer.''

 &HT;    Drilling plans worry Florida Panhandle
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PENSACOLA, Fla. _ Eilene Beard has co-owned the Scuba Shack
charter fishing business downtown since 1981. Like others along the
resort-packed Florida coast from Perdido Key to Panama City, she
depends on the Gulf of Mexico for her living.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a resource that is among the best in the world,''
Beard said.
</P>
<P>
   She and other big-boat owners made a bundle working as support
vessels to oil company ships that searched coastal waters in the
late 1980s and discovered pockets of natural gas 25 miles offshore.
</P>
<P>
   A decade after those exploratory trips, Chevron U.S.A. is in the
last phase of seeking federal approval to crank up the first
production wells off Florida's coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good money,'' Beard said, ``but I don't want to give up
our pristine area.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday in Pensacola, more than 20 scientists and engineers
from the federal agency that regulates the nation's oil and gas
resources met with residents who had questions about Chevron's
proposal. A series of public hearings along the Gulf Coast
throughout the month will culminate Sept. 27, when the U.S.
Commerce Department hears an appeal by Chevron, which will argue
that its drilling plans are consistent with state plans to protect
the coastline. The sugar-white sands of Florida's Emerald Coast
beaches represent some of the most prized getaways for Atlantans
and others throughout the Southeast. Five counties in northwest
Florida thrive on $3 billion in annual tourist dollars, including
$380 million in Pensacola alone.
</P>
<P>
   If Chevron U.S.A. wins a challenge against the state and is
allowed to drill as many as 21 natural gas wells, environmentalists
fear the waters off the Panhandle could become just another Gulf
oil yard.
</P>
<P>
   Although nearly 40 test wells have been drilled off Florida's
Gulf Coast, none are active production rigs.
</P>
<P>
   In all, there are more than 4,000 oil rigs in the federally
regulated waters of the Gulf _ most near Louisiana, Mississippi and
Alabama. In state-controlled waters, Louisiana has leased more than
120 wells, and Mississippi and Alabama together have leased 17 Gulf
rigs.
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama at Dauphin Island and Fort Morgan just across the
Florida line from Perdido Key, more than 10 wells are visible from
the coast.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron, which discovered natural gas in the so-called ``Destin
Dome 56 Unit,'' wants to drill about 25 miles south of Pensacola.
The company would build a pipeline into Mobile Bay. Contractors in
Mobile or Pascagoula, Miss., would process the natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   A draft report by the federal Minerals Management Service
suggests there would be little danger from a natural gas operation.
``The number of Florida Panhandle visitors and their enjoyment of
the Emerald Coast beaches should be unaffected throughout the life
of the proposal,'' according to MMS.
</P>
<P>
   But Amy Belanger, vice president of Gulf Coast Environmental
Defense, said the real danger could come from the crude oil
production she said Chevron is sure to pursue if its natural gas
plan is approved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our greatest fear is that they're using this to get a foot in
the door for the entire state of Florida,'' Belanger said.
</P>
<P>
   Belanger said her group has collected 40,000 signatures on a
petition opposing Chevron. Gov. Jeb Bush and local politicians also
oppose the oil giant's plans.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1 trillion cubic feet of natural gas may exist
offshore from Pensacola _ enough to supply every commercial and
residential gas user in the state for 29 years. More than 130
leases in the Florida Gulf cover more than 1,100 square miles _ a
tiny fraction of the Gulf. More than a dozen of those blocks are
closer to the Panhandle than the proposed Chevron wells. Two are 13
miles offshore.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of Florida's opposition to wells near its coast, the
Minerals Management Service in its next sale of Gulf leases won't
include water closer than 100 miles from Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's necessary to extend it 100 miles
offshore,'' said David L. Duplantier, senior counsel for Chevron
U.S.A. ``Just look at Alabama. You can see platforms from the beach
but it hasn't caused any problems with tourism.''

 &HT;    For only $1.72, a blessing from God is quite a bargain
 &HT;    By Phil Latham
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARSHALL, Texas _ A friend of mine committed a random act this
week, and he tells me that it made his day.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he says he now believes that random acts have the power
to change the world. Now that he has done one random act, he's been
hooked and plans to do it over and over and over.
</P>
<P>
   It was, of course, a random act of kindness.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, it cost him. This random act of kindness cost him
all of $1.72, but for that he bought a day's worth of happiness for
himself and probably for at least two other people as well.
</P>
<P>
   Let me explain.
</P>
<P>
   My friend was in the drive-through lane of one of those fast
food restaurants the other day buying breakfast, thinking of
nothing in particular, when the idea came to him.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a new idea. It wasn't even his idea but one he had
read in a book somewhere. The idea is this: If you're in the
drive-through line, pay for the order of the person behind you.
</P>
<P>
   It took him a while to get up the nerve to do it, never having
committed a random act of kindness before. I'm sure if he does it
often enough, he'll get the hang of it in no time at all.
</P>
<P>
   But then he decided to do it. He put back the $5 bill he had
taken to pay for his order and pulled out a $20, his only $20 bill.
My friend, by the way, is by no means rich, though he is much
richer today than he was one week ago.
</P>
<P>
   He had no idea how much the other order cost. He purposely did
not look in his rearview mirror to see if the next person was
white, black or whatever. He did not know if they were rich, poor
or somewhere in between, Republican or Democrat, sinner or saint.
</P>
<P>
   What he did know is that the life-form occupying the automobile
behind his was a human being and, in the final analysis, that was
all that mattered.
</P>
<P>
   He told the girl at the pay window, ``I'm paying for the person
behind me, too.''
</P>
<P>
   For an instant, the girl looked confused, but she took the
money. She then asked if the person behind knew the meal was
getting paid for and was politely told ``no.'' My friend then
pulled to the front window to pick up his food.
</P>
<P>
   What he had hoped for was that the food would be ready the
instant he drove up, allowing him to whisk away before the person
in the car behind him even knew he had been the ``victim'' of a
random act of kindness.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, it didn't work out that way.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, there was a delay and my friend glanced back to see the
girl at the pay window explaining it to the customer and he could
see the surprise on the customer's face.
</P>
<P>
   In a moment, the girl from the window came up and said the
customer wanted to know his name.
</P>
<P>
   But my friend refused.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just tell him he's been hit by a random act of kindness,'' my
friend said.
</P>
<P>
   And my friend could see by the look on the girl's face that she
had been affected, too.
</P>
<P>
   She had received nothing, other than being witness to the random
act of kindness.
</P>
<P>
   A moment later, her face reappeared in the window.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants you to know,'' she said in a quiet voice, glancing
toward the car behind my friend, ``that he hopes God blesses you.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it was to be. Quite a bargain for $1.72.

 &HT;    Fall movie preview
 &HT;    By Robert Sims
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When all is said and done, the summer of 1999 will be remembered
for the return of the Jedi, the swan song of a legendary director
who obviously slept through the Sexual Revolution and a witch with
the power to transform a low-budget shocker into the most
profitable film ever made.
</P>
<P>
   Summer's dying days mercifully brings to a close the hype
surrounding Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace and the
two-year wait for Stanley Kubrick's sexually dysfunctional Eyes
Wide Shut. Yet only time will tell what impact The Blair Witch
Project, a $30,000 faux documentary expected to gross upward of
$150 million, will have on mainstream and independent filmmaking.
</P>
<P>
   The fall movie season, thankfully, offers somewhat of a reprieve
from summer's popcorn fare. Call this the calm before the storm of
holiday stocking fillers.
</P>
<P>
   Fall marks a time when the studios start to unfurl their
Oscar-friendly fare. This is not to say that we won't experience
any brawls, car crashes or explosions. It's just that less is more
when it comes to the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a list of films scheduled to open before Thanksgiving.
Release dates are subject to change.
</P>
<P>
   Ten to watch
</P>
<P>
   For Love of the Game
</P>
<P>
   (drama)
</P>
<P>
   You know America's favorite pastime has made a triumphant
comeback if Kevin Costner suits up once again to play ball. In his
bid to recapture the glory days of Bull Durham and Field of Dreams,
Costner plays a seasoned Detroit Tigers pitcher who recalls his
career while on his way to throwing the perfect game. For Love of
the Game also marks a change of pace for director Sam Raimi, best
known for engineering the gore-splattered Evil Dead series and for
last year's cold and calculated A Simple Plan. (Sept. 17)
</P>
<P>
   American Beauty (drama)
</P>
<P>
   The season's first Oscar hopeful out of the gate comes courtesy
of Sam Mendes, the British theater director responsible for Nicole
Kidman baring more than just her soul in The Blue Room. American
Beauty chronicles how seductive high schooler Mena Suvari stirs
Kevin Spacey from his suburban slumber. Spacey's infatuation lands
him in a world of trouble with estranged wife Annette Bening,
especially when she catches him red-handed fantasizing about the
object of his affection. (Oct. 1)
</P>
<P>
   Three Kings (thriller)
</P>
<P>
   George Clooney's attempt to make the leap from TV heartthrob to
box office player, a la Bruce Willis, have thus far proven
fruitless. Batman and Robin, anyone? Even the critically acclaimed
Out of Sight tanked. This Gulf War-era epic, however, looks
tailor-made for Clooney to show once and for all he's not the next
David Caruso. With hostilities over, Special Forces major Clooney
enlists Army reservists Mark Whalberg, Ice Cube and Spike Jonze to
surreptitiously find millions in stolen Kuwaiti booty hoarded in
the desert by Iraqi forces. Flirting with Disaster director David
O. Russell disregards patriotic jingoism to question aspects of the
United State's role in Kuwait and the Gulf War. (Oct. 1)
</P>
<P>
   The Limey (thriller)
</P>
<P>
   Or Get Carter, L.A. style. British ex-con Terrence Stamp turns
Tinseltown upside down in his crusade to avenge his daughter's
murder.Sex, Lies &AMP; Videotape wunderkind Steven Soderbergh showed he
knows how to handle the criminal element with last year's Out of
Sight, so there's every reason to expect The Limey to come out with
two guns blazing. (Oct. 8)
</P>
<P>
   Mystery, Alaska (drama)
</P>
<P>
   This David and Goliath tale, delayed from the end of the last
NHL season, pits a small-town hockey team against the New York
Rangers. Care to place your bets? Russell Crowe heads the rag-tag
team of hopefuls out to prove they have what it takes to play with
the big boys. Burt Reynolds, finally capitalizing on his Boogie
Nights Oscar nomination, dispenses sage advice as team coach. The
power-play combination of Austin Powers series director Jay Roach
and writer David E. Kelley, of The Practice and Ally McBeal fame,
should ensure Mystery, Alaska is more than just Rocky on ice
skates. (Oct. 8)
</P>
<P>
   Random Hearts (drama)
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of Harrison Ford reuniting with director Sydney
Pollack seemed less than welcome after their collaboration on
1995's stagnant Sabrina rehash. Yet despite its grim proposition,
Random Hearts harbors enough romantic possibilities to erase the
painful memories of Sabrina. Besides, if Kristin Scott Thomas can't
ignite Ford's passions on screen, then no woman can. Widowers Ford
and Scott Thomas find comfort in each other after they lose their
cheating spouses in the same plane crash. FYI: Random Hearts offers
a peak at what Ford's aborted Age of Aquarius, an epic set in
war-torn Bosnia co-starring Scott Thomas, could have been. (Oct. 8)
</P>
<P>
   The Straight Story (drama)
</P>
<P>
   Will wonders never cease? In May, David Mamet washed out his
mouth with soap to present a squeaky-clean adaptation of Terrence
Rattigan's The Winslow Boy. Now David Lynch, a chronicler of sick
and twisted suburban mores, offers a G-rated road movie distributed
by the family friendly folks at Disney. Proving again that fact is
stranger than fiction, The Straight Story retells the real-life
adventures an elderly Iowa man (played by Richard Farnsworth)
experienced when he crossed the Midwest on his lawnmower. (Oct. 8)
</P>
<P>
   Bringing Out the Dead
</P>
<P>
   (drama)
</P>
<P>
   Talk about a match made in Hell's Kitchen. Nicolas Cage stars as
an unstable New York paramedic in director Martin Scorsese's
adaptation of Joe Connelly's bleak novel. Bringing Out the Dead
puts Scorsese back on the mean streets of New York, where he
belongs, and should remind us why Cage won an Oscar shortly before
pumping up to become an action hero. It also marks Scorsese's first
collaboration with Taxi Driver and Raging Bull screenwriter Paul
Schrader since 1988's The Last Temptation of Christ. Need any other
reason to take a ride with Cage? (Oct. 22)
</P>
<P>
   The Insider (drama)
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect to see either 60 Minutes or tobacco industry
bigwigs in line for Michael Mann's expose of media manipulation and
corporate conspiracies. The Insider promises to take the venerable
newsmagazine to task for aggressively taking on Big Tobacco, only
to back down at the first sign of trouble. Christopher Plummer is
veteran correspondent Mike Wallace, Al Pacino is 60 Minutes
producer Lowell Bergman and Russell Crowe is Jeffrey Wigand, the
former tobacco executive turned whistleblower caught in the
crossfire. (Nov. 5)
</P>
<P>
   Dogma (comedy)
</P>
<P>
   One can only wonder whether Pope John Paul II will get down on
his knees and pray for director Kevin Smith's soul. The Catholic
Church all but excommunicated Smith after declaring Dogma a
blasphemous attack on organized religion. Smith shot back, arguing
that Dogma upholds all that the Catholic Church represents and
values. So, what's all the fuss about? Renegade angels Matt Damon
and Ben Affleck trying to break into Heaven. The last descendent of
Jesus Christ toiling in an abortion clinic. Chris Rock as an
apostle. Rock siren Alanis Morissette as God. Profane? That depends
on your religious convictions. Funny? A given, considering Smith
gave us Clerks and Chasing Amy. (Nov. 12)
</P>
<P>
   Is the Academy watching?
</P>
<P>

arrival of two siblings known for their rebellious streak. Milla

 &HT;    The best of dare-devil genes went to big brother
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Tonight is Kids' Night at Kil-Kare Speedway, but
I won't be going. I have tickets for the Broadway touring
production of ``Ragtime'' in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   The only surprising thing about the above information is how
disappointed I feel.
</P>
<P>
   You've probably got me pegged as a zinfandel-swishing,
sushi-noshing, opera-glass-toting wimp who wouldn't venture within
miles of Kil-Kare. You wouldn't picture my spending Friday night at
a joint where the concession stand sells earplugs instead of
cappuccinos.
</P>
<P>
   And you'd be right, except you're underestimating the depth of
my sisterly devotion.
</P>
<P>
   I started going to Kil-Kare because my brother, Matt McCarty,
races as a hobby.
</P>
<P>
   And I keep going back because it's fun.
</P>
<P>
   My sisters and I tell ourselves that we do it for the kids. We
do it for Matt. But last time, the night of the Great School Bus
Figure-8 Race, we were forced to admit we do it a little bit for
ourselves, too.
</P>
<P>
   The racetrack looks like my son's Hot Wheels set sprung to life,
those flattened snub-nosed anatomically improbable cars humming
around the track. ``You cannot help but feel compelled by the
incredible roar of those cars,'' said my sister Beth. ``And it's so
much fun to joyfully yell and scream and cheer. That would be a
little inappropriate at `Ragtime.'''
</P>
<P>
   When God passed out thrill-seeking genes, he must have given
them all to Matt _ the oldest of us six kids _ with nothing left
over for me, the next in line. I wait for crosswalk lights; Matt
has tested the limits with hobbies ranging from bronco-riding to
Golden-Glove boxing.
</P>
<P>
   We thought he had put all that behind him when he became a
respectable father of three and husband to my wonderful
sister-in-law, Debbie. You'd think he'd have gotten enough of an
adrenaline rush from his longtime career as a
firefighter-paramedic, and more recent work as a nurse in the
intensive care unit at Miami Valley Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   But six years ago, that daredevil gene reared its ugly head when
Matt took up figure-8 racing. ``Tell people I've only been doing
pure stocks for a couple of years, so that way they'll understand
why I'm so lousy at it,'' he explained. His race car is a
lime-green '74 Chevelle spray-painted with the number ``00'' and
the names of his sponsors, Little Giant Body Shop and C&AMP;M Rubber.
</P>
<P>
   Matt and his buddies Jim McCloskey and Steve Virelli are among
the part-timers, the hobbyists, at Kil-Kare. They aren't
necessarily in it to win (though they wouldn't mind, either).
They're in it for the camaraderie, for the fun of racing against
the likes of the Jenkins family _ Earl, Harley, Tim and the
ever-amazing Frances, a wiry grandmother who draws hordes of young
fans to the winner's circle.
</P>
<P>
   My son whistles, stomps his feet and cheers, ``Go double-zero!''
whenever Matt completes a lap. We shriek with terror and delight
when ``00'' squeaks past another car in the Figure-8s. But nothing
compares with the school bus Figure-8s, all those gaudily-painted
school buses rounding the racetrack like Conestoga wagons on speed.
</P>
<P>
   We shouted until we were hoarse as Virelli roared into second
place after starting in 13th, until the bus overheated in the
race's final laps.
</P>
<P>
   Matt knows he faces an uphill battle, explaining why he does
this to someone of my limited understanding: ``It's the
anticipation, the hopes you can actually get a checkered flag _ if
I can just push the Jenkinses out of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Lots of luck, Matt. Word has it they're harder to unload than a
little sister.

 &HT;    2000 election is shaping up as a potentially weird race
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ The next presidential election is almost
15 months away, which in the political world is equivalent to
approximately 2 million light years. Anything can happen between
now and November 2000. A lot already has.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Beatty, who played Dick Tracy in the movies and is almost
as old as Clint Eastwood, is thinking about jumping in. Jesse
Ventura, a professional wrestler, may be a candidate if Larry King
doesn't nominate Ross Perot. John Wayne isn't a front-runner only
because he's dead. So is Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Although he hasn't been heard from since he co-starred with a
horse, and may be either in a nursing home or still trying to find
his way ``Out of Africa,'' Robert Redford is always a possibility
with his strong appeal to older women who don't mind wrinkles.
</P>
<P>
   Since I'm out of the running due to smoking rabbit tobacco when
I was 12 years old, although like young Billy Clinton I didn't
inhale, I continue to follow the great American horse race with
keen interest. (Note: Pundits commonly refer to presidential
primary campaigns as ``horse races,'' although to date no entire
horses have entered. However, it is not unusual to have hind parts
of horses in the field.)
</P>
<P>
   Whenever I feel a need to gaze into a cloudy crystal ball for
political insight, I call my friend Bert Lance, the Calhoun
prognosticator.
</P>
<P>
   ``What about this?'' he said. ``Bush-Dole against
Gore-Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Afraid early senility had set in on my astute friend, I
explained that Bob Dole is too busy selling Viagra and that Bill
Clinton wouldn't be willing to play second fiddle to his former
vice president, even for an opportunity to hang around the White
House and play with interns.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't get it,'' Bert replied. ``I mean George W. Bush and
Elizabeth Dole against Al Gore and Hillary Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're being funny,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not at all,'' he replied. ``It could happen. And wouldn't it
make an interesting race?''
</P>
<P>
   Stranger things have. Elderly Atlanta Constitution alumni
remember Reg Murphy's famous column headline following Bill Shipp's
scoop reporting the intentions of a peanut farmer from Plains:
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimmy Carter is running for WHAT?''
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating that guns are likely to be a dominant issue in the
2000 election, and having three shotguns in my closet in case I get
invited to Gene Sutherland's annual dove shoot, I dug out an
encyclopedia left over from the pre-Internet era and actually read
the Second Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   I was particularly concerned because, according to Neal Boortz,
I'll have to carry a slingshot or a bow and arrow to Gene's dove
shoot if mush-brain Democrats are allowed to have their way on
guns.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what the Founding Fathers wrote and citizens ratified 208
years ago:
</P>
<P>
   ``A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a
free state, the right of the people to bear arms shall not be
infringed.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to figure out what our Founding Fathers meant 208
years ago, before we had the National Guard, or Gatling guns. As
far as I know, Georgia no longer has a militia, well-regulated or
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Since I can't speak with dead people unless I happen to run into
Newt Gingrich, and neither can anybody I'm acquainted with, I've
decided my interpretation of the Second Amendment is as good as
that of anyone running for president or hosting a talk show. This
makes me feel a lot better about Gene Sutherland's dove shoot.
</P>
<P>
   Due to bad hand-eye coordination, I'm a poor shot. I've been
known to miss a wounded dove attempting to light on the limb of a
tree I was standing under. Instead of a 12-gauge shotgun, what I
need is a real militia-type weapon. If I can pick up a reasonably
priced surplus flak wagon left over from World War II, I can get my
limit like everyone else when I go on a dove shoot.
</P>
<P>
   However, I'm in full agreement with mush-brain Democrats on the
issue of handguns. As far as I'm concerned they should be done away
with. To say I can't hit the side of barn with a pistol is an
understatement. A handgun led to one of the most embarrassing
moments of my life.
</P>
<P>
   In the Army, my primary weapon was a .45-caliber Colt
semiautomatic from the Teddy Roosevelt era. I had to qualify with
it every year, which with my bad aim was an impossibility. A
sympathetic (I thought) range officer suggested on qualifying day
that I go about my business and let him qualify for me. A few days
later I was summoned to a colonel's office, expecting to be sent
home in disgrace or to the military prison at Fort Leavenworth,
Kan.
</P>
<P>
   What I received instead was a commendation for having fired the
highest score with a .45-caliber pistol of anyone in the 47th
Infantry Division!
</P>
<P>
   After careful study of my Second Amendment right, and realizing
a need for personal protection, I'm looking around for a used
bazooka in good condition. As for my presidential candidate, Warren
Beatty's the man. Dick Tracy was a darn good shooter.

 &HT;    Focusing only on the Davidian fire will slash Danforth probe's
value
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ An independent investigator will attempt to find
out if the government killed people during the FBI's tragic tank
and tear-gas assault on the Branch Davidians' compound in 1993 and
then covered it up.
</P>
<P>
   It's too little, too late.
</P>
<P>
   The narrow scope of former Sen. John Danforth's belated
independent investigation will not restore lost credibility in
government.
</P>
<P>
   In accepting Attorney General Janet Reno's offer to head up a
limited investigation into government actions on the final day of
the 51-day siege, Danforth, who by all accounts is a nice guy, said
he will not focus on poor judgment by federal officials ``even if
those judgments led to the ultimate results.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The ultimate results'' in this situation were the charred
remains of 76 men, women and children removed from the rubble of
the Davidians' Mount Carmel compound.
</P>
<P>
   If outrageously poor judgment by government officials caused the
needless deaths of 21 children and 55 adults on a windy Monday
morning six years ago east of Waco, and if that incompetence is
outside the scope of Danforth's investigation as he says, then
everyone can forget about an independent investigation reviving
public confidence in the commitment of government to level with
American people.
</P>
<P>
   Quite likely, Danforth's investigation will eventually report
that no, the government did not purposefully kill anyone during the
final assault and yes, there were several minor cover-ups due
primarily to confusing terminology and improper reporting
procedures now corrected.
</P>
<P>
   Public credibility in government comes from a belief that public
servants take responsibility for their mistakes and are held
accountable for misbehavior.
</P>
<P>
   Government credibility cannot be assumed. It must earned. It is
hard won and easily lost.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth should immediately utilize his powers as a special
counsel to use the assistance of a federal grand jury to add needed
weight to pursue his investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth also should announce his intention to expand his
investigation into the entire government involvement in the attempt
to arrest David Koresh and other Davidian leaders. If Danforth is
fired for attempting to lay out the entire story to the American
people, then public pressure should finally result in the sort of
top-to-bottom outside investigation that President Clinton, Reno
and Congress avoided six years ago in the mistaken belief that a
once-over-lightly self-examination would satisfy the public.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has the ability to conduct a comprehensive
investigation into all aspects of the government's involvement with
the Branch Davidians. Congress has the required subpoena power, the
power to prosecute for perjury, the proper oversight authority and
the resources to do the job right.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with a congressional investigation is that Congress
has its own credibility problem.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what the issue, Democrats will take one side for their
own political advantage and Republicans the other side for the same
reason.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, Democrats have lined up behind Reno and against
FBI Director Louis Freeh.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have lined up in support of Freeh and opposed to
Reno.
</P>
<P>
   This is before any new investigation has even begun.
</P>
<P>
   It's obvious that congressional investigations into this serious
matter would be no more than another partisan food fight among the
nation's top lawmakers that would only further weaken public
credibility in government and play into the hands of dangerous
anti-government conspiracy nuts.
</P>
<P>
   To restore public credibility in government, Americans need the
whole truth about what happened 10 miles outside of Waco, not just
part of what happened during a narrowly defined period of time out
of context with other government actions.

 &HT;    Building boxes that will last forever
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On the Internet, a man reports that he wants to make a
small box but, for lack of information, is about to embark on a
path that I can guarantee he will regret.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been looking at books in stores and libraries but
without success,'' he writes. ``I want to make a small box by
gluing the four sides to the face of a large board that will act as
a bottom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I have to worry about the bottom expanding with moisture
and then warping? I can't think of another way to attach this that
will allow for wood movement. I saw one in a store that looked as
though it was glued on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, I am debating joining the sides with just a miter
instead of a box joint. Is this technically a cross-grain situation
or end grain-to-end grain? Will it be strong enough?''
</P>
<P>
   I cannot think what books this fellow has been looking at;
certainly Tage Frid's ``Joinery: Tools and Techniques'' was not
among them, or he isn't paying much attention. The latter is
certainly part of the problem, if he does not understand the
difference between cross-grain and end-grain construction.
</P>
<P>
   I realize that a lot of my readers don't know the difference
either, or they wouldn't be reading this very basic stuff. So to
explain, cross-grain construction is a situation in which boards
are glued so that the grain of one runs across the grain of
another. Given that wood moves across its grain seasonally, this is
bound to result in joint failure or cracking. End grain
construction occurs when you try to use end grain as a glue joint;
it is not. End grain will absorb the glue, leaving nothing to hold
the joint.
</P>
<P>
   Now, to take his problems in order:
</P>
<P>
   If he glues the bottom of his box directly to the sides, he has
created a situation certain to fail. All four sides will try to
keep the bottom from expanding and shrinking, and the bottom will
crack or come off. I know. I did it once myself, long ago.
</P>
<P>
   So he saw one in a store that ``looked like it was glued on?''
Maybe he did. If so, it was built during the current season, and
will come off sometime soon after the next season takes hold. The
only way to glue the bottom to the sides is to use plywood for the
bottom. If you inset the bottom into the interior, it won't look
bad.
</P>
<P>
   There are several good ways to do it using solid wood.
</P>
<P>
   You can route a slot all the way around the interior of the
sides and then rabbet the bottom to fit in the slots. Use no glue
in the slots, and be certain there's a little room for the bottom
to move, especially if you build it in the winter.
</P>
<P>
   A classier way, to my mind, is to make a frame-and-panel bottom.
This can be inset, or built large enough so that the sides are
glued directly to the frame, which protrudes at the bottom and
provides a sort of pedestal effect.
</P>
<P>
   The panel, of course, will be captured in the frame and free to
expand and contract; this is the point of all frame-and-panel
construction. Gluing the sides to the frame will work because,
first of all, the the grain of the four sections of the frame runs
in the same direction as the sections of the sides to which they
will be glued, and because the sides of a box this size shouldn't
be more than half an inch thick at the most. A half-inch glue area
will not interfere with the minute amount of movement to be
expected in frame members, which would probably be no more than an
inch to an inch and a quarter in width.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of trouble? Of course it is. But it will last forever, not
a mere six months or so.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as to the idea of butt-joining mitered corners: I wouldn't
recommend it. You can figure that if a 90-degree cut across the
width of a board results in all end grain, then a 45-degree cut
will be about 50 percent end grain. I have heard of people
successfully doing this by coating the end grain with glue, letting
it absorb, and then coating it again, until it will absorb no more,
and then gluing up the joint.
</P>
<P>
   I just wouldn't trust it. There must be a dozen viable ways of
making 90-degree joints, some, like a spline joint, quite simple,
ranging up to joinery so complicated it would make your head hurt.
Why take the chance?

certainly Tage Frid's ``Joinery: Tools and Techniques'' was not
among them, or he isn't paying much attention. The latter is
certainly part of the problem, if he does not understand the
difference between cross-grain and end-grain construction.
</P>
<P>
   I realize that a lot of my readers don't know the difference
either, or they wouldn't be reading this very basic stuff. So to
explain, cross-grain construction is a situation in which boards
are glued so that the grain of one runs across the grain of
another. Given that wood moves across its grain seasonally, this is
bound to result in joint failure or cracking. End grain
construction occurs when you try to use end grain as a glue joint;
it is not. End grain will absorb the glue, leaving nothing to hold
the joint.
</P>
<P>
   Now, to take his problems in order:
</P>
<P>
   If he glues the bottom of his box directly to the sides, he has
created a situation certain to fail. All four sides will try to
keep the bottom from expanding and shrinking, and the bottom will
crack or come off. I know. I did it once myself, long ago.
</P>
<P>
   So he saw one in a store that ``looked like it was glued on?''
Maybe he did. If so, it was built during the current season, and
will come off sometime soon after the next season takes hold. The
only way to glue the bottom to the sides is to use plywood for the
bottom. If you inset the bottom into the interior, it won't look
bad.
</P>
<P>
   There are several good ways to do it using solid wood.
</P>
<P>
   You can route a slot all the way around the interior of the
sides and then rabbet the bottom to fit in the slots. Use no glue
in the slots, and be certain there's a little room for the bottom
to move, especially if you build it in the winter.
</P>
<P>
   A classier way, to my mind, is to make a frame-and-panel bottom.
This can be inset, or built large enough so that the sides are
glued directly to the frame, which protrudes at the bottom and
provides a sort of pedestal effect.
</P>
<P>
   The panel, of course, will be captured in the frame and free to
expand and contract; this is the point of all frame-and-panel
construction. Gluing the sides to the frame will work because,
first of all, the the grain of the four sections of the frame runs
in the same direction as the sections of the sides to which they
will be glued, and because the sides of a box this size shouldn't
be more than half an inch thick at the most. A half-inch glue area
will not interfere with the minute amount of movement to be
expected in frame members, which would probably be no more than an
inch to an inch and a quarter in width.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of trouble? Of course it is. But it will last forever, not
a mere six months or so.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as to the idea of butt-joining mitered corners: I wouldn't
recommend it. You can figure that if a 90-degree cut across the
width of a board results in all end grain, then a 45-degree cut
will be about 50 percent end grain. I have heard of people
successfully doing this by coating the end grain with glue, letting
it absorb, and then coating it again, until it will absorb no more,
and then gluing up the joint.
</P>
<P>
   I just wouldn't trust it. There must be a dozen viable ways of
making 90-degree joints, some, like a spline joint, quite simple,
ranging up to joinery so complicated it would make your head hurt.
Why take the chance?

   GERMANY-SYNAGOGUE -$ADV11 _ DRESDEN Germany _ Sixty-one years
after the Nazis burned the century-old temple to the ground,
Dresden Jews plan to break ground soon an a new synagogue, the
first new place for Jews to worship in what was East Germany since
before WWII. Before the war, there were 6,000 Jews in Dresden.
After the war, there were fewer thna 100. But with the end of the
Cold War, Jews again are moving to Dresden, which is now now to
more than 250 Jews with more coming all the time. Yet, the backers
of the new temple are more than $5 million short of the
approximately $20 million needed to build the temple. They wonder
what to think of this given the fact that more than $200 million
was raised easily to rebuild the major protestant chuch, which was
destroyed in Allied bombing. (Roughton, Cox News Service). WITH

Dresden Jews plan to break ground soon an a new synagogue, the

before WWII. Before the war, there were 6,000 Jews in Dresden.
After the war, there were fewer thna 100. But with the end of the
Cold War, Jews again are moving to Dresden, which is now now to
more than 250 Jews with more coming all the time. Yet, the backers
of the new temple are more than $5 million short of the
approximately $20 million needed to build the temple. They wonder
what to think of this given the fact that more than $200 million
was raised easily to rebuild the major protestant chuch, which was

 &HT;    MEXICO GETS COMIC RELIEF AS PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES HIT
TELEVISION TALK SHOW CIRCUIT

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Manuel Bartlett confessed to cheating on a French
exam so he could get a college scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   Vicente Fox took off his trademark belt buckle to screams of joy
from the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Porfirio Munoz Ledo shook his shoulders in a shimmy to
demonstrate that he's got rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   These men are all competing to become the next president of
Mexico. And for the first time in the history of this country's
normally stodgy political culture, they're willing to do the
unthinkable to get votes. With two notable exceptions who fear for
their dignity, all candidates vying for next year's highly
competitive presidential election are reaching out by appearing on
David Letterman and Jay Leno-style talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of offering canned speeches, they're talking about their
families and foibles and engaging in snappy repartee. They're
guffawing at off-color jokes and participating in unscripted
hijinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``A president should be able to handle a talk show appearance as
well as he handles a guerrilla uprising in Chiapas,'' said Adal
Ramones, a comic and television host whose freewheeling live chats
with candidates this month have electrified the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the candidates who've appeared on the show have said this
is another Mexico now. Things have changed and the president can't
be untouchable, even when it comes to gags,'' said Ramones, whose
show ``Otro Rollo,'' or ``A Different Thing,'' reaches tens of
millions of viewers tuned into the Televisa network.
</P>
<P>
   All this is happening in a country where just a year and a half
ago police commandos stormed factories producing rubber masks of
President Ernesto Zedillo. The Attorney General said the factories
were violating copyright laws, but everybody knew the crackdown was
because Mexico has unwritten rules that no one dare mock the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Slapstick comic Eugenio Dervez, who also invited Fox to appear
on his show, chalked up today's more relaxed mood to a big thaw
melting down Mexico's rigid political system.
</P>
<P>
   ``This type of campaigning has never happened before in
Mexico,'' Dervez said. ``I think this is a great opening of
democracy and freedom of expression in this country. And what the
candidates want now is a big screen and big ratings.''
</P>
<P>
   The rash of television appearances precedes the first ever
primary election to be held on Nov. 7 by Mexico's ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI. All of Mexico's
presidents for the past 70 years have been PRI apparatchiks. And
presidents have always hand-picked who would run as their
successors.
</P>
<P>
   Up to now, it was common for the PRI's candidates to never
before have run for office. They were often fairly unknown to the
Mexican people and the press usually shied away from digging beyond
the candidate's official portrayal.
</P>
<P>
   But competitors for the PRI's upcoming nomination _ especially
the two front runners _ are locked in a fierce media battle.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, who belongs to the conservative National Action Party, is
already in the mix because he is running such a competitive
campaign in a bid to win Mexico's July 2000 general election.
</P>
<P>
   The only two prominent presidential contenders who have so far
snubbed Ramones' invitation to ``Otro Rollo'' are Francisco
Labastida, who is widely regarded as the PRI elite's favorite
choice for the party's nomination, and Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, who is
expected to be the left's candidate. The two are basing their
campaigns on an image of solemn character and analysts say they
fear doing comedy would undermine their strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Ramones said Labastida was the first to be invited to ``Otro
Rollo,'' but he declined after his campaign advisers found out he'd
be on the same show as his chief rival in the PRI, Roberto Madrazo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he missed a great opportunity,'' Ramones said, noting
that all the candidates on his show have received mostly favorable
press coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting aside the Lewinsky matter,'' Ramones added, ``(U.S.)
President Clinton didn't lose any of his seriousness by going on a
talk show and playing the sax. He showed he was versatile and that
he was close to the people he would govern.''
</P>
<P>
   Labastida is still considering Ramones' offer, according to
sources in his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, who appeared on ``Otro Rollo'' on last Tuesday, used the
show to trash his rivals for turning down Ramones' invitation.
After talking about his children and his beloved ranch _ and
strapping his belt around his leg like a gun holster _ Fox pulled
out two pairs of jeans decorated with his own campaign slogans.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are for those two who wouldn't go on the show,'' he
said, prompting gales of laughter from the studio audience.
</P>
<P>
   The week before his appearance on ``Otro Rollo,'' Fox appeared
on Dervez's show in a prepared comedy sketch _ something no other
candidate has dared to do. Fox was ``interviewed'' by a character
Dervez plays who resembles Jerry Lewis' nutty professor.
</P>
<P>
   ``When are you going to stop already? It sounds like you're
already rehearsing your state-of-the-union speech,'' Dervez yelled
at Fox, interrupting him as the candidate, feigning seriousness,
introduced himself to viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, the same night that Dervez's show aired
President Zedillo gave his annual state-of-the-union address. While
Zedillo's speech captured only about 6.5 percent of Mexico's
television audience, Fox attracted more than 40 percent of all
viewers a couple of hours later.
</P>
<P>
   ``All interviews are valuable,'' Fox said when asked why he
submitted to doing comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's appearance on Dervez's show was so unusual for a
politician that Mexico City's Reforma newspaper conducted a poll to
gauge public reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Respondents were slightly in favor of politicians going on
comedy shows. But regardless of their opinions, most admitted
they'd opted to tune in to Dervez's show that night while skipping
their president.
</P>
<P>
   Only 29 percent respondents told Reforma they'd seen Zedillo's
speech while 51 percent said they'd seen Fox on Dervez's show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that there's real political competition in Mexico,
politicians will have to go to the people rather than expecting the
people to come to them,'' said Sergio Sarmiento, news director for
TV Azteca, a Televisa rival network.
</P>
<P>
   Ramones thinks the candidates' eagerness for exposure is a
healthy sign for the media to get more aggressive with politicians.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates all bounded onto his show like celebrities,
entering though a door to a fanfare of flashing lights and a burst
of rock music. Ramones engaged them in small talk and jokes.
Finally, with exaggerated respect, he asked each candidate if he
could break with tradition and poke fun at him should he become
president.
</P>
<P>
   Cornered by Ramones, every candidate who has appeared on ``Otro
Rollo'' has instantly agreed to be the butt of gags and sketches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course!'' said Madrazo, a 47-year-old PRI candidate who is
running as an alternative to the old-fashioned PRI. ``Go ahead.
Your humor brings us closer to the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo showed Ramones a few karate moves on the show. Then,
without Madrazo knowing what he was about to do, Ramones asked the
candidate to grab a blender on a coffee table and whip up a
smoothie using milk, sugar, chocolate and eggs.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexican slang, eggs, or ``huevos'' means testicles. Ramones
used the eggs as a prop to make a humorous reference to Madrazo's
audacious attacks on his rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the others think they can compete with me!'' Madrazo said
gamely, as he blended the ingredients into froth.
</P>
<P>
   Ramones had other plans for Porfirio Munoz Ledo, Cardenas'
underdog competitor for the leftist nomination. He forced a
chortling Munoz Ledo to watch a parade of bikini-clad women
modeling various jackets and shirts Mexican presidents
traditionally wear.
</P>
<P>
   When PRI contender Manuel Bartlett appeared, Ramones made him
demonstrate on slow-motion camera how a politician properly grips
hands and slaps backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics aren't the way they used to be here,'' Ramones said,
explaining his ground-breaking show. ``Television is no longer
simply a means of communicating the official line.''

 STATE SALMON POPULATIONS LISTED AS THREATENED  &HT;     By GLEN MARTIN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Concerned about dwindling numbers of Pacific salmon, the
National Marine Fisheries Service listed two salmon populations in
California under the U.S. Endangered Species Act Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agency's decision, California's Central Valley
spring-run chinook _ or king _ salmon and the state's coastal
chinook salmon were designated as threatened.
</P>
<P>
   The fish join three California ``salmonids'' already listed
under the act _ Sacramento River winter-run salmon, California coho
salmon and coastal steelhead trout. The winter-run chinook is
listed as endangered, while the other fish have the less-stringent
threatened status.
</P>
<P>
   Under the act, regulators can impose fishing quotas, land-use
restrictions and other measures to protect listed species. It is
unlikely landowners with holdings near spawning streams will face
new restrictions as a result of the listing, the fisheries service
said.
</P>
<P>
   The service also decided Thursday that three other populations
of Pacific salmon do not warrant listing at this time: Central
Valley fall- and late fall-run chinook, southern Oregon and
northern California chinook and Deschutes River chinook in Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Though all the populations of chinook are the same species,
scientists have determined that significant genetic variation
exists among the different runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have a better grasp on the status of these salmon
populations and can move forward to protect those that need the
coverage of the (act),'' said Terry Garcia, a deputy administrator
with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which
oversees the fisheries service.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  ``The fish don't care who protects them, as long as the
efforts are adequate,'' said Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  But some environmentalists and fisheries advocates are
unappeased by the listings. ``We're very disappointed that they
overlooked the fall-run chinook,'' said Barry Nelson, a senior
policy analyst with the Natural Resources Defense Council.
</P>
<P>
   Though several hundred thousand fall-run chinooks return to
their spawning grounds on an average year, said Nelson, ``most of
those are hatchery fish. The wild population is essentially as
endangered as the spring-run salmon.''
</P>
<P>
   Pietro Parravano, resident of the Pacific Coast Federation of
Fishermen's Associations, said he was pleased that the fish
received a threatened rather than an endangered status, because it
might mean fishermen could dodge further regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that doesn't guarantee that fishermen still won't be
taking the hit, as we traditionally have in the past,'' he said. &LR; 
``I'm very worried that the service has stated that restrictions on
landowners will be unlikely, particularly where the spring &LR;   &LR; run is
concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Parravano said spring-run chinook have lost 70 to 80 percent
of their spawning grounds to logging, agriculture and development.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't been able to fish for coho for seven years, and
they're still declining,'' he said. ``If we're going to make any
progress, land-use restrictions have to be on the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Kier, a Sausalito fisheries consultant specializing in
steelhead and salmon, said the listing could undermine recent
cooperative ventures between landowners and government regulators
to improve the fortunes of the fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the listings so far have been less than successful, except
for the winter-run,'' Kier said. ``Quotas for California coho and
steelhead were already so small on the Klamath River that the only
thing the listing did was put the lodges and guides out of
business. It didn't adequately address water quality or logging, so
the fish are in as much trouble as before.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said he doubts the listing will stop cooperative
ventures, because landowners know they could face tough regulations
under the Endangered Species Act if the fish don't recover.

 CHRON  
EDITORS NOTE: This package is made up of a main story followed by
three optional sidebars. Switch On the Bulbs: Plant now for luminous spring bloom 
 
 
By Janet Fletcher &HT;    c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
SAN FRANCISCO _ The bulb catalogs have been piling up on coffee
tables for weeks now, tempting gardeners 1with drifts of daffodils
and lavishly flowering lilies. But those are someone else's
pictures. How do you get spring-flowering bulbs to perform so
splendidly in your own yard?
<P>
   In fact, bulbs are among the least demanding plants in the
garden, experts say. But to get the best behavior from them, choose
them wisely and plant them well. The following planting guide for
fall bulbs should guarantee good results.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; How to buy: &LR;  Shop early, advises Mimi Luebbermann, the
Petaluma, Calif., co-author of ``Beautiful Bulbs'' (Chronicle
Books, 1998). Catalogs and nurseries tend to have limited supplies
of the most interesting varieties. Ask your favorite nursery when
the bulbs will arrive, and be first in line.
</P>
<P>
   For each variety, buy the biggest bulbs available. Bigger bulbs
produce stronger plants. Each bulb should feel as firm as an onion
and have no scars or bruises, Luebbermann says. ``And if it's dried
or moldy,'' she says, ``don't even think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   With daffodils, look for what Luebbermann calls ``double noses''
_ two bulbs joined together, which will give you twice the bloom.
</P>
<P>
   Although a few local nurseries have extensive fall bulb
selections, Luebbermann prefers mail order. ``You get much, much
more variety,'' she says. ``The bulbs you buy in nurseries are
fairly run-of-the-mill.'' Few nurseries have the space to stock 100
different daffodils, but a daffodil enthusiast will find that many
and more in specialty catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   Last, choose bulbs that are appropriate for Bay Area climates,
says David Morton, associate buyer for the Smith &AMP; Hawken catalog.
Bulbs that need winter chill, such as hybrid tulips, won't reliably
bloom more than once here. Unless you are willing to treat them as
annuals and replant every year, steer clear of them.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; When to plant: &LR;  Wait until the soil cools and warm weather is
behind us, says Nancy Perriera of Orchard Nursery in Lafayette,
Calif. ``If you plant in warm soil, they're going to want to grow
and there's no stopping them,'' she says. Perriera waits until
January so there's no chance the bulbs will jump the gun. Morton
recommends planting in November, before winter rains make the soil
too mucky to work.
</P>
<P>
   Keep tulips in a paper bag in the refrigerator until you are
ready to plant them. Store them away from apples, which emit
ethylene gas that can cause the bulbs to break dormancy. Keep other
bulbs in paper bags in a cool, dark place.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Where to plant: &LR;  Most bulbs want at least six hours of sun a
day. Remember that you can plant early-blooming bulbs under
deciduous trees that won't leaf out until after the bloom. Try not
to plant spring-flowering bulbs in an area that gets lots of summer
water or they may rot.
</P>
<P>
   For spring color in shady areas, consider fritillaria meleagris,
galanthus (snowdrops), oxalis and some species tulips.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; How to plant: &LR;  All bulbs need good drainage. For the clay soils
that predominate in the Bay Area, that means lots of amending.
Morton and Perriera recommend two parts amendment (such as fir bark
with chicken manure) to one part existing soil. Work the amendment
in well to a depth of 8 inches.
</P>
<P>
   To achieve a natural look with impact, plant bulbs lavishly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to think about planting 500 daffodils at a time, or
even 100, but if you can, order bunches,'' Luebbermann advises. And
resist the urge to plant them in a line like soldiers. Groups of
bulbs here and there look more natural. Luebbermann puts five
daffodil bulbs in a 12-inch hole, spacing them apart so they have
room to multiply.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm loving this effect of clumps,'' says the writer, who
admits she had a hard time abandoning the habit of planting in
rows. ``It helped when I stopped buying five of this and five of
that, and I bought 25 of one kind. It really makes a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   She advocates planting containers thickly, too, using a process
known as layering. ``Buy the biggest, deepest pot you can afford,''
she says. ``Then put in, say, a 5-inch layer of potting soil, then
a layer of daffodils, then more potting soil, then another layer of
daffodils.'' Repeat until you reach the top. The daffodils will
come up through each other to produce a lush effect.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you buy through catalogs or at nurseries, your bulbs
will likely come with instructions telling you how deep and how far
apart to plant them. With luck, they'll also tell you which end is
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We often get calls on that,'' says Joyce Hemingson, a
horticulturist with White Flower Farm, a Connecticut mail-order
nursery. ``On a lot of bulbs, you can still see the dried root
material from last year.'' Lacking that, Hemingson says, you can
always plant sideways.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the pointed end goes up, Perriera says. But if you're
unsure, ask at the nursery. As a rule of thumb, plant bulbs at a
depth that's twice their diameter.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; rh1  &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; Naturalizing: &LR;  Gardeners with lots of space may want to try
naturalizing bulbs, planting them in an area where they have room
to reseed and expand naturally, such as an unwatered hillside or
meadow. The idea is to plant them in an unstudied fashion and then
let nature take its course. Over the years, the bulbs will multiply
on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Daffodils, species tulips, ipheion (spring starflower), grape
hyacinth, lilies and galanthus (snowdrop) can be counted on to
naturalize in the Bay Area's climate. Tulips, which require winter
chill, will not.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a small investment now, in five years you can have a
meadow of daffodils,'' Luebbermann says. ``Plant muscari and, in a
couple of years, you'll have a carpet of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Morton says that, in his landscaping days, he achieved a
meadowlike look by throwing bulbs in the air and planting them
where they landed.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Care: &LR;  In theory, new bulbs arrive with all the nourishment
they need stored in the bulb itself. They should flower the first
year without additional feeding. But most experts agree that a
little fertilizer at planting time and during the growing season
will produce longer and stronger bloom.
</P>
<P>
   Morton puts about 1 tablespoon of bone meal into the bottom of
each planting hole, working it in well to avoid burning the bulb.
Once the top growth shows in the spring, he begins feeding monthly
with organic fertilizer and continues feeding until the leaves
yellow, to provide nutrients for the following year.
</P>
<P>
   Hemingson says White Flower Farm promotes another regime:
top-dressing with a complete fertilizer at planting time and again
in early spring when the green growth shows. Bone meal can attract
animals that will want to dig up what you've just planted, she
says. Better to apply the fertilizer above ground, which is what
you do in subsequent years anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The most critical feeding happens naturally, however, as the
leaves turn the sun's rays into energy stored in the bulb for the
next year. Never remove a bulb's leaves until they have died back
naturally or you will compromise the next year's bloom. Hemingson
even advises against braiding or tying the leaves, techniques some
gardeners use for camouflage.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need the sunlight on them and air around them,'' she
says. ``It's better to try to plant something that will come up and
hide the dying foliage.'' Daylilies planted with daffodils, for
example, can mask the bulbs' yellowing leaves and provide another
three months of color.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Make Them Bloom Early Indoors &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you plan now, vases of fragrant paperwhites or a dramatic
amaryllis can add beauty to a home in the dead of winter. By
providing the right conditions, you can force spring-flowering
bulbs to break dormancy and bloom indoors before they would
naturally.
</P>
<P>
   You can force bulbs in soil, sand or vases or bowls filled with
gravel and water. Bulbs vary in the length of time it takes to
force their bloom, but paperwhites take about six weeks. Check a
bulb book for guidance in timing your planting.
</P>
<P>
   To force paperwhites in water, put a layer of pebbles in a vase
or bowl, making the layer thick enough to anchor the roots. Add
just enough water to cover the stones. Adding some activated
charcoal will help keep the water clear. Set the bulbs on the
pebbles so the root ends barely sit in water. Keep the container in
a cool, dark place, replenishing water as necessary to keep it just
below the bulb base.
</P>
<P>
   When the roots develop and there are 2 to 3 inches of top
growth, bring the container out into direct bright light. The bulb
will complete its growth and bloom.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent floppiness, be sure to provide bright light. ``Any
plant that doesn't get enough light will get leggy,'' says Mimi
Luebbermann, the Petaluma co-author of ``Beautiful Bulbs,''
``although they always do anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   She suggests choosing a tall, wide glass vase to provide support
for the stems. Or you can make a restraining hoop for a low
container by spacing three upright lengths of bamboo evenly around
the edges, then wrapping raffia around them to collar the plant
stems.
</P>
<P>
   Some bulbs grow so fast indoors that they are thrilling to
watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give a child an amaryllis, and you might make them instantly a
gardener,'' Luebbermann says. ``My kids' godmother used to give
them one every year, and you can almost see them grow. It's the
best Christmas present you can give a child.''

 OFF THE WALL: Beeping Wallet Nags You to Refill Its Pockets  
   
   
 By Mary Corcoran  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  As paper money slowly turns into debit, ATM and
credit cards, it is becoming increasingly important not to lose
your plastic. To help out, enter the Beeping Wallet.
<TEXT>
<P>
   This innovative money holder created by Kopel Inc. is the first
pa-  &LR; il,9p6,7p  &LR; tented electronic wallet that reminds you whenever
a credit or debit card is removed. The wallet beeps when you take
out your card and continues beeping every 20 seconds until the card
is returned to its slot.
</P>
<P>
   If you're lending your card to your spouse, don't worry. The
wallet won't annoy you with beeps the entire day. The beeping
mechanism automatically shuts off after five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Even better, the wallets look normal, not like clunky electronic
devices. You won't be able to tell by their design, weight or feel
that the wallets can beep.
</P>
<P>
   Inventor David Kopel says the wallet's beeps help keep credit
and other cards secure.
</P>
<P>
   Beeping Wallets are hand stitched and made of soft grain
leather. They come in 14 men's and women's styles. They range in
price from $14 for a basic L-shaped billfold with three secured
credit card slots to $45 for a secured document holder that can
protect airline tickets and passport as well as credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   Other designs include checkbook covers, trifold wallets and
french purses. Each wallet uses a battery guaranteed to last three
years. The battery can be replaced with a standard watch battery.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the battery nor the beeping mechanism affects the
magnetic strips on debit and credit cards. But nonbeeping styles
are available for those looking for only a traditional wallet.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
WHERE TO FIND IT
</P>
<P>
   The Beeping Wallet can be ordered online at www.beeping &QL;

 Editors note: Psst! Read the latest? If not, you haven't

great 
 new home-and-garden items and places to visit.   JURASSIC ART: Fossils Bring Life to Tabletops  
   
   
 NAPA, Calif. _  Antiques date back decades, maybe hundreds, of
years. But what do you call pieces that go back millions of years?
<TEXT>
<P>
   Well,  &UR; Chajo &LR;  calls its creations ``Fossil Stone'' fine
furnishings. Each table from this Napa company features an eons-old
limestone surface, sporting different types of fossilized fish.
</P>
<P>
   The stone dates back more than 50 million years to the Eocene
Epoch, when mammals first emerged as dominant land animals; the
fossils are from freshwater fish that swam in North American lakes.
The materials come from a quarry in Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   The limestone-encased fossils become tabletops and are sometimes
surrounded by accent stone and wood. They sit on handcrafted iron
bases.
</P>
<P>
   Chajo owners Chanin Cook and Jon Edie mostly worked with ceramic
tiles and glass before they found their new nitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fossils are an interesting medium to work with,'' Cook says.
``You can't just walk into a store and say, `I'd like this one and
this one.'''
</P>
<P>
   The furnishings range from magazine racks (pictured at far
right, from $900) to side tables (pictured, from $900) to coffee
tables (starting at $2,400).
</P>
<P>
   Chajo also takes custom orders. ``We once had a woman order a
custom 4 feet by 4 feet coffee table,'' Cook says. ``We worked with
her to create tiles of fossiled stone, with an occasional featured
specimen.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  For more information or to order Chajo furnishings, call &LR; 
 &LR; (707) 257-3676 or visit  &LR; www.chajo.com.

 &UR; SPRINKLERS AND MORE: Play Misty for Me &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; FORT BRAGG, Calif. _ &LR;  Does your lawn make you yawn? Maybe you need
a funky new sprinkler to add panache to that turf.
</P>
<P>
   A Mendocino catalog company has the answer for you. Sprinklers
from the  &UR; Wind &AMP; Weather &LR;  catalog are veritable works of lawn art.
The pirouetting Ballerina Sprinkler (pictured, $485), which shoots
water 80 feet in diameter, sports a copper tutu and has old English
coins as eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The handcrafted copper Snail Sprinkler ($55) sprays a gentle
mist 40 feet. Both the snail and the ballerina hook up to regular
garden hoses, and their copper parts will become patinated with
time.
</P>
<P>
   Another model, the dainty Tulip Sprinkler ($38.50), is made of
rusted iron and hooks up to drip irrigation systems.
</P>
<P>
   The Lawn Loon Hose Holder ($88), made of recyled steel parts in
a cartoonlike bird shape, comes in handy when your hose isn't being
used.
</P>
<P>
   The catalog also offers many other yard accessories, such as the
Scarecrow Silhouette ($39.50), a 5-foot, 2-inch steel scarecrow
frame that spins in the wind in whatever outfit you choose for it.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these items are also available at the Wind &AMP; Weather
retail store in Fort Bragg. Any one of them will certainly make
your neighbors green with lawn envy.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The Wind &AMP; Weather retail store is open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. &LR; 
 &LR; daily at 147 Laurel St., Fort Bragg; (800) 922-9463. Order a &LR;

 PLANT OF THE WEEK: Barrel of a Cactus  
   
   
 By Tara Duggan  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 Plant name:  Golden barrel cactus ( Echinocactus grusonii ).
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Type of plant: &LR;  Perennial.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Description: &LR;  A rotund, golden-spined cactus native to Mexico
with short thorns and large ribs. Very old specimens have been
known to grow up to several feet across and up to 21/2 feet in
diameter. In April and May, the plant is crowned with yellow
flowers, which are usually 2 inches in diameter.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Microclimate: &LR;  Grows well in most of the Bay Area. Enjoys full
sun when grown in the ground and partial shade when grown in a
container. Will tolerate temperatures only slightly below freezing
unless protected.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Cultural requirements: &LR;  Plants can be grown indoors in a
container as well as outdoors in the ground. Golden barrels prefer
fast-draining, rich soil. If grown in a container, they should be
fertilized at least three times a year, using a general-purpose
fertilizer (5-10-15). This plant adapts wellto indoor growing
conditions if adequate light is provided. In summer, water at least
every two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Bloom period: &LR;  April and May. Golden barrels usually start
flowering when they're about 10 to 12 inches in diameter.
</P>
<P>

RISE IN DAMAGING UV RADIATION LINKED DIRECTLY TO OZONE DEPLETION
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By DAVID PERLMAN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Levels of the sun's damaging ultraviolet radiation that burns
the skin of beachgoers and disrupts the DNA of plants and animals
have increased dangerously over the past decade, scientists have
found.
</P>
<P>
   And for the first time, their measurements link the increases
directly to the long-noted annual decline in the Earth's protective
layers of ozone as high as the upper stratosphere.
</P>
<P>
   The ``ozone hole'' phenomenon was first discovered 25 years ago
above Antarctica and New Zealand, and has since been confirmed over
wide areas of the Northern Hemisphere as well in a series of
measurements by balloon-borne instruments, high-flying NASA
aircraft and satellite observations.
</P>
<P>
   The alarming decrease in atmospheric ozone _ largely caused by
worldwide pollution in the upper atmosphere from chemicals called
chlorofluorocarbons _ led to the 1987 Montreal Protocol in which
more than 140 nations have agreed to ban those chemicals by the end
of this century.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. banned their production in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Ozone is itself a toxic gas, but in the Earth's upper
atmosphere, in regions ranging from 10 to 25 miles high, ozone acts
as a shield against the dangerous frequencies of ultraviolet
radiation known as UV-B.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the best of sunblock ointments and skin creams, UV-B, in
turn, can cause blistering sunburns that lead to skin cancers; it
can cause damaging cataracts in human eyes, and disrupt long
sequences of DNA in bacteria and algae that are particularly vital
to the ecological health of marine life.
</P>
<P>
   But until now there has been no firm evidence linking the
depletion of ozone to increases in UV-B radiation reaching the
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   In an article published Friday in the journal Science, however,
scientists from New Zealand's National Institute of Water and
Atmospheric Research report that over the past 10 years peak levels
of sunburning UV radiation reaching their monitoring instruments
have increased by 12 percent _ a finding that correlates
significantly with the annual losses of ozone in the atmosphere
above New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   During the southern nation's summer of 1998-99 (winter here in
the Northern Hemisphere) peak levels of the skin-burning,
DNA-damaging UV radiation were the highest ever measured, the
scientists say. UV levels that winter were 15 to 20 percent higher
than in the late 1970s, when research measurements first began soon
after the ``ozone hole'' was discovered spreading outward in the
upper atmosphere from Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
   The report in Science, which came from a New Zealand team led by
atmospheric physicist Richard McKenzie, ``provides the strongest
evidence yet that a degraded atmospheric ozone layer causes more
hazardous conditions for life on the planet's surface,'' according
to a research news article in the same journal.

 NO SINKERS IN CHINA BASIN  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Channeling Archimedes: Breakfast at Fred's place in Sausalito,
and as is often the case, the talk turns to science. Specifically,
do baseballs float?
</P>
<P>
   Important question, since Father Guido Sarducci (Don Novello) is
assembling a team of dogs to retrieve home runs hit out of the
Giants' new ballpark and into China Basin.
</P>
<P>
   A poll is taken: 19 say baseballs do not float, 1 says they do,
2 say shut up and pass the ketchup.
</P>
<P>
   The lone ``no'' vote, Dick Seashore (not his real name, of
course; his real name is Richard), trots over to the Big 5 sporting
goods store, where the manager donates a ball to science, so to
speak.
</P>
<P>
   Seashore fills the men's room sink, drops ball and ... ``It
floats! With almost an inch showing above water. So the dogs won't
have to wear diving masks.''
</P>
<P>
   Prof. Seashore forgets that baseballs will float even higher in
salt water and that pollution in China Basin will help even more.
You'd think a guy named Seashore would know that.
</P>
<P>
   IF WE MUST allow spectators into the mayoral debates _ and why
must we, since the debates are televised and radiovised? _ let's do
it right.
</P>
<P>
   Allow only professional comedians with bullhorns. This is no job
for amateur hecklers.
</P>
<P>
   Why do the Brown-Jordan-Reilly debates need a goober gallery of
hooting and braying electonerds?
</P>
<P>
   CUTE MOMENT right after the debate, spotted by Ben Eilenberg:
</P>
<P>
   One of Clint Reilly's lackeys drove up to the curb, jumped out
of the car and ran around to open the door for the boss ... and
locked everyone out of the car.
</P>
<P>
   So the Reilly party had to hoof it back to headquarters. What,
no Muni?
</P>
<P>
   Next debate, someone should accidentally lock the auditorium
doors and send all the candidates' supporters into the park to play
on the swings and slides.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T's T&AMP;A: Mike Ostfeld got his AT&AMP;T Cable bill, along with a
flyer stating, ``On TCI Digital Cable, all pay-per-view movies are
only $2.99.''
</P>
<P>
   On Mike's bill was one ``regular'' movie at $2.99 and four
``adult'' movies at prices from $3.99 to $5.99.
</P>
<P>
   Osfeld phoned and was told that ``all movies for $2.99 doesn't
include adult movies.''
</P>
<P>
   Since he never ordered or watched (honest!) any of the adult
movies, they were deleted from his bill, including $3.99 for
``Dance of Desire.''
</P>
<P>
   Moral of story: Check your bill closely for mistakes and hot
movie suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   YOU KNOW you're in San Francisco, says Brian Bringardner, when
you wear two sweatshirts and a winter coat to a baseball game and
the people in front of you are eating sushi.

<P>
   WARRIORS' coach P.J. Carlesimo is buying Adolfo's Restaurant in

</P>
<P>
   It has been kiddie week on ``Jeopardy,'' and the 11- and
12-year-olds are very mature, but Karen Douglas wonders if they
really need that runner-up's prize: A bottle of Centrum Silver
vitamins for seniors.
</P>
<P>
   CLOSE ENCOUNTERS of the nerd kind:
</P>
<P>
   (And you thought you'd heard every possible bad pun on that
movie title.)
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there are government nuclear-weapons research secrets
worth stealing: The reports from our scientists on their romantic
affairs with foreign spies, reports now demanded by the Department
of Energy.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, one-night stands are exempted from DOE scrutiny.
Why? My guess is that our scientists aren't sluts. In terms of
sensitive secrets, they don't put out on the first date.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Green wonders, ``Will the kiss-and-tell mandate conflict
with the don't ask/don't tell policy, if the scientist is a member
of the armed services having a gay affair?''
</P>
<P>
   Only an IRS agent could answer a question that complicated,
Dennis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder,'' wonders Kathy Guerrero, ``if the DOE has a form
for reporting these encounters?''

<P>
   And if it was a threesome, do you have to file the report in
triplicate?

CALIFORNIA LAWMAKERS PASS HMO REFORMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ More than 14 million Californians would
have the right to sue their HMOs and to get a second opinion from
another doctor under a series of health care reforms passed by the
California Legislature and supported by Gov. Gray Davis.
</P>
<P>
   In the final hours of the 1999 legislative session, which ended
Friday, lawmakers hurriedly wrote and amended several HMO-reform
measures Davis proposed only three weeks ago. Lawmakers also added
several new reforms not requested by the Democratic governor.
</P>
<P>
   Davis recently told the Legislature to slow down on HMO reform,
but lawmakers nevertheless approved measures that would force HMOs
to pay for contraceptives and mental health drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Davis has been leery of approving too many mandates on HMOs,
fearing premiums will rise. Despite his misgivings, Davis is
expected to sign the bill.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most significant bills requires HMOs to pay for
mental health drugs for adults and children.
</P>
<P>
   The mandate would cover schizophrenia, manic depression,
obsessive-compulsiveness, anorexia and bulimia, among other severe
mental illnesses in the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a brother of a schizophrenia patient, I have been waiting
for this for a long time,'' said State Sen. Don Perata, a Democrat
from Oakland. ``Finally, we have to acknowledge that the biological
causes of mental illness are no different than those of other
diseases.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers also approved a measure giving patients the right to
have an independent doctor review medical decisions by HMOs if
treatment is delayed or refused.
</P>
<P>
   A separate bill requires HMOs to pay for a second medical
opinion if the patients don't like the advice they get from their
primary doctor.
</P>
<P>
   The external review system would be run by the state. Six other
states have external review systems, and reviewers in those states
have supported patients' demands 90 percent of the time, according
to one study.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now if you pay for health care at enormous cost and
you're denied something, you just have to grouse about it and
suffer in silence,'' said Assemblywoman Carole Migden, a Democrat
from San Francisco and author of the measure. ``This gives an
option for a patient to seek accountability.''
</P>
<P>
   But the most debated and lobbied health care bill of the session
would let patients sue their HMOs if they suffer substantial
physical or financial harm because of an HMO decision to deny or
delay care.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers could only sue after exhausting all other options
through independent review, and could only seek damages if they
were denied medically necessary treatment, rather than a broader
medically appropriate standard sought by some consumer advocates.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than any other reform this year, this legislation helps
to even the grossly skewed balance of power between patients and
their HMOs,'' said Jaime Court, a consumer and trial attorney
advocate monitoring HMO legislation. ``Seriously harmed patients
will now have a big stick to wave at their HMO. Hopefully, they
will never have to use it.''
</P>
<P>
   HMO industry spokespeople said it was disappointed with the
liability bill because of last-minute amendments. Those would allow
patients to skip the external review system and sue HMOs if they
paid for medical services out of their own pockets and were already
substantially harmed by an illness the HMO wouldn't cover.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think that's what the governor had in mind,'' said
Walter Zelman, chief executive of the California Association of
Health Plans, the central HMO lobbying group. ``We hope to clean
that up through the legislative process next year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature also approved a measure requiring HMOs to
approve or deny medical care within five days in most cases and
within 72 hours for urgent procedures. Only medical professionals
could make those initial decisions.

 &HT;    KEY BLACK TECH PROFESSIONALS GATHER AT WHITE HOUSE IN BID TO
NARROW 'DIGITAL DIVIDE'
 &HT;    600&AMP;ADD
 &HT;    Moving in both (w) Washington and (f) Financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seeking to enhance the online skills of
African-Americans, a small but growing vanguard of black
information technology professionals has been exchanging e-mail and
visiting each other's Web sites. This week, they met directly for
the first time to launch a renewed effort to bridge the ``digital
divide'' that curbs minority access to cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took the White House to bring everybody together,'' said
Jena Roscoe, associate director of the president's office of public
liaison, who organized the two days of intensive briefings for the
African-American Internet community, which ended Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Some 70 participants from across the nation attended the unique
event, held in the ornate Indian Treaty Room on the fourth floor of
the Old Executive Office Building, where President Dwight
Eisenhower once held his news conferences.
</P>
<P>
   The participants heard from a wide array of top White House
aides responsible for race initiatives, science,
telecommunications, and technology policy; electronic commerce,
economic development and minority community empowerment. Also
present were key figures from the departments of Commerce,
Education and Transportation, as well as the Federal Communications
Commission, the Small Business Administration and Minority Business
Development Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Although the briefings were closed to the press, the White House
allowed a Cox Newspapers reporter to sit in on some of the
sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speakers were great,'' said Dionne Muhammed, whose
Atlanta-based site, www.AshantiTech.com, is ``dedicated to
increasing technology awareness in the black community'' and which
offers, among other services, free E-mail ``with an Afrocentric
flair.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' she added, ``the speakers weren't really necessary.
What happened here is that we finally put the faces together with
the Web sites. We were able to add the all-important human touch.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Derrick Brown of Marietta, Ga., executive director of
KnowledgeBase, a non-profit unit with a broad mission to foster
online training among minority students:
</P>
<P>
   ``My experience here has convinced me that ... our initial
investment must be to foster a stronger sense of community and
collaboration among the leaders of this movement. That is, we must
all see the same end, and channel our collective efforts towards
that end.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown also noted that further investments must focus on creating
technology centers in churches, schools and community centers as
well as opening access to capital markets. Subsequent investments
also must be made to continue developing compelling content
targeted at minority groups, ``produced by companies that we
collaborates to build,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will allow our (minority) leadership to build the
capacity necessary to make significant impact. We must teach each
other the leadership and entrepreneurial skills necessary to gain
access to these markets,'' Brown concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the closing reception, where the networking
efforts continued, the visitors, each of whom paid his or her own
way here, heard from Courtland Cox, director of the Minority
Business Development Agency, an arm of the Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nation's big corporations are finally coming to understand
that they have to set up marketing strategies to deal with minority
groups,'' Cox said. ``There are now some 2 million minority-owned
businesses in this country and more of them need to get on the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Cox previewed for the group a new U.S. Census Bureau analysis
due to be released Sept. 22. It shows, he said, ``that over the
next 50 years the U.S. population will grow by some 120 million and
that 90 percent of that growth will be minority.''
</P>
<P>
   By 2050, Cox said, 47.2 percent of all Americans will belong to
minority groups. The four states that will account by then for a
quarter of the overall population _ California, Texas, New York and
Illinois _ ``will all be majority minority,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of those projections, limited minority usage of the
Internet has created a ``digital divide'' between those who have
access to online services and other new technologies, and those who
do not.
</P>
<P>
   A Commerce Department survey released last July revealed that
only about one in four black and Hispanic households owns a
computer with Internet access, compared with half or more of Asian
and non-Hispanic white households. That study also showed that
Asians are ahead of all other groups, including non-Hispanic
whites. Overall, the poorest and least educated Americans, as well
as single parents, have the biggest problem keeping up.

LIGHTENING REMAINS WONDEROUS MYSTERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Lightning struck the San Francisco and Monterey
Bay areas about 1,500 times overnight earlier this week in a rare
display of one of nature's most glorious _ and still somewhat
mysterious _ phenomena.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time anyone around here can remember that number of
lightning strokes is 10, 12 years ago,'' said Dan Polster, a
meteorologist at the National Weather Service office in Monterey.
</P>
<P>
   Californians rarely see lightning. According to a 1995 estimate
by PG&AMP;E, lightning causes an average of only 3 percent of the
utility's outages.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Golden State, though, lightning is a real-life
hazard, one that burns down buildings, fries golfers, burns holes
in airplanes, incinerates forests and knocks out electrical grids
supplying millions of customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a fantastic night. It was like being in New Orleans,
but without the seafood,'' said Vito Longo, manager of electrical
distribution systems at the Electric Power Research Institute
(EPRI) in Palo Alto. ``It was a stunning storm for this area of the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Humanity owes a lot to lightning. According to some theorists,
the first chemical building blocks of life _ our evolutionary
ancestors _ might have formed on Earth billions of years ago when a
lightning bolt struck a pond.
</P>
<P>
   Also, early humans might have discovered fire when they first
noticed a blaze in a lightning-ignited forest.
</P>
<P>
   And the modern age of electrical engineering and electronics _
from light bulbs to power grids to TV to cell phones to the World
Wide Web _ stems from 18th-century experiments by Ben Franklin and
others, who used kites in dangerous attempts to attract and study
lightning.
</P>
<P>
   A typical lightning bolt is an inch wide and as hot as 100,000
degrees Fahrenheit. That's 10 times as hot as the surface
temperature of the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists still debate how lightning forms. They agree that a
lightning bolt is a giant electrical spark that connects positive
and negative electrical charges within a thunderstorm.
</P>
<P>
   It's a giant version of the electric spark anyone can create on
a cold, dry day by shuffling across a thick carpet, then touching a
doorknob.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how the positive and negative charges are separated in
the first place remains contested, though. The leading explanation
is that within the thundercloud, falling droplets of water and ice
crystals rub together, knocking off negatively charged subatomic
particles called electrons. Later the electrons are reconnected
with the atoms in the searing flashes called lightning.
</P>
<P>
   Every second, 100 or so lightning bolts flash somewhere around
the world. The constant electrical crackling continually recharges
the natural ``electrical circuit'' of Earth's atmosphere _ and has
for billions of years.
</P>
<P>
   Lightning research is undergoing a kind of renaissance, thanks
to a sensational discovery a decade ago: ``sprites.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, atmospheric physicist Bernard Vonnegut of the
State University of New York and a colleague suspected that a
previously unknown form of electrical activity was going on in the
upper atmosphere. The two published a scientific article citing
reports by airline pilots of huge, odd glows or lightning-like
flashes above thunderclouds. However, the scientific community as a
whole didn't take such reports seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1989, University of Alaska scientists imaged these
above-the-thundercloud glows, or ``sprites,'' using a video camera.
</P>
<P>
   In still images, these momentary bursts of light _ some of them
hundreds of miles wide _ resemble fireworks or creatures like
spiders or crabs.
</P>
<P>
   They are part of a larger class of exotic electrical phenomena _
dubbed ``blue jets'' and ``elfs'' _ in the upper atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Lightning causes more than $100 million annually in damage to
U.S. electrical grids, according to a 1995 estimate by officials at
EPRI, a research and development arm of the nation's electric
utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have dreamed for decades of firing or dropping long
wires into thunderstorms in order to weaken them by draining their
electrical charge before they hit populated areas.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-20th century, at the height of the U.S. Forest
Service's ``Smokey the Bear'' publicity campaign (``Only you can
prevent forest fires''), the agency attempted such experiments in
hope of finding a way to prevent lightning-triggered forest fires.
</P>
<P>
   The effort was eventually abandoned, perhaps because Forest
Service scientists realized that natural fires are, in fact, vital
parts of the natural ecosystem, destroying accumulated brush and
allowing resurgence of new plants and animals.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, with funds from EPRI, researchers at the
University of New Mexico have investigated ways to control
lightning with lasers. In laboratory tests, the laser flash creates
a brief, electrically conductive or ``ionized gas'' channel.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, such ion channels could be created in the atmosphere
by ground-based lasers during a lightning storm. The result would
be numerous invisible ``lightning rods'' that could suck the
electricity from the storm. Experts envision posting such devices
at golf courses and other lightning-prone places.

   HOUSE: In the midst of a fiscal crunch that requires cutting
more than $2 million from the budget, officials at the University
of Missouri-Kansas City are eyeing several hundred thousand dollars
worth of renovations for the chancellor's residence. The curators
were set to meet to talk about the renovations today, but the
curators decided to shelve the idea until a new chancellor arrives
in January. Former UMKC Chancellor Eleanor Schwartz, who left in
disgrace in February after a troubled year on campus, just moved
out of the residence last week. For the last seven months, the
university has paid for her to live in the residence, while also
paying $3,750 a month for interim chancellor Gordon Lamb to live in
an apartment on the Country Club Plaza. Lynn Franey. Photo. 20.

GROWING NUMBERS OF MULTIRACIAL AMERICANS CHANGES RACE DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANNIE NAKAO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PIEDMONT, Calif. _ Piedmont teenager Michelle Behrens knows her
family tree.
</P>
<P>
   One grandfather was a native of the Netherlands who founded the
National Symphony in Washington, D.C. The other was one of the
Tuskegee Airmen, the fabled squadron of African American fliers in
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   As a biracial child, Michelle, 15, is proud of her heritage.
</P>
<P>
   It's the outside world that might not understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``That whole thing about choosing between sides _ I can really
relate to being put in that situation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Demographic studies estimate 7 percent of Americans are biracial
or multiracial. Their swelling ranks _ they are projected to
comprise 21 percent of the U.S. population by 2050 _ could
dramatically alter the discussion of race in this country.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday evening, that national issue will get a boost with the
kickoff of a 10-hour PBS documentary series on a New York
interracial couple and their biracial children.
</P>
<P>
   ``An American Love Story,'' presented by the American Playhouse
and Independent Television Service, is being compared to the
landmark series, ``An American Family,'' which 30 years ago focused
on the Loud family of Santa Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   But the story of Bill Sims, who is African American, his wife
Karen Wilson, who is white, and their biracial daughters, Cicily
and Chaney, is expected to provoke a deeper national debate about
race and its confounding complexities by exploring the daily lives
of one interracial couple and their children.
</P>
<P>
   The debate got under way Wednesday night when about 100 East Bay
residents gathered in Piedmont to preview a segment of the series.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was the third organized in Piedmont by the
Television Race Initiative, which works as a partner with local
communities to provoke discussion and problem-solving around issues
of race.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is simple _ tie community-based gatherings to
high-profile television broadcasts to break the ice and encourage
conversation on a notoriously difficult topic, even in the diverse
San Francisco area.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing a national debate to the community level makes sense,
said Barbara Ludlom, the series' executive producer and a Piedmont
resident.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where we live, shop, go to the library,'' said Ludlom.
``You can see people want the opportunity to talk.''
</P>
<P>
   And talk they did.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of work to do,'' said Joyce Hicks, 47 and
African American, who attended the meeting with her husband, Eric
Behrens, 51, who is white, and daughter Michelle. ``What this film
showed was that things have not changed much.''
</P>
<P>
   In the segment, Cicily, the older daughter, has a rough first
year at predominantly white Colgate University in upstate New York,
then spends a semester in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   Cicily, raised in a family where color has no meaning, is
ostracized by the tiny, close-knit African American student
community for associating with whites, and tensions erupt while she
is abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Defiantly, she says in the film, ``I don't fit. I don't mind not
fitting into anybody's pigeonhole because that's not where I want
to be.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What Cicily said was that (race) didn't become an issue until
she went away to college,'' said Hicks. ``That's going to be a
similar situation for my children.''
</P>
<P>
   Hicks and Behrens, both lawyers, often talk to Michelle and her
17-year-old brother, Philip, about issues of race and their family
backgrounds. They also push the children to excel academically and
develop interests that boost their self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, Hicks said, she knows ``the transition from our home
into the world, which still has much separation and racism, won't
be seamless. I don't have any easy answers. My children understand
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin O'Brien, 35, of Oakland, whose wife, Deanna, 32, is
African American, thinks interracial relationships are inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come from all over _ they're going to mix it up and the
result will be biracial children,'' O'Brien said. ``The country's
only going to get browner.''
</P>
<P>
   Demographers back him up, noting that increasing numbers of
multiracial people will come from future generations of Asians and
Latinos, who will assimilate by marrying whites.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, 16 percent of Asians and 17 percent of Latinos can
claim other ancestry as well. By 2050, a third of Asians and 45
percent of Latinos will be of mixed heritage, according to Barry
Edmonston, a demographer with Portland State University, and Jeff
Passel of the Washington, D.C.- based Urban Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't see the full impact until the next generation,''
Edmonston said.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with other groups, blacks tend to marry within their
own group, reflecting their historic rigid segregation from other
groups. What's more, some believe it is black-white couples who
have drawn the most hostility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a bigger issue because of the history of this
country, where black people have been treated as cattle,'' said
Martinez resident Tra Holloway Boxer, an African American family
therapist who is herself in an interracial relationship with a
white man.
</P>
<P>
   ``This culture even has a name for white-Asian couples _
Eurasian,'' she said. ``There is no name for black-white couples.''
</P>
<P>
   The O'Briens said they have never encountered overt racism or
comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's never happened in the San Francisco rea,'' said Kevin
O'Brien. ``But people still stare, though it's more out of
curiosity.''
</P>
<P>
   As for their children's potential identity issues, the O'Briens,
who have two young sons, ages 3-and-1/2 and 1, said they hadn't
even thought about it until their first son was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``They asked what we wanted to put down on the birth
certificate,'' O'Brien said. ``I told them to put down
`American.'''
</P>
<P>
   The show, however, has had impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``What hit me more than anything was seeing what might happen to
my own sons,'' said O'Brien. ``It really made me think.''

<P>
   DRESDEN, Germany _ On a cold autumn night in 1938, marauding
Nazis put this city's elegant, century-old synagogue to the torch.
</P>
<P>
   As the flames flickered across on the nearby Elbe River, the
stormtroopers stopped firefighters from putting out the blaze and
instead ordered them to keep it from spreading to neighboring
buildings. Only the Star of David from the church's dome was saved.
</P>
<P>
   Six decades after the attack during what became known as
``Kristallanacht,'' Dresden's Jews are trying to raise a new
synagogue from the weeds of the long vacant site of the old one.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, workers began turning earth at the site near
the city's baroque heart, the preliminary steps to begin heavy
construction this autumn.
</P>
<P>
   However, the synagogue's supporters worry they will not have
enough money to complete the project, which will cost approximately
US$12 million.
</P>
<P>
   After two years of fundraising, the construction kitty stands
about $4 million short, said Siegfried Reimann, the head of the
association building the synagogue _ the first new one in the old
East Germany since the war.
</P>
<P>
   Reimann is particularly disappointed by the response of German
businesses. His group, to its continuing frustration, has sent
scores of letters to the country's leading banks and businesses
seeking contributions with only modest success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone says money is very difficult, that it is very
tight,'' Reimann said during a recent interview with Cox Newspapers
in the association's small offices in suburban Dresden.
</P>
<P>
   He is most troubled by the contrasting ease with which more than
US$150 million has been raised to rebuild the imposing baroque
Frauenkirche, the domed protestant church that has been in ruins
since Allied bombing raids in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is much money in Germany _ but not for a synagogue,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Riemann cited the response of the Dresdner Bank,
which was founded and operated by Jews until the Third Reich
ejected them in 1933. The bank has pledged about US$30,000 to the
synagogue, a fraction of the US$3 million it has given to the
Frauenkirche project.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Dresdner Bank employees have contributed another
US$2 million to the Protestant church through a company-endorsed
program, said Stefan Lutz, a bank spokesman. The bank also has
spearheaded a campaign that has raised about US$45 million for the
Frauenkirche.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a big difference: The Frauenkirche is regarded as an
international symbol for peace which was destroyed at the end of
the second world war,'' Lutz said. ``And the synagogue is not that
kind of symbol. It's a symbol in a different way as huge as the
Frauenkirche.''
</P>
<P>
   The synagogue has been embraced by the local and state
governments, which have contributed about US$3 million. ``Helping
the construction of a new synagogue is not only an obligation but
an opportunity to demonstrate civic duty and solidarity,'' Kurt
Biedenkopf, the minister president of the state of Saxony said in a
fundraising brochure. ``After all, it was the citizens of Dresden
who destroyed the synagogue.''
</P>
<P>
   The site is at the end of a series of terraces that meander
alongside the river past the city, once known as ``Florence on the
Elbe.'' Dresden has been in various stages of reconstruction since
two nights in February 1945, when Allied planes dropped tons of
incendiary bombs on the city killing at least 35,000 people and
leaving the city center a vast field of rubble.
</P>
<P>
   The communist East German government supported the
reconstruction of some architectural jewels, most notably the
Zwinger, a 280-year-old baroque complex of elegant buildings,
fountains and gardens that was a favorite play spot for Europe's
18th Century beautiful people. However, the communists also heaped
their share of massive and monstrous socialist architecture on the
city. Today, Dresden, whose streets are crowded with new cafes and
the sounds of jazz mingled with polka tunes, hums with new
construction, much of it intended to fit in with the city's
glorious architectural past.
</P>
<P>
   City officials see the synagogue as integral to this continuing
reconstruction. ``If you are going to rebuild the great churches of
Dresden, you must also provide a synagogue,'' said Gerd Kinzel, a
spokesman for the city.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly 50 years, the fledgling Jewish community has held its
services in a building at the old Jewish cemetery. Not only is the
funeral hall too small, it violates Jewish laws against holding
services for the living in a place for the dead.
</P>
<P>
   About 6,000 Jews lived in Dresden at the onset of World War II.
Only about 50 survived the Holocaust, and only about 60 Jews were
in the city at the end of the Cold War in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, Jews have come here from the
former Soviet Union and its satellites. Community leaders expect
the population to reach 300 by the end of the year making the need
for a new synagogue urgent.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to serving practical needs _ ceremonies such as
weddings and bar mitzvahs have been very difficult to hold _ the
complex will mean as much or more for what it represents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an important symbol of normalization _ of acceptance,''
Reimann said.
</P>
<P>
   The design by Berlin architects Wandel, Hoefer, Lorch &AMP; Hirsch
is as stark as the old synagogue created in 1840 by famed architect
Gottfried Semper was ornate. Semper also designed Dresden's famous
opera house.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed complex includes two cubical buildings, one a
temple the other a community center. The temple is turned slightly
toward Jerusalem. A space will be left empty between the buildings
to represent the loss of the old synagogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``This also symbolizes the destruction of the Jewish community,
and the two buildings show double destruction of Dresden, not just
by the Nazis in '38 but also in the bombings of '45,'' said
Wolfgang Lorch, one of the architects.
</P>
<P>
   The completion of the synagogue may also bring Dresden its first
resident rabbi in decades. The city is now served by a traveling
rabbi from Berlin who includes Dresden on a circuit of German
cities. The complex also will have a shop for kosher food, a
problem for Jews in the pork loving city.
</P>
<P>
   It is scheduled to be completed by 2002 _ if enough money can be
found.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue trying to raise the funds as we build,''
Reimann said. ``What else can we do?''
</P>
<P>

US$2 million to the Protestant church through a company-endorsed
program, said Stefan Lutz, a bank spokesman. The bank also has
spearheaded a campaign that has raised about US$45 million for the
Frauenkirche.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a big difference: The Frauenkirche is regarded as an
international symbol for peace which was destroyed at the end of
the second world war,'' Lutz said. ``And the synagogue is not that
kind of symbol. It's a symbol in a different way as huge as the
Frauenkirche.''
</P>
<P>
   The synagogue has been embraced by the local and state
governments, which have contributed about US$3 million. ``Helping
the construction of a new synagogue is not only an obligation but
an opportunity to demonstrate civic duty and solidarity,'' Kurt
Biedenkopf, the minister president of the state of Saxony said in a
fundraising brochure. ``After all, it was the citizens of Dresden
who destroyed the synagogue.''
</P>
<P>
   The site is at the end of a series of terraces that meander
alongside the river past the city, once known as ``Florence on the
Elbe.'' Dresden has been in various stages of reconstruction since
two nights in February 1945, when Allied planes dropped tons of
incendiary bombs on the city killing at least 35,000 people and
leaving the city center a vast field of rubble.
</P>
<P>
   The communist East German government supported the
reconstruction of some architectural jewels, most notably the
Zwinger, a 280-year-old baroque complex of elegant buildings,
fountains and gardens that was a favorite play spot for Europe's
18th Century beautiful people. However, the communists also heaped
their share of massive and monstrous socialist architecture on the
city. Today, Dresden, whose streets are crowded with new cafes and
the sounds of jazz mingled with polka tunes, hums with new
construction, much of it intended to fit in with the city's
glorious architectural past.
</P>
<P>
   City officials see the synagogue as integral to this continuing
reconstruction. ``If you are going to rebuild the great churches of
Dresden, you must also provide a synagogue,'' said Gerd Kinzel, a
spokesman for the city.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly 50 years, the fledgling Jewish community has held its
services in a building at the old Jewish cemetery. Not only is the
funeral hall too small, it violates Jewish laws against holding
services for the living in a place for the dead.
</P>
<P>
   About 6,000 Jews lived in Dresden at the onset of World War II.
Only about 50 survived the Holocaust, and only about 60 Jews were
in the city at the end of the Cold War in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, Jews have come here from the
former Soviet Union and its satellites. Community leaders expect
the population to reach 300 by the end of the year making the need
for a new synagogue urgent.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to serving practical needs _ ceremonies such as
weddings and bar mitzvahs have been very difficult to hold _ the
complex will mean as much or more for what it represents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an important symbol of normalization _ of acceptance,''
Reimann said.
</P>
<P>
   The design by Berlin architects Wandel, Hoefer, Lorch &AMP; Hirsch
is as stark as the old synagogue created in 1840 by famed architect
Gottfried Semper was ornate. Semper also designed Dresden's famous
opera house.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed complex includes two cubical buildings, one a
temple the other a community center. The temple is turned slightly
toward Jerusalem. A space will be left empty between the buildings
to represent the loss of the old synagogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``This also symbolizes the destruction of the Jewish community,
and the two buildings show double destruction of Dresden, not just
by the Nazis in '38 but also in the bombings of '45,'' said
Wolfgang Lorch, one of the architects.
</P>
<P>
   The completion of the synagogue may also bring Dresden its first
resident rabbi in decades. The city is now served by a traveling
rabbi from Berlin who includes Dresden on a circuit of German
cities. The complex also will have a shop for kosher food, a
problem for Jews in the pork loving city.
</P>
<P>
   It is scheduled to be completed by 2002 _ if enough money can be
found.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue trying to raise the funds as we build,''
Reimann said. ``What else can we do?''
</P>

   TAKE-BOS  
 SAN FRANCISCO: ... more catches.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He is arguably the greatest football player to ever wear a
uniform, a title he has said many times he wants. Certainly no one
can argue with his numbers, numbers that continued to rise last
year in a season in which he began to feel for the first time his
team gently pushing him to the side.
</P>
<P>
   At 36, Rice had 82 receptions for 1,157 yards, yet didn't feel
he was the man the Niners looked to any more after battling to
recover from two knee surgeries in 1997, injuries that limited him
to two games and seven receptions that year.
</P>
<P>
   But the measure of Jerry Rice was not the numbers two and seven
in 1997. The real measure of who he was and who he remains is the
number 105 in 1997. That is how many days it took him to come back
from torn anterior cruciate and medial collateral ligaments in his
left knee after being tackled by Tampa Bay's Warren Sapp. It was
the first major injury of his career, the first test of both the
King of the Hill and The Hill itself, and Rice passed it perhaps
better than any athlete in history.
</P>
<P>
   Refusing to be put on injured reserve, Rice did what he has done
for so long. He hired his own people to rehab him, working with a
ferocious woman named Lisa Giannone who pushed him as hard as he
wanted.
</P>
<P>
   In 105 days he was back, a remarkable testament to his tenacity
and the level of fitness he had maintained for so many seasons but
he would last only one half, scoring a touchdown on Joe Montana
Night but landing on the same knee and fracturing his patella. That
ended his season and some speculated his career, but a tearful Rice
knew otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Once again he worked with Ferris and Giannone, modifying the
intensity of his workouts but never the intensity of his desire to
get back not to playing football, but to playing football like
Jerry Rice. At times, the 49ers were concerned that they did not
have full control over his workouts, but for years his solitary
workouts had never failed him and they did not this time.
</P>
<P>
   Rice came back last year to lead his team in receptions,
although he struggled mentally when he realized the time he dreaded
had finally come. In key moments the 49ers were looking first to
Terrell Owens, like with three seconds left against the Packers in
a playoff victory in which Owens made the catch to win the game in
heavy traffic.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of catch Rice always seemed to make before, the
kind of moment when the Niners always turned to him. But the ball
went to someone else this time, so Jerry Rice went back to his hill
this spring to push himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of coaches like guys to come to the facility to work out
and be with the fellas,'' Rice said. ``But it's never been
mandatory here, so I've gone off doing my own thing. I think a lot
of guys start to venture off more on their own now because you can
only do some much in the offseason within the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``With my training, everything is mapped out for me, paperwise.
It's just like going to the facility but it's very serious. It
teaches you mental toughness because when you're alone who knows if
you take a day off? But I don't take a day off.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Rice will be 37 before this season ends but he proved
himself again last year when he became only the fifth receiver in
NFL history to have a 1,000-yard receiving season after the age of
34. He didn't take a day off in 1998, yet he knows his team for the
first time is looking to younger men like Stokes and Owens at least
as often now as it looks to him.
</P>
<P>
   That happens to every athlete, no matter how fit or fanatical
they may be and Rice understands this. But that doesn't mean he
accepts it. He understands what age can do and how a team's
thinking can change, but this spring and early summer he understood
something else as well. He understood he would put his faith where
it had always been _ in The Hill and a six-hour workout day, day
after lonely day.
</P>
<P>
   He would put his faith not in the team's men but in his own. He
would put his faith where his father taught him to put it. This
year, like everyone for the past 15, Jerry Rice would put his faith
in his own hands, hands as valuable as any that ever played pro
football.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pushing my body to the ultimate got me back on the field last
year when some people didn't think I would do it,'' Rice said.
``Since I sustained that knee injury I've had to back off a little
bit and it feels strange.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now they think maybe it's time for Jerry Rice to
disappear. They think it's over for Jerry. Maybe they want me to
just disappear but I'm not going anywhere. I feel stronger than
ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I'm up at 6 a.m. and out of the house in the
morning in the offseason. It's why I work five, six hours a day on
my own. After I'm done, for two years I just want to sit on my
butt, but this is still my livelihood so I've got to get my work
in. My goal is to be the best football player to ever put on a
uniform. I'm not there yet but if I keep working and I go out there
and keep doing what I've been doing, eventually people will have to
say that.''
</P>
<P>
   Until they do, he'll keep working mostly on his own. He'll keep
lifting at a state-of-the-art gym near Candlestick Park with his
private conditioning coach. Keep sprinting quad-bursting intervals
alone in the early morning while others are asleep. Keep taking
care of the minutest detail, like the time he insisted a lefthanded
equipment man named Ted Walsh throw him passes because a new
quarterback was ready to replace Joe Montana. A lefthanded
quarterback named Steve Young. A quarterback whose passes would
rotate in the opposite direction of the righthanded Montana's. Rice
wanted to be prepared.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, he'll keep running up that hill toward the clouds
until everyone concedes what should be obvious already _ that there
is only one King of the Hill.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Ty Law knew he was in the right place when the woman
started laughing at him. Not that it was all that amusing to him at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in an odd way that's what Law had come in search of. Not for
someone to laugh at a videotape of him running, but for someone who
could look at such a tape and see the little things that made it
seem funny. Only such a trained eye could watch it and perceive
more than that the guy on tape was pretty fast, which Law was.
</P>
<P>
   Just not fast enough to suit himself . . . or to suit Jackie
Joyner-Kersee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my first day with Bob (Kersee, Jackie's husband and a
legendary women's track coach),'' Law recalled. ``After I got into
town he had someone pick me up, but I didn't see him for two hours.
First I had to go through a whole physical. X-rays. A physical
therapist. I finally told them, `I'm not hurt. I'm here to work
out.' One of them goes, `So we heard.'
</P>
<P>
   ``When I finally met Bobby we sat down and began discussing why
I was there and why I wanted him to train me and brainstorming
about what I needed to accomplish and how to do it. He put
everything on the table about the way it was going to be. Then he
tells me, `It's up to you to stay or walk but this will be the
hardest thing you've ever done.' With my ego I was thinking, `You
damn sure ain't gonna break me. I'm a professional football
player.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I gave him the videotape of me running. I think it was
from the combine workout and I'm thinking, `Check this out.' He
watches it. Then he slows it down and he's watching and I hear a
woman laughing behind me.
</P>
<P>
   ``She says, `We gotta work it with you! Your body's all over the
place.' Bobby starts laughing and I look up and it's Jackie on the
landing above us. I turn to Bob and he says, `You got to learn how
to run.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And learn he did, running and stretching and lifting as Kersee
instructed, often right alongside Jackie, a woman who won three
Olympic gold medals and holds the world record in the heptathlon.
</P>
<P>
   Through the winter and spring of 1998, Law tagged along with the
Kersees. He trained with them in St. Louis, Los Angeles, and
Orlando, living out of a suitcase in towns he knew nothing about,
far from his home and the Patriots, a team that was wondering what
he was up to and why he wasn't content earning thousands of dollars
training with them rather than paying some track coach to do it
alone.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over and a new football season rolled around, the
Patriots discovered why. Law had developed something he and Kersee
call ballistic explosion, and by the time the explosions concluded
he led the NFL in interceptions and was named Most Valuable Player
in his first Pro Bowl. He had found what he had long been looking
for from a track coach in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The search for the road to elite status in pro football ended
for Law when he found Kersee. Less than a year after their meeting,
he signed an exceedingly elite contract worth $50 million with a
$14.5 million signing bonus. Law agreed to those terms not long
after completing his second offseason of work with a trainer and
coach he has grown to trust without question.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the season I had last year I told him, `Bobby, if you go
to Japan, I'm coming with you,' '' Law said.
</P>
<P>
   Law's experience is being duplicated around the NFL. As elite
players look for an edge or a new way to rehabilitate a broken body
part, some are moving away from their team's strict but still
voluntary offseason workout programs to seek help from people like
Kersee, Mackie Shilstone in New Orleans, Bob Parisi in New Jersey,
Marv Marinovich and Kevin McNair in Southern California, Ray Ferris
in San Francisco, Mike Boyle in Boston, and other strength and
conditioning specialists and speed coaches.
</P>
<P>
   They are seeking something they believe cannot be found within
the traditional team structure _ a workout of their own that can
unlock what they believe is trapped inside them. All of them are
looking for the person who has that key.
</P>
<P>
   For Ty Law, that person was Bob Kersee.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Law had spent three very productive years in the NFL when he
decided to seek out Kersee, although he first began thinking about
him after watching a movie about Gail Devers on TV, a story in part
about how Kersee brought Devers back from injury and illness to win
the 100-meter gold medal in the 1992 and 1996 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Law talked it over with his agents but life intervened and
another season passed without a connection being made. Law then
found himself watching a story about former Atlanta Falcons
defensive back Brian Jordan, who was then playing baseball for the
St. Louis Cardinals, and how Kersee brought him back from injury,
too. The decision was made.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last straw was seeing how he brought Brian back from his
back problems,'' Law said. ``My agents said they knew some other
football guys who could help me. I told them, `I know how to play
cornerback. I want him.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so glad I took the initiative to call. When I got there I
just let him take over. I didn't doubt him. I believed in Bob.''
</P>
<P>
   Law believed even the night he found himself climbing a
Stairmaster with his hands. He believed when he found himself
running odd distances at Joyner-Kersee's hip or taking killer
stationary bike rides or when Kersee's physical therapist was
snapping his weak shoulder into places he wasn't sure it was
intended to go. Through it all, Law believed it would work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby kept talking about explosion,'' Law said. ``Being a
corner, that's what I need. But you never knew from one day to the
next what you'd be doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mentally, I was challenged every day by Bobby. He knew my
body. He could look at me and know what it needed today. But he's
not anxious to tell you why. He told me at the start, `In the
morning, you just do whatever I tell you. You let me be the coach.
Later on you can see Bobby your buddy. We can have a beer or go to
a ballgame and talk about things if you have questions. But on the
track, I'm the coach.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He warned me there would be times he'd curse me. He reminded
me of Coach (Bill) Parcells that way. I might have had a question
or two about what he wanted me to do but I held it in and our
relationship grew from that.''
</P>
<P>
   Law grew as well, coming back last season with a clearly
improved ability to burst on the ball that enabled him to become
the first Patriot to lead the NFL in interceptions with nine.
Although Law knows most of that was accomplished by his
considerable work ethic, it was not done alone.
</P>
<P>
   It was done with the help of a man who knows about biomechanics
and speed and has no fear of superstars.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get the best out of an individual, a coach has to find a
way to motivate the athlete,'' Kersee explained from Tampa, where
he is creating a strength and conditioning program for the NHL's
Tampa Bay Lightning. ``You have to raise the level of intensity to
get the athlete's attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes that means you have to get in their face and get
their blood boiling. My aim is to motivate the athletes I take on
to reach optimum performance. I expect a certain discipline from
you and I won't accept less. We all have problems from time to
time. We all have a flat on the way to the track. But when it's
time to train, leave it outside the gate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Ty when he called me I thought he was absolutely crazy
to pursue me off what he knew of me. But he felt there was more
inside him and that excited me. This was a guy who was not afraid
to try and increase his level of play, even though he knew what it
meant.''
</P>
<P>
   What it meant was months of work, two years without a real
vacation, and lonely nights sharing a temporary apartment in St.
Louis with his cousin, Tennessee Oilers defensive back Anthony
Dorsett. Most of all, it meant being pushed by an often abrasive
genius named Bob Kersee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't be intimidated by a 15-year veteran with a bad
attitude,'' Kersee said. ``They can say what they want but when
they're done they better do the work. Ty understood that from the
first day. He understood I'm an expert in biomechanics. I've spent
years studying movement in sport. When I get an athlete, I design a
program specifically to strengthen his weak areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a team situation, it's difficult to do that. Teams have too
many athletes they're working with in an offseason program for
that. That's why I limit my numbers. When I looked at Ty I saw two
things _ he had a bad shoulder that needed to be worked on and he
needed work on his ballistic agility.''
</P>
<P>
   It is such attention to the individual that many NFL players now
seek. It is what led New York Giants All-Pro cornerback Jason
Sehorn to walk away from his team's offseason program last winter
at the most critical of times and rehabilitate his seriously torn
knee ligaments on the West Coast with conditioning guru Marinovich,
speed coach McNair, and Dr. Scott Connolly, founder of the Met-Rx
nutrition program.
</P>
<P>
   To make such a move is to gamble with your livelihood, or at
least to gamble with falling out of the good graces of the team
that provides it. It is a move not every athlete can afford to make
but, in the opinion of Law, it was one he couldn't afford not to
make.

ALVIN ROY INTRODUCED WEIGHT TRAINING, SOLIDIFIED TEAMS 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The setting was a hot July day in 1963 in a secluded California
location. Coach Sid Gillman had taken his San Diego Chargers out of
town to toughen them up for the season at a remote destination
known as Rough Acres Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   Gillman thought his players were soft. He wanted them bigger,
stronger, tougher. In the first three seasons of the American
Football League, he had been frustrated at not winning a
championship. He had plans to remedy that. His team was going to be
stronger and tougher.
</P>
<P>
   To make this happen, Gillman introduced Alvin Roy not only to
his Charger team but, as it would turn out, to pro football as
well. Roy, as best as can be determined, is the father of
weightlifting in the National Football League, and perhaps in
college football as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the first day we met him at Rough Acres,'' said Ron
Mix, a Hall of Famer who was one of the greatest offensive tackles
ever. ``Sid introduced him to the team, gave Alvin's background as
one of the coaches of our US Olympic weightlifting team from 1960.
I was the only player on our team at the time that had ever lifted
weights on a regular basis. Weightlifting was unheard of in
football in those days. I played at USC; we didn't have a single
weight in our locker room. It was the same when I got to the
Chargers.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I had lifted weights myself out of necessity. I was
switched from end to tackle in my junior year at USC, because I
started to have trouble with my eyesight. I weighed only 205 pounds
and knew I had to get bigger, so I started lifting. I don't want to
sound like I'm arrogant or something, but I thought I was the
strongest man in the NFL back around the time Alvin showed up.''
</P>
<P>
   For some reason, Gillman chose wide receiver Don Norton to be
Roy's first test case. Norton had never lifted a weight in his
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alvin loaded Norton up with some weights,'' said Mix. ``He was
going to have him do a squat. Don was all bent over, and when he
started to stand up, we heard this loud `Craaack.' It sounded like
a buggywhip. I say that (kiddingly) because we were at Rough Acres.
Don went down and out, for the rest of the season. He had a cracked
vertebrae. Alvin neglected to tell him the fundamentals of lifting
before he started. Like keeping the chin up and the back
straight.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Alvin Roy came out of Baton Rouge, La. Chances are, he never
played football. He was short, about 5 feet 6 inches, but very
muscular. Even though he was 43 when he arrived in San Diego to
help the Chargers, he had the body of a middleweight fighter and
carried himself like a weightlifter.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1950s, Roy had a small weightlifting studio in Baton
Rouge. At the same time, Fuzzy Brown was the head football coach of
Istrouma High School, which didn't like getting whipped badly every
year by archrival Baton Rouge High. Brown somehow decided Roy could
help. He started working with the high school players.
</P>
<P>
   The next season, Istrouma went undefeated, beginning a streak
that reached 44 games. People started paying attention to Alvin
Roy. Soon he moved crosstown to Louisiana State University, where a
coach named Paul Dietzel was putting together a national
championship team built around a local wonder boy, Billy Cannon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cannon (who had played at Istrouma) had a body like a greek
god,'' said Raiders executive assistant Al LoCasale, who was
working with San Diego back at the start of the AFL. ``Billy not
only ran the 100-yard dash in 9.4, he was also a great shot-putter.
He was so powerful looking when he came to the AFL, people started
to wonder how he got like that.'' Cannon also won the Heisman
Trophy his senior year and was the most coveted college player in
the country. The AFL, then in its first year, made a big splash
when Houston signed Cannon away from the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his death in 1979, Cannon told the Baton Rouge
Advocate: ``I was very fortuante to be at Istrouma when Alvin was
there. His ideas were unheard of at the time. There had always been
this belief that athletes should not lift weights. The old theory
was that if you lifted weights you became muscle-bound. Alvin
proved everyone wrong on that.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Charger players did not know what to make of Roy when he
first showed up. Each day he seemed to wear a different T-shirt in
training camp. ``One day it would be a shirt from the Olympics,''
said LoCasale. ``The next it would be from the world weightlifting
championships in Russia, or some other places. He wore the shirts
to let the players know he had a great background in
weightlifting.''

   Early in camp, at one of the team meetings, Gillman had Roy
address the entire squad.

   ``Alvin stood up there one day and held a pill bottle in his
hands,'' Mix said. ``He said, `Men, I've got the secret in this
bottle. I learned it from the Russkies.' Then he opened the bottle
and took out a pill. He held it up and said, `The secret is in the
pill. It will make you stronger. This provides you with plenty of
protein, and protein is the building block to build greater muscle
mass.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that Alvin quite knew what he had in those
pills.''
</P>
<P>
   Those pills were Dianabol steroids. The players were told to
take one each night after dinner. They were mandatory. The order
lasted just five weeks.

 &HT;    KEY BLACKS GATHER AT WHITE HOUSE IN BID TO NARROW 'DIGITAL
DIVIDE'
 &HT;    600&AMP;ADD
 &HT;    Moving in both (w) Washington and (f) Financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seeking to enhance the online skills of
African-Americans, a small but growing vanguard of black
information technology professionals has been exchanging e-mail and
visiting each other's Web sites. This week, they met directly for
the first time to launch a renewed effort to bridge the ``digital
divide'' that curbs minority access to cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took the White House to bring everybody together,'' said
Jena Roscoe, associate director of the president's office of public
liaison, who organized the two days of intensive briefings for the
African-American Internet community, which ended Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Some 70 participants from across the nation attended the unique
event, held in the ornate Indian Treaty Room on the fourth floor of
the Old Executive Office Building, where President Dwight
Eisenhower once held his news conferences.
</P>
<P>
   The participants heard from a wide array of top White House
aides responsible for race initiatives, science,
telecommunications, and technology policy; electronic commerce,
economic development and minority community empowerment. Also
present were key figures from the departments of Commerce,
Education and Transportation, as well as the Federal Communications
Commission, the Small Business Administration and Minority Business
Development Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Although the briefings were closed to the press, the White House
allowed a Cox Newspapers reporter to sit in on some of the
sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speakers were great,'' said Dionne Muhammed, whose
Atlanta-based site, www.AshantiTech.com, is ``dedicated to
increasing technology awareness in the black community'' and which
offers, among other services, free e-mail ``with an Afrocentric
flair.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' she added, ``the speakers weren't really necessary.
What happened here is that we finally put the faces together with
the Web sites. We were able to add the all-important human touch.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Derrick Brown of Marietta, Ga., executive director of
KnowledgeBase, a non-profit unit with a broad mission to foster
online training among minority students:
</P>
<P>
   ``My experience here has convinced me that ... our initial
investment must be to foster a stronger sense of community and
collaboration among the leaders of this movement. That is, we must
all see the same end, and channel our collective efforts towards
that end.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown also noted that further investments must focus on creating
technology centers in churches, schools and community centers as
well as opening access to capital markets. Subsequent investments
also must be made to continue developing compelling content
targeted at minority groups, ``produced by companies that we
collaborate to build,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will allow our (minority) leadership to build the
capacity necessary to make significant impact. We must teach each
other the leadership and entrepreneurial skills necessary to gain
access to these markets,'' Brown concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the closing reception, where the networking
efforts continued, the visitors, each of whom paid his or her own
way here, heard from Courtland Cox, director of the Minority
Business Development Agency, an arm of the Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nation's big corporations are finally coming to understand
that they have to set up marketing strategies to deal with minority
groups,'' Cox said. ``There are now some 2 million minority-owned
businesses in this country and more of them need to get on the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Cox previewed for the group a new U.S. Census Bureau analysis
due to be released Sept. 22. It shows, he said, ``that over the
next 50 years the U.S. population will grow by some 120 million and
that 90 percent of that growth will be minority.''
</P>
<P>
   By 2050, Cox said, 47.2 percent of all Americans will belong to
minority groups. The four states that will account by then for a
quarter of the overall population _ California, Texas, New York and
Illinois _ ``will all be majority minority,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of those projections, limited minority usage of the
Internet has created a ``digital divide'' between those who have
access to online services and other new technologies, and those who
do not.
</P>
<P>
   A Commerce Department survey released last July revealed that
only about one in four black and Hispanic households owns a
computer with Internet access, compared with half or more of Asian
and non-Hispanic white households. That study also showed that
Asians are ahead of all other groups, including non-Hispanic
whites. Overall, the poorest and least educated Americans, as well
as single parents, have the biggest problem keeping up.

ART DONOVAN SHAPED UP DIFFERENTLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Art Donovan, the worst month of the year always was August.
That's the month training camp with the Baltimore Colts got in the
way of him making a real living.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things were different back in my day,'' the 74-year-old
Donovan said recently. ``We didn't make much money, so we all
worked in the offseason, but I worked year-round. I worked for a
distilling company, selling liquor. Good job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got paid 12 months a year, but in July and August I lost my
expense account. They knew I was at training camp, so they knew I
wasn't driving around selling the product. I hated that.''
</P>
<P>
   The product _ alcohol _ was something Donovan acknowledges he
didn't hate. Most NFL old-timers like Donovan spent more time
indulging themselves with such refreshments than they did laboring
to prepare their bodies for battle. To them, football was a game
they played, not a life they lived.
</P>
<P>
   In Donovan's playing days, which began in 1950 and lasted
through three teams that went bankrupt before he finally settled in
with the Colts in 1953, there were no Met-Rx nutritional drinks, no
dieticians preparing high-protein or high-carbohydrate meals, no
fancy offseason strength and conditioning programs. And certainly
no bonus payments to stay in shape.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, at the training camp of the San Francisco 49ers, a
blackboard was posted listing the calories and nutritional value of
everything on the team's daily menu. In Baltimore, where Donovan
played for 10 of his 13 NFL seasons, the Ravens this summer
color-coded their training camp fare to make it easier for players
to know what was good for them and what was what a guy like Art
Donovan would have dined on.
</P>
<P>
   If the food in question had a green sign on it, a player could
eat all he wanted. A yellow sign meant caution _ they could still
have what they wanted but were urged to use restraint. Then there
was the dreaded red tag, which meant they should eat such foods
only in moderation but were urged to avoid them altogether.
</P>
<P>
   In Donovan's day, they had a training table, too. Or at least
they had a table with food on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players sleep in one dormitory, eat at the college
cafeteria, which is in operation early to take care of them,''
wrote Robert Reiger in a 1960 book called ``The Pros: A Documentary
of Professional Football in America.'' ``The food is simple and
runs to steaks and roasts almost to the point of monotony.''
</P>
<P>
   today's thoroughly regimented NFL life does not feature many
roasts. Player's nutritional needs are catered to, both at training
camp and during the season, when most teams not only provide the
players a balanced meal at lunch but also a dietician to consult
about the rest of their meals.
</P>
<P>
   But in Artie Donovan's day, things were a little different. For
guys who played pro football in the 1950s and '60s, when arguably
today's modern game was created, they ate what they wanted, when
they wanted, for as long as they wanted, and few people ate more
than Art Donovan.
</P>
<P>
   ``They called me Fatso and that was fine,'' the Hall of Fame
defensive lineman said. ``Weeb (Ewbank, the Hall of Fame coach for
whom Donovan played for eight years) used to try and get me to lose
weight. I used to tell him I was already a light eater _ I never
started eating until it was light.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember one summer Weeb told me, `Art, I want you to do
some calisthenics.' I said, `You want a gymnast or a football
player?' In 13 years, I did 13 push-ups. When I got to training
camp, the first time I ran was the first time I ran since the last
play of the previous season. The only weight ever lifted weighed 24
ounces. It was a Schlitz. I always replaced my fluids.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gino Cappelletti came along right as Donovan was finishing up
his career, but things were not much different. He played for the
Patriots from their inception in 1960 through 1970, playing every
game in the 10-year history of the American Football League, and
today remains the all-time leading scorer in Patriots history and
17th on the NFL's all-time list with 1,130 points. He also owns two
of the top five scoring seasons in league history: 155 points in
1964 and 147 in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   None of those accomplishments came as the result of an offseason
workout program.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the season was over we'd go home and, kaput, that was
it,'' recalled Cappelletti, who has watched how the training side
of the game has changed as a Patriots coach, as a broadcaster, and
as father-in-law of former Chicago Bears wide receiver Tom Waddle.
``They didn't even give us a physical before we left. It was jump
in the car and go home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't hear a word until a letter showed up in the spring
telling us when to come to training camp. There was none of this
offseason workout business. No one got paid to come to the facility
and work out. Most of the teams didn't even have a facility, let
alone a program, and not everybody even got paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the offseason, football was nonexistent. Lifting weights
wasn't organized or mandatory, so not that many guys did it. Most
of us were doing things in the offseason to get ready for the rest
of our lives. today, they play a few years, they don't have to
worry about that.''
</P>
<P>
   In Cappelletti's day, players did not come to camp ripped and
ready, as the ones he talks about today do. No one back then hired
a private conditioning coach or a speed consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, most did what Donovan and Cappelletti did to prepare
for a pro football season. They worked for a living.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys worked construction jobs to stay in shape,'' Cappelletti
said. ``I worked on the railroad in Minnesota, putting down
railroad ties. Guys would do sit-ups and push-ups, but in my day
only a few guys would go lift weights. Weightlifting wasn't
organized or mandatory. Maybe we'd do a pull-up on a chinning bar,
but that was it. We got in shape by playing. We got in what I call
football shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``You lift railroad ties from 8 to 5, that's enough lifting for
one day. That's how I got in shape. Then there were guys who worked
cashing tickets at Suffolk Downs. I don't know how you stay in
shape doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   George Young first became associated with the NFL with the Colts
during Donovan's career. Eventually he became the general manager
of the New York Giants and built their two Super Bowl champions
before moving to the NFL office, where he serves as the conscience
of the football side of the game.
</P>
<P>
   What he sees today and what he remembers from the early days
differ so radically it's almost absurd to compare the two. One was
a job, the other a business.
</P>
<P>
   ``One time in the 1950s a guy called and asked me for Art
Donovan's number,'' Young recalled. ``He said he wanted to come
down and work out with him. I started laughing. He didn't do
anything until the day he showed up for camp. A lot of the players
were that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't the emphasis there is now on fitness. I think it
shows in some of the injuries those old guys carry with them. Now
it's a full-time job.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the money is so different. today's player doesn't have to
work now. He works at football. There's no comparison in the
physical conditioning, but remember, when I started with the Colts
they had an office on Charles Street and that was it. We couldn't
get into the stadium in the spring because the baseball team had
it. If we were going to work out, it would be at the McDonough
School or in Clifton Park. That's a public park. Imagine that
today?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the first to change this approach was Stan Jones, a Hall
of Fame guard who made weightlifting his obsession while at the
University of Maryland. Jones, who starred for the Chicago Bears
from 1954-65 while making seven straight trips to the Pro Bowl,
transformed his 6-foot-1-inch body into a 250-pound pile of muscle,
something rare in those days. So rare, in fact, that in his brief
Hall of Fame biography it states, ``First to rely on weightlifting
for football preparation.''
</P>
<P>
   today, Jones would be considered a workout warrior. Back then he
was simply considered nuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember one year the big thing was isometrics,'' Donovan
said. ``The Colts brought some guy to camp and you could volunteer
to do it if you wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd walk by the gym and he's got guys pushing against the
wall. What the hell good did that do you? What did pushing against
a gym wall have to do with playing football?
</P>
<P>
   ``The last guy who did it was Raymond (Berry, the eccentric Hall
of Fame receiver who went on to coach the Patriots). He'd try
anything. He hurt his back, and we ran that isometric guy out of
town.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet nothing lasts forever. By the mid-1970s, offseason programs
had begun to proliferate around the NFL. Change was in the air,
financially and in terms of fitness.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the issue had to be addressed in the collective
bargaining agreement to prevent coaches such as Hank Stram from
taking things too far, which Donovan believes is the case today.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of what's going on today started in the late 1970s,''
Young recalled. ``We had a stipulation in the collective bargaining
agreement in 1977 about how many offseason mini-camps a team could
have because some were starting to work the players too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``When one or two coaches start to do that, then the rest have
to do it to keep up. That's how this all got started.''
</P>
<P>
   Where it will end, as technology and science continue to
advance, is anyone's guess, but don't try and convince Art Donovan
it has anything to do with football.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have dietician's food, regular food, weights, and
workouts,'' Donovan said. ``We had hot dogs, cheeseburgers, salami,
and bologna, and we did all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed they did.

 ST. LOUIS: ... not to make.

<P>
   ``A lot of players have substantial workout clauses in their
contracts, yet we pay him for this,'' Law said of his time with
Kersee. ``I could be short $100,000 because I'm going with Bob
Kersee. It's nothing against (Patriots conditioning coach) Johnny
Parker and Mike (Morris, the team's speed coach). They have a great
program but I chose to do it differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like the NFL isn't for everybody, Bob Kersee isn't for
everybody. But he was right for me. I wasn't a hard ass about it,
but even with Coach Parcells I had a mind of my own. I won't
hesitate to stand firm on something I believe in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to (Patriots coach) Pete (Carroll) out of respect and
told him I wanted to do this. I knew the team would have a thing
about it but I felt I needed to do something different to become a
better player. He tried to talk me into staying. There wasn't as
much resistance as I expected but they thought I should stay and I
thought I should go.''
</P>
<P>
   Although not an advocate of such free thinking, Carroll doesn't
argue with the obvious results.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why it's called voluntary,'' Carroll said of the
offseason workout policy. ``Sure I wanted Ty to be with us. I want
all our players to be with us. Johnny runs a great conditioning
program and when they're away, you don't know what a guy is getting
into.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, Ty had an incredible offseason. He found a formula
that fit him. Another guy might not get the same results. I'm sure
he believes he's found something that gives him great confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   True, but Law understood fully the chance athletes like he and
Sehorn take when they go off on their own in a league where Newt
Gingrich is considered a liberal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew if I got hurt they'd say it's because I wasn't here
with them,'' Law said. ``If I was and I got hurt, they'd say it was
a freak accident. That's the NFL. That's why every player has to
believe in himself.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sehorn believed in himself and in his fitness team as much as
Law believed in Kersee, and the results he got from Marinovich's
unorthodox Dynamic Workout System that uses large gymnastic balls
and small, round hand weights rather than the traditional
dumbbells, barbells, and iron squat racks, were obvious to the
naked eye.
</P>
<P>
   So obvious that Sehorn became the subject of several articles in
national magazines on his comeback from knee surgery that
illustrated how, after missing all of last year due to a torn
anterior cruciate and medial collateral ligament, he battled back
under Marinovich's program and the Met-Rx nutritional system,
gaining 18 pounds of muscle while reducing his body fat from 6
percent to 4.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Each day Sehorn would go to a small barn in San Juan Capistrano,
a town south of Irvine in Southern California, where Marinovich
works alone. Next to the barn is a small camper where Marinovich
lives like an acolyte to fitness, a true believer who has given his
life over to sports and a conditioning program he has developed
that centers not around traditional weightlifting but on
flexibility and odd-looking rubber balls.
</P>
<P>
   It is not the kind of program that gives NFL coaches reason to
nod in approval, yet Seahorn swore by it and his 4.4 speed after
the knee injury and the 227 pounds of muscle he left the barn with
are evidence of its effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've evaluated over 5,000 athletes during my coaching career
and the fact is the traditional programs don't work,'' Marinovich
said. ``What I found was the guys who held the weightlifting
records were very seldom the best running backs or wide receivers
or linebackers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there were people who heard I was working with Jason
and told him he was training with a guy who's nuts, but the more
heavy weight training athletes do the more out of balance their
body becomes and the more susceptible to injury. Sports are based
on instability. You're always on one foot, so you want to train
that way, emphasizing flexibility and balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Hence Marinovich's use of large gymnastic balls as unstable
support under the backs and legs of his athletes, forcing them to
balance themselves as they do a series of unusual stretching and
lifting exercises with 10- and 12-pound hand weights. Sehorn did
this for nearly two hours a day, along with more traditional
weightlifting at Connolly's gym at night plus afternoon speed work
with McNair. Two months after Sehorn began, his body's
transformation was shocking and so, too, was the return of his
trademark speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a team, everything is a cookie-cutter approach,''
Marinovich said. ``Teams don't have the time for the individual, to
fit his workout to his body type or his weaknesses. As a
conditioning coach in the NFL, I was successful but the amount of
work being done didn't transfer to the field as it should have, so
I began looking for other ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jason understood that immediately. He's looking for new
information, new systems. The fact is there's a big gap between
performance and what people thought enhanced performance. It's no
negative reflection on what anybody else is doing. Every guy we
have here has his own individual program and it changes every few
workouts. You can't do that with 60 guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can understand why the teams want everyone together but a
guy like Jason is a different kind of cat. He's not satisfied with
what everyone else is doing. Working with Jason was like being a
mechanic and getting a Ferrari to work on. It was thrilling.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also remarkable, right up to the moment his hamstring
popped.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks before the opening of Giants training camp, Sehorn
suffered what anyone in his position fears. He injured himself
training alone and hasn't played a snap since, the most dreaded
thing that can happen to an independent-minded athlete in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Giants coach Jim Fassel downplayed reports he was angry over
Sehorn's decision to rehabilitate on his own, saying at the time of
the hamstring injury, ``I knew he was going to be pushed (by McNair
and Marinovich, with whom Fassel once coached). He just didn't
spend as much time as he could have on stretching.''
</P>
<P>
   Sehorn did not practice a day all summer and will not be ready
for Sunday's season opener against Tampa Bay. Despite the
tightly-muscled body he created with the help of Marinovich,
McNair, and Met-Rx and the recovered knee he used to defend his
``Superstars'' title on TV in March, Sehorn cannot play football at
a time when football is being played. Some have begun to whisper
what Law and other players who go off on their own know they will
hear if private training does not lead to public performance.
</P>
<P>
   They question the work that was done or how it was done or with
whom it was done. No one is questioning Law because his work led to
the interception title and the Pro Bowl, but Sehorn's work has not
yet led him back to the playing field and so despite the ripped
physique he brought back from California, he must now defend
himself as best he can until he can show what the Met-Rx and
Dynamic Workout System have done for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time I worked my butt off I put on a lot of
muscle,'' Sehorn said after he tore his left hamstring. ``The
amount of time I put into stretching compared to the time I put
into working out wasn't there. You put on 18 pounds of muscle, you
need to stretch a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   So now he stretches as well as doing Marinovich's workouts and
following the Met-Rx plan. Sehorn stretches and waits for the day
when he can explode as Law did last season.
</P>
<P>
   While Sehorn waits, Law salivates at the thought of a new year.
Healthy, faster and, he believes, stronger after a second offseason
with Kersee, Law will meet with his mentor next week to talk about
his conditioning and diet and check his ballistic explosion. Kersee
is doing the same this week with Jerome Bettis and Jordan. It is a
small example of what athletes like Law are searching for today,
personal fine-tuning.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys could benefit from conditioning themselves, but
I do feel some resistance from coaches at times,'' Kersee said.
``As a coach myself, I understand it, but a lot of athletes want a
guy training them now without a vested interest. Athletes like Ty
come to me at great sacrifice because they want one thing, someone
who is looking out solely for their best interest.''

 &HT;    KEY BLACKS GATHER AT WHITE HOUSE IN BID TO NARROW 'DIGITAL
DIVIDE'

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seeking to enhance the online skills of
African-Americans, a small but growing vanguard of black
information technology professionals has been exchanging e-mail and
visiting each other's Web sites. This week, they met directly for
the first time to launch a renewed effort to bridge the ``digital
divide'' that curbs minority access to cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took the White House to bring everybody together,'' said
Jena Roscoe, associate director of the president's office of public
liaison, who organized the two days of intensive briefings for the
African-American Internet community, which ended Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Some 70 participants from across the nation attended the unique
event, held in the ornate Indian Treaty Room on the fourth floor of
the Old Executive Office Building, where President Dwight
Eisenhower once held his news conferences.
</P>
<P>
   The participants heard from a wide array of top White House
aides responsible for race initiatives, science,
telecommunications, and technology policy; electronic commerce,
economic development and minority community empowerment. Also
present were key figures from the departments of Commerce,
Education and Transportation, as well as the Federal Communications
Commission, the Small Business Administration and Minority Business
Development Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Although the briefings were closed to the press, the White House
allowed a Cox Newspapers reporter to sit in on some of the
sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speakers were great,'' said Dionne Muhammed, whose
Atlanta-based site, www.AshantiTech.com, is ``dedicated to
increasing technology awareness in the black community'' and which
offers, among other services, free e-mail ``with an Afrocentric
flair.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' she added, ``the speakers weren't really necessary.
What happened here is that we finally put the faces together with
the Web sites. We were able to add the all-important human touch.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Derrick Brown of Marietta, Ga., executive director of
KnowledgeBase, a non-profit unit with a broad mission to foster
online training among minority students:
</P>
<P>
   ``My experience here has convinced me that ... our initial
investment must be to foster a stronger sense of community and
collaboration among the leaders of this movement. That is, we must
all see the same end, and channel our collective efforts towards
that end.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown also noted that further investments must focus on creating
technology centers in churches, schools and community centers as
well as opening access to capital markets. Subsequent investments
also must be made to continue developing compelling content
targeted at minority groups, ``produced by companies that we
collaborate to build,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will allow our (minority) leadership to build the
capacity necessary to make significant impact. We must teach each
other the leadership and entrepreneurial skills necessary to gain
access to these markets,'' Brown concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the closing reception, where the networking
efforts continued, the visitors, each of whom paid his or her own
way here, heard from Courtland Cox, director of the Minority
Business Development Agency, an arm of the Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nation's big corporations are finally coming to understand
that they have to set up marketing strategies to deal with minority
groups,'' Cox said. ``There are now some 2 million minority-owned
businesses in this country and more of them need to get on the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Cox previewed for the group a new U.S. Census Bureau analysis
due to be released Sept. 22. It shows, he said, ``that over the
next 50 years the U.S. population will grow by some 120 million and
that 90 percent of that growth will be minority.''
</P>
<P>
   By 2050, Cox said, 47.2 percent of all Americans will belong to
minority groups. The four states that will account by then for a
quarter of the overall population _ California, Texas, New York and
Illinois _ ``will all be majority minority,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of those projections, limited minority usage of the
Internet has created a ``digital divide'' between those who have
access to online services and other new technologies, and those who
do not.
</P>
<P>
   A Commerce Department survey released last July revealed that
only about one in four black and Hispanic households owns a
computer with Internet access, compared with half or more of Asian
and non-Hispanic white households. That study also showed that
Asians are ahead of all other groups, including non-Hispanic
whites. Overall, the poorest and least educated Americans, as well
as single parents, have the biggest problem keeping up.

<P>
   Three years ago, when he checked the status of his application
to join the police force, city officials in New London, Conn., told
Robert Jordan he had been disqualified.
</P>
<P>
   They told him he was too smart.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's mistake was as follows: When he, along with about 500
other would-be police officers, went in to take the test
administered by the Southeastern Connecticut Law Enforcement
Consortium, he scored 33 out of 50 points. That was well above the
range of 20 to 27 points the test company recommended for police
officers. It's also higher than what was recommended for office
workers, bank tellers, secretaries.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan spent three years protesting the decision. But this week,
US District Court Judge Peter Dorsey took the wind out of his sails
in a summary judgment, saying it is reasonable to reject people who
score too well on a screening test.
</P>
<P>
   And Thursday Bruce Rinehart, New London's chief of police, said
he has been pleased with the results of the Wonderlic intelligence
test and will probably use it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Police work, believe it or not, is a boring job,'' he said.
``What happens if you get certain people who can't accept being
involved in that sort of occupation is it becomes very frustrating.
Either the day they come in they want to be chief of police, or
they become very frustrated and they leave.''
</P>
<P>
   When Jordan filed his federal lawsuit, in June 1997, it
attracted national attention to Connecticut police departments' use
of a commercially available 12-minute intelligence test that
recommends minimum and maximum scoring levels for particular jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The test, which was devised and marketed by a Libertyville,
Ill., company called Wonderlic, bases its recommendations on the
average scores of past test-takers. The average score for all
workers is 21, for example; reporters' average score is 27, and
attorneys' average score is 29, said Ralph Monaco, who acted as New
London's lead attorney in the case. A Wonderlic spokesman said that
over the past 40 years, the test has been taken by 100 million
people in a variety of industries, as well as government, the Coast
Guard, and the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   Dorsey's ruling has brought the spotlight back to Jordan, a
48-year-old from Waterford who has worked as an insurance salesman
and a security guard, finished one year of law school, and now
works in a prison. While the judgment came as a disappointment,
Jordan was somewhat consoled by the limo picking him up Thursday to
drive him to New York, to appear on a morning talk show discussing
the case Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made them the laughingstock of the country,'' Jordan said,
with some satisfaction. ``Jay Leno made up this great song. The
theme music was `Dumb cops, dumb cops, whatcha gonna do, whatcha
going to do with a low IQ.' People just can't get over it that they
want to cultivate this kind of department.''
</P>
<P>
   But however amused the general public may be, the intelligence
test has kept Wonderlic in business for 40 years _ and its
application in New London appeared reasonable to the judge.
According to Elizabeth Bartholet, who teaches employment law at
Harvard Law School, doubts about overqualified candidates are
neither uncommon nor totally unreasonable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concern those employers have is that those people are
going to be unhappy, that they're going to lord it over people,
they're going to leave the job early, they're going to be bored. It
isn't necessarily irrational,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In this particular case, the New London police department was
selecting ``five or six'' officers from about 500 candidates,
explained Rinehart, New London's chief of police. The Wonderlic
test was administered in March 1996 at a local junior college on
behalf of police departments in New London and 13 other Connecticut
communities, which selected preferred candidates from among the
people who scored between 20 and 27.
</P>
<P>
   When he didn't get any responses several months after taking the
test, Jordan approached New London's assistant city manager, and
was told that he and 62 other test-takers had been disqualified
because of high test scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `We don't like to hire people with too high an IQ to
be cops in this town,' '' Jordan said. ``I was kind of taken aback,
as any reasonable person would be. He said there was nothing more
boring than driving around in a police cruiser all day, and no one
with any smarts would want to do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Rinehart, who has defended his policy countless times over the
past two years, said the test was merely a preliminary screening
tool, and has been consistently misinterpreted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has nothing to do with being smart,'' said Rinehart. ``We
are a core city. We're like Hartford, New Haven, Bridgeport. You
might go down into Greenwich and they might want a different
profile. We want people who are going to be able to go out into the
community and work with the people we serve.''

BUYING TEXTBOOKS: IN LINE VS. ON LINE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- John Iannone stands amid a crowd of newly arrived
students outside Boston University's student union. He hands out
T-shirts and hats. He urges the students to take a turn at the
putting green he's set up nearby where they win a prize if they
sink a ball. Then he moves in to deliver his pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you want to save money on your textbooks this year?'' he
shouts. ``Do you want to avoid the lines? You should check us out.
It's fast. And you're going to pay a lot less money.''
</P>
<P>
   Iannone, a BU senior this year, is a campus rep for
Varsitybooks.com, one of a score of textbook Web sites that have
appeared seemingly overnight to persuade college students to
abandon the fall ritual of crowding into campus bookstores and
instead buy on line. The new companies are spending millions on
advertising and have hired an army of students like Iannone to
spread the word in a race to capture a substantial piece of the
$3.6 billion college textbook market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The college bookstore is one of the last bastions of
monopoly,'' said Eric Kuhn, a 28-year-old former lawyer and
cofounder of Washington-based Varsitybooks.com. ``It's like the old
Soviet Union _ you wait in ridiculous lines, pay ridiculous prices,
and until now you really didn't have a choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Offering discounts that in some cases cut the cost of textbooks
in half, the virtual booksellers say students can buy what they
need in just a few minutes. Most sites also promise delivery in one
to three days for a flat rate of as little as $5. The combination
of low prices and speedy delivery make the campus bookstore
obsolete, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the hype surrounding the multimillion-dollar promotional
campaigns launched by the fledgling Web sites, it is too early to
tell whether the idea will have broad appeal. But on-line
booksellers like Amazon.com have already made purchasing books over
the Internet commonplace. And the nation's 15 million college
students would seem a ready-made market for on-line textbook sites.
Most students own their own computers and carry credit cards needed
to make purchases from Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   So far, anecdotal evidence suggests students are giving the
on-line sites a close look.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why anybody wouldn't do it on line,'' said Josh
Sevin, a master's student in urban planning at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, as he browsed at MIT's campus bookstore
this week, writing prices in a notebook.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always the feeling you're getting gouged at the local
bookstore. I was just thinking as I was coming in here how obsolete
a store like this has become,'' Sevin said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, few students seem burdened with nostalgia for that
particular campus institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saved $10 to $20 a book,'' said Amy Pechaitis, a sophomore
chemical engineering major at MIT who shopped three on-line sites
for the best deals. ``And they delivered them right to my dorm room
door. I don't have to deal with lugging 150 pounds of books all the
way across campus.''
</P>
<P>
   Such sentiments worry campus booksellers, who have responded
with price cuts and, in the case of the MIT's bookstore, a
guarantee to match the price of any on-line bookseller.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the sites that are up this year, it's a serious
competetive threat,'' acknowledged Chris Colbert, manager of the
Barnes &AMP; Noble-owned MIT Coop bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the on-line solution may not offer all it seems to
promise, argues Rusty Drugan, executive director of the New England
Booksellers Association, which represents some 31 college
bookstores in the region. Buying textbooks over the Internet can be
more complicated than ordering a few books from a mainstream
Internet bookseller like Amazon.com, he says. Some sites require
students to find out what books they need before they log on. Then
they must search for them individually, a potentially laborious
task when a semester's worth of books may number in the dozens.
</P>
<P>
   Even sites that have acquired university book lists _ enabling
students to click on the courses they're taking and automatically
receive the required textbooks _ can be difficult to navigate, he
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It still takes a long time,'' Drugan said. ``The fact of the
matter is that all the hype about being able to get all your books
in five minutes isn't really true. You can spend just as much time
on line as you do in the store, without the convenience of being
able to see the books and having someone to talk to.''
</P>
<P>
   There are also may be practical difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where are they going to have these things delivered?'' said
Joe Lassiter, a Harvard Business School professor of management.
``Most college students live in dorms and small apartments that
aren't equipped to handle a lot of large packages. And if you need
to exchange one or two books, you have to send them back. The
hassle factor gets higher. There are all sorts of mechanical
problems involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Students, however, seem to feel that inconveniences on line pale
in comparison to those that await at nonvirtual bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   ``After you consider the price you're going to pay and the lines
you're going to have to wait in, I'd say doing it on line is a
pretty good deal,'' said Sevin, the MIT student.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the on-line threat, many traditional bookstores are
not taking chances and are joining up with Internet companies with
the hope that an Internet presence will help retain fleeing
customers.
</P>
<P>
   In the most recent example, Barnes &AMP; Noble, which runs some 350
college bookstores nationwide, launched Textbooks.com earlier this
year. The site is offering steep discounts, undercutting its own
stores, and promising cheap, fast delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Bookstore _ an independent bookseller not affiliated
with the official Barnes &AMP; Noble outlet, the Harvard Coop _ this
week announced a partnership with local Internet bookseller
Schoolstop.com. ``We're hoping that working together will make a
bigger and better whole,'' said Sheri Sable, Harvard Bookstore's
marketing director.
</P>
<P>
   But on-line companies are spending huge sums to grab students'
attention. Varsitybooks.com has hired some 1,000 campus
representatives to promote its site. Ecampus.com, which debuted
this summer, has launched a $10 million promotional campaign,
airing advertisements on TV, in magazines like Rolling Stone and on
8,100 movie screens around the country. Efollet.com, one of the
largest college textbook sellers, is also pouring $10 million into
an ad blitz with the slogan ``Get out of line.''
</P>
<P>
   Smaller upstarts like Boston-based CoreText.com, which is
focusing on the student-rich Northeast, are going up against giants
like Textbooks.com, which recently kicked off a massive publicity
assault that a company spokesman said is intended to reach ``every
conceivable market'' nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   More on-line textbook sellers are entering the market, hoping
either to eclipse others with sheer size or to carve out a
specialty niche. Besides straightforward Internet textbook sellers,
eBay-style auction sites where students can buy and sell used books
are also springing up.
</P>
<P>
   Many fledgling sites will perish in short order when they run
out of money or simply get overwhelmed by larger, better-known
companies, analysts say. Others say the rapid rise of the new sites
is bound to be followed by a round of consolidation, as companies
join forces to try and gobble up market share.
</P>
<P>
   But few doubt that fortunes will be made as the latest
e-commerce trend takes shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to carve out a little bit of this market and all
of a sudden, you're a million-dollar company,'' says Barbara
McDonough, a Harvard graduate who co-founded Boston-based
CoreText.com, an on-line textbook seller launched this fall.
``There's a lot of competition out there, but that just means this
is a really, really good idea.''

SINGLE INVESTOR, 65, SHOULD REDUCE RELIANCE ON STOCKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, September 12, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am single and just turned 65 and am receiving $900 a month
Social Security. My home is paid for and I have a reverse mortgage
which provides me with $571 a month. My expenses are about $1,700 a
month, so I have automatic withdrawals of $540 a month made from my
IRA accounts to make up the difference. These are the accounts:
$1,992 in Vanguard Asset Allocation fund, $22,221 in Vanguard
Wellesley Income fund, $9,172 in Vanguard LifeStrategy Income fund,
$20,373 in Vanguard Windsor II, and $200 in Vanguard Prime Money
Market fund. I also have about $30,000 in a Vanguard Variable
Annuity invested in its Balanced account, which I plan to begin
drawing on when I reach age 70. Do I have my modest assets in the
right place?
</P>
<P>
   M. H. Lakewood, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A. Two things bother me. For one thing, since you need the
income stream from your IRA accounts for living expenses, I think
you hold funds with too many of their assets in stocks. And more
important, your level of withdrawals is too high. You would have to
earn average portfolio returns of 12.7 percent to support
withdrawals of $540 a month without depleting the principal.
Although the markets of the last couple of years have made such
returns look routine, over the long haul youre likely to find such
expectations unreasonable.
</P>
<P>
   But on the other hand, it appears that you don't need to be
making withdrawals of this magnitude. The payments from Social
Security and your reverse mortgage combine to provide you with
$1,417 a month, meaning you would need but $283 a month to meet
your expenses. If you were to withdraw that amount and your
portfolio achieved an average of 7.5 percent returns, you not only
would face no erosion of principal, but you would see a very modest
level of growth _ about $500 a year. Or, you could withdraw $326 a
month with a reasonable expectation that you would see no erosion
of principal.
</P>
<P>
   I suggested you target 7.5 percent as the expected portfolio
return because I think you should make some fairly extensive
changes in the portfolio. When you combine the percentages of stock
holdings in your three balanced funds _ Asset Allocation,
Wellesley, and LifeStrategy Income _ with the all-stock Windsor II,
it works out to 57.6 percent stocks in the entire portfolio. That's
too much _ a lot too much _ for a person who depends on the
portfolio for an income stream. You have probably seen the danger
yourself thus far in 1999, since the best-performing of your funds,
Windsor II, has delivered a total return of only 3.5 percent
year-to-date. When substandard investment performance is combined
with a high schedule of withdrawals, serious erosion of capital is
the invariable result.
</P>
<P>
   My suggestion would be to reduce the position in Vanguard
Windsor II to $5,000, putting the rest of the money from that
account in Vanguard GNMA, a top-rated fund which is entirely
oriented to producing income. It sports a current yield of 6.7
percent, and has an excellent long-term record of retaining its
principal value. (But if you go into this fund, you have to
understand that short-term volatility goes with the territory when
it comes to GNMA funds. You have to take a long-term perspective
and never commit short-term money to such an investment.) The
effect of such a move would be to reduce reliance on the stock
market from that 57.6 percent to 29.1 percent _ much more
appropriate for a person in your situation.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I will be 61 years old this month and plan to retire at the
end of the year. I would like to arrange my finances in a
retirement fashion with the best returns and the least risk. There
are my current investments and assets: I have a $45,000 IRA account
with 70 percent in a growth mutual fund, 28 percent in a bond fund,
and 2 percent in a money market fund; a brokerage account of
$36,000 with 88 percent invested in individual equities and 12
percent in a growth mutual fund; and a $20,000 SEP-IRA account with
55 percent in a technology sector mutual fund, 40 percent in a
global value fund, and 5 percent in a bond fund. I also have a
taxable account of $60,000 that is entirely invested in a growth
and income fund, and a total of $46,000 is in CDs, bank accounts
and foreign bonds. I will have no retirement income from my present
employer, but will draw Social Security benefits at age 62.
</P>
<P>
   A.V., Beaumont, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A. As with the individual above, you have far too much stock in
this portfolio for your current situation. I calculate a total of
only 29.2 percent of the portfolio on the fixed-income side. My
suggestion would be to make changes in two phases.
</P>
<P>
   First, I would immediately move all the tax-deferred money _ the
regular IRA and the SEP account _ to bonds, CDs, bond funds, and
the like. This would boost the fixed-income side of the portfolio
to 53.1 percent. As I noted above, Vanguard GNMA is one of my
favorite funds to provide an income stream in retirement.
</P>
<P>
   As for the second phase, I would wait until you retire to make
additional portfolio changes. This is not because I am comfortable
with that 47 percent stock market reliance, but because if you wait
until 2000 to make the changes, you will be in a tax year when your
income will probably be considerably lower than now. This would
reduce the impact of the capital gains tax on any further sales of
stocks and stock funds.
</P>
<P>
   To begin the second phase, you will need to work out a
retirement budget, obtain a projection of your Social Security
benefit which will begin a year from now, and then calculate how
much you will need to draw from your savings to make ends meet. If
you made the moves I suggested above, you would have $111,000 in
fixed income investments, which might give you an income stream of
about $6,937, or $578 a month, from those holdings, based upon a
portfolio average 6.25 percent yield. (But achieving such returns
would also require moving a good deal of the money you now have in
savings and checking accounts into a mutual fund money market
account, where your yield is likely to be dramatically higher.)
</P>
<P>
   Once you have figured your projected income stream from the
fixed-income side and Social Security and your projected retirement
expenses, you can calculate whether there is a shortfall _ and if
so, how much more money you might put on the fixed-income side to
meet it.
</P>
<P>
   I am not advocating moving all of your savings into bonds.
You'll want to leave some money in growth vehicles to protect
against the impact of inflation on your living costs in the later
years of retirement. But my guess is you'll find that you'll need
to have about 70 percent of your money in fixed-income holdings.
That would give you an income stream of $9,056 a year or $754 a
month from that source, using the same assumptions as before.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I enclose a list of my investments. I am 61 years old,
single, and plan to take Social Security at age 62. In addition to
the assets listed, I receive a pension of $3,987 with a 2 percent
cost-of-living adjustment. My only debt is an $82,000 mortgage at
7.25 percent. My question is whether I should change any of these
funds at this time? I am not planning to withdraw money from my
accounts unless an emergency arises. Please advise me if this
appears to be a balanced portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   J.H., Portland, Oregon
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, I calculate that 75.8 percent of the portfolio of 10
funds is either in the large-cap blend or the large-cap growth
market sectors, so I would say it's quite poorly diversified. (To
make that calculation, I counted 56.5 percent of your holdings in
AIM Balanced fund and all of the holdings in Oppenheimer
Convertible Securities as large-cap holdings.)
</P>
<P>
   Even though you don't need an income stream from this portfolio
and will be able to ride out sags in the large-cap market, I would
suggest you both broaden your representation in different market
sectors and beef up the fixed-income side. You might, for example,
swap your position in Oppenheimer Growth fund for one in
Oppenheimer Enterprise, and cash out both of your Vanguard Holdings
_ Index Growth and Index 500 _ for Vanguard Mid-Cap Index. Those
two moves alone would reduce your exposure to the large-cap
universe to 61 percent of the portfolio. I would then advise that
you move $30,000 from the various large-cap holdings to
fixed-income funds, further reducing the large-cap position to 50
percent.

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- John Iannone stands amid a crowd of newly arrived
students outside Boston University's student union. He hands out
T-shirts and hats. He urges the students to take a turn at the
putting green he's set up nearby where they win a prize if they
sink a ball. Then he moves in to deliver his pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you want to save money on your textbooks this year?'' he
shouts. ``Do you want to avoid the lines? You should check us out.
It's fast. And you're going to pay a lot less money.''
</P>
<P>
   Iannone, a BU senior this year, is a campus rep for
Varsitybooks.com, one of a score of textbook Web sites that have
appeared seemingly overnight to persuade college students to
abandon the fall ritual of crowding into campus bookstores and
instead buy on line. The new companies are spending millions on
advertising and have hired an army of students like Iannone to
spread the word in a race to capture a substantial piece of the
$3.6 billion college textbook market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The college bookstore is one of the last bastions of
monopoly,'' said Eric Kuhn, a 28-year-old former lawyer and
cofounder of Washington-based Varsitybooks.com. ``It's like the old
Soviet Union _ you wait in ridiculous lines, pay ridiculous prices,
and until now you really didn't have a choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Offering discounts that in some cases cut the cost of textbooks
in half, the virtual booksellers say students can buy what they
need in just a few minutes. Most sites also promise delivery in one
to three days for a flat rate of as little as $5. The combination
of low prices and speedy delivery make the campus bookstore
obsolete, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the hype surrounding the multimillion-dollar promotional
campaigns launched by the fledgling Web sites, it is too early to
tell whether the idea will have broad appeal. But on-line
booksellers like Amazon.com have already made purchasing books over
the Internet commonplace. And the nation's 15 million college
students would seem a ready-made market for on-line textbook sites.
Most students own their own computers and carry credit cards needed
to make purchases from Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   So far, anecdotal evidence suggests students are giving the
on-line sites a close look.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why anybody wouldn't do it on line,'' said Josh
Sevin, a master's student in urban planning at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, as he browsed at MIT's campus bookstore
this week, writing prices in a notebook.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always the feeling you're getting gouged at the local
bookstore. I was just thinking as I was coming in here how obsolete
a store like this has become,'' Sevin said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, few students seem burdened with nostalgia for that
particular campus institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saved $10 to $20 a book,'' said Amy Pechaitis, a sophomore
chemical engineering major at MIT who shopped three on-line sites
for the best deals. ``And they delivered them right to my dorm room
door. I don't have to deal with lugging 150 pounds of books all the
way across campus.''
</P>
<P>
   Such sentiments worry campus booksellers, who have responded
with price cuts and, in the case of the MIT's bookstore, a
guarantee to match the price of any on-line bookseller.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the sites that are up this year, it's a serious
competetive threat,'' acknowledged Chris Colbert, manager of the
Barnes &AMP; Noble-owned MIT Coop bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the on-line solution may not offer all it seems to
promise, argues Rusty Drugan, executive director of the New England
Booksellers Association, which represents some 31 college
bookstores in the region. Buying textbooks over the Internet can be
more complicated than ordering a few books from a mainstream
Internet bookseller like Amazon.com, he says. Some sites require
students to find out what books they need before they log on. Then
they must search for them individually, a potentially laborious
task when a semester's worth of books may number in the dozens.
</P>
<P>
   Even sites that have acquired university book lists _ enabling
students to click on the courses they're taking and automatically
receive the required textbooks _ can be difficult to navigate, he
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It still takes a long time,'' Drugan said. ``The fact of the
matter is that all the hype about being able to get all your books
in five minutes isn't really true. You can spend just as much time
on line as you do in the store, without the convenience of being
able to see the books and having someone to talk to.''
</P>
<P>
   There are also may be practical difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where are they going to have these things delivered?'' said
Joe Lassiter, a Harvard Business School professor of management.
``Most college students live in dorms and small apartments that
aren't equipped to handle a lot of large packages. And if you need
to exchange one or two books, you have to send them back. The
hassle factor gets higher. There are all sorts of mechanical
problems involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Students, however, seem to feel that inconveniences on line pale
in comparison to those that await at nonvirtual bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   ``After you consider the price you're going to pay and the lines
you're going to have to wait in, I'd say doing it on line is a
pretty good deal,'' said Sevin, the MIT student.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the on-line threat, many traditional bookstores are
not taking chances and are joining up with Internet companies with
the hope that an Internet presence will help retain fleeing
customers.
</P>
<P>
   In the most recent example, Barnes &AMP; Noble, which runs some 350
college bookstores nationwide, launched Textbooks.com earlier this
year. The site is offering steep discounts, undercutting its own
stores, and promising cheap, fast delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Bookstore _ an independent bookseller not affiliated
with the official Barnes &AMP; Noble outlet, the Harvard Coop _ this
week announced a partnership with local Internet bookseller
Schoolstop.com. ``We're hoping that working together will make a
bigger and better whole,'' said Sheri Sable, Harvard Bookstore's
marketing director.
</P>
<P>
   But on-line companies are spending huge sums to grab students'
attention. Varsitybooks.com has hired some 1,000 campus
representatives to promote its site. Ecampus.com, which debuted
this summer, has launched a $10 million promotional campaign,
airing advertisements on TV, in magazines like Rolling Stone and on
8,100 movie screens around the country. Efollet.com, one of the
largest college textbook sellers, is also pouring $10 million into
an ad blitz with the slogan ``Get out of line.''
</P>
<P>
   Smaller upstarts like Boston-based CoreText.com, which is
focusing on the student-rich Northeast, are going up against giants
like Textbooks.com, which recently kicked off a massive publicity
assault that a company spokesman said is intended to reach ``every
conceivable market'' nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   More on-line textbook sellers are entering the market, hoping
either to eclipse others with sheer size or to carve out a
specialty niche. Besides straightforward Internet textbook sellers,
eBay-style auction sites where students can buy and sell used books
are also springing up.
</P>
<P>
   Many fledgling sites will perish in short order when they run
out of money or simply get overwhelmed by larger, better-known
companies, analysts say. Others say the rapid rise of the new sites
is bound to be followed by a round of consolidation, as companies
join forces to try and gobble up market share.
</P>
<P>
   But few doubt that fortunes will be made as the latest
e-commerce trend takes shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to carve out a little bit of this market and all
of a sudden, you're a million-dollar company,'' says Barbara
McDonough, a Harvard graduate who co-founded Boston-based
CoreText.com, an on-line textbook seller launched this fall.
``There's a lot of competition out there, but that just means this
is a really, really good idea.''

NEW HAMPSHIRE'S FRACTIOUS SISTERHOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A week ago, New Hampshire became the first state in the union to
have elected three women to its top political offices: the governor
is Democrat Jeanne Shaheen; Republican Donna Sytek is the speaker
of the vast, 400-member House, and Democrat Beverly Hollingworth is
the newly elected president of the New Hampshire Senate.
</P>
<P>
   This must be charming news for the 
if-only-women-ran-the-world-they-could-just-get-together-around-the-
kitchen-table-and-solve-all-our-problems crowd. These would be
people who have never heard the names Indira Gandhi, Golda Meir,
and Margaret Thatcher.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire is in a God-awful mess, and there's very little
evidence that the Shaheen-Sytek-Hollingworth troika will help the
state pull out of it. A court has ordered the state to come up with
an additional $100 million to bail out New Hampshire's chronically
underperforming schools. And on key issues relating to the school
debacle, the women don't see eye to eye.
</P>
<P>
   My high-school history teacher once told me: Statesmanship in
New Hampshire begins and ends with no taxation. Shaheen, a sort-of
liberal Democrat, has taken New Hampshire's notorious no-new-taxes
pledge for reasons of political expediency. Sytek, a conservative,
pro-life Republican, believes in ``the pledge,'' but opposes two of
Shaheen's alternate ideas for raising the needed school funds _
legalized gambling and a capital gains tax. She would rather cut
the state budget.
</P>
<P>
   This year, New Hampshire witnessed the political equivalent of a
UFO landing: the Republican legislature voted for an income tax,
which their own speaker opposed. Then the Democratic governor, who
once worked for Gary Hart, threatened to veto the income tax bill,
which she instead managed to bury in the Senate. Last week, Shaheen
was lobbying for her longtime protege, state Senator Sylvia Larsen,
to take over the presidency that went to Hollingworth. And
Shaheen's Senate janissaries are already talking about making
trouble for the new president.
</P>
<P>
   Gosh, can't we all get along? For the record, all three pols say
they enjoy working with the other, etc, etc. But the state has been
embroiled in a semipermanent fiscal crisis for more than a year,
with no end in sight. ``Well, you've got a governor who's opposed
to an income tax, and supports gambling, and you've got a Senate
president who's against gambling and favors an income tax,''
explains Sytek. ``And I'm against both of those things.'' When will
it all end? Says Sytek: ``I wish I knew.''

   Alan Meckler, who is famous in the on-line world for buying the
domain name ``Internet'' from Web pioneer Rob Raisch's Cambridge,
Mass.-based The Internet Co. for about $100,000, has plans to
launch a Boston-based Internet news site. To see what I mean, go to
internet.com and look at Meckler's other news sites: atnewyork.com,
arabia.internet.com. I'm told that Meckler wants to launch about a
dozen US city news sites in the near future, and he confirms that
he has done some interviewing in Boston for the editor's job. Isn't
this already a crowded field, with Cnet and ZDnet and heavens knows
who else? Just asking. . . Hail to the Chief: Amazon.com's newly
aggregated ``purchase circles'' purport to show what books are hot
sellers in specific towns and corporations. The top seller from
buyers working for The New York Times: ``The Times of My Life,'' by
former Times editor Max Frankel. At Fidelity Investments, staffers
are snapping up ``The Mutual Fund Business,'' by Fidelity's
president and chief executive officer Robert Pozen.

`TRICK' PERFORMS A SMALL MASTERPIECE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Trick'' is a neat little whirly top of a movie: colorful,
small, spinning with energy and compassion. Watch and be
mesmerized.
</P>
<P>
   Written by Jason Schafer and directed by first-time filmmaker
Jim Fall, this engaging romantic comedy (opening today) features
several genuine surprises, among them the happy realization that
Tori Spelling can, in fact, act.
</P>
<P>
   Let's not mince words here: She's terrific. Her nerdy turn as a
desperate young actress is one of the movie's waggish joys, a
crack-up character bit that ought to redeem years of pouty
eye-rolling on ``Beverly Hills: 90210.''
</P>
<P>
   Spelling plays Katherine, best friend and former prom date to
the now-gay Gabriel (Christian Campbell, Neve's brother), a pianist
who yearns for a career composing Broadway musicals. When we meet
him, he's in the middle of writing one, some upbeat, major-key
business involving a maid named Dorkas and her inamorato, Rodrigo.
</P>
<P>
   One of the lovelier elements in Fall's film is its gentle tweak
at gay stereotypes: Gabriel writes show tunes, but darned if he
isn't embarrassed to admit it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel really lame telling people that,'' he explains to a
stranger, ``because it makes me seem like a queen ... which would
be OK if I was. Which I'm not.''
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel's such a charmer _ a bright man-boy with extravagant
dimples _ that it's hard to believe he can't get a date. But he's a
loner, and it's as a loner that he shuffles into a bar one night,
looking rather startled to be there. One man after another
approaches; one man after another he shyly rebuffs. Then he catches
sight of a near-nude go-go boy (J.P. Pitoc) writhing seductively to
a disco beat, and, zinn

   You can tell by Drew Bledsoe's words during the exhibition
season that he won't accept what-ifs, excuses, and spins. He
understands that he must throw the football several times per game
for the Patriots to win. He knows that running games come and go
without much fanfare in New England, that handing the ball off is
often a futile and unnecessary evil.
</P>
<P>
   For, as Bledsoe put it so aptly a week ago, ``We are what we
are,'' borrowing a phrase from his former coach, Bill Parcells,
whom he will face in Tuna Bowl V Sunday at the Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
   What the Patriots must do is borrow many things from the 1996
team that went to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   If we can look past the craze created by Michael Bishop, a
seventh-round pick from Kansas State who won the hearts of New
Englanders by scrambling and putting up 41 points in four games
against third-stringers and players who didn't make NFL rosters, we
would be able to see that the Patriots will return to prominence
based primarily on Bledsoe's aerial show.
</P>
<P>
   If the Patriots could mimic the '96 season, Bledsoe would throw
it 623 times and complete 373 (both the best totals in the league
that year) for 4,086 yards and 27 touchdown passes.
</P>
<P>
   That season, Bledsoe had Terry Glenn for 15 games and he caught
90 passes. He had the speedy Shawn Jefferson (50 catches), Troy
Brown (21), Ben Coates (62), Curtis Martin (46), Dave Meggett (33),
Sam Gash (33), and Keith Byars (27). Martin gained 1,152 yards on
316 carries (3.6-yard average), nothing spectacular and nothing
that the combination of Kevin Faulk and Terry Allen couldn't
duplicate.
</P>
<P>
   The offensive line still has Bruce Armstrong, Todd Rucci, and
Max Lane.
</P>
<P>
   The big difference between the '96 offense and last year's? The
'96 Patriots stayed healthy, the '98 edition didn't.
</P>
<P>
   On defense, the '96 group got better as the season progressed.
They allowed only 93.9 yards rushing per game, and they had a pass
rush _ Willie McGinest had 9.5 sacks, Chris Slade 7. The Patriots
need McGinest and Slade to stay healthy and combine for 16.5 sacks,
to go along with whatever Chad Eaton and Henry Thomas can provide
in the middle and what Brandon Mitchell can give at the other end.
</P>
<P>
   In the secondary, the '96 team had Otis Smith and this one has
Steve Israel: advantage, '99. Ty Law was a young corner who still
wasn't covering the other team's top receiver; now he is considered
one of the top three cover corners in the league. Lawyer Milloy
broke into the starting lineup six games into the '96 season; now
he's an All-Pro. There's the obvious absence of Willie Clay; now
there's Chris Carter.
</P>
<P>
   The most noticeable difference is in the linebacking unit, where
Ted Johnson was certainly the main reason the '96 Patriots were so
effective against the run. Johnson will miss most of the '99
season. In '96, Todd Collins was flying around from sideline to
sideline, the combination of Slade and Dwayne Sabb was effective on
the weakside, and rookie Tedy Bruschi had four sacks as a nickel
pass rusher. Now rookie Andy Katzenmoyer, a player with great
promise, mans the middle, with Bruschi playing full time on the
weakside.
</P>
<P>
   Faulk will have to give what Meggett provided on kickoffs, while
Brown will be the primary punt returner.
</P>
<P>
   The noticeable differences are the ``character'' guys who are no
longer here: Collins, Meggett, Byars, Martin, Clay, Corwin Brown,
Dave Wohlabaugh. They were all good locker room guys who could step
forth when things weren't going right.
</P>
<P>
   The coach and the staff are obviously different and so is the
approach and the delivery of the Pete Carroll-led Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   The '98 Patriots showed they are capable of great spirit and
intensity, as witnessed in exciting wins over Buffalo, Miami,
Pittsburgh, and San Francisco at the end of the year that saved
what might have been a dismal season.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, when it was time to toughen against New York and
Jacksonville, it didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   The AFC East is tougher than it was in '96. Most of the main
characters remain the same, but now it's about Carroll showing he
can elevate the Patriots to the '96 level. He must show that speed,
strength, and youth can win out over character and intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   If he can't prove it this year, he may never get the chance
again.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at the '99 squad:
</P>
<P>
   QUARTERBACK _ Starter: Drew Bledsoe. Backups: John Friesz and
Michael Bishop.
</P>
<P>
   In the confines of Ernie Zampese's precision passing game,
Bledsoe needs big-play options. Last year he was second to Randall
Cunningham in completions of 25 yards or more with 37 (Cunningham
had 39), and he did that with a banged-up receiving unit while
Cunningham was throwing it to Randy Moss, Cris Carter, and Jake
Reed. Bledsoe has a chance to be a Pro Bowler for the fourth time
if his receivers stay healthy. The Patriots have vastly improved
here, adding 10-year vet Friesz, who is a big jump over Scott
Zolak, and Bishop has prompted crazy talk of perhaps using him in
situations with the first offense.
</P>
<P>
   RUNNING BACKS _ Starters: Kevin Faulk (RB) and Tony Carter (FB).
Backups: Terry Allen, Lamont Warren, Harold Shaw, Chris Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   Allen's best contributions _ other than mentoring Faulk _ would
come if he carried 10 times or fewer a game. In '98, when he gained
700 yards on 148 carries in 10 games, Allen averaged just over 5
yards per carry in the first 10 carries. He'll also help the
Patriots when they run left, where they were last in the league
last season with 436 yards on 140 carries for a 3.1-yard average.
Conversely, the Patriots were second in the league running to the
right, with 786 yards on 158 carries (a 5-yard average). The
Patriots were 29th in the league running up the middle (256 yards
on 105 carries for a 2.4-yard average), but Allen should also help
there, averaging 3.6 yards straight ahead. He gained 58 of his 700
yards last season inside the 20, and scored four touchdowns. He was
also stopped for no gain or for a loss only nine times, second
lowest total in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Faulk, a talented multipurpose player from Louisiana State,
looks to be an accomplished north-south runner who hits the hole,
then makes his cuts. He'll also be a good outlet receiver for
Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   Warren will be a third-down back used mostly as a receiver. Shaw
can be used as both a halfback and fullback, while Floyd will be
the short-yardage fullback. Look for Carter to be used in early
downs as a receiver/blocker.
</P>
<P>
   TIGHT END/H-BACK _ Starter: Ben Coates. Backups: Rod Rutledge,
Mike Bartrum.
</P>
<P>
   Coates wants to extend the field more: In '98, 52 of his 67
catches were for 10 yards or fewer. He was also more effective on
the road, with 34 receptions for a 12.3-yard average. At home he
caught 33 passes for a 7.6 average.
</P>
<P>
   Some would argue there are signs the five-time All-Pro has
slowed, but Coates, 30, thinks because he's in better shape and has
put his personal problems behind him, he can reemerge as a deep
threat and get more yardage after the catch. He's still a target
for Bledsoe anytime, anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Rutledge will be the second tight end in running situations to
take advantage of his blocking skills, but he's made strides as a
receiver. Bartrum won't be on the field too often, as long snappers
are like gold _ you hide and protect them.

JERRY RICE AT HIS PEAK IN THE OFFSEASON 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Ricky Watters has told the story many times but
just the thought of his first encounter with the King of the Hill
wears him out to this day, the strain showing on the edges of a
smile as he speaks.
</P>
<P>
   Watters had heard about The Hill before he ever ran it because
everyone who plays a down in San Francisco hears about it, and
Watters played many downs before moving on to the Eagles and now
the Seahawks. Not everyone tries The Hill but everyone knows about
it, because Jerry Rice believes he became King of the Hill in large
part because he is king of that winding piece of real estate.
</P>
<P>
   It is a hill that sits in the midst of a rolling northern
California park just south of San Francisco, a hill that runs
straight up into the clouds, toward the place where Rice sometimes
seems to have come from. It is not Mount Olympus, but it is high
enough that getting to the top tells you something about yourself.
So the rest come to test that hill and themselves. And Jerry Rice,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Rice has been running it for 15 years and many people have run
with him. The great, the near great, and the not so great have come
there. Barry Sanders has run it. Amani Toomer has run it. So, too,
have a bus full of Rice's present and former teammates, including
Roger Craig, the man who first showed it to him. Many have come to
The Hill. Fewer have come back.
</P>
<P>
   ``This hill's probably four miles and it just keeps going up and
up and up,'' Watters said of the winding gravel trail that takes
Rice through grass burnt golden brown, past a small waterfall,
through shrubs and by green trees and on to the only place he
seeks. To the top.
</P>
<P>
   For most Californians it is a beautiful hiking trail. For Jerry
Rice it is a track that has helped take him to the top of the NFL
for 15 years. But for folks such as Ricky Watters, it is simply a
hard road to glory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a trail,'' Watters remembers about his first run.
``We started off easy. I can remember thinking if I could just stay
with Jerry I'd be all right. Next thing I know he's like, `OK, go!'
He just takes off and I take off and all of a sudden I'm breaking
down. I can't run any more. I'm trying to stay with him and I
can't. When I get up near the top he's up there and he looks like
he never ran and he's like yelling, `Come on, Ricky! Come on,
baby!' He's hyping me up and everything and when I finally get
across the line I'm like, `Oh, man!' He hugs me and says good job.
Then he says, `You OK, 'cause we gotta get ready and run back
down?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm like, `What?' ''
</P>
<P>
   That is the reaction of many athletes who have watched Rice's
fanatical offseason workouts. They see him stretching with the
morning sun on a field at Menlo College or watch him run sprint
accelerators, slow jogs of 20 yards followed immediately by a
sprint of 60 followed by another 20-yard jog and so on until 14 or
15 have been done without stopping.
</P>
<P>
   They watch him sprint for nearly an hour. They watch him run
around cones, cut, moving right and then left, work with an elastic
harness strapped to his back. They watch him punish himself through
a series of pyramid sprints that begin at 100 yards and then
decrease in 10-yard intervals, losing distance but never speed
until the field has been exhausted and so has he. By then anyone
watching Rice is thinking as Watters did that first day. They are
thinking, ``Like, what?'' It is a reaction that makes Rice smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a funny thing with Ricky,'' said Rice with a grin. ``When
he came that first day we started off and we ran easy the first
mile or so, but those last 800 yards are straight up. When I beat
him to the top he was devastated!''
</P>
<P>
   He laughs at the thought, glorying in this small victory because
that is what he has always been about.
</P>
<P>
   Dominance of his body and his game.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many who have come to The Hill are like 49er receiver J.J.
Stokes. They try it Rice's way for a while and then leave for more
standard team fitness fare. Yet even with the passage of time Rice
remains, having decided years ago that there would be nothing about
him that is standard.
</P>
<P>
   So he hired a personal trainer named Ray Ferris more than a
decade ago to work with him _ whipsaw him, really _ and he has over
the years supplemented Ferris's ideas for speed work, football
drills, weight lifting, and finally the knee rehabilitation that
began in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Seldom does Rice journey to the 49ers' training complex in Santa
Clara in the offseason. Instead he works exclusively on his own.
Five, six hours a day nearly every day. He works with other
athletes like Watters if they care to test themselves, or he works
alone. Within a week or two after his annual trip to the Pro Bowl
(12 times in 14 seasons) it starts again. The private work nobody
sees. Working the way his father taught him when he used to lay
brick under a hot Mississippi sun.
</P>
<P>
   It was there in Crawford, Miss., that Jerry Rice learned the
value of hard work, catching bricks his father would throw to him,
one by one, until they were all where the father wanted them. It
was a hot Delta blues lesson passed from man to boy along with
those flying bricks, and the son has not forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``After my rookie year (a disappointing 1985 in which he was
plagued with so many dropped balls that despite catching 49 passes
for 927 yards to become the NFC rookie of the year, he heard
mocking boos one day in San Francisco after he had dropped four
passes against the Rams, boos he has never quite forgotten), I went
out with Roger Craig and Ray Ferris and I thought I was in the best
shape of my life and they near ran me to death,'' Rice remembered.
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, Rice stood looking sleek in a jet black Spandex
body suit, his cleats spatted by perfectly aligned white adhesive
tape. He had just finished a light training camp workout with his
teammates on the football field at the University of the Pacific,
where the 49ers train in the summer. Though nearly 37, he looked
like a man for whom the word fitness was invented.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't get through their program that day,'' Rice said.
``So it's been part of me ever since. I was one of the first to get
in on this (working out outside a team's structure), and I believe
it's kept me very productive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is simple. Push your body to the ultimate. It's a
very competitive thing.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There has never been a receiver more competitive than Rice, who
has dominated his era like no player in league history, save Don
Hutson. He owns every receiving record worth holding, 14 in all,
including most receptions, most receiving yards, most touchdowns,
most games with 100 yards receiving, most years with 1,000 yards
receiving, most 100-catch seasons, most receiving yards in a single
season, most receiving touchdowns in a season and most seasons with
50 or more catches.

   TAKE-BOS  
 BOSTON: ... protect them.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIDE RECEIVERS _ Starters: Terry Glenn and Shawn Jefferson.
Backups: Tony Simmons, Troy Brown, Vincent Brisby, Sean Morey.
</P>
<P>
   The stats speak volumes _ the Pats are 23-11 the last three
years when Glenn plays, 7-7 when he doesn't. If he stays healthy,
he makes a tremendous impact on the offense because he often draws
double teams that could spring Jefferson (who led the league last
season at 22.7 yards per catch) or Simmons deep, Brown and Brisby
over the middle, or Coates underneath. Brown is still a big-play
guy, terrific on third down against an opposing nickel back. But
the Patriots need to throw the ball over the middle more. Last
season, Glenn and Jefferson combined for only nine catches over the
middle. The Patriots think the speedy Simmons is on his way to
stardom, and Brisby is around just in case of injuries. Morey could
be the ace in the hole, a kid who has defied the odds, made the
team, and has come up with big plays.
</P>
<P>
   OFFENSIVE LINE _ Starters: LT Bruce Armstrong, LG Heath Irwin, C
Damien Woody, RG Todd Rucci, RT Zefross Moss. Backups: C Jason
Andersen, G/T Max Lane, T Derrick Fletcher, T Ed Ellis.
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis is run blocking, but the Patriots need to better
protect the quarterback. Last year the line allowed 40 sacks in 596
pass plays, with Armstrong leading the way with 10 1/2, which
according to Stats Inc. was the second-highest among left tackles
in the NFL (former Bengal Kevin Sargent allowed 11.25), followed by
Rucci's 6 1/2. Armstrong, a six-time Pro Bowler who played all of
last season with a fracture in his right leg, is now 15-20 pounds
lighter and has a new vigor for run blocking, which he must do at a
high level for the offense to click.
</P>
<P>
   Woody has a chance to be an impact player at center because of
his size (6 feet 3 inches, 325 pounds) and quickness, but he's
replacing the steady Wohlabaugh, who allowed only 1 1/2 sacks
despite playing five games with a broken hand. Woody can help the
run game, where the Patriots averaged only 2.4 yards per carry,
29th among 30 NFL teams. The Pats need more than medicore work from
their guards and Moss. While Irwin may be quicker in run blocking,
he allowed 2.5 sacks in four games.
</P>
<P>
   DEFENSIVE LINE _ Starters: E Brandon Mitchell, T Chad Eaton, T
Henry Thomas, E Willie McGinest. Backups: E/T Chris Sullivan, T Bob
Kuberski, E Greg Spires, E Sterling Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   McGinest is to the defense what Glenn is to the offense. He has
missed 12 games the past two years with injuries, and he's the pass
rusher the defense needs to help the secondary make plays. Overall,
however, the line is thin. Eaton, who had 6.5 sacks and stuffed a
runner for no gain or a loss 10.5 times last season, keeps getting
better and is inching toward Pro Bowl caliber, but Thomas is aging
and Mitchell is playing with a broken right hand and a protective
device on his left hand. Sullivan has versatility and is
fundamentally sound, and the Patriots are hoping that they get
something extraordinary out of Palmer, who was once a starter for
the Washington Redskins and is known better for his run stopping
than his pass rushing. Kuberski can give the inside guys an
experienced backup who can allow Eaton and Thomas to rest a series
or two.
</P>
<P>
   LINEBACKERS _ Starters: WLB Tedy Bruschi, MLB Andy Katzenmoyer,
SLB Chris Slade. Backups: Marty Moore, Bernard Russ, Vernon
Crawford, Ron Merkerson, Ted Johnson (injured).
</P>
<P>
   Johnson (biceps tendon tear) has been replaced by Katzenmoyer,
who had been competing against Bruschi on the weak side.
Katzenmoyer made big plays in the exhibition games, but he has a
long way to go. Johnson's injury, coupled with the loss of Collins
in free agency, means Bruschi has to go from being an effective
nickel backer to a full-time player. Slade had an off year after an
All-Pro selection two years ago. With McGinest back, the duo should
give the Patriots a decent 1-2 pass rush. Beyond the starters,
there's little in experience. Moore has five years in the league,
but he's a better special teams player, and barring a deal for
another linebacker, this will likely not be a position of strength.
</P>
<P>
   DEFENSIVE BACKS _ Starters: LC Ty Law, RC Steve Israel, SS
Lawyer Milloy, FS Chris Carter. Backups: C Tebucky Jones, Kato
Serwanga, J'Juan Cherry; S Tony George, S Larry Whigham.
</P>
<P>
   Law, who had nine interceptions and 27 passes defensed in his
All-Pro season a year ago, is a top corner and Israel is a proven
veteran on the right side, but the Patriots are trying to improve
their nickel coverage, which was horrendous last season. This is
where Jones has to step up. Many feel Jones, taken on the first
round out of Syracuse last year, would be a killer safety in the
league but comes up short as a corner. Milloy was an All-Pro last
season and now has to add calling the backfield signals to his
responsibilities because Willie Clay was released. The jury is out
as to whether Carter can effectively replace the savvy Clay, who
averaged four interceptions and 95 tackles in his three-year
tenure. And nobody knows about Cherry, who is a sprinter and a
project.
</P>
<P>
   SPECIAL TEAMS _ Starters: P Lee Johnson, K Adam Vinatieri and
Johnson, KR Kevin Faulk and Tony Simmons, PR Troy Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has always kicked for a good average and had only one
punt blocked last season, when he averaged 44.7 yards and netted
35.6 yards per punt. The departed Tom Tupa (Jets) was money in the
bank because he was so consistent. Johnson will likely get the bulk
of kickoff duties, as he's outdistanced Vinatieri by a few yards in
the exhibition season. Vinatieri, who had six touchbacks on
kickoffs last season in 77 attempts, is still a very accurate field
goal kicker (31 for 39 last season) and has the leg strength, as he
showed when he boomed a 58-yard field goal vs. Carolina in last
week's exhibition game. The Patriots have some adjusting to do with
their kickoff team after losing returner Derrick Cullors for the
season (on injured reserve after knee surgery). Faulk appears the
top candidate to take the role, though Simmons and Jones may see
duty. Brown remains a solid punt returner who is capable of
breaking the big play, and he also may wind up on kick returns.
</P>
<P>
   COACHING _ If Pete Carroll has learned anything in his two years
here, it's that adjustments are everything. He's had a rollover
roster the past two seasons, and he has to be able to push the
right buttons to get the most out of the new, the young, and the
old on his team. The time for tinkering is over. He had a built-in
excuse for an early exit in the playoffs last season, and now,
despite some questionable personnel decisions in the exhibition
season and offseason, he'll have to live with those decisions and
produce a playoff team capable of getting deeper than Round 1 of
the playoffs. All eyes will be on Dante Scarnecchia, who is the new
offensive line coach, and Brad Seely, the new special teams coach.

   ``Dave Kocourek, our tight end, started to feel sick so he went
to his personal physician,'' said Mix. ``His doctor asked the usual
questions, like, what medications, if any, are you taking. When
Dave told his doctor about the pink pills, the doctor got alarmed.
He pulled out a pamphlet on steroids that had the word ``DANGER''
written across it in big red letters. Dave gave it to me, because I
was the team captain. I took it to the coaches, and after that the
pink pills were no longer mandatory. But they were voluntary and
available.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1963 season turned out to be a great one for the Chargers.
After three unsuccessful seasons, they won their first
championship, hammering the Boston Patriots, 51-10, in the
championship game. The Chargers were bigger and stronger.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things I will never forget about those early
weightlifting sessions with Alvin was the first time he had Ernie
Ladd and Earl Faison try lifting,'' said Mix. ``They had never
lifted in their lives. I thought I was as strong as any guy in the
league at the time, and I could military press 325 pounds. Alvin
put 300 pounds on for these guys, and they both lifted it over
their heads. First shot. I couldn't believe it. They had such great
natural strength.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   After the 1966 season, the Kansas City Chiefs represented the
AFL in the first Super Bowl, and lost to Green Bay. When the season
was over, Roy offered head coach Hank Stram some help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alvin came to me and told me he thought he could help our
club,'' said Stram, ``and after talking to him I thought he could.
We only had two players on our team at the time, Walt Corey and
Smokey Stover, who lifted weights. The rest didn't. But I was
impressed by the way it helped Corey and Stover, who came into the
league at 185 and built themselves up to 235. I told Alvin that if
he came to Kansas City and worked full time with our team, he had a
deal. With the Chargers it was just a training camp thing, and then
going around after the season, checking on guys for Sid (Gillman)
to make sure some of his players were staying in shape.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stram-Roy agreement led to another innovation. ``Because we
hired him, we had the first minicamp ever in pro football,'' said
Stram. ``It evolved because I wanted to bring all our players in
right away, so Alvin could teach them the fundamentals of lifting
weights. When they went back home, they could stay with it and do
it right. The next year we asked the players to get jobs around
Kansas City so they could come in and work out at our facility, and
some 35 of them did just that.''
</P>
<P>
   Roy's legend continued to grow. The Chiefs won the Super Bowl in
1969. The next year the Cowboys hired him to start their program.
When Stram finished at Kansas City and went to New Orleans, he
brought Roy with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He set up the programs for the Chargers, Chiefs, Cowboys, and
Saints,'' said Stram, ``and when I got fired in New Orleans, I
called up Al Davis and told him he should take this guy. And he
did. Unfortunately, he died when he was in Oakland. I got a call
from Al LoCasale one day and he said, `Hank, I've got some bad
news. Alvin Roy died on the practice field today. He had a heart
attack.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Strange thing is, he always talked about possible heart
troubles. Everyone in his family had died of heart attacks. I was
at a golf tourney the other day in Kansas City and somehow Alvin's
name came up. I told whoever asked me, `It's a shame Alvin wasn't
still alive to see what has happened. He's the guy that started all
of this.' He loved what he did. He did it with a passion. He was a
real nice guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Pettit, the great scorer from the St. Louis Hawks now in the
basketball Hall of Fame, has fond memories of Roy. ``I didn't know
Alvin when I was at LSU, but after my third year in the pros, I
went to him because I felt I had to get stronger,'' Pettit said.
``Now, it wasn't because I wasn't doing well in the NBA. I had
three pretty good years. But I weighed just 210 and was getting
pushed around a little bit. So I went to Alvin and he was a great
help over the next four years. I got my weight up to 240 pounds,
and going toward the end of my career, I got to like the hitting
and physical play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lifting with Alvin made me stronger, gave me more endurance,
strengthened my hands. In the offseason, when I came home to Baton
Rouge, I'd go over to work out with guys like Jim Taylor and Billy
Cannon. When I started with Alvin, I was the first guy in the NBA
to lift weights. When Wilt Chamberlain came along, I think he was
the second guy. Alvin was way ahead of his time and a really nice
man.''
</P>
<P>
   Sam King, sports columnist for the Baton Rouge Advocate, also
remembers him fondly. ``I went to LSU in '56, the same year Billy
Cannon went to the school,'' he said. ``Alvin did a great job with
Billy, and Jim Taylor. They really thrived under him, and our team
went on to win a national championship, and Cannon won the Heisman.
I got to know Alvin when I was a student. He was a very nice man.
Years later, when he was with Dallas, I bumped into him one day and
I mentioned my young son was a Cowboy fan. That Christmas Eve I got
a call. It was Alvin. Said he was coming home for Christmas, would
be at the Baton Rouge Airport at 11 o'clock, and that I should meet
him because he had an autographed football for my son, signed by
Roger Staubach and all the Cowboys. He made my son the happiest kid
in the country that next morning. That's the way Alvin was. He was
nice to everyone.''

BIG-TIME BACKFIELDS FACE DOUBLE TROUBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The question is so basic that you feel silly asking it: Who's
your quarterback?
</P>
<P>
   Now, if you are a 2-9 team, looking to make a turnaround, maybe
it makes sense. But what if you are a top 10 program? What if you
won a national championship just a couple of years ago or are among
the favorites to win one this season?
</P>
<P>
   Look what is happening in college football. Look at No. 2 Penn
State, at No. 5 Nebraska, at No. 6 Michigan, at No. 13 Ohio State,
at No. 14 UCLA, and at No. 19 Arizona. Look at what is probably
going to happen soon at schools such as Oregon, California, and
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   All have quarterback controversies either in progress or
gathering strength like a storm in the South Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Michigan and Penn State used the quarterback tandem
system, which is surprising since both Michigan coach Lloyd Carr
and Penn State's Joe Paterno have often proclaimed themselves
one-QB guys.
</P>
<P>
   Carr has a ``problem'' because in Tom Brady and Drew Henson he
has two quarterbacks he believes capable of leading the Wolverines
to at least the Big Ten title.
</P>
<P>
   Paterno feels the same about his duo, starter Kevin Thompson and
``backup'' Rashard Casey.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the quarterback-tandem system say it can work.
They point to a most recent example: Arizona, which went 12-1 last
season under the guidance of Ortege Jenkins and Keith Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Carr used both Brady and Henson in last week's win over Notre
Dame. Brady played three quarters, Henson one. It was Brady at the
helm during the fourth-quarter drive that won the game for
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   The Michigan situation is complicated by Henson's threat that,
unless he plays, he will give up football and resume his baseball
careeer as a minor leaguer with the Yankees, who are recruiting him
as hard as Michigan did two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Will Carr stick with his quarterback rotation? ``We'll see how
it goes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Penn State, which has started with two easy wins with
Casey and Thompson splitting time, Paterno said, ``We're going to
keep playing both.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, that will prove to be both teams' undoing. Two
quarterbacks cannot fit into one position.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, the Nittany Lions can zip past Akron and roll over
Pittsburgh, as they are expected to do Saturday afternoon, but when
it comes to crunch time aginst Miami next week or against Michigan
or Ohio State later this season, Penn State is going to need a
leader, one quarterback who makes the plays.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose Paterno decides that Thompson, with whom he seems to
feel more comfortable, has had a horrendous opening quarter against
Ohio State in their game next month. Knowing that a shot at the
national championship is at stake, he inserts Casey, who guides the
Lions to a pair of touchdowns in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   What does Paterno do at halftime? Stick with Casey? That seems
to be the obvious choice. But then Casey throws a couple of
interceptions in the third quarter, and Ohio State takes the lead.
</P>
<P>
   What does Paterno do going into the fourth quarter?
</P>
<P>
   It's a coach's nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches are paid to make decisions. And no decision is more
important than naming a starting quarterback. For the mental health
of a team, the identity of the starting quarterback should never be
in question.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Great expectations
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If anyone is wondering why No. 1 Florida State is such a big
favorite over No. 10 Georgia Tech in Saturday night's Atlantic
Coast Conference showdown in Tallahassee, they need only look at
the results of the last three meetings of Tech and the Seminoles at
Doak Campbell Stadium. Combined score: 131-10. And make no mistake:
The Seminoles know the importance of beating Tech. No one else in
the ACC looks capable of beating them, unless FSU has its annual
brain burp, which its backers vow won't happen this season . . .
Poor Central Florida. The Golden Knights opened their season by
getting blasted by Purdue last week. Next up: games at Florida, at
Georgia Tech, and at Georgia. No one in the country will play a
tougher stretch of games than that this season . . . With Miami
running back Najeh Davenport out for the season with a knee injury,
Hurricanes coach Butch Davis went down his depth chart to play true
freshman Jarrett Payton. Yes, he's the son of Hall of Fame running
back Walter Payton. Payton, who picked up 32 yards in nine carries
in Miami's 57-3 win over Florida A&AMP;M last week, had a bittersweet
feeling about his college debut. With his father back home in
Chicago, awaiting a liver transplant, he understandably had mixed
emotions. ``Sometimes I get choked up,'' he said after the game.
``I wanted my dad here tonight, but I know what's important is that
he stays home and rests and gets better so he can come to my games.
I don't want to rush anything.'' . . . Temple has a new running
backs coach, former Penn State star Blair Thomas, and one of his
jobs has very little do with X's and O's. ``The first thing you
have to do is change the attitude of the players you have,'' said
Thomas, who was a running back on Penn State's national
championship team in 1986. Since Temple hasn't had a winning season
in nine years, that will be a full-time job . . . Speaking of
Temple, it's nice to see that Kansas State has upgraded its
schedule. The Wildcats of Bill Snyder host Temple Saturday in their
opener. The other KSU nonconference games are against Texas-El Paso
and Utah State. Let's see, Miami plays Ohio State, Florida State,
and Penn State in three of its nonconference games _ who do you
think wins the strength-of-schedule tie-breaker if Miami and
K-State both have one loss going into Bowl Championship Series
selection weekend? . . . Most players wait until the end of the
season to make their postseason all-star game plans. Not Navy wide
receiver Travis Williams. He's already been selected to play in the
2000 Hula Bowl next January . . . Don't bet the house on Pacific-10
teams winning close games. Seven of the schools in the conference
are breaking in new kickers . . . UCLA, with 14 players suspended
for last week's game against Boise State and Saturday's matchup at
Ohio State because of the handicapped parking scandal of last
season, will go into the Buckeyes game with only 67 scholarship
players available and six starters missing . . . Penn State has won
both its games in spectacular fashion, going through the ``A'' part
of its schedule with easy wins over Arizona and Akron. The Nittany
Lions have had 15 of their 16 scoring drives take less than three
minutes . . . Sign of the times at Alabama: The Tide started two
true freshmen _ offensive tackle Dante Ellington and linebacker
Saleem Rasherd _ against Vanderbilt. It was the first time in
school history that two true freshmen started the Tide's opening
game . . . Don't expect the Pitt-Penn State series to continue much
longer. Paterno is not interested in a home-and-home deal with the
Panthers anymore. He wants a 2-1 ratio, which is OK with Pittsburgh
coach Walt Harris but not with athletic director Steve Pederson. If
this series does dissolve, it will be another case of good,
old-fashioned, and fast-disappearing Eastern rivalries dying out.

AIRWAVES NOW SUPER SATURATED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's been a good four decades since CBS launched the first NFL
pregame show. During most of the 1960s and '70s, the network had
the only pregame show, a staggering fact, considering the
astounding number of programs these days dedicated to professional
football on network, cable, radio, and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   So much football, so little time.
</P>
<P>
   Take ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   Enough said.
</P>
<P>
   The network is so big that it had to start another network
``ESPN Now'' just to tell viewers what ESPN2, ESPN Classic and its
other sister stations had on air.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sunday NFL Countdown'' is a two-hour show. ``NFL PrimeTime''
is the 45-minute, must-see show on Sunday nights. ``Monday Night
Countdown'' comes on two hours before sister network ABC airs its
weekly showcase game, ``Monday Night Football.'' For daily doses
from Tuesday through Saturday, ESPN has the 30-minute ``NFL
2Night.'' And for the real die-hards, the 30-minute ``Edge NFL
matchup'' airs on both ESPN and ESPN2 during off-hours.
</P>
<P>
   Don't bother factoring in all the NFL reports that run
throughout ``SportsCenter.''
</P>
<P>
   The total comes to at least nine hours per week of NFL-specific
programming. It doesn't sound like much when calculated in a vacuum
and given all the self-promotion the self-proclaimed Sports Leader
has on air. But when added to the countless number of NFL shows on
other networks, it's a miracle that any other event can attract any
significant coverage.
</P>
<P>
   OK. Maybe the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   But not even baseball, America's former national pastime, could
generate such nicknames as the ``Super Six'' for its sportscasters.
</P>
<P>
   The Super Six?
</P>
<P>
   Oh, that's Keith Olbermann, Chris Myers, Kevin Frazier, Steve
Lyons, Jeanne Zelasko, and Van Earl Wright over on Fox Sports Net.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a time when college football was king,'' said CBS
Sports executive producer Terry Ewert. ``Those days are gone. We
are all living in the golden age of the NFL. Every fan out there _
not just the obsessed, but also the casual fans _ are interested in
the sport year round. They are interested in their own team, the
moving around of players, statistics, everything. It's become such
a huge thing that the public wants to see more.''
</P>
<P>
   And television executives are only too willing to oblige. The
main reason: money. ESPN, Fox, ABC, and CBS paid $17.6 billion to
air NFL games for the next eight years _ and somone has to pay
those bills.
</P>
<P>
   That would be advertisers. Thirty-second spots are worth as much
as $450,000. Those same spots fetch about $1.4 million during the
Super Bowl. That's a lot of Budweiser and Dodges.
</P>
<P>
   Most industry analysts argue that the exposure is not harming
the sport, that it is only providing as much information to a
seemingly insatiable public. That suggests if more people watched
American soccer, then advertisers would support more _ whoops,
would support ``a'' professional soccer pregame show.
</P>
<P>
   Other industry observers worry about the NFL glut and its impact
on sports journalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``You used to be able to go in and kind of develop sources and
get people to tell you everything and break things and nobody else
would know,'' said Peter King, he of Sports Illustrated and its
television counterpart, CNN/SI. ``But to me it's become pretty much
a ruthless, cutthroat, dog-eat-dog business. Clearly, the
competition is stronger than it's ever been. And I think all of us
who are in the information business right now look at it and say
that if we don't bring our `A' games to the table every week, we're
going to get slaughtered.''
</P>
<P>
   True indeed.
</P>
<P>
   CNN/SI tries to solve the problem by coming on first at 10 a.m.
on Sunday mornings.
</P>
<P>
   To stay fresh, most networks hire newspaper guys to appear on
air. Never mind McDonough, Shaughnessy, Ryan, or Borges at the
Globe dominating Boston's TV and radio programs.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, for instance, Jay Mariotti, an award-winning
columnist for the Chicago Sun-Times, also has his own radio show,
from 10 a.m.-2 p.m. weekdays on One-On-One Sports. He also appears
on Fox News Channel from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine that the first NFL pregame show appeared in
1957 on CBS. ``Pro Football Kickoff'' was a 15-minute show hosted
by Bud Palmer. He was replaced by Johnny Lujack in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, ``NFL Today'' went to 30 minutes, and 32 years later,
well, put it this way: If you listen real close, ABC is already
promoting its Super Bowl coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Its pregame show then, if you count all the little reminders
that the Bowl is on ABC, has established a new world record for
pregame coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Five months.

SMASH MOUTH MAKING FUN A FUNDAMENTAL AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; So you think rock music has gotten a little too serious in the
last few years? Then Smash Mouth might be for you. Named for the
term ``smash mouth'' coined by NFL coach Mike Ditka to denote
violent football, the band is just the opposite, embracing
listeners with a sense of zany fun.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing this band smashes is the laugh meter, especially
in the runaway hit ``All Star,'' a Top 5 song from the band's Top
10 album, ``Astro Lounge.'' Sample lines: ``Hey now, you're an all
star, get your game on, go play; hey now, you're a rock star, get
the show on, get paid.''
</P>
<P>
   Smash Mouth and Ditka do have one trait in common: ``We don't
take no for an answer,'' says singer Steve Harwell.
</P>
<P>
   Smash Mouth first scored two years ago with the surprise hit,
``Walkin' on the Sun.'' And the new album picks up from that with
rib-tickling tracks ``Roadman'' (``driving like a madman''),
``Stoned,'' and ``Digging Your Scene.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We approach this as a business, but first as fun,'' Harwell
says. ``A lot of people are too serious about this stuff. The way
we broke through is that we just wrote fun songs that people have
always wanted to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   Call it the other side of grunge and angst, but it's just Smash
Mouth music to Harwell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Music took such a turn with the Nirvanas and Marilyn Mansons
and all that. It just kind of got away from what it's all about.
It's always been about fun pop songs and just rockin'. I like to
think we brought that back.''
</P>
<P>
   Based in San Jose, Calif., Smash Mouth's music is an eclectic
mix of surf-rock, new-wave pop (Harwell has been heavily influenced
by Joe Jackson and Squeeze), upbeat reggae, flamenco guitar fills,
and spacey lounge core, topped by quippy hooks that you can't get
out of your head. When told that ``Roadman'' has such a hook,
Harwell says, ``Hey, I'm doing my job, then. If you're going crazy,
it's working.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Roadman'' was written about a former Smash Mouth roadie, while
the Beatlesque ``Just Wanna See'' has an almost fairy-tale humor:
``All the little kids gettin' down to the rhythm, and the boys all
shined up chasin' down the women . . . And Mr. Moon checkin' on how
you're all livin'.''
</P>
<P>
   But the song sweeping the country is ``All Star,'' whose
marketing angles have been endless. ``The timing was perfect for
it,'' says Harwell. ``It ended up that almost every sports team
wanted to use it. We got a lot of exposure that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Smash Mouth was invited to sing the song at the home run derby
at Fenway Park this summer, the night before the All Star Game. The
band performed by the bullpen and Harwell heard some boos when he
yelled ``Save Fenway Park!'' But he says, ``I didn't care. I just
think it's stupid to tear that park down.''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind, though, because the band got to meet the all-stars
and hung out with Red Sox shortstop Nomar Garciaparra, who ``is
actually a big fan of ours,'' says Harwell.
</P>
<P>
   Smash Mouth formed four years ago. It pooled the talents of
Harwell (an Elvis Presley devotee), guitarist Greg Camp (a
surf-rock lover), bassist Paul DeLisle (a punk-rock fan), and
drummer Kevin Coleman, who named the group (Smash Mouth was one
word at that time), but has since left the band because of back
problems. His replacement is Mitch Marine, who is not yet a
full-time member.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin's back problems were affecting our shows,'' says
Harwell. ``It got to the point where we didn't even want to go out
there. But that's turned around now. We have a new spark in our
attitude. Now, it's `Let's go play.' It was a bad thing that turned
into a positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Musically, Smash Mouth has made its reputation with lighthearted
fare, but there are deeper tunes on the latest album, including
``Fallen Horses.'' Says Harwell: ``That was written for Paul
McCartney. Right before his wife (Linda) died, he had taken her to
Mexico, where they went on their last horse ride. . . . I saw the
news clip of her riding the horse in slow motion and him right
behind her. It clicked in my head.''
</P>
<P>
   Following the tour with Kravitz, Smash Mouth will do some radio
shows, then mount its own tour in February. ``We hope to go out
with a good three-band bill,'' says Harwell. ``We're just really
excited about how things are going.''

TEXAS TRAGEDY, FROM EYES IN THE STORM 
</HEADLINE>

ISAAC'S STORM 
A Man, a Time, and the Deadliest Hurricane in History 
By Erik Larson 
Crown, 323 pp., $25 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the predictions of meteorologists are on target, this could
be the most timely book of the next two months: This year's
Atlantic hurricane season is supposed to produce more, and perhaps
more intense, storms than in any recent year.
</P>
<P>
   But if a major hurricane does menace the New England coast,
``Isaac's Storm'' will not be the most comfortable book to have by
the bedside as the wind shrieks and the waves rise.
</P>
<P>
   The storm in question _ its designation as ``Isaac's'' is
another question _ is the hurricane that struck Galveston, Texas,
on Saturday, Sept. 8, 1900. It was a storm of truly frightful
proportions, turning a thriving, bustling city into a wasteland of
rubble in which were buried the bodies of as many as 8,000 of its
residents.
</P>
<P>
   Erik Larson's accomplishment is to have made this great-storm
story a very human one _ thanks to his use of the large number of
survivors' accounts _ without ignoring the hurricane itself.
</P>
<P>
   The storm crossed Cuba on Sept. 4 and was predicted to turn
north toward the Atlantic coast. Instead, it steered across the
Gulf of Mexico and made landfall just south of Galveston. The
conventional wisdom of the time held that Galveston's sloping
offshore shelf would temper the force of storm-driven waves, and
there are accounts of children playing in the surf just hours
before the hurricane-force winds drove the sea over the beach and
far into the city.
</P>
<P>
   By early evening, Larson writes, ``the sea had erected an
escarpment of wreckage three stories tall and several miles long''
that was ``so tall, so massive that it acted as a kind of seawall''
_ except that as the waves shoved it forward, ``it scraped the city
clean of all structures and all life.''
</P>
<P>
   This is clearly more than ``Isaac's storm.'' Building the story
around one character is a useful device, but perhaps it was done
mainly as an (over-)reaction to the impersonality of Sebastian
Junger's ``The Perfect Storm.'' True, Isaac Cline is an easily
identifiable character, and there is a serious question about
whether, as head of the weather bureau, he fatally underestimated
the potential for destruction from a storm hitting Galveston. But
curiously, the story seems to stall whenever Cline becomes the
focus _ and too often Larson has to pump up his central character
with ``what was Isaac thinking'' speculation. And frankly, Larson's
bit players too often upstage Cline.
</P>
<P>
   Among the incidents that capture the physical and emotional
impact of the storm surge is that experienced by merchant (and
amateur meteorologist) Samuel O. Young. His house was six blocks in
from the beachfront, and his family was safely out of town, so
Young stayed, watching the storm's progress from his second-floor
windows. Curious about ``a heavy thumping that seemed to come from
a downstairs bedroom,'' he went to investigate. Looking down the
stairwell, he saw that the water had risen almost to the top step.
``The heavy thudding . . . had to be furniture. A bureau, perhaps,
bumping against the ceiling as the water rose and fell.''
</P>
<P>
   By that time, in the early evening, only one other house still
stood in Young's immediate neighborhood: that of a family named
Youens. As Young watched, he saw it ``begin a slow pirouette.'' In
his account, ``Mr. Youens' house rose like a huge steamboat, was
swept back and suddenly disappeared.'' Knowing that the parents and
their two children had remained inside, he said, ``my feelings were
indescribable as I saw them go.''
</P>
<P>
   And there are dozens of other vividly recounted incidents that
could be singled out to illustrate the dimensions of the story and
Larson's skillful telling of it.
</P>
<P>
   It is a tribute to his control of his material _ and of his
writing _ that there is only one moment at which he seems to have
allowed his emotional response to overtake the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly,'' Larson writes, ``the prospect of watching their
children die became very real'' for families trapped in their
houses. ``Whom did you save? Did you seek to save one child, or try
to save all, at the risk of ultimately saving none? . . . And if
you saved none, what then? How did you go on?''
</P>
<P>
   The sophisticated reader may find the emotionalism unsettling, a
lapse in literary judgment. But ultimately, as the accounts of just
such situations multiply _ thumping like Mr. Young's furniture at
the reader's consciousness _ that series of questions universalizes
the account of one storm in one place at one time. The storm, the
place, the time, after all, could be here and now.

AGUILERA SHOWS SHE'S MORE THAN JUST MARKETING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN ANDERMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On paper, Christina Aguilera sounds a whole lot like one more
little dot on pop music's connect-the-dots teen-dream page. Here's
the resume: 12th-grader with bare midriff and ``Melrose Place''
hair sings sultry dance-pop tunes. Alumnus of star-studded ``Mickey
Mouse Club'' class of '93, with Britney Spears, J.C. and Justin
from 'N Sync, and ``Felicity's'' Keri Russell. Fashionably Latin
surname (her father is Ecuadoran) offers unbelievable
cross-marketing potential.
</P>
<P>
   Slam-dunk. Drooling executives at RCA snapped Aguilera up, spent
a year fine-tuning her clothes, hair, makeup, and material, and _
surprise, surprise _ the 18-year-old songbird has a smash hit.
``Genie in a Bottle,'' which spent five weeks this summer at No. 1
on the Billboard Hot 100, is a pulsing R&AMP;B tune that plays like a
sonic transliteration of Aguilera's much-photographed pout. ``You
gotta rub me the right way,'' the singer implores again and again
in a breathy vamp, suggesting that nothing less than her chastity
is at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Now there's something adolescents and record-company vice
presidents can really get excited about. The big surprise, however,
is that Aguilera's eponymous debut CD _ which opened at No. 1 on
the Billboard charts this week _ is something that the rest of us
can get excited about, too. That's not to suggest that these 12
tracks form a cohesive, gratifying body of work. Artistically
speaking, there's more promise than actual delivery, mainly because
Aguilera's songs sound like they just rolled off the assembly line.
In other words, the Christina Team at RCA would very much like a
return on its hefty investment, and dance-pop formulas are as
predictably lucrative as they are musically predictable. The songs
range from inspirational power ballads like ``I Turn To You'' (one
of two tracks by the one-woman hit factory Diane Warren) to
cliche-ridden confections (``Come On Over (All I Want Is You)'' and
``Love Will Find a Way'') to the paint-by-numbers cadences of
``Reflection,'' originally recorded for the soundtrack to Disney's
animated film ``Mulan.''
</P>
<P>
   While the tunes are at times painfully familiar, and overtly
skewed toward the teen market _ Aguilera's singing soars above the
fray. Where Britney Spears comes off as quick study who can mimic
serviceable licks and carry a tune, Aguilera is a real singer.
Mariah, Whitney, and Celine all come to mind; Aguilera is similarly
blessed with the sort of breathtaking elasticity, golden tones, and
sheer power that separates the divas from the dabblers.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Mariah Carey, to whom she'll draw the most
comparisons, Aguilera's vocal gymnastics are fleshed out by feel _
not just for expertly navigating a melody, but for navigating a
lyric with subtlety and passion. On ``Obvious'' _ a lovely,
bittersweet ballad and the most sophisticated track _ Aguilera's
delivery is at once sweet and unsettled. She bundles the innocent
delirium of infatuation with the aching fear that her feelings will
show, and shuttles between the two with a breadth of emotion rare
in someone so young. Ironically, the most powerful element about
the song is that _ for all her youth-defying vocal prowess _
Aguilera paints a vivid portrait of what it feels like to be 18
years old. She accomplishes a similar feat on ``What A Girl
Wants,'' a breezy celebration of patience in the pursuit of
self-discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Here's hoping Aguilera's handlers let her grow up to discover
what it's like not just to be a successful singer, but to sing
great songs.

GHOSTS OF SUMMER HAUNT `STIR OF ECHOES' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
STIR OF ECHOES 
Written and directed by: David Koepp (novel: Richard Matheson) 
Starring: Kevin Bacon, Kathryn Erbe, Ileana Douglas, Liza Weil,
Kevin Dunn, Conor O'Farrell, Jennifer Morrison, Zachary David Cope 
Running time: 110 minutes 
Rated: R (violence, sexuality and language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Stir of Echoes'' is a solidly crafted and perfectly
respectable supernatural thriller that has the bad luck to follow
the higher-impact ``Blair Witch Project'' and ``The Sixth Sense''
into the marketplace. Unfairly perhaps, but inevitably, compared
withthose films, it's a bit earthbound and lacking in joltage, even
though it stacks up competitively enough on a point-by-point
comparison, starting with strong lead performances by Kevin Bacon
and Kathryn Erbe as a Chicago working-class couple and Zachary
David Cope as their young son. The latter's matter-of-fact
acceptance of the presence of ghosts in their house rivals that of
Haley Joel Osment in ``The Sixth Sense,'' although he doesn't bear
anything like the weight of sadness in Osment's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the air turns cold in the presence of the ghosts the
young can see and their parents can't, at least not at first. The
composure of Bacon's convincingly inscribed working stiff begins to
crack, however, after he allows himself to be hypnotized at a
neighborhood party and subsequently is beset by disturbing visions.
Soon he, too, finds himself staring at an obviously unhappy ghost
whose troubled spirit can't rest until a horrible wrong has been
put right. Initially, his skepticism anchors the film in its
Chicago working-class neighborhood milieu. But soon it becomes a
liability because he's the last one to piece together what
happened. Given the same flashbacks and visions, we in the audience
are way ahead of him in figuring out where the story is going.
</P>
<P>
   What ``Stir of Echoes'' comes down to is a nice screenful of
Chicago neighborhood atmosphere that's virtually devoid of mystery,
and consequently suspense, much less the surprise ending that has
audiences returning to ``The Sixth Sense'' to read that film's
clues in retrospect. ``Stir of Echoes'' might have worked just fine
a few decades ago, but it now seems too simply schematic to spook
us as much as it wants to. Too bad, because there's some nice work
on screen. In addition to Bacon, Erbe, and Cope, the appealing
down-to-earth quality extends as well to Illeana Douglas's friendly
neighborhood psychic and Kevin Dunn's next-door neighbor who has
his own reasons for feeling tortured. But ``Stir of Echoes'' needs
less down-to-earth flavor and more unearthly force.

EERIE `STIGMATA' SPOILED BY MTV-STYLE DIRECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
Directed by: Rupert Wainwright 
Screenplay by: Tom Lazarus, Rick Ramage 
Starring: Patricia Arquette, Gabriel Byrne, Jonathan Pryce, Nia
Long, Dick Latessa, Ann Cusack, Enrico Colantoni, Thomas Kopache,
Portia De Rossi, Patrick Muldoon, Rade Sherbedgia 
Running time: 102 minutes 
Rated: R (intense violent sequences, language and some sexuality) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Think ``The Exorcist'' when you think of ``Stigmata'' and you
won't be far from wrong. ``Stigmata'' is a sort of reverse
``Exorcist,'' in which an honest priestly investigator played by
Gabriel Byrne tries to find out why the spirit of a dead but godly
priest is driving spikes through Pittsburgh hairdresser Patricia
Arquette's hands and feet and making her life miserable. He brings
enough warmth and nuanced intelligence and simply humanity to keep
cliche at bay, and give the priest a bit more dimension than
priests in films like this are usually allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Arquette, too, performs impressively as the intelligent but
increasingly drained and worried and desperate woman who asks how
she can believe in God if he allows such things to happen to her.
Not a believer, she has little patience with the priest's advice to
regard as a gift from God the mysterious wounds mimicking the
wounds of Christ on the cross. It takes them a long time to connect
these events to a rosary sent by the woman's mother, who got it
during a visit to a South American church where inexplicable events
have occurred following the death of a revered priest and maverick
biblical scholar.
</P>
<P>
   Even Pittsburgh, where the film was shot, plays a central role,
being photographed as a looming presence, its towers slammed
onscreen at vertiginous angles, including the art deco building
where Arquette's single woman lives in a snazzy loft. Or, rather, a
loft that had been snazzy until mysterious gushers of blood begin
splashing through it. Lots of old buildings, lots of alleys, lots
of drained color and brutal grave clarity in the look of things
play powerfully against the battered sweetness and spunkiness
Arquette projects, even when she's possessed and rattling through a
long-buried passage of Aramaic.
</P>
<P>
   If only director Rupert Wainwright had trusted the visual
effects and the intriguing story elements more. Time and again,
mood is destroyed, or rather, never gets the chance to form.
Eeriness and otherworldliness are crowded off the screen by an
overaggressive attack mentality that sends images cascading across
the screen as if being dished out by the church of MTV. Soon the
images of blood, especially blood spreading as it drops into water,
arrive at a point of diminishing returns. ``Stigmata'' could have
been a classy thriller. But all the Aramaic in the world can't save
it from its own pounding slickness.

`LOVE STORY' IS HUGE AND INTIMATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN KOCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
AN AMERICAN LOVE STORY 
Produced, directed and videotaped by: Jennifer Fox 
On: PBS 
Date: Sunday (9-12) through Thursday (9-11 p.m.) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chaney Sims, the younger daughter of Karen Wilson and Bill Sims,
is physically mature for a not-quite-13-year-old girl, and her
parents are in a swivet about her first-ever date. Their small
balconied apartment in Queens, N.Y., virtually vibrates with
parental agitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what the male mind-set is,'' worries Bill, ``I've been
a boy.'' Karen, who has a lovely, photogenic smile and, like her
husband, an infectious laugh, is cautiously setting boundaries for
the neighborhood walk she may or may not allow the youngsters to
take.
</P>
<P>
   With all the fuss, Chaney feels emotionally caged. But later in
this, the fifth hourlong episode of the 10-part ``An American Love
Story,'' she says in an interview with the filmmaker, ``I'm going
have a lot of children _ eight or nine, and Daddy's going to help
me raise them.''
</P>
<P>
   Her fantasy is testimony _ as is this finely textured, intimate,
and ambitious chronicle itself _ to deeply loving family commitment
or, as the current cliche would have it, family values. In the same
episode, after the family colors Easter eggs in the cramped but
always bustling kitchen, Bill laments the maturing of his
``babies,'' Chaney and Cicily, a senior at Colgate University who
spent some of the previous year in Africa. ``I just want to hold on
to it as long I can,'' he says, seeing their youthful innocence
slipping away.
</P>
<P>
   The nonfiction ``An American Love Story,'' debuting nationally
on PBS, disproves Tolstoy's dictum that ``happy families are all
alike.'' Here are very particular, memorably idiosyncratic, and
appealing people who come to seem like members of your own family.
Such is the level of intimacy, empathy, and accessibility achieved
by filmmaker Jennifer Fox, who, along with her sound engineer,
lived with the Wilson-Sims family for 18 months and shot 1,000
hours of videotape in the course of a seven-year filmmaking
process. Study life closely and sympathetically enough, Fox seems
to be saying in her huge, occasionally unruly opus, and it will
defy narrow or arbitrary categorization.
</P>
<P>
   One of the results is a novelistically rich account of family
love, of devotion as pure as it can be in the real world of sweat
and tears with its sickness and weakness _ ills that finally beset
everyone, including the family in ``An American Love Story.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a much larger sense, if we understand our nation as a
kind of extended family, this documentary is about the deeply
troubling consequences of perhaps our worst ``family'' problem _
racism.
</P>
<P>
   It's about the injustices, tensions, frictions, and fractures
race hatred causes _ about the agonizingly personal suffering it
inflicts on individuals and, by implication, the broad social
dysfunction it foments.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Sims, whom we learn is a blues singer in the second episode
and whose plaintive voice is heard throughout the series singing
original compositions, is black. Karen, who, like Bill, grew up
near Columbus, Ohio, is white. They decided to raise their family
in Queens because, while they agree that New York is no less
prejudiced than most other places, they find it more tolerant _ a
subtle distinction that perhaps only people blistered by the
effects of discrimination can readily make.
</P>
<P>
   The parents know that their two biracial daughters occupy a
realm foreign to their own experiences, often forced by society to
choose between colors and cultures that are equally natural and
important to them. But should there ever be a race war, Chaney
reasons, she'd have to stick with her dad because, as he points
out, to our race-obsessed society at large she and her sister are
perceived as black.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to be black, a lot of white people don't realize
that,'' says Cicily, who attends a predominantly white university
where she's painfully marginalized by nearly everyone and has few
close friends. The stress caused her to lose much of her hair as a
freshman. Being black, says Bill, ``You have to be tense all the
time,'' something he and Karen know only too well.
</P>
<P>
   Dating in Ohio in the late '60s, they both suffered emotionally
costly threats and harassment because of Bill's color. We learn
that Bill was detained and searched so many times by local police
in Prospect, Karen's hometown, that her father complained to the
town council.
</P>
<P>
   The documentary's revealing and searingly personal take on race
prejudice emerges naturally in the context of this engrossing
family story. And for this reason, it's hard to imagine how anyone
exposed to the film could deny the mundanely ugly presence of
American racism, its distressing persistence and depth. ``An
American Love Story'' strongly suggests that antiblack feeling
hasn't significantly abated, no matter how hopefully many of us buy
into an image of a kinder, gentler, pluralistic culture today.
</P>
<P>
   But paradoxically, the toxic assaults of racism in some ways end
up strengthening, not undermining, the Wilson-Sims's solidarity.
Such is the triumph of family trust and love and mutual support,
and the sacrifices and allowances they routinely make for one
another. Perhaps nothing better symbolizes the family's nurturing
cohesiveness than images of Bill, a househusband by day, in the
kitchen slicing, dicing, frying, and baking the foods he loves to
prepare for the animated family meals. Affectionate food-rich
rituals, some involving birthdays, anniversaries, and holidays,
thread brightly through the length of an ``An American Love
Story.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not, of course, to suggest that Fox's vision of the
family is saccharine or uncomplicated by varieties of human
imperfection. For example, the knowledge that Bill is a problem
drinker creeps up on us uncertainly as if we, too, were members of
the family unwilling to fully embrace his alcoholism. Bill is
surprisingly perceptive about his carousing after-hours alter ego,
which he dubs ``The Other Bill,'' and yet he's not entirely honest
about the drinking until the angry confession he makes directly to
the camera in Episode 9.
</P>
<P>
   Memorably emotional moments like this (most of them much
happier, by the way) abound in ``An American Love Story,'' and
their candor and almost palpable urgency compensate for the
occasional lack of structure and the fuzzy audio that bedevil a few
of the episodes.
</P>
<P>
   What is perhaps most striking about the series is the level of
intimacy Fox achieves without her obvious presence or the camera
seeming invasive. An air of openly trusting collaboration _ even
under such troubling personal circumstances as a possibly
life-threatening illness Karen has at one point _ distinguishes and
dignifies this entire project.
</P>
<P>
   ``An American Love Story'' offers powerful and incontrovertible
evidence that bigotry is America's overarching problem and one that
impinges daily, often horrendously, on families like this one and
people of color throughout the country. But this is a minutely
particular story about a nimbly adaptable and deeply loving family,
so while Karen and Bill and Cicily and Chaney's lives may be sadly
shadowed by society's attitudes toward race, they are never defined
by them.
</P>
<P>
   By revealing a real world in which prejudice challenges but
never defeats a resiliently loving and creative family, ``An
American Love Story'' is a profoundly upbeat, heart-stirring, and
very important enterprise that will repay your attention
generously.

FLEMING TAKES FLIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Renee Fleming says she loves doing phone interviews because she
doesn't have to worry about how she looks. ``I can sit here in my
sweatpants and look out at San Francisco Bay at the same time I'm
talking,'' she says with a smile you can hear.
</P>
<P>
   America's favorite soprano is on the phone to talk about the
Tuesday release of her new CD devoted to Richard Strauss. One of
the first great records of her career was of Strauss's ``Four Last
Songs'' with Christoph Eschenbach conducting; a later album
included the final scene from Strauss's opera ``Daphne'' under Sir
Georg Solti. And now Decca has recorded Fleming in a gorgeous disc
of the final scene from ``Capriccio,'' the duet from the first act
of ``Arabella,'' and two long stretches of ``Der Rosenkavalier,''
with Eschenbach conducting, Susan Graham chiming in as Octavian,
and Barbara Bonney singing the radiant phrases of Sophie for the
last time in her career.
</P>
<P>
   The Marschallin will be one of Fleming's principal roles this
season; she will appear in productions of ``Der Rosenkavalier'' in
five different cities. She loves singing Richard Strauss but
doesn't think of herself necessarily as a canonical ``Strauss
soprano.'' ``The three roles on the new recording are about the
only Strauss roles I can do, with the possible exception of Daphne.
And the whole idea of what a Strauss soprano is has changed over
the years. The first Marschallin, Margarethe Siems, was also the
first Zerbinetta, and no one today would dream of singing both
those roles; another famous early Marschallin, Frieda Hempel, sang
the Queen of the Night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elisabeth Schwarzkopf changed the whole nature of Strauss
singing, moving the emphasis away from the purely vocal aspect to
the dramatic. I personally like what she did, as you can probably
hear for yourself, but my goal is to find a personal balance, a
combination of the vocal and dramatic aspects of this music. My
personal preference is for the way Strauss was performed in the
'30s, when he was still alive, a more classical style, but one in
which you can always hear every word.''
</P>
<P>
   The appeal of Strauss's famous, ecstatic writing for soprano
``is that he uses the voice in a soaring kind of way, a blossoming
kind of way,'' she says. ``He understood how to create the arc of a
line above a textured orchestra and the voice flies,'' Fleming
says. ``Singing has a physical sensation to it as well as the
emotional and intellectual aspect. There is a physical joy I feel
when I am singing Strauss.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleming says a central aspect of her singing of Strauss is the
degree of comfort she feels in the German language. ``German is my
best language, after English, because I won a Fulbright Grant to
study in Germany in 1984. I can't say enough about how formative
this experience was for me. I had met the soprano Arleen Auger in
Aspen. I latched on to her and asked if I could study with her in
Frankfurt, and she said I could, although she wouldn't be there a
lot. I wasn't accepted into the opera department, so I concentrated
on songs, on lieder, all that year, working with the collaborative
pianist Hartmut Hoell and with Rainer Hoffmann. It was a tremendous
education. I also went to the opera about three times a week on
student passes, and the piece I loved the most was Strauss's
`Capriccio.' Helena Doese sang all the performances, and I loved
her voice and her `Ausstrahlung,' her charisma. It was that year
that has enabled me to do so many things I have done since; it was
a tremendous gift.''
</P>
<P>
   The Marschallin was Fleming's first Strauss role, onstage in
Houston in 1995. ``I'd seen the opera a decade earlier, when I was
a student at Juilliard; it was Elisabeth Soederstroem's last
performance of the part at the Met. I found her incredibly moving;
I loved the silvery quality in her voice and, of course, her acting
ability is tremendous.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Fleming was one of the younger Marschallins in the
opera's history. ``The Marschallin doesn't necessarily have to be
50 or 60 to be in the situation she's in, abandoned by a younger
lover for an even younger woman; she's supposed to be 35, or
something like that. Now television and films are telling us we
live in a society that doesn't value women unless they are 18 or
19, so women find a lot they can relate to in `Der Rosenkavalier.'
''
</P>
<P>
   Fleming followed up the Marschallin with ``Arabella,'' also in
Houston and with Eschenbach, and finished the first-act monologue
despite an electrical failure that left her singing in a work light
that made her look like a character in a horror film. ``Capriccio''
is the only opera represented on the disc that Fleming has not yet
sung onstage, but it's on the books _ and with Eschenbach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy doing things for the first time with him because we
work so very well together. Actually, this record represented a
first for him; it really surprised me when I found out this was the
very first time he had conducted the Vienna Philharmonic. It was
also wonderful to share this experience with Sharon Graham and
Barbara Bonney, with whom I had just done the opera in Paris. I
admire the move Barbara has made, to stop singing Sophie while she
is still singing it gloriously.''
</P>
<P>
   When Fleming called in, it was 11:15 in the morning in San
Francisco, where she is in the final stages of rehearsal for her
first performances of the title role in Charpentier's ``Louise.''
``I know this is the crack of dawn for many sopranos, but I've been
up for hours _ having two small children can train you into
becoming an early riser. I am really beginning to enjoy `Louise';
the piece has really grown on me as we have rehearsed it. You have
to close down your 1999 self and take on the time in which it was
written; you can't afford to be thinking about dysfunctional
families and codependent relationships. If you can get out here,
you should come to see Samuel Ramey in the final scene; he is truly
phenomenal. The final scene is fun for me too, because it's
practically a mad scene. I'll be doing this opera again in Toulouse
and in Paris and there is going to be a telecast as well, so I am
going to have a very full experience of this role.''
</P>
<P>
   Several colorful strands intertwine in Fleming's varied
repertory _ baroque opera, Italian bel canto opera, French opera,
Strauss, new music, and jazz. She has a very clear sense of what
she wants to do, and of what's not a good idea. ``I've been offered
Strauss's Ariadne, but it's not right for me; it's a little low,
and it demands a really full middle voice, which I don't have. My
voice opens up on top and I have a solid low voice, which comes
from my work as a jazz singer. That's why all these French operas
have been so good for me _ they go up and they go down and they
don't stay there in the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleming says that right now she wants to concentrate on
polishing operas she has already sung rather than adding new roles.
``You never know what is going to happen to a voice. Some never
change; some lighten up; others, like Mirella Freni's, alter so
drastically they can sing a whole new repertory. I don't know
what's going to happen to mine. I do know I want to put `La
Traviata' back on the schedule because I don't want to look back
later and say, `I missed out on it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Fleming's next solo disc will be her first official jazz
recording. ``I listen to jazz all the time, and a recording is in
the works for December. I sat down and made a wish list of artists
and songs I adore. We'll do a straight-ahead jazz record with a
small trio, and there will be no big lush arrangements. I am so
lucky to have grown up in a musical family. I was performing at a
very early age and exposed to many different kinds of music in
different kinds of situations _ a lot of church, retirement homes,
school concerts. My parents are terrific musicians and music was an
essential part of my upbringing. So my career is not not really to
my credit _ I didn't get involved personally until I was in my
20s!''

WORKING WITH BOYLE HAS MADE SENSE

 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURLINGTON, Mass. _ The moment deserved a dramatic pause. The
man responsible for raising the stock of NFL prospects sat facing
the 5,000-square-foot workout area where he continues to build his
reputation and business. He was ready to reveal the secret of his
success.
</P>
<P>
   But Mike Boyle follows no complex formula. The strength and
conditioning coach does not pretend to be an innovator or
trendsetter or visionary, though many would argue he has helped
change the shape of professional athletics.
</P>
<P>
   His great secret? Common sense.
</P>
<P>
   Emphasizing strength and conditioning has transformed the sports
world over the last two decades and gone from novelty to fad. Boyle
keeps his advice simple. His career has followed the rise in
popularity of performance enhancement, beginning with a volunteer
job at Boston University and evolving into his own training site,
Sports Acceleration North.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, when Boyle started organizing workouts and
investigating ways to make players bigger and more athletic, he was
one of a small group of strength and conditioning coaches. By
helping professionals, Olympians, and recreational athletes
maximize their talents, Boyle has earned a reputation as one of the
best in the business. He can list a large group of professional
athletes as former and current clients. From Billy Brooks to Eric
Swann to Mike Mamula, he has proven to the football world the
benefits of a little common sense and a lot of intelligent
training.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes an open-minded person,'' said Boyle. ``The problems
that I run into are people who are not willing to grasp the
obvious. I get very frustrated with some people because I think
that everybody should be able to do what I'm doing. Everybody has
access to the same conferences. Everybody has access to the same
information. This should not be that hard. It's just a matter of
finding the pieces and putting them in a package that fits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never envisioned it as all that difficult, but I realized
as I've gone along that I am in fact somehow doing it better than
other people. But I find that more surprising than anything else. I
think there are tons of people who have the intellectual capacity
to do this stuff. I'm always looking for a better way, but I don't
make a lot of big changes. It's basic common sense. I've spent a
lot of my life trying to get the end result that I want. I've been
able to combine the ability to know what I want and get (athletes)
to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   With strength and conditioning training now an accepted part of
an athlete's daily regimen, Boyle does far less selling of his
philosophy. In the early '80s, systematic strengthening and
performance-oriented conditioning were viewed with skepticism.
Boyle had to break through the old-school mentality that placed
common practices before common sense. Recognizing a future in
performance enhancement, Boyle quit his job as an athletic trainer,
took jobs tending bar in Boston, and volunteered as the BU football
team's strength and conditioning coach.
</P>
<P>
   His work at BU introduced him to a young player named Billy
Brooks, who eagerly embraced the new strength and conditioning
program. Boyle traveled to seminars across the country trying to
find information that could help Brooks improve his speed. Brooks
attended the NFL combine in 1986 and ran 4.4 in the 40,
representing a four-10ths of a second improvement over the course
of his college career. He shocked scouts who did not expect a
player viewed as a 1-AA possession receiver to run that fast. And
Brooks did not hesitate to credit his training.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least, I was a smart trend recognizer,'' said Boyle, the
recently retired strength and conditioning coach of the Boston
Bruins and strength and conditioning consultant for USA Hockey. ``I
was able to see things as they were developing and realize it was a
field that was going to blossom.''
</P>
<P>
   Success with Brooks led to work with players outside BU. Then,
as Boyle describes it, ``Eric Swann happened.'' Before the
defensive lineman jumped from high school to the NFL, he spent a
season playing for the Bay State Titans and training under the
tutelage of Boyle. The phenom quickly became the talk of the 1991
NFL draft. ESPN filmed him lifting weights at BU. Newspapers around
the country wrote stories about his remarkable progress. Leading up
to draft day, Boyle realized his coaching career would make as
large a leap as Swann's football career once the player was
selected.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Boyle had trained local players looking to get
chosen in the late rounds or find their way onto a team as a free
agent. Swann represented the coach's first legitimate top pick. The
Cardinals drafted the then-20-year-old lineman with the sixth
overall pick. So far, Swann has been to two Pro Bowls. His hulking
6-foot-5-inch, 317-pound physique represents the byproduct of
advances in strength and conditioning training and the prototype
for football's future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bigger is better if it's bigger and more athletic, and that's
what you've seen in the NFL,'' said Boyle. ``There's this
development now of what almost amounts to a freakish group of
people. (The players) have gotten so big and so fast that you start
to see injury situations and things that happen that are strictly a
result of physics. It's like throwing two 300-pound rocks at each
other and having them collide.''
</P>
<P>
   After the bigger, more athletic Swann made headlines, Boyle
added businessman to his titles. Almost a decade after he entered
the profession as a volunteer, Boyle saw a sizable market for his
services. He knew players and agents would be willing to pay him
for setting up programs that improved speed, strength, and agility.
</P>
<P>
   Again, common sense was his guide. If a professional football
player could improve his draft position with a solid showing at the
NFL combine, then prospects should train for the combine. Boyle
started working with friend and agent Brad Blank. The coach helped
Blank's clients prepare for the combine, producing impressive and
profitable results.
</P>
<P>
   Prospects projected as third- and fourth-round picks vaulted
into the second round based on their combine results. With Boyle's
help, Blank's clients improved their stock more than others. Three
years ago, eight prospects trained with Boyle for the combine;
seven of them were chosen in the top 70. Now, combine camps have
become a selling point for agents and every player representative
has a strength and conditioning coach ready to help improve draft
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should not be that difficult an idea,'' said Boyle. ``We
know the seven or five or six things we're going to be tested on.
Hey, how about we practice them before we go?''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Boston College's Mike Mamula was the seventh overall
selection in the draft. The Philadelphia defensive lineman remains
one of Boyle's most heralded draft-day successes. His numbers in
Indianapolis translated to a four-year, $6 million dollar contract
with the Eagles that included a $2.6 million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Since Mamula declared himself eligible for the draft after his
junior year, he was largely unknown. His speed, strength, and
agility had never been tested. Boyle acknowledges that Mamula's
stellar results at the combine were a product of training and the
fact that no base had been established for the player.
</P>
<P>
   With players such as Swann and Mamula, the coach must simply
coax and harness latent talent. Boyle breaks down the combine
events in detail and determines the best approach to each test. The
drills become practiced tasks. He breaks down training in a similar
fashion, deciding which skills need the most polish.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got great raw material with Mamula,'' said Boyle. ``We made
this big, huge national splash because this guy shows up at the
combine and puts on an ungodly performance. He runs faster than the
DBs, he jumps higher than the wide receivers, and he
out-bench-presses the linemen.''
</P>
<P>
   Boyle has watched the interest in his craft trickle down. Today,
high schoolers and recreational athletes seek specialized training
programs. And now the man who built his business by helping the
best get better finds his biggest rewards come from helping the
little guys.

JOHNNY PARKER HAS STRONG IMPACT ON PATRIOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Ted Johnson recalls lying in his bed at
Massachusetts General Hospital after tearing his left biceps tendon
last December while trying to tackle the Steelers' Jerome Bettis.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first people to visit was Johnny Parker, the
Patriots' strength and conditioning coach.
</P>
<P>
   Parker can be hard-driving and brutally honest, but this moment
did not call for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came to the hospital and apologized to me for my injury,''
said the linebacker. ``He takes it personally. He felt the injury
could have been avoided and he could have done something to prevent
it. That's just the way he is. A torn bicep _ that's a freak thing,
but he thinks it's his fault.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, now wearing a sling on his right arm because of another
torn biceps tendon, this one suffered in training camp, paused for
a moment as if to contain his emotions. ``I've had a couple of
coaches in my life who I'll always remember, and he's one of the
people who has impacted my life and career the most,'' said
Johnson. ``He really cares about us. You can feel that when you go
in (the weight room). It's a great feeling. This game is
competitive, with people coming and going, but he wants to make you
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker is a straight-shooter with players, coaches, and
management. When he didn't like the way things were run last year,
he had a meeting with vice president of player personnel Bobby
Grier and owner Bob Kraft. After the team lost to Jacksonville in
the first round of the playoffs, he blamed himself for the rash of
injuries, which had left the Patriots battered and overmatched.
</P>
<P>
   He is so brutally honest, the Patriots won't let him speak to
the media.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Carroll lauded the strength and conditioning program during
training camp. The players also spoke highly of the program,
although some don't attend religiously, thus forfeiting contractual
bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   Under Bill Parcells, who first hired Parker while he was
coaching the New York Giants in 1984, then brought him to New
England, Parker's program was effective and players were much more
faithful to training. Under Carroll, things have changed, though
there was an increase in attendance this offseason, spurred by
Parker's chat with management and Carroll's tougher stance on
training.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think some guys stay away because it's the toughest program
in the league,'' said defensive tackle Chad Eaton. ``There are guys
who don't want to undergo that rigorous a program. It's hard. There
isn't one in the league that compares. When we were in Tampa Bay,
their strength coach, Jerry Simmons, who used to be my strength
coach in Cleveland, kept bugging me about Johnny's program and what
he does. Johnny is the strength and conditioning guru. He's the
most respected strength coach in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how hard is it?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have friends on other teams and I know coaches on other
teams. This is the hardest. Not even close,'' said Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a lineman, offensive or defensive, Eaton is a good guy
to ask about the routine.
</P>
<P>
   Linemen start with a half-hour warmup on the treadmill. ``It's
the type of workout that most average people would go through for
an entire week,'' said Eaton. The treadmill is moving at a fast
pace, and during the warmup, Parker is known to say a few words and
question a player's masculinity once or twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been times when he's been across the room and it
doesn't look like he's watching you, and all of sudden he'll start
saying stuff to you,'' said Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Parker puts the linemen through heavy weightlifting _ squats,
clean jerks, curls, bench press, military press. All of it is pure
powerlifting, with as much weight as possible. Five sets, five
repetitions a set. Linemen usually go 500-600 pounds on squats.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not over.
</P>
<P>
   Parker then gets them out on the Foxboro Stadium sod and brings
out several 180-pound bags of sand. Linemen are asked to throw
these bags up and down the field _ 200 yards _ within a five-minute
time limit. Mess up, and you're liable to do it again.
</P>
<P>
   The sandbags offer a fluctuation in weight, the same fluctuation
a linemen would experience in game conditions. It's helpful for
balance, and it builds great stamina.
</P>
<P>
   The routine is altered for running backs and linebackers, for
receivers and defensive backs, and quarterbacks and kickers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Linebackers were expected to run like defensive backs and lift
like linemen,'' recalled Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``After we're completely dead, we get to do it again the next
day,'' said Eaton.
</P>
<P>
   That's a four-day-a-week ritual from late March through late
May. Wednesdays, Saturdays, and Sundays are usually off. The
workout takes about 3 1/2 hours to complete, and most players are
done by early afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you first get into it, you are sore to the point you
can't move,'' said Eaton. ``You're working virtually every muscle
in your body, body parts you never knew you had.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Armstrong, Henry Thomas, Zefross Moss, and Ben Coates, all
veterans, don't bother taking part, choosing to work out at home
instead. But, as Eaton put it, ``Nothing could assimilate a Johnny
Parker workout. Nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the 52-year-old Parker, a native of Shaw, Miss., has beaten
himself up over the injury bug the Patriots have felt the past
couple of years. After the loss to Jacksonville, Parker blamed
himself for players getting hurt, feeling he hadn't done enough to
get them in prime physical condition.
</P>
<P>
   Old-timers around the league have said too much offseason
training can lead to injuries. Others feel injuries are caused by
not training enough. Parker is obviously a believer in the latter.
Even with someone like Drew Bledsoe, Parker would emphasize that to
be a quarterback, you have to have a strong body. And so Bledsoe,
one of the highest-paid athletes in the business, puts himself
through the pain every offseason.
</P>
<P>
   It's not surprising that Parker has studied strength and
conditioning in other countries, visiting the Soviet Union in 1983
and 1986 to study the techniques of Soviet Olympic trainers. He has
incorportated many of those methods into his own routine.
</P>
<P>
   Parker introduced the sandbags two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he comes up with stuff like that you wonder, `Where did
he go on vaction this year? Where did he come up with this?' ''
said Johnson. ``His methods at times are unconventional, but
there's always a meaning behind the madness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Johnny is open to your input. It's not always my way or the
highway. If you're not getting positive feedback, he won't do it.
He focuses on things that go unnoticed _ back, abdomen, rib
strength work. Those are things you normally take for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker took a Giants team that had 23 injuries in '83 and
reduced the total to seven in '84. Parker has always said that he
and other coaches are defined by wins and losses, so when the team
doesn't measure up, he doesn't measure up. So Parker got quite
emotional after the Jacksonville game and put the blame squarely on
his own shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's such a great coach because he takes it so personally,''
said Johnson. ``He cares and he wants you to care. He never stops
coaching. You think you have it mastered, and then he teaches you
yet another way to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker has an equally tough regimen during the season,
overseeing the weightlifting during the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you watch Johnny he never sits down,'' said Johnson. ``For
as long I've known him, I've never seen him pull up a chair and
sit. He's always on the go. He never relaxes. He takes the job
seriously. He takes pride in everything he does.''

IT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Start the game. Please.
</P>
<P>
   No one wants to hear any more about the Tuna, who, barring a
last-minute roster change, won't be lining up at his old inside
linebacker position Sunday at Giants Stadium. No one wants to hear
any more about the ``new'' Pete Carroll, either. What everyone
wants to see is a demonstration of the product.
</P>
<P>
   But this is football, and one of the problems with football is
that there are too few games and, therefore, too much talk.
Baseball is an everyday deal. Basketball and hockey are every-2
1/2-day deals. Football, for very good reasons, is a weekly deal,
and probably should be an every-other-week deal (unless someone
would like to implement my plan to have 100-man rosters).
</P>
<P>
   Granted, we haven't had any real games yet, but once we do, the
familiar pattern will return. Three hours of action (sort of) will
be followed by endless analysis and _ nothing could be more
guaranteed _ overreaction, regardless of the outcome. That's one of
the many things baseball has going for it. No matter how painful
the loss or euphoric the victory, reality will present itself
immediately in the form of another game the very next day. The
focus is always where it should be _ on the game itself.
</P>
<P>
   So brace yourself in advance for the Opening Day post-mortems.
No matter what the Patriots do against the Jets, most people will
overreact Monday morning. A win, and it will be ``Super Bowl, here
we come.'' A loss, and it will be ``Omigod, 0 and 16.'' When the
subject is professional football, there is a curious aversion to
adopting what you call your basic long view.
</P>
<P>
   It will be even worse this time because the first game is
against the Jets. Yes, friends, it is Tuna Bowl V. Neither team
needs this nonsense in the opener, and that's especially true for
Carroll and the Patriots. The truth is that this game has far
larger implications for Our Lads than for the Jets. If the Jets
lose, Parcells will be able to put it in some sort of perspective.
His team will not lose its equilibrium. His reputation will not be
at stake. It will be regarded as a bump in the road, and nothing
more. There will probably be some Wayne Chrebet talk. If Vinny
Testaverde has a bad day, there might be a little Rick Mirer
discussion. But Parcells will control the agenda, and what they
will hear in New York is that there are 15 games to go and now it's
time to get ready for Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   It won't be that way if the Patriots lose. If the Patriots lose
it will be proof that the Tuna has put a curse on all of New
England, starting with Drew Bledsoe. If the Patriots lose it will
be proof that the new Pete Carroll is nothing more than the old
Pete Carroll with a new phony script. If the Patriots lose, in
fact, it will be time to start asking Bob Kraft about the coaching
names on the proverbial short list that every owner and general
manager supposedly has tucked away in his top desk drawer.
</P>
<P>
   This is ridiculous, of course, but it is ridiculous only because
anyone truly interested in the long-range welfare of the franchise
should already be worried. There will be no definitive answers
supplied Sunday. We will know somewhat more at 4 p.m. than we had
known at 1 p.m., but we won't have all the answers. We will need a
larger sampling to clear up the Big Picture. But anyone who has
been paying attention already has an idea about what's been going
on down there in Foxborough the past three years, and how can
anyone possibly say it's been good?
</P>
<P>
   It's not even a Parcells thing. It's a Carroll-Bobby Grier
thing. Forget, for a moment, that the Tuna was ever here. Just look
at the 1999 team, as compared with the 1996 team. It is nowhere
near as good, and that's only half the story. The very harsh
reality is that every team in the division is substantially better
than it was three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing confounds me more in life than relentlessly optimistic
people, so I suppose I shouldn't be surprised that there are so
many locals bullish on the Patriots. Some of them were shocked when
ESPN's John Clayton came on the air last month to declare that he
was picking the Patriots for fifth in the AFC East. More were
startled when they picked up the Aug. 30 edition of Sports
Illustrated to discover that renowned expert Paul Zimmerman, a.k.a
Dr. Z, had them fourth.
</P>
<P>
   To me, these rankings were like, duh. Tell me something I
(itals)don't(unitals) know. Sure, if the sun, moon, and stars are
aligned properly, and if Terry Glenn plays 16 games and Bledsoe
throws for 4,000 yards and 35 TDs and Kevin Faulk is the AFC
Offensive Rookie of the Year and Bruce Armstrong plays like he's 25
and Adam Vinatieri kicks two last-second, game-winning, 50-yard
field goals and Willie McGinest actually gets into someone's
backfield once in a while and Ty Law plays like a combination of
Deion Sanders and Dick ``Night Train'' Lane and the offensive line
actually opens up an occasional hole and the defensive line doesn't
get blown off the line of scrimmage every other play, well, gee, it
might be an OK year.
</P>
<P>
   Could happen, I suppose. Then look at the schedule. The division
is brutal. Every AFC East game is eminently losable. Why should
anyone be struck dumb if the Colts come in here and win a week from
Sunday? The Patriots will win some AFC East games, but who knows
how many, and which ones? They will all be tough. The Giants at
home and the Cardinals in Tempe are hardly gimmes. Denver at home?
Another cupcake, right?
</P>
<P>
   In comparison to their main rivals, the Patriots have not been
managed well in the post-Parcells era. That's a simple and quite
obvious fact. They could win Sunday, but that one game will not be
a referendum. No matter what happens, stick around. It's likely to
get worse. That's the word from the Doom &AMP; Gloom Society. Now it's
up to Carroll and his troops to prove we pessimists wrong. Oh,
well. At least we've got a game to watch.

GUMBEL PREFERS TO SHINE FROM THE SHADOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are lots of bright, shiny stars out there in the sports
television universe. Greg Gumbel is not one of them. His feet are
too planted on solid ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's really be honest,'' Gumbel said the other day. ``Do you
really need six or seven hours of a pre-Super Bowl show? I mean,
what does that really amount to?''
</P>
<P>
   These aren't rhetorical questions. Gumbel has his own answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you what it is: It's absolute filler,'' he said. ``It's
like going to a bar and watching the game. If it's me, I'm telling
the people to shut up because I'm trying to watch the game.''
</P>
<P>
   On the telephone, Gumbel has one of those accents heard in
Illinois or Minnesota, kind of Canadian and Midwestern at the same
time. You would never notice it listening to him on air, especially
now with his job as lead CBS play-by-play commentator for the NFL.
His voice is smart, not noisy, almost silent, barely leaving a
trace. And it's all by design.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be the star,'' Gumbel said. ``That's important
to me. I learned it by listening to guys like Ray Scott and Pat
Summerall. Pat has always been the epitome of class as far as I'm
concerned. He doesn't intrude. He doesn't try to convince you how
much he knows. Just by his quiet control over the broadcast you
know that he knows what he is talking about. The star of the
telecast is the analyst. My job is to tell what happened. The
analyst's job is tell why it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Invisibility is a good thing, and in Gumbel's case, it doesn't
mean he hasn't been around.
</P>
<P>
   Gumbel, 53, has been in the business since 1973, back in the day
when the sports universe had just a few regional blocs. His baby
brother, Bryant, already on-air in Los Angeles, told him that there
was a sports anchor job open in Chicago. Gumbel was selling medical
supplies at the time. His only experience as a commentator was
growing up in Chicago, goofing around with his brother in their
living room, pretending to call the games on television.
</P>
<P>
   Gumbel auditioned, as did 70 or so other applicants, and was
told, ``Don't call us, will call you.'' He waited a few weeks
before hearing that he got the job. He did all right, picking up
two local Emmys for his work.
</P>
<P>
   From there, he was off to ESPN, a cable network crawling out of
its infancy in 1981, attracting only hard-core viewers with its
irreverent knowledge of all things sport. The Madison Square Garden
Network was the next stop. He still hosted studio shows, but he
added play-by-play skills by calling New York Knicks and Yankees
games. He won another Emmy and,
</P>
<P>
   more important, was noticed by the networks.
</P>
<P>
   CBS called in 1989. Before he left for NBC in 1994, Gumbel
hosted the ``NFL Today show'' and the 1992 Winter Olympics in
Albertville, France, and worked play-by-play for Major League
Baseball, college basketball and football.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad. Not bad at all for a guy who didn't intend to go into
television. That he was successful was not a surprise. He came from
a good family. His daddy was a judge and had a firm hand. Judge
Gumbel died in 1972 and never saw the harvest of his children. ``He
taught us three things: think clearly, listen well and speak
intelligently,'' his son said.
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't been a problem for Gumbel. What has been a problem
is the Vanilla question, that he is too plain, that somehow he is
not black enough, whatever that means. ``You just deal with the
criticisms,'' Gumbel said. ``It doesn't bother me. You try to
figure out where it's coming from and stay focused on what you are
trying to do.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is remaining invisible and smart, allowing the game to
take the limelight.
</P>
<P>
   ``My problem with guys like Howard Cosell and Harry Carey were
that they thought they were bigger than the game,'' Gumbel said.
``A lot of these newer guys come on the air and fill it up with
things like statistics. Joe Blow could quote all the statistics in
the world to try to impress you with how much they know. But in
some cases the statistics cover up for something that they don't
know. Never mind how many rebounds Dennis Rodman has had, how about
that weak-side pick he just set?''
</P>
<P>
   Gumbel returned to CBS in 1998 with a five-year deal. Many
critics wrote that he was ill-suited to provide play-by-play. He
was a better studio guy, the critics wrote. Gumbel said that he
hopes his performance last year during CBS' return to football
erased any of those doubts.
</P>
<P>
   And if they haven't, he said his style will remain unchanged _ a
star in the shadows.

MARTIN'S IN NO RUSH TO MAKE NOISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Curtis Martin has the personality of a
whisper. So he was startled and chagrined when a simple, sincere,
innocent statement he made on the first day of training camp came
across as a trumpet fanfare.
</P>
<P>
   JETS RUNNING BACK INTENDS TO GAIN 2,000 YARDS THIS SEASON!!!
</P>
<P>
   Stop the presses. It was as if Marcel Marceau had driven through
Manhattan announcing his upcoming performance from a loudspeaker
atop a pickup truck. Shy, devout, unobtrusive Curtis Martin
indulging in such bravado?
</P>
<P>
   Stop the pressure. There was no self-promotion intended, Martin
explained Thursday in the Jets locker room, his exasperation
regarding the situation giving way to his characteristic patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to explain it one more time because I'm really tired
of talking about it,'' he said. ``A woman asked me a question:
`Curtis, I know you're a team player who wants to win above all
else. But if you had a (personal) goal, what would it be?' And I
said, `I'd like to gain 2,000 yards.' I think that's any running
back's goal. It's going to be a goal of mine as long as I play. I
don't feel I've had my best year yet, not at all. And if I'm asked
a question, I'm going to say what I think. They took it in a whole
other direction. That's the media.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not just them. Coach Bill Parcells was moved to sardonic
heights when advised of the alleged proclamation, telling Martin
before the exhibition game against the Giants, ``Try to reach 50
first.'' Martin's response: 127 yards, including 80 on one carry _
for a touchdown _ in a 16-10 victory. And not one syllable of
gloating.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that if anyone has a right to set 2,000 as a target
before the millennium, it's Martin, who never would offer such a
self-defense. He is one of only five running backs in NFL history
to have gained at least 1,000 yards in each of his first four
seasons _ three with the Patriots and last year with the AFC East
champion Jets, who reunited him with Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, his last season with New England, he amassed 1,160
yards despite missing five games. And after the Jets pried him
loose as a restricted free agent with a staggering six-year, $36
million offer that included a couple of poison pills the Patriots
weren't willing to swallow to keep him, he picked right up on that
pace. Despite coming off abdominal surgery and being plagued by an
assortment of leg ailments right from the get-go, he gritted his
teeth for 1,287 yards, second best in team history, as he helped
the surprising Jets to the AFC Championship Game.
</P>
<P>
   So while only four men have rushed for more than 2,000 yards in
a season, who's to say Martin can't make it a handful?
</P>
<P>
   Even Parcells, upon reflection, has tempered the ridicule. ``I
wouldn't say it's unrealistic,'' he said. ``But you're going to
have to have a lot of long runs to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Above all, what you need in the long run is robust health. And
that's what most enthuses Martin as he approaches Sunday's season
opener against the Patriots at Giants Stadium. Though he said that
``sometimes injuries can make you stronger mentally; I use them to
focus'' he stayed clear of the trainer's room during the preseason
for the first time since he can remember. And he prefers that
alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the healthiest I've been in the last few years,'' he
said. ``It's definitely given me a different mind-set. It's nice to
get through the preseason feeling this good, especially compared to
how I felt last year.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that he kept how he felt last year a secret speaks
volumes for the admiration he commands among his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year he was banged up and nobody knew it,'' said center
Kevin Mawae. ``That's the kind of guy he is. The sky's the limit
when he's 100 percent healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Brash receiver Keyshawn Johnson, who is never hesitant to
compliment either himself or a teammate, was equally impressed.
``Any time a player is nicked up or hurt, it's going to affect his
play some,'' said Johnson. ``What he did last year _ it's scary to
think what he can do when he's at his best.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin seemingly has extra incentive to reach a peak Sunday
against the team that let him go amid rumblings that he was too
fragile to invest in for the long term. But he's particularly
vigilant about avoiding bombast these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always have incentive to win no matter who you're
playing,'' he said. ``It doesn't matter who the other team is. I
like playing against my old team. I've got a lot of friends there,
a lot of memories. It brings out the intensity, like playing
against your brothers.''
</P>
<P>
   It was against a father figure that he engaged in what for him
constitutes showmanship. On Sept. 14, 1997, in Parcells's
ballyhooed Jets debut against New England, Martin helped the
Patriots to a 27-24 overtime victory _ their only one against their
ex-boss _ by gaining 199 yards. Included was a 33-yard run, after
which Martin ran past his former and future coach and smirked at
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He still kids me about that,'' said Martin. ``He said, `You
think I didn't see that little smirk you had on your face?' ''
</P>
<P>
   If he performs a similar feat Sunday, Martin might be tempted to
run up to Parcells on the sideline, smirk, and announce, ``Only
1,967 to go.'' He won't, of course. Martin abhors calling attention
to himself, even when he's asked to.

WATER TABLE MAY SOLVE A PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, September 12, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My house is 20 years old with original Masonite (hardboard)
siding. The two bottom strips of hardboard are rotting. A
contractor suggested putting up primed siding or vinyl, first
removing all the hardboard. Is removing the old hardboard
necessary?
</P>
<P>
   H.M., Marlborough, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Your contractor thinks so, and so does the handyman, if you
are going to put on any new siding. And, cedar, white or red,
clapboards or shingles, is better than vinyl, which in this
handyman's opinion is no better than the hardboard. The reason all
hardboard should come off is that it may decay under any new
siding; hardboard is notorious for decaying when it gets wet; that
is why it is so heavily painted. Also, new siding will lie smoothly
and evenly on the sheathing if the hardboard is removed.
</P>
<P>
   Here's another idea: If the hardboard is intact above the two
boards that are decaying, you can try this and save a bundle of
money: Take off the two decaying hardboard boards, and install a 1
x 10 or 1 x 12 pressure-treated board (whatever size will cover the
area of the two bottom boards that were removed). Put flashing
between the new board and the hardboard above. You are creating a
water table, which is the New England term for such a board. Let
that board weather or paint or stain it the same color as the trim
or hardboard.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have weeds growing in the cracks of a very long hardtop
driveway. You have mentioned using vinegar to keep them away. I
don't think vineger will kill the weeds or the seeds that they are
storing. Would a torch work?
</P>
<P>
   MARGO LONG, Reading, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. A torch (like an acetylene torch or similar fire-spewing
tool) will work, but could melt the hardtop. Better I think is a
hot-air gun. It too could melt the asphalt but any weed, and seeds,
should be dead by the time the gun threatens to melt the asphalt.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I just put up a new deck with a mahogany railing. I would
like it to weather. What can I do to make it weather nicely and
stand up to the weather?
</P>
<P>
   HOWARD LEVY, Swampscott, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Let's start with the mahogany railing. And this goes for the
floorboards, too, if they are mahogany. Mahogany is naturally decay
resistant and will weather to an attractive, even, silver color.
But, according to recent studies, it should not be left to weather
without some protection because ultraviolet rays break down lignin
in the wood, the ``glue'' that holds the wood together. When lignin
breaks down, the wood deteriorates.
</P>
<P>
   So, treat the wood with a clear sealer to prevent this. This
sealer should be renewed once every year or so; there is nothing
maintenance-free about a wood deck.
</P>
<P>
   This is particularly important on horizontal surfaces such as
floorboards and railings. Vertical surfaces are less likely to
deteriorate, but it is a good idea to seal these as well.
</P>
<P>
   This all applies to any other wood: pressure-treated, cedar,
Douglas fir, and all pines.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative to sealing and allowing the wood to weather is
to apply one coat of a semitransparent stain. You will get a color,
and the wood will not weather, but such stains last longer than
sealers; three or more years is typical for some semitransparent
stains; at that time, apply another single coat.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I want my brand new mahogany deck to keep its mahogany color.
I applied CWF (Clear Wood Finish) which is designed to keep wood
new-looking, but it didn't do very well. What can I use?
</P>
<P>
   KEITH FLAHERTY, Wilmington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Nothing, other than trying other brands of a CWF-type finish.
Keeping wood new-looking outdoors goes against the natural tendency
of wood to weather; but people want such a new look, and
manufacturers are eager to accommodate their desires _ for money.
If you are unsatisfied with the CWF (or the even better CWF-UV,
which resists ultraviolet rays), go to a semitransparent stain.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What are the pros and cons on garage doors: wood or metal?
The bottom panel of my custom-made door has rotted out and a
custom-made replacement costs $290. I can get a metal door for $550
to $750. Is it worth getting a new metal door?
</P>
<P>
   BARRY STEARNS, Waltham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, how long did the bottom panel last: 20 years? 10? The
point I'm getting at is that for $290 you will be set for another
10 to 20 years, or as long as the old panel lasted.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the steel doors are good, well painted, and light in
weight, and the price is right for a custom unit. They will dent,
and must be kept painted to prevent them from rusting; removing
rust and repainitng is a pain. Now you can make your choice. I
personally would opt for the replacement panel.
</P>
<P>
   Some garage doors are insulated. That is not a good argument for
buying such a door. Garage doors need no insulation because garages
are unheated; the insulation will do no good at all.
</P>

THE TROUBLE WITH NUMBERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   `Good morning, class.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Good morning, Mr. Nyhann.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I began class Wednesday with a quiz that had 47 numbers in it
to discuss some basic economics. Today I want to tell you about the
difference between sloppiness and ignorance.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I told you Wednesday that the top fifth of American
households had a household income averaging $515,000 a year, that
was not true. The top 20 percent have an average income of
$102,300. The mistake I made was reading the wrong line of numbers
in a chart in The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``The $515,000 per year income is the average for the top one
percent of households. That was the next number down on the chart.
But by making that mistake, some people thought I was trying to
pull a fast one.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what happens when you work too fast and get sloppy.
That's one kind of mistake. The second kind is when you do
something not out of sloppiness, but out of ignorance. Let me give
you another example.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I told you Wednesday about the different amounts of money
that people have to live on, it was measured by `households.' It
never dawned on me that households vary by size as well as income
and that government statistics reflect that. My mistake was in
assuming that households in the bottom fifth were the same size as
households in the top fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``How did I discover that? A polite lady from Cambridge, I'll
call her Harriet G., because she's shy and didn't want her last
name used, called me first thing Thursday. Harriet works with
numbers all day, doing databases, and `cares about numbers,' she
said. She suggested I read a book called `The New Dollars and
Dreams,' by MIT professor Frank Levy. Then I got a call from Marvin
W., who is a number-cruncher in the health care field. He pointed
out that I must have made a mistake confusing the top 1 percent
with the top 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got that sinking feeling that columnists and teachers get
when they realize they've laid a stink bomb out there and people
call you on it. Neither mistake really undermined my basic
argument, that wealthier people are better able to take care of
themselves, and poorer people need more education. But it's like
trying to sell a new car with bird poop on the windshield _ that's
all the customer can see. I asked fellow-columnist David Warsh, for
accurate income-by-household data. He told me to call Levy at MIT.
So I did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Professor Levy was very helpful. He looked up a US Census
report, `Money Income in the US.' In 1996, the last year household
size was measured by income, households with income under $10,000
averaged 1.8 persons in size, that it was two persons for incomes
of $10,000 to $15,000, 2.6 persons for $25,00 to $30,000, and 3.1
persons per household for incomes over $75,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
   ``How come? Well, a lot of people who live alone get by on
Social Security checks or meager little paychecks. And the folks
with more money tend to have their kids around longer, and a lot of
families with higher incomes have a mother working in a highly paid
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``But on the larger question of how wealth is divvied up in this
country, Professor Levy told me: `A lot of what's going on here is
that the whole technology of the economy is changing very fast. The
biggest change, starting with the recession of 1980-82, was that
the wages of blue collar male workers went right through the floor,
driven by technology and trade.' That was when new machinery,
robots, computers, and so forth began taking the place of
machinists and assembly-line workers. And foreign workers who were
paid a lot less than Americans began making things our consumers
wanted to buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then he talked about what he calls `the winner-take-all stuff
at the top.' These are the high-paid people, bosses at
corporations, professionals, computer people, athletes, movie
stars, folks who get stock options.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `That's where politics comes in. The danger is the
money just slops over into the political system and reshapes the
rules of the system. But underlying everything is how the
technology is breaking. Back when President Kennedy was talking
about a rising tide lifting all the boats, a farm worker displaced
from agriculture could move into manufacturing. That kind of move
is much harder now because the education thing has ramped up so.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And that was what I was trying to warn you about in
Wednesday's discussion: Young people today need to get as much
education and training as they can, because the more you have, the
more you can earn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Professor Levy makes the argument at the close of his book
that the economy is like a river, and the people are riding a river
that can be swollen in flood, disrupted by rapids, or parched by
drought. And the political system tends to respond to the richest
and the most powerful people. They're the ones who give
thousand-dollar campaign contributions and have their phone calls
returned by attentive politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Levy wrote: `The current free market creates high-income
winners as well as low-income losers. Under our current political
system, the winners are in a much stronger position to influence
policy.' What I'm telling you is that the political arguments
affect how wealth is divvied up. But in making your argument, if
you are sloppy or ignorant, as in the two mistakes I made, you
weaken your case. So I should try harder, right?''

The case was watched by legal experts and educators nationwide
because the landmark U.S. Supreme Court case, Swann vs.

   ECON-REPORT (Undated) _ The Labor Department reported that
prices paid to producers for goods other than food and energy
unexpectedly fell in August for the second time in three months, a
tame inflation reading that prompted a jump in bond prices. The
core producer price index, which removes volatile food and energy
prices, fell 0.1 percent last month after showing no change in

expected, gaining 0.5 percent in August, after falling 0.2 percent
the previous month. By Sylvia Nasar.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-DOLLAR (Undated) _ The Bank of Japan intervened in
currency markets in an attempt to keep the yen from rising against
the dollar, as foreign investors shift more funds into Japan,
betting its recession is over. The estimated $3 billion to $4
billion in yen offered by the Bank of Japan found eager buyers in
the first sale by the central bank in two months. The yen fell as
low as 110, from an eight-year high against the dollar of 107.55,
only to climb back to 109.40 despite repeated interventions.
</P>
<P>
   MARKET (New York) _ At 1:50 p.m., the industrial average was up
24 points, and the Nasdaq index up 34 points. Elsewhere, prices
were up 0.2 percent in Tokyo and were virtually unchanged in Hong
Kong. They were up 0.8 percent in Frankfurt, dropped 1.1 percent in
London, rose 1 percent in Brazil and gained 0.6 percent in Mexico.

COMDEX ADS TOUT ITS RELEVANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Celebrating its 20th anniversary, Comdex is looking to brand
itself as the nation's premiere high technology trade show with a
$5 million campaign that includes its first TV advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is the largest campaign ever for a trade show,''
says Gerry Berton, a vice president of marketing at ZD Events, the
Needham, Mass. company that produces Comdex.
</P>
<P>
   ZD Events produces about a dozen Comdex shows a year, but the
big one is held in Las Vegas. This year, it is set to run from Nov.
15 through Nov. 19.
</P>
<P>
   By Berton's lights, Comdex's history can be divided into three
eras. In the beginning, the makers of personal computers were often
the stars of the show.
</P>
<P>
   IBM introduced its PC at Comdex in 1981, and Apple Computer Inc.
debuted its Macintosh at the show in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   But by about 1986, companies with more of a networking focus
such as Intel Corp. came to the fore, and now it's Internet
companies such as Lucent Technologies Inc. and AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   In the age of the Internet and easy exchanges of large amounts
of data, some might think trade shows have outlived their time,
that there are better ways for techies to spend their time than
schmoozing with 200,000 of their peers in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the Comdex ad campaign is to strongly suggest
otherwise, Berton says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though many companies are putting a lot of money into the
Internet, we want to remind them that trade shows like Comdex
should still be part of their marketing mix,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to reinforce the message that Comdex is the premiere
technology show where deals are made and new products are
introduced,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Partly developed by Boston ad agency Partners &AMP; Simon, print ads
for Comdex have already appeared in the Wall Street Journal and
trade publications such as PC Week.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a 30-second TV ad that ZD Events created with the
help of a local production company is about to air on CNBC, CNN,
MSNBC, and the Airport Channel; a separate 90-second spot will be
shown on United Airlines flights.
</P>
<P>
   Internet companies are sometimes called dot-coms _ such as
Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we should call it dot-com-dex,'' one ad for Comdex
suggests, looking to play up the trade show's Internet relevance.
``Think of it as a million-square-foot chat room,'' says another
ad.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your're interested in meeting the players, products, and
companies driving the Internet economy, there's only one event _
Comdex _ where the virtual world becomes real,'' one ad says.

<P>
   In the TV ad, an Internet executive is attempting to exchange
e-mails with Internet bigwigs, including Microsoft founder Bill
Gates, who also happens to be one of Comdex's keynote speakers this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Much to his dismay, the executive doesn't get an instant reply.
Killing time, he throws darts and practices his putting stroke in
his office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is the server down?'' the executive wonders, frustrated at not
getting answers to his e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a message appears on his computer screen: ``Bill Gates

EMPLOYERS PUT HMOS TO THE TEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Want to know from your health maintenance organization how many
open-heart surgeries your local hospital has performed? Or would
you like a guarantee that your HMO's psychiatrist will call you
back within 24 hours?
</P>
<P>
   Good luck. Chances are, not too many HMOs can deliver that kind
of service. At least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   But they might soon. In an effort to prod HMOs to bring better
care to average patients, some of Massachusetts' largest employers
have asked a dozen health plans doing business in the state to
report on how well they serve members, including whether they
provide useful information to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The project, involving giants such as Raytheon Corp., Analog
Devices, and Harvard University under the umbrella of the
Massachusetts Health Care Purchaser Group, represents a new twist
in the uneasy alliance between employers and their health insurance
companies. In the past, the focus was on cost. But with the
managed-care industry steeped in financial losses, many HMOs are
hiking their premiums 10 percent or more next year. As a result,
employers are temporarily throwing in the towel on the fight
against costs. Instead, companies are shifting to quality, pressing
health plans in the state to justify the more than $3 billion they
receive each year in premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next month, health plans in Massachusetts are expected
to respond to a lengthy questionnaire targeting five specific areas
of health-care quality _ mental health, prescription drugs,
customer service, hospital and doctor relations, and management of
chronic illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The HMOs, which traditionally have kept this information
confidential, say they plan to cooperate. ``It's a lot of work, but
we think it's laudable that they are gathering worthwhile
information,'' said Alan G. Raymond, spokesman for Harvard Pilgrim
Health Care, New England's largest HMO.
</P>
<P>
   Answers to the 50-question survey will become part of a ``report
card'' that the group intends to publicly disclose next month as a
tool to reward better-performing HMOs while dunning health plans
that do poorly.
</P>
<P>
   Among the questions being asked of health plans:
</P>
<P>
   --Do the HMOs require psychiatrists and psychologists to return
patient phone calls within 24 hours? The idea is to give mental
health the same treatment as other illnesses, said Paula Breslin,
executive director of the Massachusetts Health Care Purchaser
Group. ``If someone with diabetes calls, they get a call back
within 24 hours,'' Breslin said. ``Why should it be any different
for a patient with schizophrenia or an anxiety disorder?''
</P>
<P>
   --Can patients get useful information about specific doctors or
hospitals in the HMOs' networks? Can they, for example, find a
nephrologist who speaks Spanish? Or a cardiologist who has had at
least 10 years of working experience? Can a patient facing
hip-replacement surgery find out how many of these procedures were
performed last year at the hospital down the street?
</P>
<P>
   --Does the HMO have a way to tell patients when they are
prescribed drugs that interact poorly?
</P>
<P>
   --Do health plans have a good way of tracking patients with
chronic illnesses, such as asthma or hypertension? Do they have
clinicians call patients regularly to see whether they're taking
their medications properly?
</P>
<P>
   --When patients are admitted to an intensive care unit at a
hospital, does the health plan hire an ``intensivist,'' a doctor
specializing in intensive care to oversee the patient?
</P>
<P>
   While some health plans already perform these functions, not all
do. By exposing this spottiness in its report card, the employer
group is hoping consumers will choose better-performing health
plans, thereby harnessing the power of the marketplace to force all
HMOs to improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking for information to help our members make
choices,'' said Breslin. ``We want to communicate our expectations
to the health plans about where we want them to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the employer group, founded in 1993, always kept an eye
on health-plan quality, the focus has generally been on cost. Until
last year, the group issued ``cost challenges,'' daring HMOs to
keep premium increases below a set threshold. Because of the
group's considerable clout _ it represents 2 million consumers, or
about one-third of the state's population _ HMOs complied, at times
forgoing increases altogether to attract new members.
</P>
<P>
   But medical inflation, particularly prescription drug costs,
roared back and nearly all of the state's major health plans began
to bleed financially last year. Startled HMO executives called for
rate increases of anywhere from 8 percent to 15 percent next year.
Employers, hard put in today's tight labor market to attract and
retain workers, could not very well cut back on health insurance
benefits, said Susan Connolly, principal at William M. Mercer, a
benefits consulting firm in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's happy about this,'' Connolly said. ``Employers feel
they are temporarily backed into a corner on this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Employers, therefore, are taking another tack, one focused on at
least getting their money's worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Employers have always been vilified for looking only at the
bottom line,'' Breslin said. ``In fact, we're very interested in
quality.''

A WORK IN PROGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Do you know this man? Liberal Democrat, US senator from
Massachusetts, 6-feet-4, black hair, lantern jaw.
</P>
<P>
   No, not John Kerry. It's US Senator Terrence Mullally, otherwise
known as our own William Weld.
</P>
<P>
   The former governor may have gotten skunked by the current
senator in 1996, but Weld's alter ego has ended up in the Senate
just the same _ even if he does bear a certain resemblance to the
man who sent Weld packing to the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   Give Bill Weld his due: In his second book coming out next
month, ``Big Ugly,'' Weld has written a fun _ often downright funny
_ tour of the money and the wheeling and dealing that he so wanted
to be a part of in Washington. Mullally/Weld is one senator who
keeps his pants on, but he's also a man who likes to look. ``Most
of the lobbyists in attendance at the Hubert Horatio Humphrey
Center on Thursday, April 8, had one thing in common. Can you
guess? They had breathtaking legs.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, though, when he's not thinking about Washington and
other stuff, Weld is building a business in, as he says, ``one of
the most lucrative areas of the law'' _ the private equity
business. In this era of the Internet, big buyouts and hot IPOs,
everybody wants in this space, Weld included.
</P>
<P>
   When Weld joined his former legal counsel, Robert Cordy, in the
Boston office of McDermott, Will &AMP; Emory, two years ago, the idea
was international law. But his interests and his contacts have
pushed him increasingly into the venture and buyout business.
</P>
<P>
   What does Weld, a litigator by trade, bring to the party? ``In
New York and Boston I can probably set up a meeting as easy as the
next person,'' says the ever-understated Weld, who is spending two
to three days a week in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, Weld is a smart, engaging, well-connected wannabe
in this world. Business generated: in excess of $3 million,
respectable for a senior partner in a big law firm, but nothing
special. In the political world, Weld has name recognition; in the
private equity world the names people know in Boston are Paul
Brountas at Hale and Dorr and Dick Testa at Testa Hurwitz.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago-based McDermott, with 825 lawyers worldwide and 88 in
Boston, is one of the nation's 10 largest firms, but has never been
a player in private equity. Now it wants in the game and has just
hired John Egan and five other lawyers from Goodwin, Procter &AMP;
Hoar's private equity group to work with Weld.
</P>
<P>
   Weld's biggest private equity deal has been raising a buyout
fund to invest in for-profit education and training companies such
as the Edison Schools Inc., which manages public schools. Weld
spent about a year helping to raise about $125 million for the
fund, which may eventually close at $300 million. But that is still
modest in the private equity business today.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey T. Leeds, founder of Leeds Equity Partners in New York,
could not be higher on Weld. Leeds tells a story of a Midwestern
fund-raising trip with Weld last winter, and a harrowing ride
through an ice storm aboard a small plane. Their flight canceled,
the two got stuck in a no-name hotel at the Cleveland airport with
no clothes, no nothing. Weld settled into a sports bar with a
football game, a burger and couldn't have been happier. ``He takes
whatever is dished up,'' said Leeds.
</P>
<P>
   Weld dismisses a return to politics as unlikely; he seems to be
having fun.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How much is it about the money?
</P>
<P>
   A. We're just trying to keep the mind alive here. Of course, it
takes a certain amount of wherewithal to keep the mind alive.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You interested in the Internet?
</P>
<P>
   A. Very interested. I just don't have much background.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is that going to stop you?
</P>
<P>
   A. Not at all. Are you kidding? I think I have proven I am
opportunistic.
</P>
<P>
   There is little question that Weld, with his intellect, contacts
and charm, can succeed in the private equity business if he sticks
with it. And that, as always, is just the question.

SALESCIENCE STIRS CONTROVERSY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It would be a simple story: small biotech company hits one out
of the park with a cancer-fighting drug, propelling its stock to
spectacular heights and drawing raves from Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   SafeScience Inc. of Boston is many things, certainly a biotech
company with a cancer drug and other products that is getting lots
of attention. But it is nobody's idea of a simple story.
</P>
<P>
   SafeScience stock, which started the year just below 5, soared
to 29 in August but has sunk 47 percent in the last five weeks and
now trades at 15 1/8. The small company's stock market value
approached $500 million at its peak.
</P>
<P>
   The spark for all the commotion: SafeScience's positive reports
on the phase I human trials of a chemical compound called GBC-590
and plans to move on to the next stage of clinical research soon.
</P>
<P>
   On a more modest note, the company recently recorded its
first-ever quarterly sales from a separate line of nontoxic
household products and is about to announce a $200,000 initial
order in a cobranding deal with Shaw's Supermarkets Inc.
</P>
<P>
   President Bradley Carver sees them as important steps toward
SafeScience's longer-term goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just about making money. It's about building a large,
multinational, multibillion-dollar corporation. That's the dream,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The SafeScience story has certainly won over some private
investors, including George Strawbridge, a near-billionaire and
Campbell Soup heir. It's also come under attack by a growing number
of short sellers who are betting the stock will tumble and have
gone so far as to commission their own independent consumer lab
tests of SafeScience products.
</P>
<P>
   Short sellers are not SafeScience's only problem. Most
seriously, there are questions about who actually owns the
company's GBC-590 compound and how effective it has really proved
to be so far in the treatment of cancer patients. SafeScience does
not have a patent for the compound, nine years after chief
executive David Platt first applied for the right, though the
company said it cleared the last bureaucratic hurdle in an appeal
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its glitzy story, SafeScience has attracted investment
coverage from just one analyst at a small Kansas City-based
brokerage and practically no institutional ownership of its stock.
</P>
<P>
   One explanation: the company's financial history, which involved
going public through a reverse merger with an inactive shell
company and a series of private stock placements to fund
SafeScience activities. Carver describes it as a ``grass-roots''
effort to build investor support and avoid the high cost of venture
capital funding.
</P>
<P>
   SafeScience has put together an unusual team to bring the stock
to the attention of investors. Frederick Pierce, who is the
company's finance manager, is responsible for introducing
SafeScience to new institutional prospects and David Nahmias is a
consultant who approaches retail brokers.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce is best known in downtown financial circles as the Lehman
Brothers broker who executed stock and option transactions for
former Centennial Technologies Inc. chief executive Emanuel Pinez,
the man at the center of a huge 1997 stock fraud scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Pinez, who has been in jail for more than two years awaiting a
criminal trial, allegedly cooked the Centennial books to make the
Wilmington company appear more successful than it really was.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce executed transactions for Pinez and related offshore
entities, some of which took place after ``Lehman knew . . . that
Mr. Pinez was engaging in highly suspect and possibly unlawful
trading in Centennial securities,'' according to a civil complaint
filed by the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC sued Lehman over disputed Pinez assets, but Pierce has
never been charged with any wrongdoing by the government. Pierce
resigned from Lehman and never returned to the brokerage business,
though he insisted this week the departure was voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   Nahmias, the other SafeScience investor contact, also spent part
of his career as a stockbroker. The National Association of
Securities dealers barred him from association with any NASD firm
in any capacity in 1996 as a result of a disciplinary case.
</P>
<P>
   Nahmias had been censured once before by the NASD and
temporarily barred by state regulators in Tennessee for ``dishonest
and unethical business practices'' in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Thursday, Nahmias declined to discuss
the disciplinary cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has nothing to do with what I do for SafeScience,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Brittania Holdings, an offshore investment vehicle based in
Nevis and operated by trustees located in the Channel Islands, is
the largest stockholder of SafeScience after Platt and Carver.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce said SafeScience is building relationships with
well-known institutional investors. He supplied a list of firms
where SafeScience has made investment presentations, including
Deutsche Banc Alex Brown; State Street Global Asset Management;
Adams, Harkness &AMP; Hill in Boston; and several London firms.
</P>
<P>
   SafeScience will need more money to continue to fund its
business, especially for medical research. It plans to conduct a
full phase II trial of GBC-590 involving 192 patients at six big
hospitals, including Beth Israel, for the treatment of prostrate
cancer. It also plans smaller, preliminary phase II trials for
pancreatic and colonalrectal cancer. Total expected tab: $8 million
to $9 million.
</P>
<P>
   Carver insists SafeScience and Platt clearly own the rights to
GBC-590 and will hold a patent for the compound soon. But
scientists at Wayne State and the Detroit college's affiliate
Karmanos Cancer Institute, where Platt worked under the direction
of Dr. Avraham Raz a decade ago, suspect Platt was researching on
their dime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we're suffering from a dearth of facts. I don't
think we've been privy to what's been in their (patent)
application,'' said Fred Reinhart, director of technology transfer
at Wayne State. His questions: Does GBC-590 infringe on existing
institute patents and who would own the rights if Platt developed
GBC-590 while employed to conduct reserach at the institute?
</P>
<P>
   Raz said his suspicions in the dispute, first reported in the
Wall Street Journal, were based mostly on the timing of the
original patent application and the work Platt was doing for him at
that time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before he came to me, he worked on plants,'' said Raz. ``He
never worked on cancer. I provided him with an environment in which
to work and it's insulting to me if this is true.''
</P>
<P>
   Carver disputes this and said Platt had conducted some of his
relevant research in Israel before moving to Detroit. He said there
is ``nothing going on legally and never has been'' regarding any
challenge to Platt's ownership of the compound.
</P>
<P>
   Why has it become such a hotly contested issue now?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it works,'' said Carver. ``Because it's moving along,
probably. I don't think it's a new thing, the politics of
science.''

CELLUCCI, BUSH CAST CLOUDS OVER SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The public schools have opened for another year, with the
sunshine of September optimism already blotted out by the
thunderclouds of politics. No one knows whether the clouds will
deliver life-giving rains or hail and devastation.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, George W. Bush, governor of Texas and the virtual
Republican nominee for president, said that if he is elected, he
will take federal funds from failing public schools and give up to
$1,500 per child to parents who want to transfer their children to
private schools. In an early warning to Democratic strategists who
take Latino and African-American voters for granted, Bush unveiled
his plan before the Latino Business Association in Los Angeles. He
received a warm round of applause when he said:
</P>
<P>
   ``Some say it is unfair to hold disadvantaged children to
rigorous standards. I say it is discrimination to require anything
less _ the soft bigotry of low expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, Governor Cellucci issued his own gale warning,
saying that every public school in the state will be ranked on the
basis of student scores on the Massachusetts Comprehensive
Assessment System tests. In 2003, high school students must pass
the MCAS tests to graduate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents will know what schools are achieving and what schools
aren't,'' Cellucci said.
</P>
<P>
   What Cellucci and Bush would do with the schools that are not
achieving is an answer that lies hidden in the thundercloud. In
Massachusetts, failing schools might be taken over by the state
Board of Education, which is headed by James Peyser. Peyser is
known more for school choice than school resurrection. Bush's
brother Jeb, governor of Florida, already has a voucher plan that
offers parents the chance to opt out of bad public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have also taken their turn at huffing, puffing, and
rhetorically blowing down ``failing schools.'' President Clinton
has threatened to close schools. New York City's school chancellor,
Rudy Crew, has announced the closing of 13 troubled schools.
</P>
<P>
   But they, too, have not come up with a serious plan to replace
``failing schools'' with something else.
</P>
<P>
   All students in New York State must pass the Regents English
examination to graduate. Of the 50 states, 48 now have ``high
stakes'' standardized tests. There is nothing wrong with base-line
standards of literacy and math proficiency. I have seen too many
young clerks who cannot make change when the cash register crashes,
too many students in college classes who cannot spell, and too many
young people who confuse Michigan and Minnesota to think otherwise.
Nor, ideally, should we be afraid of ranking the schools either, to
find out which ones need resources or maybe a round of firings.
</P>
<P>
   But that is precisely where politicians have failed. Rushing
children into high-stakes tests is asking them to go to the stake
when a Pentagon-paradigm Congress is providing a fraction of the
$112 billion the General Accounting Office says is needed to repair
the nation's crumbling school buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the widening gaps in wealth and resources are addressed,
high-stakes tests are just a class-based and race-based screening
device that fuels smugness among wealthier white students who
believe they ``earned'' their elite status. The tests will
assuredly pluck up some exceptional working class and low-income
students for governors to pat on the head. Cellucci did that last
winter by singling out the high scores of the Morse School in
Cambridge, where more than 40 percent of the students are from
low-income families.
</P>
<P>
   But without dealing with resources, the tests in the main will
also provide an excuse to abandon vast numbers of urban students.
Besides, we need more ``failures'' to populate our ever expanding
and ever profitable state and federal prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, many parents have to elevate education as a priority.
Obviously, principals and teachers have to do a much better job of
believing in their students. But politicians must remember that
they, too, shoulder a huge responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   We will know Cellucci is serious when he stops condemning
schools and starts dealing with the resource gaps that allow for
Wellesley, Westwood, Winchester, and Weston to have no more than 7
percent of 10th-graders failing in English and no more than 17
percent of 10th-graders failing in math while Springfield, Boston,
Lawrence, and New Bedford have between 37 percent and 49 percent of
10th-graders failing in English and between 63 percent and 78
percent of 10th-graders failing in math.
</P>
<P>
   We will know Bush is sincere when he comes up with something
more than a public relations ploy. Perhaps that $1,500 might go a
long way somewhere in rural Texas, but it buys you only a few weeks
at some private prep schools in New England.
</P>
<P>
   In rhetoric, Bush is right. Disadvantaged children suffer
discrimination from low expectations. Many micro-efforts around the
nation show that low-income students can learn. No one, certainly
no one in the approaching thunderstorm, has woven those small
triumphs into an optimistic national vision. That leaves us with a
forecast in these early rounds of high stakes tests of high winds,
damaging hail, and washed-out students.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ World War III will not be launched when clocks strike
midnight on Jan. 1. A Chernobyl-style meltdown will not occur at
the country's power plants. Banks and businesses will continue to
operate. Russians will have heating and lights.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in Moscow have offered repeated assurances that Y2K,
the so-called millennium computer bug, will not disrupt life in
Russia or cause problems for the world.
</P>
<P>
   Then why are so many people so worried?
</P>
<P>
   Russia's declarations are conspicuous, but the extent to which
the cash-strapped government has addressed the potential Year 2000
glitch is far from certain. Russian computer experts say Moscow is
talking a good game, but in deep denial about the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Time and money are running out, they warn.
</P>
<P>
   ``The period from noon on Dec. 31st and for the next 24 hours, I
prefer to lay very still in my bed and do nothing,'' said Jahn
Han-Magamedov, technical director of the Russian Regional Center
for Internet Technologies, a computer-industry think tank in
Moscow. ``When is Russia going to start paying attention to this
problem? Until it costs lives and money?''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the British embassy in Moscow issued an
internal memo to its staff suggesting that their families and
relatives not visit Russia between late December and early January
because of fears of potential computer-bug difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   A memo produced by the defense attache's office in the U.S.
embassy in Moscow _ and leaked last week to the press _ said
Russia's military was neglecting safeguards in 100 systems
designated ``mission critical'' of the 1,000 systems in use by the
Russian Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has been anxious to cooperate with Moscow on
Y2K _ particularly in safeguarding nuclear warheads and each
country's early-warning defense system _ to protect against a New
Year's Eve glitch that could mistakenly signal a nuclear attack.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has accepted an American offer to place a team of Russian
officers at a joint monitoring center in Colorado to observe U.S.
missile warning data during the Year 2000 transition, the Pentagon
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians will send 10 to 20 officers to staff the joint Y2K
Center for Strategic Stability, to be established in December at
Peterson Air Force Base, Colo. The intent is to allow the Russians
to view U.S. data and reassure them should satellites record a
glitch that falsely indicates that a nuclear launch has occurred.
</P>
<P>
   United States and Russian officials are confident that their
nuclear weapons and early-warning systems will not malfunction.
</P>
<P>
   But there are plenty of other pitfalls for Russia's aging
computers, which like computers worldwide may or may not go on the
blink by misreading the year 2000 as the double-zero date of 1900:
power plants and heating systems, air and train travel, oil and gas
pipelines, banking and telephones.
</P>
<P>
   As one U.S. official in Russia put it, get ready for
``breakdowns rather than blow-ups.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Russia's chief communications regulator has suggested that
the country may have to curtail the number of commercial air
flights and temporarily shut down some hazardous industries ``just
in case.''
</P>
<P>
   While many businesses that have sprouted in the post-Soviet
economy are on-line and automated, few government services are
computerized.
</P>
<P>
   Functions such as welfare rolls and Russia's military draft are
still carried out on paper and by hand. In Moscow, even many of the
traffic signals are still controlled by cops stationed at the
intersection.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials insist that their Soviet-era missile complex
simply is not designed to rely on computers that measure time in
such a way as to be affected by the millennium bug. Likewise, they
say, their nine major nuclear power plants are protected, though
some private experts are not so sure about the utility grids that
supply electricity to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other major
cities.
</P>
<P>
   Various warnings have come in reports from the CIA, the European
Union and private analysts who predict the first few months of 2000
could be rough for Russia with abrupt power-plant shutdowns,
transportation delays and possible interruptions in the flow from
Russia's natural gas pipelines. Europe depends on roughly one-third
of its natural gas from Russia to run heating and electrical
plants.
</P>
<P>
   If telephones go out or the power is interrupted, most Russians
all too accustomed to things not working may consider it is just
another day in their faulty post-Soviet society.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has been plagued by economic and political instability
since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. So it is not
surprising that a difficult-to-understand computer glitch _ whose
effects are even more difficult to predict _ would not cause much
public concern.
</P>
<P>
   But computer experts warn that more must be done to tackle the
problem and they accuse government officials of purposely
downplaying the potential risks. In July, the country's finance
ministry estimated that Russia's government agencies need at least
$187 million to solve its Y2K problems _ inexplicably down from
previous government estimates of a need for as much as $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the government estimated that its agencies have about
28,000 vital computer systems, only a third of which are ready for
the Year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But officials insist that the government in just the past few
months has made strides.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is well-known that Russia was very late in addressing this.
The attitude is if we can not solve the problem, let's do what we
can to minimize the risks. That is being accomplished,'' Natalya
Cherneh, a government consultant who organized a July conference on
the Y2K problem for Russian lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Russia does have one thing going for it _ it's lagging progress
compared to the rest of the industrialized world. The country of
146 million people has relatively few computers. Personal computers
were strictly limited during Soviet times and the large, centrally
planned industries were slow to convert to automation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the flip-side of Russia's backwardness in the world.
We can probably expect fewer problems because we have fewer
computers controlling things,'' said Dmitri Kuvalin of the Russian
Academy of Science's Institute of Economic Forecasting, which has
studied the Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
   Experts predict the big problems may hit small and medium-sized
companies who have joined the computer age on the cheap _ buying
knock-off personal computers and pirated software.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not likely to affect that average Russian,'' said
Kuvalin, ``simply because the lives of most people here still are
not dependant on the computer.''

WORTHY OF A CHUCKLE, EVEN AMID THE DAYS OF AWE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J.R. LABBE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Jewish High Holy Days began at sundown Friday, starting with
the two-day observance of Rosh Hashana and continuing with the
eight days of Yom Kippur.
</P>
<P>
   This is the time when Jews believe God will judge their lives.
He may find that they merit reward, or that they are deficient to
the point of deserving punishment.
</P>
<P>
   I remember the solemnity of this time of year from my high
school days, when I attended a predominantly Jewish public school
in the suburbs of St. Louis. The unique sound of the shofar, or
ram's horn, as it is blown the prescribed 100 times during the
holiday, transports listeners back to an ancient time when men
named David and Moses were celebrated for their leadership and
wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   But Rosh Hashana is not only about judgment. It is also a time
for laughter, according to Rabbi Daniel Lapin, a regular
contributor to the ``Jewish World Review.''
</P>
<P>
   ``On Rosh Hashana, Chapters 21 and 22 of Genesis are read; they
chronicle the birth and early life of Abraham and Sarah's son,
Isaac, history's first-born Jew. Even from conception, laughter
surrounds his life,'' Lapin wrote. ``In fact, out of the 13
Scriptural references to `laughter,' nine occur in the context of
Isaac's life. His name means `he shall laugh' and it is the name
that G-d instructed Abraham and Sarah to give him after they had
laughed about his birth. It must have seemed a comic thought that a
90-year-old woman and her 100-year-old husband would become
first-time parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Judgment and laughter _ too much of one and not enough of the
other was evident when the Southern Baptist International Mission
Board decided to publish a prayer guide calling for its members to
pray for the Jews' conversion to Christianity during the 10 holy
Days of Awe.
</P>
<P>
   The board has published a similar missal of bad taste directing
followers to pray for Muslims during Ramadan, the Islamic holy
days. And coming soon to a Southern Baptist church near you: guides
aimed at converting Hindus and Buddhists.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Sibley, who headed the International Mission Board's first
efforts of praying for Jews in 1996, said the board was not trying
to be offensive or provocative with its evangelical efforts timed
to occur during the Jews' holiest of observances.
</P>
<P>
   Oy. How do you think Sibley and the mission board would have
reacted if the Jews, Muslims and Buddhists got together on Dec. 24
and called for prayers the next day encouraging all Christians to
turn away from their misguided beliefs in the Redeemer? Can you
say, ``Offended and provoked''?
</P>
<P>
   Intolerance is an acceptable attribute among Bible literalists
who believe that the printed word consists of God's actual
proclamations _ not metaphors, not parables, but literally what he
said. And according to the New Testament of the Christian Bible _
which is not part of the Hebrew Bible, the Torah _ God said the
only way to everlasting salvation is through belief in his son,
Jesus Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Evangelical Baptists seem to take their intolerance a step
further than do those in other Christian denominations. It is
possible to pray for all God's human creatures to discover the
majesty of his son without escalating that fervor to the point of
aggression. And despite protestations that offense was not the
intent, the mission board's actions were perceived as offensive by
Jews across the country.
</P>
<P>
   It would almost be laughable if the Southern Baptists could find
any humor in such things, but the intolerance they show for other
religions is exactly what is keeping some U.S.-based Christian
churches from branching out in places like Russia. The Moscow city
prosecutor's office is trying to outlaw the Jehovah's Witnesses by
using a law that allows courts to ban religious groups found guilty
of inciting hatred or intolerance.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Southern Baptists consider the Jehovah's
Witnesses a cult, but that's fodder for another column.
</P>
<P>
   Intolerance is not always bad, but how it is manifested
certainly can be. Lord knows this world has seen its share of
harassment, torture and killing at the hands of intolerant people.
And that is why Jews reacted so viscerally and negatively to the
Southern Baptists' prayer guide.
</P>
<P>
   I offer this suggestion to my Jewish friends: Take a page from
Abraham and Sarah's playbook and laugh it off. One of the sayings
that I often heard muttered by the mothers of my high school
classmates was, ``From your lips to God's ears.'' He may be
listening to the Baptists with one ear, but he has plenty of
attention span left to go around. Shalom.

28,000 vital computer systems, only a third of which are ready for
the Year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But officials insist that the government in just the past few
months has made strides.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is well-known that Russia was very late in addressing this.
The attitude is if we can not solve the problem, let's do what we
can to minimize the risks. That is being accomplished,'' Natalya
Cherneh, a government consultant who organized a July conference on
the Y2K problem for Russian lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Russia does have one thing going for it _ it's lagging progress
compared to the rest of the industrialized world. The country of
146 million people has relatively few computers. Personal computers
were strictly limited during Soviet times and the large, centrally
planned industries were slow to convert to automation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the flip-side of Russia's backwardness in the world.
We can probably expect fewer problems because we have fewer
computers controlling things,'' said Dmitri Kuvalin of the Russian
Academy of Science's Institute of Economic Forecasting, which has
studied the Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
   Experts predict the big problems may hit small and medium-sized
companies who have joined the computer age on the cheap _ buying
knock-off personal computers and pirated software.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not likely to affect that average Russian,'' said
Kuvalin, ``simply because the lives of most people here still are
not dependant on the computer.''

CHRONICLE OF MIXED-RACE FAMILY IS MEDITATION ON DEVOTION, RACE,
RELATIONSHIPS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the 10-part documentary ``An American Love Story,'' the
unusual and the universal merge with such ease that it's easy to
miss the key points. As the title implies, it's the story of an
American family, told in such matter-of-fact, low-key style that
you begin to wonder what makes this family so special.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the point that filmmaker Jennifer Fox wanted to make
with her portrait of the Wilson-Sims family: that this ordinary
family has the same joys and sorrows as other families. The
difference is that Bill Sims, a blues musician, is black, and his
wife, corporate manager Karen Wilson, is white. They met in 1967,
married in 1979, and have been together ever since. They raised two
daughters, Cicily Wilson, who turned 20 during filming; and Chaney
Sims, 12 at the time (the parents alternated their daughters'
surnames because Karen Wilson, whose father had no sons, wanted her
family name to live on).
</P>
<P>
   Fox, who was part of an interracial couple when she conceived
this project in the early '90s, spent a year and a half with the
family and culled the series' 10 hours from 1,000 hours of footage.
The family had a say in what she used; you won't find mind-blowing
revelations along the lines of the groundbreaking '70s series ``An
American Family'' or shouting matches a la ``The Real World.'' The
accent is mostly on the positive in this series, which runs in
two-episode installments over five nights, beginning at 8 p.m.
Sunday on KERA/Channel 13.
</P>
<P>
   This documentary is the final ``American Playhouse''
presentation. And because it is being treated with such weight _ in
a news conference at the PBS summer press tour, ``Playhouse'' CEO
Ward Chamberlin called it ``by far the most important and
significant work that we've ever been associated with'' _ it's easy
to feel guilty for believing that the series is sometimes a bit
boring. It's possible that Fox would forgive that feeling, because
``An American Love Story'' is inspired by the occasional mundanity
that she was trying to portray. Rather than play up any racism
directed at the family, Fox focuses on day-to-day events: first
dates, illnesses, graduations, high-school reunions.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Fox ignores racism completely. Much of it is seen
through the eyes of Cicily, who encounters it as a religion student
at New York's Colgate University, where the few black students
chastise her for not aligning with them (she finds acceptance in an
ordinary way _ by joining a sorority). More surprisingly, she
encounters it among a group of students spending a semester in
Nigeria, where the students' work doesn't forestall a race-fueled
argument over who gets to sit where on the tour group's bus. This
is where Fox comes closest to tripping herself up; although she
doesn't show the argument, she spends considerable time
interviewing the people involved, and the series threatens to
devolve into an episode of MTV's ``Road Rules.'' But she makes it
clear that despite how far we've come, we have a long way to go
before erasing color lines completely.
</P>
<P>
   The series works better when it concentrates on the ordinary.
The most compelling events come in episode five, when younger
daughter Chaney _ aptly described by her father as being 12, but
looking 19 _ wants to go on her first date (with a boy she's met
only by phone). It's here that Fox best achieves her intentions of
showing the Wilson-Simses as an everyday family: Dad is
overprotective (because he was a teen-age boy once), Mom is
protective but a little more lenient, and Chaney rolls her eyes
when trying to explain to her parents why it would be embarrassing
to have her first date with them in the house.
</P>
<P>
   After she shot her footage, Fox interviewed all four family
members, as well as selected relatives and friends. If you're going
to spend 10 hours with a bunch of strangers, they should be as
likable as the Wilson-Simses. All four are strong-willed but laugh
easily, and are given to gentle _ and sometimes not-so-gentle _
teasing of one another. Bill Sims, who performs much of the series'
music (a soundtrack album and a Sims CD are also being released),
comes off as most philosophical; he often makes remarks that sound
measured and even prepared, as if he anticipated Fox's questions.
The sense is that because he's already a performer, he's used to
the star treatment.
</P>
<P>
   But Sims is also candid, especially about his past involvement
with sex and drugs, and about his drinking problem (which the
series depicts in episode nine). The women are more spontaneous.
Karen Sims, the often-smiling mother who still favors peace-sign
earrings and some hippie-influenced fashions, is honest enough to
acknowledge that as a white woman, she cannot possibly understand
everything that her husband or daughters go through. Cicily and
Chaney, despite their youth, are surprisingly thoughtful, as if
they're trying to be spokeswomen for a type of person who is
rarely, if ever, seen on TV.
</P>
<P>
   The series can be difficult to digest; each episode is built
around a theme, and some of the themes can't fill up an hour's
worth of time. But by the time the 10th installment rolls around,
you're curious about what's become of this affable family. More
important _ and Fox has said this was one of her intentions _ is
that you start meditating about what your own family has been
through.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the series is part of a project that will continue
after the final episode. PBS has set up a Web site,
www.pbs.org/weblab/lovestories, for people to contribute their
families' stories and for discussion of the series. And after the
series' final installment, PBS' Bill Moyers will catch up with the
family to find out what's happened since shooting concluded in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``An American Love Story'' contains language stronger than you
usually hear on broadcast TV and includes graphic depictions of
illnesses.

before WWII. Before the war, there were 6,000 Jews in Dresden.
After the war, there were fewer than 100. But with the end of the
Cold War, Jews again are moving to Dresden, which is now now to
more than 250 Jews with more coming all the time. Yet, the backers
of the new temple are more than $5 million short of the
approximately $20 million needed to build the temple. They wonder
what to think of this given the fact that more than $200 million
was raised easily to rebuild the major protestant chuch, which was
destroyed in Allied bombing. (Roughton, Cox News Service). WITH

3-D GRAPHICS CARDS GET ONE MORE LOOK 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) Over the last few months, I've been reviewing the
latest generation of high-end 3-D graphics cards. This column wraps
up that series, and just in time. The next generation is almost out
the door.
</P>
<P>
   Already, nVidia has unveiled details of its new GeForce 250 card
(originally code-named the NV10), and 3dfx is talking about its
yet-unnamed, next-generation card. You should begin seeing these
new cards on store shelves later this year.
</P>
<P>
   But meanwhile, we've got a fine crop of video adapters that are
great for either basic business use or playing games. If you've
just gotta have the zippiest graphics on the block, here are two
fine choices:
</P>
<P>
   --Millennium G400 Max _ $250, Matrox Graphics. &UR;  &LR;  For years,
Matrox ruled the roost as the maker of the fastest 2-D graphics
cards, with its Matrox Millennium I and II series. But those cards
weren't great for 3-D games, and neither were subsequent offerings
aimed specifically at gamers, such as the Matrox Mystique.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, gamers may turn their nose up at any 3-D card
offered by Matrox, but in the case of the G400 Max, that would be a
big mistake.
</P>
<P>
   While this card is not the fastest one I tried, it does have
some features not found in a lot of other video cards, not to
mention gorgeous color. In fact, the G400 Max unseats cards that
use nVidia's TNT2 chips for having my favorite ``look.''
</P>
<P>
   The G400 Max comes with 32 megabytes of fast video memory, as do
most of the other cards I've been testing. It will render 32-bit
colors and textures in 3-D. It can display 16.8 million colors at
resolutions of up to 2,048-by-1536 pixels, and supports monitor
refresh rates up to 200 hertz.
</P>
<P>
   (Matrox doesn't reveal the clock speed of its cards, but this
does have a 360-megahertz RAMDAC _ the part of the card that
converts its digital signal to analog output for use with a
monitor.)
</P>
<P>
   But the G400 Max has two features that make it stand out. First,
it has built-in hardware support for DVD. That means it does the
work of decoding DVD movies _ most other game-oriented cards leave
this to a software component _ so the main chip in your computer
doesn't have to.
</P>
<P>
   The G400 Max does bump-mapping in its hardware component.
Bump-mapping is a way of applying depth to textures, and it's
usually done using the card's drivers. In hardware form, though,
the result is a much richer, realistic appearance. However, games
must be written to take advantage of this feature.
</P>
<P>
   The card also has two monitor outputs. This allows the card to
take advantage of a feature in Windows 98 that lets you connect two
monitors to your computer. Usually, you have to have two graphics
cards installed, and getting a configuration like that to work can
cause some serious pain. Having two outputs on one card _ a feature
Matrox has dubbed DualHead _ makes it an elegant solution. An
adapter lets you connect the second output to a regular TV set, as
well.
</P>
<P>
   What can you do with this? The most obvious thing is to simply
extend your field of view _ seeing a character in a game scamper
off the trailing edge of one monitor and appear on the leading edge
of another is a hoot. Some games, such as Microsoft's Combat Flight
Simulator, will take advantage of it by putting one type of display
on one monitor _ say, maps of your position _ and a different
display on the other. Finally, you can even play DVD movies on one
screen while you work on a deadline project on the other. Now
that's a classy way to procrastinate!
</P>
<P>
   As a performance test, I used the time demo feature of the Quake
III Arena Test 1.08. This pumps large amounts of visual data
through the card and figures an average frames-per-second. The
higher the better, though the human eye can see only 24 frames per
second. I used three of the game's built-in graphics settings _
Normal, Fast and High Quality _ as well as the settings I use when
I play the game. The card was installed on a Dell Dimension with a
500-megahertz Pentium III chip and 256 megabytes of memory. The
desktop was set to display 32-bit color.
</P>
<P>
   With Fast settings (512-by-384 resolution, 16-bit color and
textures, low geometric detail, bilinear filtering), the G400 Max
hit 44.3 frames per second. With Normal settings (640-by-480,
32-bit color and textures, trilinear filtering and high geometric
detail), it achieved 40.1 fps. On High Quality (800-by-600, 32-bit
color and texture, high geometric detail and trilinear filtering),
it reached 37.4 fps. And at my settings (1,024-by-768, 32-bit color
and texture, high geometric detail and trilinear filtering), it got
36.1 fps.
</P>
<P>
   --Viper V770 Ultra _ $200, Diamond Multimedia. This is the
second card I've reviewed that uses nVidia's TNT2 Ultra chips, the
previous one being Creative Labs' 3D Blaster Riva TNT2 Ultra. In
terms of features, the Diamond card is more bare-bones _ but it's
also a bit faster.
</P>
<P>
   The V770 Ultra comes with 32 MB of video memory, and will render
32-bit colors in 3-D. It supports 16.7 million colors at
resolutions up to 1,920-by-1,440 and monitor refresh rates up to
200 hertz.
</P>
<P>
   It does not have the DualHead feature of the Matrox card and it
does not even have TV-out capabilities, like the Creative model.
</P>
<P>
   The Viper V770's graphics engine performs at 150 MHz, while its
memory works at 183 MHz. An included utility lets you overclock
this to 175/200. I was able to do this with no ill effects, but of
course, your mileage may vary. Overclocking can be risky, but in
this case _ given that Diamond advertises that you can crank it up
_ I suspect it's a fairly safe bet. The RAMDAC operates at 300 MHz.
</P>
<P>
   While the V770 Ultra does not support hardware-based DVD, it
does come with software that lets you play DVD discs (provided you
have a DVD-ROM drive, of course).
</P>
<P>
   The Matrox may have won my heart in terms of its rich colors and
bump-mapping feature, but this card still has a beautiful look to
it. I also like the InControl Tools that come with it, which let
you tweak and configure the card.
</P>
<P>
   This card performed beautifully with the Quake III test. At the
Fast settings, it scored 49.6 fps. On Normal, it got 44.5 fps. On
High Quality, it hit 40.7 fps. And on my settings, it was close to
the Matrox, with 36.2 fps.

<P>
   (Undated) Q. _ Hey, finally a Linux column! (See
www.chron.com/content/story.html/tech/324615) Reasonably fair and
accurate, too, I think. I agree that Linux is not quite ready for
the ordinary Joe, though it's getting close. But I'm not sure your
warning at the end of the article was justified. Your discussion of
Red Hat Linux made it sound like it is not possible to have a
machine that can boot both Red Hat and Windows. The problem is only
that Red Hat does not include a partitioning procedure with its
installation. Thus, to make a Windows box dual-bootable, one must
do on one's own what Caldera does for you and then nondestructively
partition your disk. Then one can install Red Hat. The only tricky
part is that, when one is asked where to install the LILO boot
loader in the Red Hat install procedure, one must answer ``Master
Boot Record.'' LILO will then be the first program that runs (after
the BIOS stuff) and will give you the option of booting Windows or
Linux.
</P>
<P>
   A. _ Several Linux users wrote in response to this column to
point out that Red Hat's Linux installation will indeed let you
boot from either Windows or Linux. My lack of knowledge of the way
Linux works had me answering that question wrong, and thus I was
not able to boot from Windows.
</P>
<P>
   The Caldera installation is much better in this regard, and I
repeat my recommendation that Windows users who are interested in
trying out Linux should use that version instead of Red Hat's.
</P>
<P>
   Q. _ I'd been told by a computer service person that writeable
CDs are not as reliable as commercially written CDs in CD-ROM
drives. Do you find this to be the case? Do you find the
CD-R-written CDs to be more reliable than CD-RW CDs?
</P>
<P>
   A. _ I've not had as much experience with CD-RW drives, but I
can say that write-once CDs (or CD-Rs) often are not as reliable as
commercial-grade compact disks. Of course, remember that
commercially sold disks go through a quality assurance process. Who
knows how many get tossed out in the testing process?
</P>
<P>
   The quality of homemade CDs can be affected by a variety of
factors, ranging from the speed of your computer to how its memory
is configured to the type of writeable CD drive you have. For
example, getting a perfect recording on a CD that connects to your
parallel port _ which is a slower connection _ is going to be
harder than using a built-in drive that connects to your computer's
system board.
</P>
<P>
   If you are having problems with a writeable CD drive, try
reducing the speed at which it writes to the disk. For example, if
your CD-R drive writes at 4X speeds, drop it to 2X. Check the
manual for the drive's software to see how to do this.
</P>
<P>
   Q. _ Ever since DOS, I've installed upgrade versions of each
operating system. Each time I've had to rebuild my hard drive, I've
had to install one operating system on top of the other. Now I'm
doing it again, and I've read that Windows looks for one particular
file during the upgrade process. My current operating system is
Windows 98. Can you provide the Windows 95 file name I need to
install 98 directly and avoid this long process?
</P>
<P>
   A. _ I've been unable to determine if your information is
correct or not. I suspect the upgrade disk is looking for WIN.EXE,
but actually, you don't have to worry about that if you have the
installation disk or disks from your previous Windows operating
system.
</P>
<P>
   If you launch the Windows 98 setup on a clean hard drive, at one
point it will ask you for an installation floppy or CD from either
Windows 3.1 or 95. Just have that handy, put it in the appropriate
drive and the setup program will recognize it. You don't have to
install one OS on top of another until you get to Windows 98.

`STIR OF ECHOES' STIRS SOME INTEREST BUT LETS YOU DOWN IN THE END 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union

<P>
   ``Stir of Echoes'' has a few things going for it and a few
things not.
</P>
<P>
   Going for it are gritty, vivid acting, a compelling take on a
shopworn premise and a handful of truly nasty scares. Not going for
it is the fact that we've seen the kid who communicates with blanch
faced apparitions shtick before. About a month ago. In ``The Sixth
Sense.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who haven't seen ``The Sixth Sense,'' go see it now;
you'll think about nothing else for the next 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   For those who have _ and who aren't already sleep-deprived from
watching umpteen summer horror flicks _ then ``Stir of Echoes''
(based on a Richard Matheson novel and opening today) offers its
own, not-insignificant pleasures.
</P>
<P>
   Until the last act, when the plot disintegrates into a
slaughterous muddle of sicko-killer cliches, the film is savvy
enough, and scary enough, to sustain us.
</P>
<P>
   It eeks a lot out of modest resources. It also eeks yet another
first-rank performance out of Kevin Bacon, who again proves his
qualifications as the world's greatest Stealth Actor (he slips in
under the radar). Those who remember Bacon from his days as a
brush-haired teen-throb will be amazed, or perhaps relieved, to see
exactly how far he's come.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Stir of Echoes'' he plays a working bloke named Tom Witzky
with a wife, Maggie (Kathryn Erbe), a son, Jake (Zachary David
Cope), and a Chicago neighborhood full of big-hearted, rough-trade
friends.
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director David Koepp (``The Trigger Effect''; the
screenplays for both ``Jurassic Parks'') does a lot right with the
film's early scenes, taking considerable time to establish
character and relationships.
</P>
<P>
   We know, for instance, that Tom and Maggie are barely scraping
by. We know that Maggie's pregnant, a piece of news that is greeted
less than ecstatically by Tom, who realizes he'll never be able to
pursue his rock-'n'-roll dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Tom is a realist, a skeptic, a tough guy with a squishy center
who loves his wife and kid but bemoans the fences that rim his
life. ``I never wanted to be famous. I just never expected to be so
_ I don't know _ ordinary,'' he says, his flat Chicago vowels
limning despair.
</P>
<P>
   Things change soon enough. Jake, we realize from the movie's
opener, sees and talks to ghosts. (``Does it hurt to be dead?'' he
asks an unseen spirit.)
</P>
<P>
   Mom and Dad know nothing about this, but when Tom gets
hypnotized as a lark by Maggie's sister (an effectively imbalanced
Illeana Douglas) he starts getting spooked on his own. Nightmares
invade his waking hours. Blood splatters his lovemaking. Finally,
he sees a ghost: a spectral young woman who materializes on the
living room couch just as Tom zaps on the tube for a night of
insomnia.
</P>
<P>
   Tom's reaction to this vision is the crux of the film _ more so,
in fact, than Jake's ghostly encounters, which provide the excuse
for the movie but none of its off-kilter drama. We've seen enough
of psychically gifted kids to know that score.
</P>
<P>
   What makes ``Stir of Echoes'' interesting is Tom's otherworldly
visits, which take him utterly by surprise _ he's made to eat his
skepticism _ and turn him into the unordinary man he's always
dreamed of. He becomes, specifically, a man obsessed; he quits
going to work, lives on the sofa and spends all of his energy on
trying to get his little wraith to return.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually we learn more about her (her name's Samantha; she
wasn't too bright; she disappeared from the neighborhood), and
eventually Tom learns the reasons for her haunting.
</P>
<P>
   What are they? Not telling. But it's enough to say that Tom gets
hypnotized once more, that he stumbles across clues in a twisty
shocker of a dream sequence and that Samantha, in her own,
ectoplasmic way, sends Tom on a mission.
</P>
<P>
   The results are often blackly humorous, and they'll appeal to
anyone who has ever nursed annihilative grudges against a landlord.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stir of Echoes'' boasts some imaginative photography by Fred
Murphy and a few nifty visual effects in the hypnosis sequences, in
which Bacon levitates before a large, blank screen. And Bacon
brings such nervy energy to this role that his more extreme
behavior late in the film makes perfect narrative sense.
</P>
<P>
   Making less sense are a couple of dangling subplots left behind
by clunky editing: early suggestions of a death in Tom's past, and
later scenes involving a psychic black character shipped straight
from ``The Shining.''
</P>
<P>
   He materializes abruptly, glares at Jake, reads his mind and
utters a few dire warnings to Jake's mom before vanishing in a puff
of _ not quite smoke.
</P>
<P>
   The fire comes later, in a conclusive shootout that wraps up the
plot but makes no sense stylistically; it breaks the spell, turning
a clever spook tale into just another bloody thriller. Until that
happens, we're sold.

 &HT;    FEDERAL GOVERNMENT EARNS 'B-' GRADE IN LATEST CONGRESSIONAL
REPORT
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) Financial categories.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- With the final exam less than four months away,
the federal government still is not working hard enough to
guarantee an ``A'' on its Y2K-computer-bug test. In a report card
issued Friday by one Congressman, Uncle Sam earned only a
``B-minus'' for efforts to fix computers by Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The government is ``doing a good job, but we still haven't done
good enough,'' said U.S. Rep. Steve Horn, R-Calif., chairman of the
House Subcommittee on Government Management, Information and
Technology. Even worse, the government is getting some of its
lowest grades in its most critical areas, such as in the Defense
Department, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For more than three years, Horn has been issuing periodic report
cards on the federal government's progress in eliminating
Y2K-related problems. In this latest scoring, based on information
available as of Aug. 13, he gave the Defense Department a grade of
``D,'' primarily because of poor progress in non-military
operations, such as hospitals and retirement plans. The Social
Security Administration and Nuclear Regulatory Commission were
singled out for praise in acing their tests.
</P>
<P>
   Horn's committee is charged with monitoring how well the 24
largest federal agencies are doing in the race to repair the
programming flaw that will cause many older computers and automated
equipment to malfunction after midnight Jan. 1. The problem is that
many older programs instructed computers to read only the last two
digits of a year. As a result, some machines will interpret the
year ``00'' as 1900, rather than 2000. That misunderstanding has
the potential to disrupt the systems that control everything from
Social Security's check-writing computers to Defense's high-tech
weapons system.
</P>
<P>
   To spur action, Horn has been issuing grades to shame those
agencies lagging in Y2K compliance. He says progress this summer
has been negligible. The ``B-minus'' grade is no better than the
one he issued earlier this summer, based on June data.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, these latest grades would have been even lower if Horn
had limited his evaluation to the agencies' 43 programs that the
Office of Management and Budget regards as be ``high-impact.''
Among those, only seven programs are in good shape: Social Security
benefits; the National Weather Service; disease monitoring; the
National Crime Information Center; passport applications; veterans
benefits and veterans health care.
</P>
<P>
   Horn said much of the lagging in other ``high-impact'' areas
results not from problems within the federal government itself, but
from the lack of preparedness among state and local governments, as
well as private contractors. For example, the Labor Department's
own computer systems are in good shape. But the department's
Y2K-readiness is questionable because many of the state agencies
needed to operate unemployment insurance programs won't be
Y2K-compliant until December.

 &HT;    KEY BLACKS GATHER AT WHITE HOUSE IN BID TO NARROW 'DIGITAL
DIVIDE'
 &HT;    600&AMP;ADD
 &HT;    With Photo.
 &HT;    Moving in both (w) Washington and (f) Financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seeking to enhance the online skills of
African-Americans, a small but growing vanguard of black
information technology professionals has been exchanging e-mail and
visiting each other's Web sites. This week, they met directly for
the first time to launch a renewed effort to bridge the ``digital
divide'' that curbs minority access to cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took the White House to bring everybody together,'' said
Jena Roscoe, associate director of the president's office of public
liaison, who organized the two days of intensive briefings for the
African-American Internet community, which ended Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Some 70 participants from across the nation attended the unique
event, held in the ornate Indian Treaty Room on the fourth floor of
the Old Executive Office Building, where President Dwight
Eisenhower once held his news conferences.
</P>
<P>
   The participants heard from a wide array of top White House
aides responsible for race initiatives, science,
telecommunications, and technology policy; electronic commerce,
economic development and minority community empowerment. Also
present were key figures from the departments of Commerce,
Education and Transportation, as well as the Federal Communications
Commission, the Small Business Administration and Minority Business
Development Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Although the briefings were closed to the press, the White House
allowed a Cox Newspapers reporter to sit in on some of the
sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speakers were great,'' said Dionne Muhammad, whose
Atlanta-based site, www.AshantiTech.com, is ``dedicated to
increasing technology awareness in the black community'' and which
offers, among other services, free e-mail ``with an Afrocentric
flair.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' she added, ``the speakers weren't really necessary.
What happened here is that we finally put the faces together with
the Web sites. We were able to add the all-important human touch.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Derrick Brown of Marietta, Ga., executive director of
KnowledgeBase, a non-profit unit with a broad mission to foster
online training among minority students:
</P>
<P>
   ``My experience here has convinced me that ... our initial
investment must be to foster a stronger sense of community and
collaboration among the leaders of this movement. That is, we must
all see the same end, and channel our collective efforts towards
that end.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown also noted that further investments must focus on creating
technology centers in churches, schools and community centers as
well as opening access to capital markets. Subsequent investments
also must be made to continue developing compelling content
targeted at minority groups, ``produced by companies that we
collaborate to build,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will allow our (minority) leadership to build the
capacity necessary to make significant impact. We must teach each
other the leadership and entrepreneurial skills necessary to gain
access to these markets,'' Brown concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the closing reception, where the networking
efforts continued, the visitors, each of whom paid his or her own
way here, heard from Courtland Cox, director of the Minority
Business Development Agency, an arm of the Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nation's big corporations are finally coming to understand
that they have to set up marketing strategies to deal with minority
groups,'' Cox said. ``There are now some 2 million minority-owned
businesses in this country and more of them need to get on the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Cox previewed for the group a new U.S. Census Bureau analysis
due to be released Sept. 22. It shows, he said, ``that over the
next 50 years the U.S. population will grow by some 120 million and
that 90 percent of that growth will be minority.''
</P>
<P>
   By 2050, Cox said, 47.2 percent of all Americans will belong to
minority groups. The four states that will account by then for a
quarter of the overall population _ California, Texas, New York and
Illinois _ ``will all be majority minority,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of those projections, limited minority usage of the
Internet has created a ``digital divide'' between those who have
access to online services and other new technologies, and those who
do not.
</P>
<P>
   A Commerce Department survey released last July revealed that
only about one in four black and Hispanic households owns a
computer with Internet access, compared with half or more of Asian
and non-Hispanic white households. That study also showed that
Asians are ahead of all other groups, including non-Hispanic
whites. Overall, the poorest and least educated Americans, as well
as single parents, have the biggest problem keeping up.

TWO LATEST HORROR FLICKS FAIL TO FRIGHTEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WESLEY MORRIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   They're two horror films opening on the same day from two
studios that really want you to believe they've got the scariest
flicks in town. But neither ``Stigmata'' nor ``Stir of Echoes'' has
the requisite vision to make them anything more than a couple of
stowaways on the Blair Witch broomstick _ and between the traffic
jam of spoofs and the inevitable onslaught of knockoffs, the
broom's about to break.
</P>
<P>
   These two latest, ultimately divergent attempts at supernatural
shock are crippled by something each movie fails to account for:
We're desensitized to horror-flick parlor tricks.
</P>
<P>
   Though, if the outpouring of love for ``The Sixth Sense'' and
extreme curiosity about ``The Blair Witch Project'' are indicative,
our hunger to have the $8.50 scared out of us is insatiable.
</P>
<P>
   The first weekend we're there, but there needs to be a hook that
survives the hype, something ad campaigns for both ``Blair Witch''
and ``Sixth Sense'' exploit more than these movies do their kid
stars. ``Stigmata'' and ``Stir of Echoes'' lose what hooks they
have as their two lead characters begin losing their minds.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligent suspense-building is thrown out so that both films
can fool around with crowd-pleasing horror cliches that push us out
the window ``Exorcist''-style and down those interminable flights
of concrete steps. Our bones are intact, but our belief in the
horror flick du jour is fractured in 32 places while a genre deluge
flows faster and chunkier than Regan MacNeil's projectile pea soup,
which the makers of ``Stigmata'' are all too excited to lap up.
</P>
<P>
   A dysfunctional ``Exorcist'' for our girl-power times,
``Stigmata'' dumps all its heresy onto poor Frankie Paige (Patricia
Arquette) who receives the bloody title revelation in the middle of
a Calgon moment.
</P>
<P>
   She's hospitalized, examined, stitched up, then accused of being
suicidal, which is a slap in her demonic face. ``I love being me,''
she retorts. ``Ask anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Though by the time ``Stigmata'' puts her through a gore factory
that has her assuming the crucifixion position more often than
rapper Nas, you wish Arquette would try to love being someone else.
</P>
<P>
   With an enormous artist's loft incongruous with her gig as a
hairdresser and an apparently fantastic health care plan, why can't
Frankie read the signs: She's possessed. Maybe if she could hear
the fizzing, blipping and feedback in Smashing Pumpkin Billy
Corgan's score, she'd realize she has the devil inside.
</P>
<P>
   Director Rupert Wainwright _ not to be confused with songwriting
pianist Rufus Wainwright of the velour vocals, though that would've
been something to see _ suspects that what horror is truly about is
the noise on the soundtrack and the frequency with which you can
cut away to a host of jarring images, including stakes being
hammered in wrists like the 95 Theses.
</P>
<P>
   A more bone-chilling experience is trying to solve the mystery
of whether Arquette, Gabriel Byrne, as the Vatican priest trying to
save her, and Nia Long, as the best friend on stand-by, needed to
be in a hit this badly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stigmata'' presumes to have dogma on its mind, allegedly
inspired by a scroll that contained Jesus' last will and testament,
so to speak. But all the talk of a devious Vatican coverup is just
a lunatic, inanely underdeveloped pretense to get Arquette to
levitate, with her eyes rolled back, daring you to excommunicate
her rather than exorcise her. Either way, there isn't enough holy
water in the world.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, ``Stir of Echoes'' is a canny piece of mature
filmmaking that never recovers from a nervous breakdown it suffers
halfway through.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jurassic Park'' screenwriter-turned-director David Koepp
(``The Trigger Effect'') doesn't rely on editing-room salvation or
an irritating soundtrack to drive the stunts, he just wants to
scare us. The film begins promisingly at a small gathering of a
group of Chicago friends.
</P>
<P>
   Tom (Kevin Bacon), the cynical one, agrees to be hypnotized
under the assumption that it won't work. Bacon is perfectly cast in
a role that needs his deadpan incredulity, so the film can wear it
down once Tom starts having dreams that creep into his reality.
</P>
<P>
   Tom went ``way under _ freak under,'' as Illeana Douglas,
playing his hypnotist pal, puts it. And before long he can't make
love to his wife (outstanding Kathryn Erbe) without having the
images of his hypnosis overcome him. That same night he's joined by
a girl on his sofa. For the next several nights he returns to the
same spot to see if she'll return. And in one priceless sequence,
Tom tries to get the girl to revisit him by re-enacting his routine
from the first night he saw her, flipping on the TV and reclining,
with the camera doing its same horror-movie pan to empty space
beside him. That sort of gag-mischief makes ``Echoes'' fascinating
fun because you think it's going to push you around and mess with
your head playing genre games. Eventually, the plot's pieces begin
falling into place and you realize Koepp's telling a ghost story of
such ordinary proportions that he has no alternative but to crank
up the hokum, turning the film into a disappointing ``Shining''
riff in which the dead start making ``Field of Dreams'' demands.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon's taut resistance collapses into high-octane Jack
Nicholson menace that would make him at home with Arquette, who
screams and hisses over Corgan's music in ``Stigmata'' as though
she were L7's illegitimate demon-seed member.
</P>
<P>
   Tom's son, Jake (a preternaturally unaffected Zachary David
Cope, who seems poised to go 10 rounds with ``Sixth Sense's'' Haley
Joel Osment), is also given to telepathy and communing with the
dead. (Can we talk about the fact that there is more shining going
on this year than in a Prada ad?) At one point he talks to his
parents in that low-register voice-of-Satan _ like Arquette.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Stir of Echoes'' drops its ``Omen'' influence and proceeds
to run all over the horror map.

 &HT;    KEY BLACKS GATHER AT WHITE HOUSE IN BID TO NARROW 'DIGITAL
DIVIDE'
 &HT;    600&AMP;ADD
 &HT;    With Photo.
 &HT;    Moving in both (w) Washington and (f) Financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seeking to enhance the online skills of
African-Americans, a small but growing vanguard of black
information technology professionals has been exchanging e-mail and
visiting each other's Web sites. This week, they met directly for
the first time to launch a renewed effort to bridge the ``digital
divide'' that curbs minority access to cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took the White House to bring everybody together,'' said
Jena Roscoe, associate director of the president's office of public
liaison, who organized the two days of intensive briefings for the
African-American Internet community, which ended Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Some 70 participants from across the nation attended the unique
event, held in the ornate Indian Treaty Room on the fourth floor of
the Old Executive Office Building, where President Dwight
Eisenhower once held his news conferences.
</P>
<P>
   The participants heard from a wide array of top White House
aides responsible for race initiatives, science,
telecommunications, and technology policy; electronic commerce,
economic development and minority community empowerment. Also
present were key figures from the departments of Commerce,
Education and Transportation, as well as the Federal Communications
Commission, the Small Business Administration and Minority Business
Development Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Although the briefings were closed to the press, the White House
allowed a Cox Newspapers reporter to sit in on some of the
sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speakers were great,'' said Dionne Muhammad, whose
Atlanta-based site, www.AshantiTech.com, is ``dedicated to
increasing technology awareness in the black community'' and which
offers, among other services, free e-mail ``with an Afrocentric
flair.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' she added, ``the speakers weren't really necessary.
What happened here is that we finally put the faces together with
the Web sites. We were able to add the all-important human touch.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Derrick Brown of Marietta, Ga., executive director of
KnowledgeBase, a non-profit unit with a broad mission to foster
online training among minority students:
</P>
<P>
   ``My experience here has convinced me that ... our initial
investment must be to foster a stronger sense of community and
collaboration among the leaders of this movement. That is, we must
all see the same end, and channel our collective efforts towards
that end.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown also noted that further investments must focus on creating
technology centers in churches, schools and community centers as
well as opening access to capital markets. Subsequent investments
also must be made to continue developing compelling content
targeted at minority groups, ``produced by companies that we
collaborate to build,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will allow our (minority) leadership to build the
capacity necessary to make significant impact. We must teach each
other the leadership and entrepreneurial skills necessary to gain
access to these markets,'' Brown concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the closing reception, where the networking
efforts continued, the visitors, each of whom paid his or her own
way here, heard from Courtland Cox, director of the Minority
Business Development Agency, an arm of the Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nation's big corporations are finally coming to understand
that they have to set up marketing strategies to deal with minority
groups,'' Cox said. ``There are now some 2 million minority-owned
businesses in this country and more of them need to get on the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Cox previewed for the group a new U.S. Census Bureau analysis
due to be released Sept. 22. It shows, he said, ``that over the
next 50 years the U.S. population will grow by some 120 million and
that 90 percent of that growth will be minority.''
</P>
<P>
   By 2050, Cox said, 47.2 percent of all Americans will belong to
minority groups. The four states that will account by then for a
quarter of the overall population _ California, Texas, New York and
Illinois _ ``will all be majority minority,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of those projections, limited minority usage of the
Internet has created a ``digital divide'' between those who have
access to online services and other new technologies, and those who
do not.
</P>
<P>
   A Commerce Department survey released last July revealed that
only about one in four black and Hispanic households owns a
computer with Internet access, compared with half or more of Asian
and non-Hispanic white households. That study also showed that
Asians are ahead of all other groups, including non-Hispanic
whites. Overall, the poorest and least educated Americans, as well
as single parents, have the biggest problem keeping up.

   &UR; By DAVID PLOTZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno has always been viewed as the least
Clintonian member of the Clinton administration. Her boss believes
words are deeds and images are action. The self-styled ``awkward
old maid,'' immune to the blandishments of Beltway power, is
supposedly the beefy substance of this superficial government.
</P>
<P>
   Yet no Clinton administration figure depends more on image than
the attorney general, and none has relied so much on words and
symbols as a substitute for action. Reno's defining moment, after
all, was taking responsibility for Waco. Taking responsibility
apparently meant doing nothing (except supervising a post-mortem
investigation that doesn't appear to have investigated anything).
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the symbolic Reno represents a new and mostly
encouraging model of attorney general, a perfect fit for an age of
what legal scholar Jeffrey Rosen calls ``criminalized politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally--at least during the past half-century--there have
been two kinds of attorneys general. One is the presidential
confidant, such as Bobby Kennedy, John Mitchell, or Edwin Meese,
who treats the Justice Department as the president's private law
firm. The other is the faceless, trustworthy administration foot
soldier. Remember Bill Barr? I didn't think so.
</P>
<P>
   Reno is neither. She arrived in Washington from Miami as
Caesar's Wife, and so she has remained. She was ignorant and
independent of insider D.C., and has stayed that way. Bill Clinton
never much liked her and never coin her, and she
reciprocated. She was, she said, ``the people's lawyer,'' not his.
It is this outsiderness that has made her such a good attorney
general and such a bad one.
</P>
<P>
   This is a time when the mere act of taking a high-level
political job subjects any official to suspicion of criminal
wrongdoing. During the Clinton administration, a primary--arguably
the primary--job of the attorney general has been to supervise the
investigations of her colleagues and boss. Reno has appointed
independent counsels to investigate six of her fellow Cabinet
members and her president, and has overseen innumerable internal
Justice investigations of administration corruption.
</P>
<P>
   You can argue about whether this constant surveillance of pols
is a good thing, but there is no doubt that these are the most
highly publicized cases the DOJ handles.
</P>
<P>
   No one is better suited to them than Reno. She is smart, but
mostly she is trustworthy. She pays the list price for her cars to
avoid the appearance of favoritism. She avoids the president
because she doesn't want to be tainted by him. Her employees speak
with awe about her integrity.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's independence has given her the courage to appoint
counsels to probe her colleagues and her boss, and the courage not
to appoint counsels even when the wolves were baying for them. She
refused to authorize an independent investigation into campaign
fund raising, despite Republican outrage, because she believed the
law did not require it.
</P>
<P>
   Since she rejected a fund-raising independent counsel, some
Republicans have painted her as Clinton's tool, charging that she
was helping him so she could keep her job. (Newt Gingrich even
likened Reno to Mitchell.) But the charges haven't stuck. Reno's
entire success at Justice rests on her image as an ethical paragon.
The independent counsel may be tainted, but thanks to Squeaky
Janet, the AG and the DOJ are unsullied.
</P>
<P>
   To appreciate the hugeness of Reno's accomplishment, hearken
back to the Reagan Justice Department. Meese was under
investigation. DOJ inquiries into other Reagan officials were
suspect. The department was mistrusted, a national disgrace. Under
any Clinton crony (imagine Webb Hubbell!), the DOJ would have been
similarly compromised. After Watergate, legal reformers proposed
making the Department of Justice independent of presidential
control. Janet Reno is the next best thing: the Independent
Attorney General.
</P>
<P>
   Reno is independent not just by temperament but also because she
is unfireable. Every day since she took office, she has been
supervising at least one probe embarrassing to Clinton--Whitewater,
fund raising, Lewinsky, China espionage, etc. Clinton can't afford
the political beating he would take if he cashiered her.
</P>
<P>
   But Reno pays a price for her life tenure and her outsiderness.
The president has all-but-excluded her from policy-making. Under
the Crony Attorneys General, the Justice Department exercised vast
influence over legal policy. Meese and Kennedy, for example, shook
up federal law enforcement. But the Clinton White House has
husbanded crime policy to itself, unwilling to entrust it to Reno.
</P>
<P>
   This has made her an attorney general without measurable
accomplishment in law enforcement or prosecution. Crime has
plummeted, but she gets no credit. Reno brought an ambitious,
liberal agenda to Justice. She favored alternative punishments,
longed to help troubled kids, worried about Draconian
anti-immigration policy, and disliked the death penalty, mandatory
minimum sentences, and the crack/powder cocaine sentencing
disparity. But Clinton and the Republican Congress ignored her.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, her Justice Department has had to enforce an expanded
federal death penalty, throw more people in federal prison for
longer sentences, punish juvenile criminals more harshly, support
mandatory minimums and the crack/powder disparity, and double the
size of the Border Patrol. Reno opposed some of these policies
internally but had too little influence to stop them.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to Waco, where the symbolism and substance of
Reno collide most alarmingly. Reno's deserved reputation for
integrity is merely negative. She has not achieved anything
magnificent. Her integrity has simply prevented her from corrupting
the process. She has not conducted any powerful investigations, but
she has had the wisdom not to block others from conducting them.
</P>
<P>
   The Waco mess, however, has exposed the limits of mere honor.
Most reports suggest that FBI agents lied to Reno over and over
about what they had done, and Reno believed them. In this case,
she, not an independent counsel, supervised the operation and the
probes, and she settled for cursory answers.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to call this gullibility and incompetence, and that's
exactly what Republicans are doing: A chorus on the right,
including Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, the Wall Street
Journal editorial page, and Larry Klayman, is demanding her
resignation. (It's worth noting, however, that the FBI similarly
deceived Republican AGs over the Ruby Ridge fiasco. Attorneys
general have an impossible relationship with the FBI: They
nominally supervise the bureau and hence are held responsible for
its misbehavior, but the FBI behaves like an autonomous agency.)
</P>
<P>
   An attorney general who exerted more control over the department
and the bureau, who was a better head-knocker, and who had the full
support of the White House might have dragged the truth out of the
FBI years ago, as Reno did not and could not. But no such attorney
general could have survived the Clinton scandals, much less
survived them with her own reputation--and her
department's--intact.

RESTORATION OF `THIRD MAN' DOESN'T DIMINISH ITS QUALITY &HT;     

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JEFF MILLAR 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   (Undated) For the 50th anniversary of its release, Carol Reed's
``The Third Man'' enjoys a restoration from Rialto Pictures, the
same company that spruced up Federico Fellini's ``Nights of
Cabiria.''
</P>
<P>
   Made from the original camera negative, the version is also
Reed's cut for the European release. It adds about 11 minutes to
the American version cut by David O. Selznick, who owned the
Western Hemisphere rights.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, ``The Third Man'' was named to the American Film
Institute's 100 Greatest American Movies of All Time, even though
its Americanism is not much more than its dialogue being spoken in
the English language.
</P>
<P>
   Reed and producer Alexander Korda were British, and it was
written by the famously America-phobic Graham Greene. It won the
British Film Academy best film award in 1949. What made the biggest
splash at the time of its release, the all-zither soundtrack, was
composed and played by an Austrian, Anton Karas. Selznick, who came
in as a partner, insisted upon an American presence among the
stars. Selznick wanted Robert Mitchum but ended up with Joseph
Cotten, whom he had under contract. Likely what has imputed
Americanism to the film over the years was the performance of Orson
Welles_ who's not on the screen for much more than 10 minutes _ as
Harry Lime.
</P>
<P>
   The film's genesis is a notion by Greene, who was fascinated by
post-war Vienna: the city's provenance of European culture
juxtaposed against the rubble of World War II bombing and the
multiple governments. Like postwar Berlin, the city was divided
into zones and policed by the conquering Allies _ French, American,
Soviet and British. One zone was policed by all four at once. Four
international military cops per Jeep.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving is an American, Holly Martins (Cotten), a hack writer
of pulp Western fiction with titles such as ``Lone Rider of Santa
Fe.'' He has an offer of employment _ it's not clear doing what _
from an old school chum, Harry Lime (Welles).
</P>
<P>
   But he's told that Harry is dead, hit by a truck. Holly's just
in time for Harry's funeral, where he encounters Anna (Alida
Valli), Harry's lover, and Maj. Calloway (Trevor Howard), who runs
the British military police.
</P>
<P>
   Calloway tells Holly that Harry deserves to be dead. He was a
black marketer, selling diluted penicillin that has resulted in the
deaths of hundreds of people, most of them children.
</P>
<P>
   Holly rejects that idea _ not Harry _ and sets out to clear
Harry's name and prove that his death was not accidental. He forms
a conspiracy theory involving the military and a ``third man.''
``Amateur,'' snipes Maj. Calloway at Holly. Graham was restrained
from actually writing ``American amateur,'' but we can hear it,
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Welles gives Harry a mask of irony that turns all moral judgment
back on itself. He turns a mass murderer into a wry rogue, and
makes his villainy all the more horrifying because we rather like
him.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, in one of the film's many memorable sequences, Holly
meets up with his past aboard a dilapidated Ferris wheel, where he
hears that what seems repellent to Americans is just situational
ethics in postwar Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in the sewers of Vienna, Reed's bravura moment is the
mother of all chase scenes, tension and fear as heavy as the
dripping condensation beneath the streets.
</P>
<P>
   The tonal gradation of the film's restoration is first-rate.
There are unrepairable scratches, though; camera negatives were not
treated as reverently then.
</P>
<P>
   If you've discovered the film on videotape, you simply have not
seen the astonishing, expressionist, still-influential
black-and-white cinematography of Robert Krasker that won him an
Academy Award. &QL;

CLINTON UNVEILS PROGRAM TO BUY BACK GUNS FROM PRIVATE OWNERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 2nd graf to say program is first federal effort of its kind) (sw) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Stepping up the federal government's fight against
gun violence, President Clinton on Thursday announced a $15 million
program to buy back firearms from private owners.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under the first federal effort of its kind, the Department of
Housing and Urban Development would provide grants of up to
$500,000 to police departments around the country to buy back and
destroy as many as 300,000 weapons, mainly in and around public
housing projects. The department is suggesting that authorities
offer $50 per gun, either in cash, food, gift certificates, toys or
tickets to sporting events.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's announcement capped a day-long rally and lobbying push
here by scores of mayors, police chiefs, religious leaders and
other local officials who favor tighter gun controls.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Every gun turned in through a buy-back program means
potentially one less tragedy,'' Clinton said at a White House
ceremony where he was flanked by mayors and uniformed police
chiefs.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo said in a telephone interview
that the program would reach at least 30 sites nationwide beginning
in late November.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a gun around the house that's accessible, that's
not being used by a sportsman or a hunter, and you need a small
amount of money,'' Cuomo said, ``bring it in and we'll buy it.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The money for the federal buy-back will come from existing
department grants and does not require congressional approval.
Unlike other buy-backs, the federal program will target weapons in
and around public housing projects.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The nation's 3,400 public housing authorities will be eligible
to join with local police departments in partnerships to buy back
and destroy the firearms. Grants of up to $500,000 per police
department will be provided on a first-come, first-serve basis.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Authorities will accept guns, no questions asked, said David
Egner, a housing department spokesman. But if the police later
trace the weapon to a serious crime, like a murder, the previous
owner could be prosecuted. Guns found to be stolen will be returned
to their owners.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At a rally later Thursday on the steps of the Capitol, civic
leaders and law-enforcement officers praised the president's plan,
and called on House and Senate negotiators to break their impasse
and hammer out new gun restrictions, including requirements for
child-safety locks on all guns and mandatory background checks on
all people who buy firearms at gun shows.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here to say to the House, join the Senate in giving us
some extra tools,'' said Mayor Wellington E. Webb of Denver, a
Democrat who is president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We want gun safety because we want our cities to be safe and
our schools to be safe,'' said Mayor Paul Helmke of Fort Wayne,
Ind., who is a Republican.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hector Torres, the chief of police in Bridgeport, Conn., said in
an interview, ``We've had buy-backs in the past, and they're a
useful tool to remove weapons from the community.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers and police officers who oppose stricter gun controls
held their own news conference at the Capitol, criticizing Clinton
for offering clemency to 16 Puerto Rican militants at the same time
he is seeking tougher gun restrictions. They also criticized the
visiting police chiefs for what they described as slacking off for
politics instead of tending to law enforcement.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Standing next to cardboard cut-out figures of uniformed police
officers, signifying stand-ins for officers fighting street crimes,
Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., who is on the House Judiciary Committee,
excoriated the visiting police chiefs for ``engaging in useless,
phoney, photo ops with the president.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The intensifying debate over gun control comes at time when
violent crime is actually on the wane nationwide. But a string of
shootings, including the massacre on April 20 at Columbine High
School in Littleton, Colo., has provided new momentum for advocates
of tighter gun laws.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Over the past several years, cities and local communities have
conducted gun buy-backs with varying degrees of success. In the
past year alone, officials in Los Angeles, Washington, Atlanta and
New York have started buy-backs.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Fishner, the criminal justice coordinator for Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani of New York, said the most recent buy-back program
operated by the New York City Police Department netted 1,800
firearms between July 15 and Aug. 15, and that one operated by the
Brooklyn district attorney's office netted 659 weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Last month in Washington, police bought back 1,164 guns in a
single day. Residents received $100 in cash for each weapon, the
money having been confiscated during anti-narcotics operations.
</P>
<P>
   And a program in Lexington, Ky., last October offered $100 in
McDonald's food gift certificates for any working handgun, pistol,
rifle or shotgun. Some 331 firearms were turned in, including old
military rifles, seven assault rifles and one gun that was stolen
from a police officer's home.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Advocates said the initiatives remove thousands of guns from
private homes, if not necessarily from the hands of criminals.
Seizing on this potential benefit, Clinton twice repeated a
sobering statistic: The rate of accidental shooting deaths for
children under 15 in the United States is nine times higher than
the rate of the other 25 industrialized nations combined.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite the anecdotal evidence, there is no definitive analysis
to support that buying back firearms reduces gun violence or crime.
As a result, the housing department plans to conduct a $1 million
study of gun buy-back plans, including its own.  &QL;

   Opponents argue that gun buy-backs are largely a cosmetic effort
in a nation awash with more than 200 million firearms. Wayne
LaPierre, executive vice president of the National Rifle
Association, said that if the administration was serious about
combatting gun crimes, it would spend the $15 million on hiring new
prosecutors and prosecuting felons.  &QL;

<P>
   ``People have a right to do what they want with their own
personal property,'' said LaPierre, who said the NRA does not
oppose gun buy-backs. ``But this is nothing more than a public
relations gesture that means nothing to drug dealers killing
people.''

FORD INTRODUCES EUROPEAN-DESIGNED FOCUS, AN ALL-NEW SMALL CAR FOR
2000
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by CARS-GLANCE) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the Kia-built Festiva subcompact gone from the Ford lineup,
and the compact Contour failing to find favor with American
consumers, Ford has rolled out the European-designed Focus, an
all-new small car for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was originally designed to replace the compact
Escort, which has been Ford's smallest and least expensive model
since the Festiva went away, the Focus will be sold alongside the
Escort for a while, Ford officials announced this summer.
</P>
<P>
   That strategy hasn't worked well for the Contour, which has
competed against the cheaper Escort and the more expensive and
slightly larger Taurus in Ford showrooms. (The Contour also
continues for 2000, but production has been scaled back to mirror
its poor sales.)
</P>
<P>
   Ford officials seem convinced that the Focus and the Escort will
appeal to separate crowds, with the Focus drawing more business
from Japanese rivals Honda and Toyota than the Escort has.
</P>
<P>
   That remains to be seen, but I believe that most consumers will
favor the Focus over the Escort, which is reduced to a single sedan
model for 2000. Gone are the coupe and station wagon models, which
will be replaced by the Focus.
</P>
<P>
   Comparing the two sedans side by side gives the Focus quite an
edge over the Escort. And that's really significant, because
despite its reputation as an econobox, the Escort has been a very
good little car. For the past few years, it has been based on the
design of the previous generation of the Mazda Protege, arguably
the best compact car on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Among the attributes that give the Focus an edge are its high
profile European styling and interior roominess. With a roof three
inches higher than the Escort's, the Focus sedan _ which we tested
for this report _ approaches the dimensions of a small
sport-utility.
</P>
<P>
   That's important if you or someone who regularly rides in your
car is tall. I took a 6- foot-6 friend car shopping one day, and we
spent hours trying to find an affordable car that he could fit
into. In the Focus, those who stand 6 feet or taller will find a
high roof that doesn't touch the tops of their heads _ even in the
back seat. No kidding.
</P>
<P>
   The design isn't as radical as that of the current Ford Taurus,
but it is modern and attractive enough to turn heads, something the
practical little Escort rarely did. This is one of Ford's so-called
New Edge global designs, which will be used on a various vehicles
that will be sold in different sizes and configurations worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   In North American, Ford will sell three body styles: the
four-door sedan, three-door coupe and five-door wagon. The Focus
has been on sale in Europe for the past year, and over there, a
hatchback model is sold; U.S. dealers won't get that model because
hatchbacks don't seem to sell very well in the States anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Base prices range from $11,865 for the three-door ZX3 coupe to
$15,380 for the uplevel SE wagon (plus $415 transportation).
</P>
<P>
   Sedans come in three trim levels. The base LX model lists for
$12,125; the midlevel SE goes for $13,565; and the top-of-the-line
ZTS, which we tested, carries a sticker of $15,165.
</P>
<P>
   Two engines are available. The base engine, a 2.0-liter
four-cylinder with iron block and aluminum head, comes in the LX
and SE sedans and the SE wagon, and is rated at 110 horsepower and
125 foot-pounds of torque.
</P>
<P>
   The ZX3 coupe, which is the least expensive Focus, and the ZTS
sedan, the most expensive, have the best engine: the 2.0-liter
Zetec with 130 horsepower and 135 foot-pounds of torque.
</P>
<P>
   Standard is a five-speed manual transmission, which came in our
test car. But a four-speed automatic is optional and probably will
be the gearbox of choice for most buyers. Drivers in this vehicle
class don't particularly like to use a clutch.
</P>
<P>
   I found, however, that the clutch and manual transmission added
an element of fun and a measure of performance to our test car,
which had the 130-horsepower engine. Granted, this is no hot rod,
but there is plenty of power for the class, and the Focus ride and
handling are much crisper and sportier than I expected. I could
almost close my eyes and imagine I was driving a sporty little
coupe. Almost.
</P>
<P>
   The instrument panel and dash are radical departures from the
plain and functional dashboards of past Ford economy cars; this is
almost like the cockpit of a modern aircraft. Controls are easy to
reach and simple to operate, and I especially like the easy- to-aim
dash-mounted air-conditioning vents.
</P>
<P>
   Our test car came with all the amenities you would expect on a
larger, more expensive car, including an in-dash AM/FM/compact disc
stereo that sounded great, power windows and door locks (with a
pocket remote control), power outside mirrors, manual
air-conditioning, four-wheel disc brakes with antilock system
(optional), power steering, leather-wrapped tilt steering wheel and
a tachometer.
</P>
<P>
   Dual front air bags are standard, and side air bags to protect
the driver and front-seat passenger from a side impact are
optional. The Focus is the first vehicle to include anchors for
child safety seats, as well as top-of-the-seat tethers for child
seats, Ford says.
</P>
<P>
   The front bucket seats are fully adjustable for just about any
size person, and the rear has ample room for two adults or three
children. The trunk holds a whopping 12.9 cubic feet of stuff, one
of the largest trunks in the class.
</P>
<P>
   Competitors for the Focus sedan include the Saturn SL, Honda
Civic, Toyota Corolla (and its clone, the Chevy Prizm), Dodge and
Plymouth Neon, Chevrolet Cavalier, Mazda Protege, Mitsubishi
Mirage, Hyundai Elantra, Nissan Sentra, Subaru Impreza and Suzuki
Esteem. The only competing wagons are the Saturn SW, Elantra and
Esteem.
</P>
<P>
   EPA fuel-economy ratings range from 28 miles per gallon in the
city/35 mpg on the highway for the manual-transmission base engine
to 25 city/32 highway for the Zetec model with automatic
transmission. Our test car, with the Zetec engine and manual
gearbox, was rated at 26 mpg city/33 highway. The gas tank holds
13.2 gallons.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Focus is beginning to arrive at dealerships, it
doesn't officially go on sale until Sept. 30. The cars are built in
Wayne, Mich., and Hermosillo, Mexico.

<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: America Online continues to bill me after I
canceled my account. Calling them doesn't do any good. My wife
finally got through to them, but they refused to do anything
because she was not the one who subscribed. I called and spent my
entire lunch period waiting for a pick-up. When that failed, I got
on their Web site and sent an e-mail. No answer. What do I have to
do to get my money back? Why doesn't some government stop this
fraud?
</P>
<P>
   _ American Offline
</P>
<P>
   DEAR AMERICAN: And which government would you suggest? China?
Albania? The Duchy of Grand Fenwick? Or how about my personal
favorite, Iraq? At least Saddam wouldn't be too much of a wimp to
use weapons of mass destruction to get your crummy 20 bucks back.
</P>
<P>
   Light an aromatherapy candle and relax, Ace. What we've got here
barely adds up to incompetence, much less fraud. Sure, AOL doesn't
make it easy to quit, but it CAN be done. I was able to quit once
just by leaving voice mail. But they pulled me back in ...
</P>
<P>
   From what you've told me, I'd say you're still a subscriber in
good standing because you never got the opportunity to quit.
Couldn't break through to a support operator after only an hour?
Poor baby. AOL's got about 17 gazillion subscribers and only a
comparative handful of operators to handle the load. And your wife
can't do your waiting for you. How does AOL know she's really your
wife? And e-mail? Forget it unless you have a receipt saying it got
there. Otherwise, you may as well have sent it to Barney the
dinosaur.
</P>
<P>
   Find yourself a comfortable chair and a good book, put on one of
those CDs with ocean sounds, then wait on infinity hold until you
get through to a real, live human being. Life's too short to waste
every day cheesed off at AOL. Uh, oh. What I really meant to say
was, ``That's the only way you're going to be able to deal with
those pinheads.''
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I recently reinstalled Windows 95. Now I find
that the color palette no longer supports 256 colors, which it did
prior to reinstalling.
</P>
<P>
   _ Colorblind
</P>
<P>
   DEAR COLORBLIND: Windows tries its best to identify all your
hardware when it installs itself, but here's a case where it
couldn't figure out what video card you have in your machine.
Instead of a specific video driver, it installed a generic piece of
crud that works, but just barely.
</P>
<P>
   Determine the make and model of your video card, then go to the
manufacturer's Web site for the right driver. If you've got one of
those goofy video cards that's built into the motherboard, go to
the computer maker's site and keep your fingers crossed. Sometimes
they have the individual drivers, but many times they make you
reinstall their complete software setup whether you want to or not.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: You do good work! Too bad the paper won't give
you more space!

   DEAR ANOTHER: Oh, but they do! It's just that what you see is
all that's left over after the editors take their weed-whackers to
things. You guys would have loved the column about sending
anonymous e-mail to Sandra Bullock.

BILL BRADLEY: LIBERAL AND PROUD OF IT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Bradley is a liberal.
</P>
<P>
   Some readers might assume that I offer that description for the
purpose of insulting Bradley, since I'm inclined to disagree with
liberal thinking on most issues. Well, OK _ all issues.
</P>
<P>
   No insult is intended. I'm merely stating what had to be obvious
to anyone who listened to the speech that Bradley delivered the
other day in Crystal City, Mo., as he officially announced his
candidacy for the Democrats' 2000 presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley didn't use the L-word, but he couldn't have made his
views any clearer if he'd taken a deep breath and said: ``I'm a
liberal, and I'm proud of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The former senator and ex-basketball star drew some criticism
for failing to detail specific policy proposals. But I say there
was no need for details. Bradley articulated his philosophy in
general terms; voters are smart enough to figure out what sort of
policies will eventually be embraced by a liberal Democrat who is
concerned about health care, education and campaign finance, among
other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's generalization, in fact, was far more enlightening
than the wear-'em-out-with-details approach that defines the
stealth liberalism of the Clinton-Gore administration. Bill Clinton
and Al Gore have spent two terms bragging about ``reinventing
government'' and boasting that ``the era of big government is
over'' while constantly devising new means of injecting government
into the lives of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Clinton and Gore, Bradley does not feign disdain for a
federal government that he believes can be the driving force in
delivering the American dream to those who have been left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's disdain flows more toward the ``trifling things'' in
which government involves itself, an apparent reference to the
endless parade of small but intrusive programs that have been the
hallmark of the Clinton-Gore years.
</P>
<P>
   It will be interesting to see if Democratic voters are brave
enough to support a candidate who dares to stand on the liberal
principles that its most recent standard-bearers have pushed into
the background. Clinton and Gore are no less liberal than Bradley,
but they have labored tirelessly to create the illusion that they
are centrists.
</P>
<P>
   Having won two presidential elections with this strategy of
deception, will the party of Franklin D. Roosevelt be inclined to
put its beliefs on the line with a ticket headed by the unabashedly
liberal Bradley?
</P>
<P>
   No one could blame the Democrats for playing it safe, for
nominating Gore in the hope that he can replicate the winning
formula of 1992 and '96. But how illuminating it would be for
voters if Bradley were to take on the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Old Party's nominee will be a conservative _ either
runaway front-runner George W. Bush or one of the other would-be
presidents laboring in Bush's shadow. As the greatest nation on
Earth embarks upon a new century and a new millennium, what more
could our people ask for in a presidential election campaign than a
serious debate about the proper role of government in a free
society?
</P>
<P>
   The competition between liberals and conservatives in this
country has too often degenerated into a battle of sound bites. If
the right has succeeded in degrading the word ``liberal,'' well,
the left has likewise done plenty of damage to ``conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   A contest between Bradley and Bush, if these two end up as their
party's nominees, would be an issue-based showdown in which two
honorable and thoughtful individuals could compare and contrast
their ideas in the starkest terms in the most demanding arena
available to those who practice the art and science of politics.
</P>
<P>
   It is entirely possible, of course, that neither side wants
anything to do with such a clear-cut contest of ideas. Countless
politicians, liberals and conservatives alike, have built and
sustained careers by demonizing the opposition and muddling the
differences between the ideologies.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe both sides would rather not know who would prevail if the
voters were truly given a choice.

`LOVE STINKS' COMES OUT SMELLING PRETTY GOOD &HT;     

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JEFF MILLAR 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   So I sat there thinking, ``Every newspaper movie critic in the
First, Second and Third worlds will write corrosive reviews of this
film. You have your reputation to consider. You must write a review
just as negative.''
</P>
<P>
   But then I thought, ``So you write it, and what if the day it
runs, a TV station runs an AMC Studio 30 surveillance tape showing
me laughing at it?''
</P>
<P>
   So, I better come clean. I laughed at ``Love Stinks.'' I moaned,
too, at the flatulence jokes, the enema jokes and the
old-lady-saying-dirty-words shtick. It's that kind of movie. Yes,
sometimes it plays like a low-rent knockoff of The War of the Roses
with hopeless C-list actors. And sometimes it stinks with the flop
sweat of failure. But sometimes it's as bitterly funny as its
makers could hope.
</P>
<P>
   Seth (the notably uncharismatic French Stewart) is on the
writing team of a successful sitcom. At a wedding rehearsal for one
of his writing partners, he encounters interior-decorator Chelsea
(the got-Marilyn-Monroe's-body-but-not-her-talent Bridgette
Wilson).
</P>
<P>
   They split off for some eagerly consensual sex. Which Seth
thinks will be the end of it. But Chelsea has, as she puts it, ``my
mother's biological clock ticking in my body.'' Within hours, she
has resolved to do ``whatever it takes to marry that man.''
</P>
<P>
   And as for Seth?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a man,'' Chelsea says. ``He doesn't know what he feels.''
</P>
<P>
   The next act of the film has white-tail Seth standing frozen in
the headlights of Chelsea's Playboy-fantasy sexuality. She demands
and receives an exclusive relationship. She moves in. She changes
his answering-machine message to include her. She decorates a room
of Seth's house as a nursery. She tells him she loves him. ``So
say, `I love you back,' '' she says. Seth knows that when a woman
says, ``I love you,'' a guy is required to say, ``I love you
back.'' He'd just like to find out ``where'' it's written, so he
can know the exact wording. Chelsea waits, for a length of time and
with a degree of patience she feels reasonable, for Seth to pop the
question.
</P>
<P>
   But Seth doesn't pop the question. Not because he doesn't want
not to get married ever. He's just not comfortable with the idea of
marrying Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   He offers a one-year, live-together deal ``with no credit for
time already served.'' Seth uses humor to deal, forthrightly, with
difficult situations, and Chelsea used to think it was funny.
</P>
<P>
   It's not funny anymore. She delivers an ultimatum. He still
doesn't ask her to marry him.
</P>
<P>
   Then she takes the gloves off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Love Stinks,'' also starring Tyra Banks and Bill Bellamy, was
written by Jeff Franklin, a veteran writer-producer of TV sitcoms.
This is his feature debut.
</P>
<P>
   The film was made quick-and-dirty, as it's called in the trade _
TV lighting, TV pacing, TV directing, TV acting. At its worst, it's
bad TV. But at its best, it's very good TV.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin wrote some high-velocity zingers. And he knows how to
induce audience participation. Expect the audience's laughter to be
in high tones on some jokes and in lower tones on others. You can
call this a date movie, but there's an even chance that the date
might end by somebody walking home.
</P>
<P>
   If this is not the autobiographical, lived-through result of a
man made bitter by experience, its accurate resemblance to it must,
to whatever degree of grudging, be acknowledged as art.

AT 90, SOLOIST HAS A POWERFUL VOICE, YOUTHFUL OUTLOOK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   George Beverly Shea has been one my favorite singers for as long
as I can remember. His powerful rendition of ``How Great Thou Art''
has thrilled millions around the world.
</P>
<P>
   So I was a little in awe last week when I interviewed Shea who,
at 90, still is young at heart and loves to crack jokes about
himself.
</P>
<P>
   And he is still singing.
</P>
<P>
   How do people react when they meet him today?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, the years have been piling up,'' Shea said. ``When some
people see me, they wonder that I'm still going.''
</P>
<P>
   But Shea definitely keeps going. He says his health is ``too
good'' and he continues to be the featured soloist for the Billy
Graham crusades, a job he has held since 1947.
</P>
<P>
   He will be in Texas on Saturday night to receive the Integrity
Award given by Marketplace Ministries, a chaplaincy organization in
Dallas. He's a little embarrassed about getting an award labeled
``integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you live up to that?'' he asked. ``I guess I'd better
watch my step between now and then.''
</P>
<P>
   But Shea, a member of the Gospel Music Association Hall of Fame
and the Religious Broadcasting Hall of Fame, deserves every award
he gets.
</P>
<P>
   The Integrity Award will be coming from one of his old friends,
Gil Stricklin, a member of the Graham crusade team from 1965 to
1970.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bev Shea is a great gentleman and a man of absolute
integrity,'' said Stricklin, whom I knew in his reporting days at
the Star-Telegram. Stricklin is the founder and president of
Marketplace Ministries, which offers chaplaincy services to almost
200 companies and other institutions.
</P>
<P>
   After performing a mini-concert in Dallas when he receives his
award, Shea will sing next week at the dedication of a Presbyterian
church in Asheville, N.C., that is led by the Rev. Ed Graham, Billy
Graham's cousin.
</P>
<P>
   Shea and Billy Graham have been friends since 1943, when Shea
was an announcer on a Chicago radio station. He also sang on a
program called ``Hymns From the Chapel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This young man (Graham), who was a student at Wheaton College,
came to sit in and watch me do my show,'' Shea said. ``He was 21
and I was 31. He was very clean-cut, and there was something
special about him. He was very much a Southern gentleman.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, Shea began his remarkable career as soloist
for Graham's crusades.
</P>
<P>
   Shea, who lives a mile from Billy Graham in Montreat, N.C., said
that he pondered leaving the crusade team about four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought maybe I should just walk off,'' he said. ``But Mr.
Graham's son (Franklin Graham) called me and said he wanted me to
stay as long as his dad was able to preach.''
</P>
<P>
   A good decision. A Billy Graham crusade would not be the same
without Shea's rich baritone filling the air.
</P>
<P>
   What is his favorite song?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an unfair question,'' Shea said. ``But I don't get
tired of `How Great Thou Art.' ''
</P>
<P>
   That magnificent hymn has a special history, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found that song on Oxford Street in London in 1954,'' Shea
said. ``A man walked up and asked us to consider this song, which
was written in Sweden in 1885 and translated by a Londoner from the
Russian version.''
</P>
<P>
   He had the first recording of ``How Great Thou Art.'' Later,
Shea noted, ``everybody recorded it. Elvis (Presley), during his
last years, used it to sign off on his shows.''
</P>
<P>
   Shea didn't plan to be a singer. He was working on Wall Street
in New York for an insurance company when he entered a talent
contest that was a part of comedian Fred Allen's radio show. He
sang the spiritual ``Go Down Moses'' and won second prize.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first prize went to a yodeler,'' Shea remembered.
</P>
<P>
   Shea, at age 23, wrote the music for another of his best-known
songs, ``I'd Rather Have Jesus,'' which is one of my personal
favorites.
</P>
<P>
   Shea was born in Winchester, Ontario, and began singing and
playing the piano at age 10. His mother was his teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just love the old hymns that glorify God,'' Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   How long will he keep singing?
</P>
<P>
   ``I try not to think about that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The longer, the better, as far as I'm concerned.

`STIGMATA' IS REALLY `THE EXORCIST' LITE &HT;     

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JEFF MILLAR 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>

<P>
   (Undated) ``Stigmata'' will certainly jangle you. But sensory
overload _ loud sounds, loud music, loud ``edits'' _ had better be
all that you require of a film. What tiny ideas it has aren't even
its own. This is refried beans without the beans.
</P>
<P>
   Frankie (Patricia Arquette)is a
let's-party-like-it's-the-apocalypse Pittsburgh hairdresser whose
mom, innocently, sends her a souvenir she purchased while touring a
Brazilian village: a rosary.
</P>
<P>
   Hmm, thinks Frankie, an atheist. Then she takes a bath, and
right there in the tub, two of the wounds Jesus suffered upon the
cross _ stigmata _ appear, punctures completely through both her
wrists.
</P>
<P>
   Director Rupert Wainwright renders this MTV style, with
eighth-of-a-second edits, lots of special effects, intercuts with
close-ups of spikes being nailed into Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   Then come more stigmata. Frankie's scalp and forehead start
bleeding (from the crown of thorns) and, most spectacular, on the
subway she endures the guards' scourging: lacerations from unseen
whips appear on her back while the subway roars out of control
through the tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   This comes to the attention of Vatican hoax-buster Father Andrew
(Gabriel Byrne), whom we had seen at the beginning of the film in
the same Brazilian village of the troublesome rosary's origin,
investigating the appearance of blood coming from the eyes of a
statue of the Virgin Mary.
</P>
<P>
   Father Andrew came to the priesthood from organic chemistry. He
could not solve the reason for the beginning of life in the
laboratory; he hopes he can through spiritual understanding. The
Vatican uses him as a debunker of images of the Virgin Mary
appearing on the sides of buildings and the like.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically _ it's the closest thing to anything interesting in
the Tom Lazarus-Rick Ramage screenplay _ Father Andrew is saddened
by every hoax or fantasy he uncovers. He wants to find a miracle.
It's his shadowy Vatican bosses who don't want anything holy
happening outside their control.
</P>
<P>
   Once in Pittsburgh, Father Andrew tries to offer comfort and
understanding to Frankie. Bad news, though. There are five stigmata
in all. No authenticated stigmatic has ever suffered more than two.
</P>
<P>
   Despite having her body pierced by invisible objects _
invariably in public _ Frankie thinks Father Andrew is cute and
puts some heavy moves on him. He resists, with increasing
difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   The narrative is pointed to still more stigmata _ she gets her
feet done while she's trying to have a nice lunch with Father
Andrew _ and an attempted exorcism with extreme prejudice.
</P>
<P>
   The film is executed professionally, notably by cinematographer
Jeffrey L. Kimball and production designer Waldemar Kalinowski. And
lord knows that director Wainwright can splice film.
</P>
<P>
   It's just that for all the film's busyness, nobody has much to
do in this Cliff's Notes version of ``The Exorcist'' or ``The
Omen.'' Byrne is game. Arquette, bless her, spends half the film
trying to come up with new ways of saying ``Ouch.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless you are an admirer of splicing, production design and
cinematography, there's not much point in seeing the film. &QL;

CORNELL GOES FROM GRUNGE TO `EUPHORIA' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Grunge music'' was a term the media used to define Seattle
bands such as Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Soundgarden in the early
'90s. No one ever knew what it meant, not even singer Chris Cornell
of Soundgarden, now embarking on his first solo tour.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Grunge' had no meaning to me at all,'' Cornell said this
week, as he prepared to open at Harvard's Sanders Theatre on Monday
night. ``Using the word `grunge' makes it seem as if we all got
together and came up with the design of a flag and wanted to go out
and conquer the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever grunge was _ and the media generally applied it to
plaid shirts, heavy guitars, and lyrics about dislocation and pain
_ Cornell remained detached, just as he remains today. He's an
aloof observer going about the business of rock 'n' roll.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soundgarden was always a band that appreciated autonomy _ and
anything peripherally going on had nothing to do with us. And
nothing's changed for me in that respect,'' said Cornell, whose
first solo CD, ``Euphoria Morning,'' comes out Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Soundgarden broke up at its peak, in 1997, after selling 10
million albums in 10 years and earning rock-torch-bearer status
with albums such as ``Badmotorfinger'' and ``Superunknown,'' which
spun off the radio/MTV mega-hit ``Black Hole Sun.'' But the band
eventually burned out from touring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a long run together and just decided not to do it
anymore,'' said Cornell, now 35. ``If you're not 100 percent behind
something, you shouldn't do it. . . . But we had gotten along well.
I know musicians who have played for years and haven't found one
person that they can get along with, let alone three. The
friendships in Soundgarden were always very important to us. Our
attitude was that it wouldn't work if we weren't friends outside of
the band.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornell has since moved on psychologically and may only do ``one
Soundgarden song and maybe none'' on tour, where he'll be backed by
the Los Angeles band 11, featuring Alain Johannes and Natasha
Schneider; he recorded the new record at their home studio.
(Cornell knows 11 because the band had opened some shows for
Soundgarden.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in a completely different situation now, so trying to play
songs specific to another band can be inappropriate and
uncomfortable,'' he said, explaining why he's downplaying
Soundgarden material.
</P>
<P>
   ``Euphoria Morning'' is an artistic step forward. It's different
from Soundgarden (``It's much less guitar-oriented and much more
vocal-oriented,'' he said) and more diverse. Cornell ranges into
more Beatles-esque layering and melodies (notably on the single
``Can't Change Me,'' with its signature line, ``She's going to
change the world but she can't change me'') and, on the other end,
soulful vocals echoing one of his earliest influences, Otis
Redding.
</P>
<P>
   It's an album that takes time to grow on a listener, since it's
often so different from his past work, but the rewards are there,
if in a less visceral package than Soundgarden.
</P>
<P>
   There are some characteristically dark Cornell lyrics in
``Follow My Way'' and ``When I'm Down,'' making Cornell chuckle at
the irony of the album's title, ``Euphoria Morning.'' Still,
there's light at the end of the tunnel in the flower-powerish
``Moonchild'' and closing ``Steel Rain,'' about pulling oneself up
from depression. And there's a hauntingly beautiful tribute to
singer/friend Jeff Buckley, who died in a drowning accident in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``The song is a personal reflection of losing someone _ and I
hope it keeps his memory alive,'' said Cornell.
</P>
<P>
   The album is the most personal thing he's done, and surprisingly
has no ``name'' musicians on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to do a special-guest-star solo debut,'' he
said. ``That didn't feel right. I wanted to work with people I
knew. I couldn't imagine writing songs and having someone I didn't
know come in and interpret them.''

 &HT;    You're Mr. Network big shot, TNT's Brad Siegel
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Sept. 12.
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You are Brad Siegel. You met your wife Jill on a blind
date. You called ahead to meet her for drinks, so if you didn't hit
it off, you wouldn't have to suffer through a whole dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Then you had dinner. You and Jill now have an 8-year-old
daughter and twin 7-year-old sons. You also have two dogs, lizards,
fish, a rabbit. Last year one of the dogs chewed up the previous
rabbit, in the back yard, just as you and Jill were leaving your
Buckhead home to attend the Emmy Awards in Los Angeles. One of the
kids saw it and melted right down. Un-you-know-what-believable. It
made for some Emmy night.
</P>
<P>
   But none of that is on your mind right now, despite the family
photos and I Love You Dad artwork stacked around your office at the
Turner corporate campus in Midtown Atlanta. You are Brad Siegel,
mild-looking, ferociously competitive 41-year-old president of TNT,
a billion-dollar cash cow in the Time Warner milking barn. (You
also head Turner Classic Movies, a lesser cow in the same barn.)
You are the nice guy about whom it has been said, as a compliment,
that you don't try to kill an opponent, you try to annihilate him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try not to make enemies,'' you say.
</P>
<P>
   Then you describe how you went after American Movie Classics,
the cable channel you left for Turner, when you launched TCM five
years ago: ``It got very bloody. I like those people so much. But I
had a job to do.''
</P>
<P>
   So the only thing on your mind this morning is the thing on your
mind virtually every morning: the ratings.
</P>
<P>
   TV is plenty of things _ laugh tracks, Nike ads, Jerry Springer,
cable outages, the cheapest baby sitter ever invented _ but mainly
it's ratings. You love them. You have called your relationship with
ratings ``religious.'' A regular at your monthly dinner club, local
ad maven Joel Babbit, says of you, ``In Brad's world, there are
only two buttons on the remote: One would be `on,' and one would be
`TNT.' If Brad comes into your home and the TV is not on TNT, he
asks what's wrong. He really lives TNT.''
</P>
<P>
   You've backed off from that a bit _ at one point last year you'd
kind of wrapped up your whole identity in the ratings, which when
you realized it, sort of weirded you out. But you haven't backed
off all that much.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, they're about winning,'' you say now. ``If you have
ratings that you have to look at all the time, then you should,
like, win.''
</P>
<P>
   This morning's numbers drift across the pages in your hand like
Olympic gymnastics scores tallied by a panel of wildly partisan
judges: 7.2, 5.4, 3.3, 1.5. They represent who watched, and when
they watched, this summer's premiere of ``The Pirates of Silicon
Valley,'' a TNT film about the computer-age race between
Microsoft's Bill Gates and Apple's Steve Jobs.
</P>
<P>
   You were anxious: ``Pirates'' was a high-profile departure for
TNT, an 11-year-old network itchy to chuck its image as the place
to find westerns and Civil War dramas.
</P>
<P>
   But the shift ``Pirates'' represents not only means more
contemporary and expensive movies (Oct. 3's ``Animal Farm,'' a $22
million adaptation of George Orwell's classic novel, is TNT's
costliest film ever). It includes documentaries and series TV, like
``Bull,'' a Wall Street-set drama that's one of 11 series in
development. Your long-range goal is for TNT to be a cable network
whose niche audience is a mass of young suburban baby boomers.
</P>
<P>
   Today's numbers are good. Almost 7 million people watched the
``Pirates'' premiere _ the fourth most-watched cable movie this
year _ with the numbers highest in the biggest markets, where the
more monied, more educated, more advertiser-inveigling viewers you
now want reside.
</P>
<P>
   But the best part? When Ted and Gerry call today _ Ted Turner
and Gerald Levin, Time Warner's high sheriffs and the only two
calls your executive assistant has been instructed to interrupt
your meetings for _ you won't have to dance around their questions.
This will not be one of those days, when you dread the Ted and
Gerry calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those days when you get, `What were you thinking?' or `Why'd
you make that movie?''' you remember, not relishing the memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK,'' you finally tell the programming lieutenant seated
opposite you, officially launching your day's nonstop ant trail of
meetings and phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's go.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuning in
</P>
<P>
   You are Mr. Network Big Shot, a position variously respected,
reviled, feared, parodied and coveted by every shark who's swum in
these seas. Your day goes like this:
</P>
<P>
   It is 9:30 a.m. and you've been here an hour.
</P>
<P>
   When you're in town, you'll often drive the kids to school, then
head to the office. But mostly you're not in town _ you're in New
York or Los Angeles, a consequence of being a Mr. Network Big Shot
in Atlanta. You say you travel a lot. Jill says you travel all the
time.
</P>
<P>
   You are seated at the edge of your seat _ maybe not at the edge,
exactly, but that's the effect, the way you tune in so intently to
whoever's opposite you. You're also not the tallest guy in the
world, so your upright posture appears to give you a better view to
peer through your glasses from behind your big pine desk.
</P>
<P>
   Right now you are tuning into Carl Lindahl, who's in charge of
TNT's nonfiction programming, which mainly means documentaries _
the kind of thing TBS likes to make a splash with, but which you
want to do more of as part of your grand plan to reposition the
network as a more contemporary stop on the dial.
</P>
<P>
   TBS, man. While USA has used WWF wrestling and ``Walker, Texas
Ranger'' reruns to help it reclaim from TNT the title of
highest-rated cable network in prime time, TBS is always right
there, ranking third.
</P>
<P>
   TBS is family, but still ... beat TBS in the ratings and no way
is your day a total bust. The two networks compete vigorously over
programs and movie premieres, even though both are Time Warner
properties housed in the same building (in-house shorthand for the
difference between the two: TNT is Michelob, TBS is Budweiser). You
once described your relationship with TBS President Bill Burke as
brotherly: ``We can fight like crazy, but then it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's what Burke says of you: ``(Brad's) very competitive, and
I am, too. It can be difficult at times when we have to cooperate.
We argue. He loves an argument, to work through things, to
debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Burke says: ``Every day we get the overnight ratings, and I
look at ours first and TNT's second. And I'm not always hoping they
did a great a job.''
</P>
<P>
   Ted Turner weighs in
</P>
<P>
   Ted's on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   You've always been good with Ted. You'll argue with Ted,
challenge Ted, pester Ted to distraction. Ted likes that; it's
Ted-like. It took you a year to sell him on ``In the Heat of the
Night'' reruns, which proved a huge success. He got so tired of you
bringing them up he finally just said, ``Fine!''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he's Ted and you're not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi, Ted. ... Uh, yeah ... yeah ...''
</P>
<P>
   It's 10:57 a.m. You're in the middle of your weekly programming
meeting. Everybody else in the room has shut the-you-know-what up.
</P>
<P>
   Ted's calling about ``Pirates.'' You try to get in a word
edgewise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right ... mm-hmm ... mm-hmm ... right. ...'' You fidget, play
with the ratings sheets. ``Yeah, the response has ... did you ...
uh ... no, I agree ... I think you're right about that.''
</P>
<P>
   No question Ted's a presence in the everyday life of any Mr.
Network Big Shot at Turner, a bigger-than-life boss with
bigger-than life opinions. Fred Siebert, a former Turner underling
now with MTV, recalls Ted appreciating not only your tenacity, but
the way you look at numbers. Like Ted, there's a kind of Tao in the
way you see all the columns on a page as being related, as leading
down a path to form their own beautiful picture, as being things
way beyond things you just crunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' you finally wind down the call with Ted, ``I'm glad we
made it, and you don't have to thank me. Speak to you soon.''
</P>
<P>
   You hang up. It's 11:06. One of the programming guys leans over
from his seat, silently picks up the receiver from the cradle and
then sets it back down.
</P>
<P>
   To make sure it's really hung up and Ted isn't still listening.
</P>
<P>
   A start in entertainment
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a communist,'' you joke about how it's so weird that
you're now a Mr. Network Big Shot, considering the way you once
viewed yourself. ``To me, business was a bad word. I had a thing
against business. I looked down on the kids in business.''
</P>
<P>
   You went to Washington University in St. Louis, an art history
major from Long Island, N.Y. You thought about being a doctor until
you got on the school activities staff and spent more time
promoting events than studying organic chemistry. You'd caught the
promoter's bug in high school, where you once brought Harry Chapin
in to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what bit me more than anything,'' you recall. ``I was
are recruited to make an entertainment TV network that would be
beamed into college towns around the country. You wrote the
business plan for National College TV; a friend got you some
business plans and said, ``Here's what you have to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Then you hit the road. Visited hundreds of campuses, installed
dishes, produced concerts. You also worked at a bar four nights a
week. To make rent.
</P>
<P>
   It was a string of 15-hour days and it was a ball. You liken it
to working for an Internet start-up today. You supplied 20 hours of
original programming a week to 450 colleges and cable systems: Devo
live in 3D, the Who's final American concert. Some programs were
shot right in the office; everybody had to be real quiet at their
desks when a camera rolled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very much like, `Hey, let's make a show!''' recalls
Andrea Taylor, who works for you as TNT's head of creative
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were zealots and I was the ringleader,'' you recall. ``We
were creating a basic cable network under everyone's nose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still look at myself as an outsider,'' you add. ``As big as
a business like this is, you still need the culture to be able to
attract creative, smart people who are looking for a place that's
different than IBM. Since I've never been corporate, I don't even
know how to run a business like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The art of the deal
</P>
<P>
   You're on a conference call with your L.A. people. Your two
programming chiefs out there are talking about landing Matthew
Broderick for a movie about the Nuremberg trials. They already have
Alec Baldwin.
</P>
<P>
   Bob DeBitetto: ``You aware of the price for Broderick?''
</P>
<P>
   You: ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   DeBitetto: ``It's seven figures.''
</P>
<P>
   Hmmm. ...
</P>
<P>
   You: ``Do we have a number? An up-to-this number?''
</P>
<P>
   Julie Weitz: ``We have a number, because we can't pay him more
than Alec Baldwin.''
</P>
<P>
   DeBitetto: ``Whatever we pay, there's going to be breakage.''
</P>
<P>
   Breakage: The amount an item will push a project over budget.
</P>
<P>
   You: ``How much breakage?''
</P>
<P>
   DeBitetto: ``At least $550,000 breakage.''
</P>
<P>
   Hmmm. ...
</P>
<P>
   You to Weitz: ``I'll talk to you separately later.''

   ATLANTA: to you separately later.''
</P>
<P>
   A very hands-on manager
</P>
<P>
   Gerry's on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excuse me one second,'' you tell your 12:30, seated across
from you. It's 12:55. ``There are two calls I need to take today,
and this is one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Ted, Gerald Levin, ruler of the Time Warner roost, is
calling about ``Pirates.'' With Gerry, it's all about growing and
repositioning the brand. Since Turner became a cog of Time Warner
in 1996, the pressure to grow and reposition has been ramped way,
way up.
</P>
<P>
   When you were hired at Turner in 1993, a pre-Time Warner era,
you were not a conventional TV suit. Scott Sassa, the TNT president
who hired you and who's now NBC's West Coast president, remembers
liking that about you. Sassa hired you because you were real smart,
real aggressive (he won't even let his comments on how aggressive
you are go on the record, that's how aggressive) and real
detail-oriented.
</P>
<P>
   You allow that you are ``hands on'' _ quaint phrase coming from
your mouth. You have your hands on everything at TNT (and to a
slightly lesser extent at TCM), from what movies get made to what
the press releases say about them. Sassa remembers spotting you on
a plane once marking comments on each page of a script. ``What're
you going to do, produce this thing?'' he joked.
</P>
<P>
   Later, to underscore his point, Sassa told you, ``If I managed
you the way you manage people, you'd quit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people would feel he micromanages,'' Scot Safon, TNT's
ponytailed marketing boss, freely admits. ``I've heard that
grumbling: `God, he cares about every little thing. I can't believe
it.' Some people would feel he absolutely steps over that line.''
</P>
<P>
   Except even most of those who think you step over that line
don't mind. ``I wouldn't trade it,'' says Safon. People see your
micro ... um, hands-on management style as your effort to help
them, not make them look bad. Staffers feel free to argue with you.
They don't even sense much ego. It's as if you were still running
that college network.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor says you're virtually the same person now that you were
then, except then you ``stayed up later and didn't get up as
early.'' In the old days, she says, you'd be dancing on a table.
``Now he dances on a dance floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how big the job gets, he sees himself as a regular
person, a regular viewer. That's what makes TNT work.''
</P>
<P>
   Uh-huh. But Gerry's on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``This movie serves our purpose in the repositioning of TNT,''
you say into the receiver. You go on. Above expectations
blah-blah-blah, the upfront is phenomenal blah-blah, thank you for
the call blah.
</P>
<P>
   You hang up. You turn your attention back to your 12:30, Michael
Nozik, president of Robert Redford's film production company. He's
here to explore your interest in making movies based on rights
Redford owns to a series of Tony Hillerman novels: rural-set
mysteries whose lead investigators are Native American.
</P>
<P>
   It's the kind of pitch TNT would have eaten up a couple of years
ago. But now you're not so sure. In your new ``repositioning,'' it
needs tweaking.
</P>
<P>
   But even that gets tricky. Ted is a good friend of Redford's,
whose representative is seated right in front of you.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows I'm talking to you,'' Nozik says of Redford, ``so I
wouldn't be surprised if he doesn't drop a line to his friend
Ted.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd appreciate it if he didn't do that,'' you say. ``Ted has
such an ... affinity for Indian projects. It adds a level of ...
complexity.''
</P>
<P>
   Nozik, shrugging: ``But I can't tell him not to.''
</P>
<P>
   You, smiling, sort of. ``Nor can I.''
</P>
<P>
   Some rare quiet
</P>
<P>
   It's 5:15. Tracy Snyder, your executive assistant, hands you a
list of calls you need to make.
</P>
<P>
   You look puzzled for a second. Then ask, ``It is tomorrow I go
to New York? Or Thursday?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   The day's been typical. Dozens of phone calls, nearly a dozen
meetings, lunch in the Turner cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   You put out some fires. Called a guy at A&AMP;E to see if they're
airing a BBC movie similar to one you just finished shooting. (``I
don't expect you to do anything to compromise your position
competitively, but if you are, let me know, so I know to be angry
at you.'') Approved an ad for ``Animal Farm,'' the $22 million
movie you call the biggest challenge since you came to TNT.
Discussed with TCM's general manager whether film host Bob Osborne
should ditch the tie, to loosen him up a little for viewers.
(``Make him wear business casual.'')
</P>
<P>
   Snyder jams a half-dozen folders into your briefcase. You never
get to your paperwork at the office; you'll do it at home later.
</P>
<P>
   You get into your dark green BMW convertible (300 series), where
you finish making your West Coast calls during the 15-minute drive
home. You arrive there about 6:30, an hour earlier than usual. Only
the dogs are there to greet you. Jill took the kids swimming.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the rare quiet moments here,'' you say, walking
past an art collection that ranges from Radcliffe Bailey to pieces
done by friends. You take the dogs out back and toss them a ball.
``I generally don't know what to do with myself when I get home
this early, other than get on a phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Usually you play with the kids for an hour before they go to bed
at 8:30, eat dinner with Jill around 9, then work in your office
until at least 11. Says TBS' Burke, ``Nobody's going to outwork
Brad.'' But Josh Sapan, who as president of Rainbow Media, AMC's
parent, has competed with and against you, says you're actually
pretty balanced. ``(Brad) has a loving wife and family and a great
sense of humor,'' Sapan says. ``He understands the world is
round.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know another life separate from business,'' you allow.
``It's not like I have a million friends I hang out with. My
friends will tell you I never go out. It's business, and then
whatever I do at home. Work is very consuming for me, and I allow
it to be. I'm in a phase where I can be. If it starts to hurt the
family, I'll change things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends can't understand how I live my life without my
husband,'' says Jill, 39, who used to work in the fashion industry
in New York. ``It comes with the territory. I never had a negative
attitude about it. I pushed him to go for it. I push him a lot. I'm
all for him building his career and going as far as he can. This is
our life.''
</P>
<P>
   You don't know, or don't let on, about your future. Everybody in
the industry agrees it's bright. You seem as secure at Turner as
anybody, but working in Ted's shadow has frustrated more than one
alumnus. Certainly cable has become a breeding ground for heads of
broadcast networks (Sassa at NBC, Doug Herzog coming to Fox from
Comedy Central) eager to slow their declines by applying some of
cable's secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Jill and the kids arrive; it's not quiet any more. You walk a
guest to the door, repeating something you said earlier _ that you
really have it down now, this getting home by 7:30. Then you say,
``Kinda sick, huh?''
</P>
<P>
   No. But kinda interesting you asked. ``Classic Brad,'' Cartoon
Network president Betty Cohen says of the way you reassess
yourself. ``He asks if something is a weakness and relies on people
to tell him. And people feel comfortable telling him.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that says more about you than the ratings. Maybe.

US NEEDS TO TAKE ACTION IN INDONESIA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, September 12, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The United States just sent Air Force One to the South Pacific.
We should be sending one of our 12 aircraft carriers instead.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to actually invade an archipelago to exercise a
little military muscle. And nothing concentrates the mind of
military adventurers like the arrival offshore of a flight deck
full of F-16's.
</P>
<P>
   B.J. Habibie, the hapless president of Indonesia, the world's
fourth-most-pupulous nation, saw the trouble coming. There will be
civil war in East Timor, he predicted to visitors months ago, no
matter which way the referendum vote goes.
</P>
<P>
   But the recent vote for independence triggered what's starting
to smell like some sort of rolling military coup by generals
fearing the breakup of the sprawling island empire. And the Army
strongman pulling the only strings that now count, General Wiranto,
may be the only man who can stop the bloodletting in East Timor, if
in fact he still controls his troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Genocide,'' says Roman Catholic Bishop Carlos Belo, driven at
gunpoint from his home by a militia gang. Only armed United Nations
intervention will ``save what can be saved.''
</P>
<P>
   ``An orgy of looting, burning, and killing,'' UN Secretary
General Kofi Annan called it. Twenty thousand at least have already
been slain in the anarchic sacking of Dili, the capital, says a
Catholic aid agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ethnic cleansing'' is what the military rampage is called by
Jose Ramos-Horta, who shared the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize for East
Timor's independence effort with Bishop Belo.
</P>
<P>
   Wiranto plays a cute game, pretending his military is not
countenancing the slaughter. Like Saddam Hussein, like the North
Korean oligarchs, like the dreamy desert despot in Libya, the
generals at the head of Indonesia's 400,000-man military
establishment seem to be another collection of ambitious schemers
with shiny boots and lots of gold braid, who pride themselves on
knowing just how far the outside world can be goaded before one has
to rein in on murderous tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   On the BBC, they are comparing the sacking of Dili to the
ghastly purge of Cambodia orchestrated by the Khmer Rouge, when
they took their land back to ``The Year One,'' by slaughtering
doctors, teachers, clergy, anyone who owned a pair of eyeglasses or
a book, signs of dangerous and infectious intellectuality.
</P>
<P>
   There is vast and proper reluctance by the military powers with
the wherewithal to approach East Timor in a lock-and-load frame of
mind. Clearly the idea of outside military invasion of Indonesia's
breakaway half-island of East Timor to prevent massacre is a large
step. Perhaps too large. Wiranto has a modern army and an officer
corps willing and in some cases too eager to shed civilian blood.
</P>
<P>
   But we have to weigh the advantages of doing naught but
handwringing against the costs of sitting idly by. Bloodshed on a
vast scale has a depressing effect on the rest of the planet. It
gives too many other tinpot tyrants the wrong idea. It suggests to
the more bloodthirsty among the rulers of the world's backwaters
that they too can act with impunity.
</P>
<P>
   We saw what that kind of hands-off approach got us in Rwanda:
800,000 dead, murdered barbarously, with machetes and rocks and
sharp sticks. Their slaughter laid down a whole fresh generation of
retribution and revenge.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who flew aboard Air Force One to New Zealand
for the Asia-Pacific economic summit, is now getting heat from the
pope. There was the hint of a call for military intervention Friday
when the Vatican issued a condemnation of the military's
``murderous and destructive'' campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is also my heartfelt wish that as soon as possible
Indonesia and the international community will put an end to the
slaughter and find effective ways to meet the legitimate
aspirations of the Timorese population,'' said the pope in a
statement. But as Stalin (``How many divisions has the pope?'') so
helpfully pointed out, the Pope doesn't command any outfit more
heavily armed than the Swiss Guards. He depends upon temporal
powers to pack a wallop.
</P>
<P>
   And for the temporal powers, the question is: How do you insert
a token military force to stop the rampage in East Timor without
triggering a wider conflict with the Indonesian army?
</P>
<P>
   There are considerable resources in the military of the world's
fourth-largest nation, if you can call this assemblage of 200-plus
million people strung across 13,000 islands a nation. We should
know; we helped arm, train, and organize them.
</P>
<P>
   Australia is ready to send 4,000 soldiers to stock the pillage
and plunderering, but wants us to ride shotgun. Annan says New
Zealand, Malaysia, and the Phillipines are willing to send
soldiers, too.
</P>
<P>
   There are fewer people in all of East Timor (800,000 before the
bloodletting started) than are walking around Boston at noon on a
weekday. And the United States currently has a dozen aircraft
carriers in service: Can we not spare one?
</P>
<P>
   Truman's line was ``The buck stops here.'' Couldn't we send one
little old carrier, and a few missile cruisers, and a couple of
nuclear subs and ring up General Wiranto, and say something like,
``The bloodletting stops here _ or else?''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration quite rightly is cautious. After
Kosovo, Iraq, Haiti, and Somalia, our military escapading requires
caution, intelligence, seasoned analysis. But we have learned a
number of post-Cold War lessons since the Berlin Wall fell and the
world's bipolar construction metastasized into the confused and
confusing situation we face today.
</P>
<P>
   I buy the argument, advanced by the French, among others, that
if we'd landed four or five thousand armed and angry soldiers in
Rwanda, we'd have scared away enough of the bad guys to forestall
the massive massacres that ensued.
</P>
<P>
   We finally sent the 82d Airborne into Haiti with orders to
``come in hot,'' and the previous military dictatorship folded at
the news the paratroopers were in the air. The fact that Haiti has
been unable to get its act together since then is no reason to
relax any military pressure on Wiranto's army.
</P>
<P>
   We should threaten, bluster, and pull the plug on all the money
the World Bank and IMF feeds into Indonesia's corrupt economic
system. There's a $43 billion bailout package stalled by this. And
we can and should step up military pressure. You don't have to
formally invade a place to make an impression on the people with
the guns.
</P>
<P>
   It's like the old parable of the farmer with the mules and the
two-by-four; sometimes you just need to get their attention.
</P>

LEGALLY BLIND SHOP OWNER CITED FOR SELLING TOBACCO TO MINOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KIMBERLY A.C. WILSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ When a young man sauntered in to buy a pack of
cigarettes just before closing time, Dennis Noyes couldn't make out
the date on the ID card he displayed.
</P>
<P>
   So he bluffed, ringing up the Camel filters anyway and betting
that no minor would be gutsy enough to try to buy cigarettes in a
store that usually swarms with uniformed police officers, robed
jurists and pinstriped attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   It was a bad bet.
</P>
<P>
   Noyes got stung by a $150 ticket for selling tobacco products
that cold January afternoon to the teenager, who turned out to be a
15-year-old working undercover.
</P>
<P>
   Now Noyes, the 40-year-old legally blind owner of a snack shop
on the ground floor of the King County Courthouse, believes he was
unfairly targeted because of his condition. And his pro bono
attorney is fighting the citation as discriminatory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like they tried to set up the blind guy,'' lawyer Jeff
Smyth said Thursday as he prepared for a hearing on the case later
this month.
</P>
<P>
   Noyes' vision is limited to shapes, outlines and degrees of
light. But blind or not, every merchant is required to abide by a
six-year-old Washington state law that prohibits the sale of
tobacco to minors, said Greg Hewett, coordinator of the
Seattle-King County Department of Health's Youth Tobacco Prevention
Project.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should be no exception for this owner because he's
located in the courthouse or because of his situation. Parents were
calling us to complain that the courthouse is an easy hit for kids.
We know, because we check it,'' Hewett said.
</P>
<P>
   A parent's complaint prompted the sting on Dennis' Snack Shop,
Hewett said.
</P>
<P>
   One minute before closing time, when the shop was deserted, a
youth tobacco project representative sent in an underage teen to
try to buy the Camels.
</P>
<P>
   Noyes asked for a valid ID, figuring the teen would balk if he
were underage. Instead, the teen handed over a laminated card.
Unable to read the fine print, Noyes bluffed and made change for
the cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Noyes said he regrets his actions _ and the timing of the sting.
</P>
<P>
   ``People down here watch out for me. If (this) had taken place
when people were around, I would have asked someone to read the
date on his ID,'' Noyes said Thursday during an afternoon lull.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime customers and sheriff's deputies are accustomed to
Noyes' request to verify the date of birth on a driver's license or
state-issued ID card, Smyth said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is enforcement in that building. So, unless you're a
real dumb kid, you're not going to walk inside and buy cigarettes
from him,'' the lawyer added.
</P>
<P>
   But Mark Alstead of the Health Department said it's the
merchant's responsibility to check a cigarette buyer's age. ``It's
incumbent on the merchant that they be equipped to comply with the
law,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Noyes is equipped.
</P>
<P>
   In the nine months since the citation, a first violation of the
tobacco law, friends and advocates for the blind chipped in to buy
him a powerful magnifier.
</P>
<P>
   The device, which resembles a computer monitor, allows Noyes to
make the print on an ID more than an inch high.
</P>
<P>
   Noyes stands trial Sept. 23 for the citation, a gross
misdemeanor.
</P>
<P>
   If he loses, Noyes will have a mark on his record. He could lose
his state license to sell tobacco if he has two more violations in
as many years.
</P>
<P>
   With cigarette sales making up about a quarter of his profit,
``losing his license would be the kiss of death,'' Smyth said.

champion, is a wide-open race and for the first time in ages the

Bill Parcells appears to be pointing to winning it all this year,
motivated in part perhaps, by the knowledge that with the team for
sale this could be his final season as coach. By Mike Freeman.

retirement. He led them to a 15-1 record last season and is primed

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   FBN-NEW-COACHES (Undated) _ In a season of wide-ranging coaching

<P>
   NEW YORK _ If Buddy Hackett had ever laid eyes on the likes of
Serena Altschul, Lulu de Kwiatkowski and Alexandra Von Furstenberg
before, he wasn't showing it at Moomba last Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are the most beautiful girl I've ever seen!'' the
75-year-old comedian told Ms. Altschul, the MTV news reader and
celebutante. A few minutes later, Hackett threatened a heart attack
if introduced to any more of the hothouse beauties assembled by the
party's hostess, Liz Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   The party was a publicity event for ``Action,'' a new television
series savaging the movie business (starting on Sept. 16, on Fox).
Hackett is in the cast. So are Jay Mohr and Illeana Douglas, who
were also at Moomba for the screening and dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Thompson, the show's writer and a co-executive producer,
looked around at the 40 or 50 magazine editors, gossip columnists
and creme des les femmes of young New York society, and asked,
``Who (italics)are(end italics) these people?''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, this guy's from out of town.
</P>
<P>
   These aren't just people. These are Liz Cohen's people, the
expensively underdressed blondish ones, anyway. The ``Action''
party was really a Liz Cohen party _ her first big one since she
jumped last month from one New York publicity agency to its arch
rival. Her night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at me, I'm actually working!'' Ms. Cohen exclaimed after
setting up a paparazzi moment starring Mohr and two of her friends:
Ms. de Kwiatkowski and Samantha Boardman.
</P>
<P>
   The September issue of Hamptons Country magazine describes Ms.
Cohen _ who says she is 29 but feels 26 _ as ``a mega-superflak.''
But she doesn't consider herself one. She gives parties. For her
friends. For a living.
</P>
<P>
   Her current boss, Lizzie Grubman, lured Ms. Cohen away from the
Harrison &AMP; Shriftman agency by either doubling or tripling her
salary (depending on who's talking) and doing the same for her
assistant, Jessica Meisels.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cohen won't say what she's making, but said that the
defection was a ``business decision.'' Although she grew up among
the children of New York's seriously loaded class, her parents _ a
marketing consultant and a psychologist _ are merely well off. With
her new salary, Ms. Cohen is at least holding her own.
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad arrangement for someone who is, by her own admission,
``a bad publicist.'' When she met a reporter for breakfast, she was
chaperoned by another publicity agent from Ms. Grubman's office,
``to make sure I don't say anything wrong,'' Ms. Cohen explained.
</P>
<P>
   She hates pitching clients to the press and prefers to think of
herself as an ``event planner.'' Read: hostess. Her Rolodex is
built on a lifetime of organizing dinners out and elaborately
themed birth parties, and booking VIP rooms.
</P>
<P>
   She is also a conduit between coltish clothes horses in her
social world and editors who put their pictures in the
who's-wearing-what pages of Vogue or Harper's Bazaar.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my best friend, Lulu,'' Ms. Cohen said at the party,
embracing Ms. de Kwiatkowski. An artist with a shy, beguiling
smile, Ms. de Kwiatkowski was one of the many ``best friends'' Ms.
Cohen presented that night. Touching and squeezing, she treats
greeting as a contact sport.
</P>
<P>
   Her most violent gesture of affection is a face-pushing thing
that involves reaching out and covering the mouth of someone who
has just said something that she either loves or hates. A summer
camp kind of interaction.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of these frequently photographed young women, Ms. de
Kwiatkowski, whose father is a polo-playing aircraft broker, swore
she never goes out. ``But Liz calls and says, `Be here at
such-and-such a time,''' Ms. de Kwiatkowski said, with a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Boardman, another heiress-intimate of Ms. Cohen's, also
follows Ms. Cohen's marching orders. ``She cracks the whip and we
show up,'' said Ms. Boardman, who looks more like Jennifer Love
Hewitt's slightly older sister than the third-year medical student
she is.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Teetering toward the bar in her Manolos, Ms. Cohen lunged at
Donovan Leitch, the downtown club scene's answer to, well, Donovan
( Leitch's father). ``This is my next project!'' she announced.
``He is just so (italics)authentic.(end italics) There's something
to be said for people who are authentic, don't you think? You know,
people who aren't from Minnesota and trying really hard. Donovan's
from (italics)New York.''(end italics) She said those last two
words with a finality that suggested inconceivability of his being
from anywhere else, even though Leitch is from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serena I've known for 15 years,'' she said of Ms. Altschul.
``Donovan I've known for 15 years. Noah, how long have I known you:
15, 16 years?'' she said to Noah Bogen, who works in film.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cohen attended both public and private schools, where she
said teachers threw chalk at her head for socializing, not
studying. She graduated from York Prep ``by the skin of my teeth,''
and went to Emerson College before club owners began recruiting her
to furnish their VIP rooms with decorative debutantes.
</P>
<P>
   Her newest new best friend at the ``Action'' party was James
Truman, the editorial director of Conde Nast and a ruthless arbiter
of pop-cultural cool. His presence confirmed both Ms. Cohen's
stature as a wrangler of A-list guests and Truman's current
fascination with Ms. Cohen's crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we should call James (italics)Jameson!''(end italics)
Ms. Cohen declared, sitting very close to this famously aloof
Englishman.
</P>
<P>
   It was the sort of inane outburst that Ms. Cohen somehow manages
to make sound charming. Like singing along when ``All You Need Is
Love'' comes over the sound system. Or introducing two journalists
with less than nothing in common _ Plum Sykes, a Vogue writer, and
a male newspaper reporter _ by predicting: ``The two of you are
going to collaborate. You're going to write a poem _ together!''
</P>
<P>
   Truman offered a theory on Ms. Cohen. ``For our generation,
access and mobility though the worlds of fashion and money and
celebrity was through journalism,'' he said. ``For Liz's
generation, it's publicity.''
</P>
<P>
   Arguably, Ms. Cohen already had access and mobility. She was a
bridesmaid for Ginny Bond Donahue, a New York beauty who is the
daughter of a retired Texas oilman; the maid of honor for Samantha
Kluge, the daughter of the billionaire John W. Kluge, and a regular
at Miller sisters weddings.
</P>
<P>
   As the party closed down _ Truman and Ms. Boardman were among
the last to leave _ Ms. Cohen headed to Halo, a basement club
around the corner on Grove Street. The regular Moomba crowd was
filling up the top floor, and a perky young woman wearing a black
T-shirt that said ``Hustler'' in glittery letters jumped up from
her table to say hi to Ms. Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   It was Nikki Bokal, an aspiring actress who lives in Los Angeles
but grew up in New York, in one of the many circles that intersect
with Ms. Cohen's. She was sitting at a crowded table that included
Nicky Hilton, whose sweet-16 is still a recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. Cohen's contemporaries age, marry and drop out of the
night life, these youngsters are the up-and-comers she needs to
cultivate. The same Hamptons Country magazine article that called
Ms. Cohen a mega-superflak has a shot of her on Ms. Von
Furstenberg's Southampton beachfront posing in the sand with many
of her friends, among them Samantha and Charlotte Ronson _ siblings
of the moment in the junior-junior jet set.
</P>
<P>
   Halo was filled with their generation, 23-year-olds killing time
until their lives begin. Ms. Cohen's boyfriend of eight years,
Dylan Brown, whom she described variously as ``Waspy'' and her
``pretty boy,'' was already there.
</P>
<P>
   She asked him to fetch a round of drinks. He complained that he
didn't have any ``juice'' at this club, meaning he'd have to pay
for the drinks, and tried to get her to hit up the owner, Karim
Amatullah. Amatullah was the one who had let her past the velvet
rope. It was no problem getting in. She's known him since they were
4.

FOR INSTANT ARISTOCRACY AND A CALMING EFFECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., Sept. 12)

 By MARTY ROSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I planted a couple of boxwoods in my garden in Kansas City this
spring, and they immediately seemed to send down roots into the Old
World.
</P>
<P>
   An extraordinary dignity attaches to these slow-growing
evergreen shrubs with their dark but glowing little leaves, and my
wild garden of hollyhocks, black-eyed Susans and woodland
wildflowers was subtly and forever calmed and civilized. My tousled
young boxwoods may never see the hedge shears, but for thousands of
years, at one time and place or another, boxwoods (often known
simply as box) have been pruned into fantastic living sculptures of
hunting hounds, gigantic teapots, armchairs, chessmen, cones, cubes
and spheres large and small.
</P>
<P>
   Drawings in an Egyptian tomb appear to depict a formal garden
edged with boxwood 6,000 years ago. In Elizabethan times, a
nurseryman advertised boxwood topiary for sale, including a
well-pruned specimen of ``St. George in box: his arm scarce long
enough, but will be in condition to stick the dragon by next
April.''
</P>
<P>
   Formal clipped box may appear a little stiff and reserved, but
it is one of the pleasures of boxwood to run your hands over the
tightly trimmed surfaces, to pat it, to reach into it and give the
branches a friendly shake. Unpruned boxwood grows naturally into
handsome mounds, columns and pyramids, and it is a comfortable
thing to brush past the shrubs on one's way about the garden.
</P>
<P>
   Boxwood's pale yellow wood is extremely fine-grained and heavy;
my favorite kitchen spoon is of box. Homer wrote in the ``Iliad''
that the horses pulling the war chariot of Priam, king of Troy,
strained against a yoke of boxwood. The Greeks and Romans made
their flutes of boxwood, and combs and false teeth were once carved
of box.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 90 species and 200 cultivated varieties of the
genus Buxus, native to Central and South America, Europe, Asia and
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The best-known species, Buxus sempervirens, known as common box,
was first formally described by Linnaeus in 1753. Long before that,
plants, cuttings and roots were brought to the Americas by English,
Dutch, French and Spanish colonists to separate the gardens of the
advancing civilization from the wilderness. By one account, boxwood
was first planted on Long Island in 1652.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 100 varieties of Buxus sempervirens are recognized today.
Two of them _ Suffruticosa (true dwarf box, also known as English
box) and Arborescens (true tree box, also called American box) _
are the most widely grown. Dwarf box grows only about an inch a
year and is easy to keep neatly trimmed, but when it is neglected
it becomes a fantastic cloud of well-rooted green cumulonimbus,
growing in time to five feet. Tree box has a looser structure and
grows much larger, to perhaps 15 feet in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Little-leaf box (B. microphylla), introduced from Japan in 1860,
is the second most important boxwood species; about 20 cultivated
varieties have been registered. These dense shrubs have tiny
leaves, sometimes no more than one-third of an inch long. A fine
mature specimen of the variety Green Pillow grows to the size of an
enormous fluffed-up cushion, 30 inches high and 40 inches wide, in
30 years. Compacta, another genial little-leaf box, grows as dense
as a bunch of curly parsley, so tight and hard that it must be
touched to be fully appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   Boxwoods tend to be most impressive in old gardens. George
Washington grew ``great billowy masses'' of boxwood at Mount
Vernon, ``long, undulating, fragrant sweeps of that deep, green
verdure that the Colonists loved so well,'' Albert Addison Lewis
writes in ``Boxwood Gardens Old and New,'' published in 1924.
Robert E. Lee also grew up in the dignified presence of boxwood
hedges. Lewis writes that at the Lee family's home, Stratford Hall,
above the Potomac River near Montross, Va., ``in the perfumed
privacy of beautiful box-edged winding paths, the handsome little
boy walked daily with his invalid mother, talking solemnly with her
of the Lee ideals of right and duty and chivalry.''
</P>
<P>
   Photographs in the book show boxwoods the size of cars, their
roots wrapped in gigantic burlap bundles, loaded on massive
wooden-wheeled nursery wagons _ instant aristocracy for gardeners
with money but not much family history. One-gallon pots are the
norm today, and the selection is expanding as hybridizers introduce
hardy new varieties.
</P>
<P>
   Early spring and early fall are the best times to plant
boxwoods. They must be planted carefully, with the crown of the
plant (just above where the roots and stem meet) slightly above the
level of the surrounding soil. Give them a spot in morning sun or
in bright shade, protected from desiccating winter winds, in
well-drained soil. They appreciate a light compost mulch, an inch
or two deep. Water throughly but not too often, and let them be.
Boxwoods are not meant to grow quickly, and healthy plants in an
appropriate situation should not need fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
   Even a few small boxwoods have a pleasing effect from the start,
polishing up an informal garden and setting the tone in a formal
one.
</P>
<P>
   A sensitive English social agitator, William Cobbett, who
published under the name of Peter Porcupine at the end of the 18th
century, wrote of box: ``If there be a more neat and beautiful
thing in the world, all I can say is, that I never saw that
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Boxwood Society, P.O. Box 85, Boyce, Va. 22620,
publishes a Boxwood Buyer's Guide ($6), listing 92 sources for
about 100 species and varieties. One mail-order source with a large
selection of boxwood cultivars is Wavecrest Nursery in Fennville,
Mich. (616-543-4175); catalog $1.

<HEADLINE>
AN EPIC NOVEL PUTS NEWFOUNDLAND ON THE LITERARY MAP  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MEL GUSSOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When it was suggested to Wayne Johnston that his new
book, ``The Colony of Unrequited Dreams,'' may be the Great
Newfoundland Novel, a smile crossed the author's face. ``Is that an
oxymoron?'' he wondered during a recent interview here. For this
41-year-old Canadian, his birthplace _ a former British colony and
since 1949 a province of Canada _ ``may not be big, but the
struggle is heroic.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``The Great Newfoundland Novel is like the Great
American Novel: it never will exist. It's just something to shoot
for.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Newfoundland, the label implies that the book is
only for people from that place. As reviewers in the United States
and Canada have realized, anyone can enjoy it, even those without a
knowledge of the province's history, or those who mispronounce its
name. It's NewfoundLAND.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colony of Unrequited Dreams'' (Doubleday) is the first of
Johnston's five books to be published in the United States. It will
be followed soon by his third, ``The Divine Ryans'' (the movie
version, with a screenplay by the author, is scheduled to open this
fall). The new novel is by far the longest and most ambitious of
his works.
</P>
<P>
   A contemporary historical novel, ``Colony'' is the richly
layered story of two outsiders in a remote land searching for its
identity. With some of the feeling of a 19th-century novel, it
captures both the beauty and the bleakness of this island off the
coast of Labrador.
</P>
<P>
   The protagonist and narrator is a real person, Joe Smallwood,
the first premier of Newfoundland when it became a Canadian
province. Smallwood was born in 1900 and the book spans most of the
20th century. To American readers, he is as unknown as any governor
of a small state during his period, but he was a pivotal figure in
the history of his country. As Johnston said, ``When I was growing
up, he was a legend, an incredibly dynamic character.''
</P>
<P>
   A failure as a young journalist, Smallwood eventually became a
highly successful politician and a leader of the movement to join
the Canadian confederacy. In his early days as a labor organizer
and politician, he walked across Newfoundland, visiting every
railroad outpost along the way, and then he walked back home. It
took him more than two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was an amazing accomplishment,'' Johnston said, and it
endeared him to the public. ``The character in the book has an epic
sense of the world and of himself as he struggles to live up to it.
That's why I find Smallwood to be so emblematic of Newfoundland:
this sense of near nationhood _ near everything. If one or two
things had been different, it could have made it as a country. That
sense of loss lives on in the people who live there.'' The
fictional Smallwood's first words are, ``I am a Newfoundlander,'' a
conscious emulation of the first line of ``The Adventures of Augie
March,'' in which Saul Bellow's title character begins, ``I am an
American.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnston said that his Smallwood is true to the basic facts,
with one notable exception: the character of Shelagh Fielding, the
woman who shadows him throughout the book and is for a long time
his unacknowledged love. Fielding, as she is called, is an
extraordinarily vivid and independent woman _ and she almost walks
away with the novel.
</P>
<P>
   The two are friends _ and rivals _ since their childhood, when
they are involved in an episode that haunts them forever.
</P>
<P>
   Something similar happens in ``Fifth Business,'' by Robertson
Davies, a fellow Canadian to whom Johnston has often been compared.
In common, their novels deal with tumultuous, often comic events in
the lives of colorful characters.
</P>
<P>
   Physically and temperamentally, Smallwood and Fielding are
opposites. He is an incarnation of his name: small, wiry and often
a Zelig-like apparition in other people's lives. ( Johnston said
that at a certain age Woody Allen would have been perfect casting.)
Fielding is tall and somewhat ungainly, and as a kind of signature
carries a cane. She is bold and outspoken, a skeptic in contrast to
his role as a soapbox orator. Her character is inspired by several
people in Smallwood's life and also by her namesake, Henry
Fielding. As in Fielding's ``Tom Jones,'' her wry commentary _ and
her condensed history of Newfoundland _ enlivens the narrative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed a voice to balance Smallwood,'' Johnston said, ``and
Fielding was a bit of a gift.'' One night while working he was
looking at a photograph in an encyclopedia, a picture of the
graduating class in a girl's school in the early part of this
century. A student in the back row had ``a very evocative look.''
That was the first image for Fielding, and he kept the book open to
that page while he created the character.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston's interest in Smallwood began when he was a teen-ager
in the tiny town of Goulds, outside St. Johns. As a student at
Catholic schools, he was encouraged to become a priest. (``The
Divine Ryans'' is about a family of priests and undertakers.) ``I
have a lot in common with Smallwood,'' he said. ``I wasn't as poor
as he was, but we were poor and moved from house to house as he
did.'' Although they both loved Newfoundland, each had an antipathy
to the North Atlantic, which is so much a part of local life.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Memorial University of Newfoundland,
Johnston worked as a reporter on a small newspaper in St. John's.
One of his assignments was to go on a seal hunt, which led him many
years later to write a harrowing passage in ``Colony,'' recreating
an historical incident in which 87 sealers died after being
stranded on an ice floe.
</P>
<P>
   Covering the local courts, he met Smallwood, who by that time
had retired from office. Johnston mentioned him in an article and
Smallwood excoriated him in the courthouse: ``He was quite short
and he pretty much stood on my feet. He looked up at me and said,
`I have written for newspapers in London, New York, Boston and
Halifax, and I've never read such drivel.' And it was only from
mentioning his name in a story.''
</P>
<P>
   Were he alive today, would he stand on the author's feet and
criticize the book?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he would love the attention,'' he said. ``Even that
tantrum was for public consumption. A novel about him? He would
have loved it.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnston published his first book when he was 26, and since then
has been a full-time novelist. Eventually he moved to Toronto,
where he lives with his wife, but he still keeps close contact with
the world of Newfoundland. In preparation for ``Colony,'' he
followed his subject's path to New York, where Smallwood spent
several years writing for various periodicals and giving speeches
in Union Square.
</P>
<P>
   Late in writing the novel, Johnston thought of two key words for
use in his title: colony and unrequited, and played around with
variations of both while also considering other possibilities,
beginning with ``100 Years of Solitude.'' Of course, that title was
already taken, but there was something in it suggestive of his
grand theme.

   ``I like books that are consciously written in the knowledge
that North America is the New World, books like `The Great Gatsby'
,'' he said. ``I always loved the last pages where he's talking
about how the shore must have looked when the Dutch sailors first
saw it.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that he loved the title of V.S. Naipaul's book ``The
Enigma of Arrival'': That's how I wrote about Newfoundland, as part
of the New World. Though it's the oldest colony in North America,
it's an undiscovered new place where you have to build your culture
from the ground up.''
</P>
<P>
   As Smallwood says in ``Colony,'' it is ``a landlocked country in
the middle of an otherwise empty continent,'' an ``unfoundland'' _
at least until Johnston wrote his novel.

<P>
   U.S.-WORLDPOWER-REVIEW (Auckland, New Zealand) _ As the U.S.
helped bring one more Mideast peace agreement to fruition, a crisis
broke out at the other end of the world. Again, Washington was
called on to find a solution. But this time, in East Timor, the
ability of the U.S. to make the problem go way by simply swaggering
in proved not so easy. The world has recently come to think of the
U.S. as the one power with enough influence to make just about
anybody sit up and listen. But just what does this singular U.S.
power consist of, and how and where can the U.S. use it? By Jane
Perlez. (`i' category)
</P>
<P>
   BIG-MERGERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Mega-mergers, such as CBS-Viacom,
seem to pass the logic of a high-school economics course. They are
intended to efficiently expand a network for the distribution of
goods or services or consolidate overlapping distribution networks.
Yet many such deals are also based largely on ego, hubris and
management fads. Many fail, as post-merger returns for shareholders
often trail market averages. Putting together two large
organizations is a difficult management challenge, even when the
two are a good fit strategically. By Steve Lohr. (`a' category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   CLEMENCY-REVIEW (Washington) _ President Clinton's controversial
offer of conditional clemency for Puerto Rican militants was far
from a routine action for him. He has granted fewer clemency
petitions than either of his Republican predecessors, Presidents
George Bush and Ronald Reagan. In fact, the number of presidential
clemencies has steadily declined since the mid 1970s, as the
intensity of partisan political debate over fighting crime has
heated up.
</P>
<P>
   WILDERNESS-REVIEW (Seattle) _ Roughly 4 percent, or 103 million
acres, of the U.S. is designated as protected wilderness. And this
month, the 35th anniversary of the law that allowed Congress to set
aside public land as forever wild, supporters of more wilderness
say at least another 100 million acres could be added to the
system. But at century's end, the definition of what qualifies as
true wilderness in a country of 260 million people has never been
more elusive. And the purpose of setting aside land in its native
state has never been more contentious. By Timothy Egan.
</P>
<P>
   TWENTYFOUR-SEVEN-REVIEW (Undated) _ To trend watchers, the
expression `24/7' has worked its way into the English language as
an abbreviation for a clock-defying world where financial markets
run continually and news channels promise never-ending headlines
(along with weather and traffic reports). But how did the phrase
originate? By James Barron.
</P>
<P>
   DROUGHT-BENEFITS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Farmers, home gardeners and
many others cursed the severe drought that hit the Northeast this
summer. But others managed to make hay while the sun shone. Among
them are wine-makers, well-diggers, building contractors, seashore
landlords, apple, peach and blueberry growers, wild-turkey lovers,
and cops looking for marijuana crops. By Joe Sharkey.
</P>
<P>
   SLEEP-TIPS-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ The publishing world has been
producing so many books on sleep and sleep disorders that the
nation now has a viable alternative to counting sheep. Many are
repetitive, recommending familiar habits of healthful living. But
even so, the books may not leave your eyelids droopy _ for a close
perusal yields passages that surprise, startle, mystify or amuse. A
sampling.
</P>
<P>
   GUN-OWNERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ A photo essay about gun owners
yields a range of reasons for owning guns: sport, hunting,
collecting, self-protection (against rattlesnakes as well as human
intruders), sentimental reasons and investment. WITH PHOTOS.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   PERU-FUJIMORI-REVIEW (Lima) _ President Alberto Fujimori's
tenure has been marked by extraordinary up-and-down swings in his
popularity. But every time he mocks human rights and is branded a
tyrant by foreign democrats, his popularity with Peru's voters
rises again. When Peru led South America in abandoning military
rule and embracing civil liberties and democracy two decades ago,
it quickly found itself on the verge of collapse in the face of
terrorist violence. Fujimori responded with a distinctive formula:
an electoral democracy that survives primarily by setting ever
stricter limits on civil liberties. By Clifford Krauss.
</P>
<P>
   GERMANY-HOLOCAUST-REVIEW (Buchenwald) _ The `Americanization' of
German memory puts a fixation on the Holocaust that some Germans
say excludes a rich cultural and political history and
oversimplifies the 12 years of Nazism. Another historical
distortion will take root if Nazi crimes become exclusively
synonymous in popular consciousness with the murder of 6 million
Jews, if all the camps are seen only as death factories for Jews
and if there is no place in that consciousness for the millions of
non-Jewish victims. By Roger Cohen.

 LEFT BRAIN VS. RIGHT BRAIN? BLAME IT ON THE ABC's  
 (bl)  
 By SANDRA BLAKESLEE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, psychologists had a field day ascribing
various functions to either the left or right side of the human
brain. Language was on the left. Drawing skills stemmed from the
right. The left was a whiz at logic but not at intuition. The right
could conjure up poetry but not arithmetic. Eventually, things got
so silly and inconsistent that the whole endeavor was dismissed as
``dichotomania.'' Careful researchers abandoned the enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Today, many of those same researchers say that hemispheric
lateralization is undergoing a renaissance. They now know that the
left and right halves of our brains interact dynamically and that
specialization, which undoubtedly exists, is a matter of processing
style rather than having specific mental traits reside on one side
or the other.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Marie Banich, a cognitive psychologist at the University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, said the left brain is specialized
for processing information in a piecemeal, analytic and sequential
manner. This happens to be good for verbal information. The right
brain is good at processing information in an integrative, holistic
manner. That's ideal for spatial information.
</P>
<P>
   Still, such research hasn't squelched the idea that each side of
the brain is monomaniacal from birth, that the right is feminine,
mystical, quintessential yin and the left is masculine, orderly,
utmost yang. Popular authors spin ``just so'' stories describing
how each side drives human behaviors and explains human foibles.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Dr. Leonard Shlain, a vascular surgeon who operates on
arteries that supply blood to either side of the brain. Aside from
treating patients at California Pacific Medical Center in San
Francisco, where he is the chief of laparoscopic surgery, Shlain
gathers information for a just-so story that purports to explain
everything from the development of women's rights to monotheism,
from witch burning to religious wars.
</P>
<P>
   All this is spelled out in Shlain's book ``The Alphabet Versus
the Goddess,'' published last year by Viking Putnam, in which he
argues that the invention of the alphabet actually changed which
half of the human brain was dominant.
</P>
<P>
   ``A civilization's principal means of communication molds it
more than the content'' of the information, he writes. Before the
invention of simple alphabets (defined as having fewer than 30
signs) images were the principal means of communication. After the
alphabet was invented, however, the images gave way to linear
sequencing. That meant that comprehension, instead of occurring in
the right brain, began occurring in piecemeal fashion in the left
brain.
</P>
<P>
   It's here that Shlain makes an astonishing leap. The human
nervous system, he says, was substantially rewired when people
began reading alphabets. Never mind that there is no scientific
evidence for this claim. Even Dr. Shlain admits that correlations
don't prove cause and effect. (As he is fond of saying, the
disappearance of stars at dawn does not cause the sun to rise.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, he insists that people should take his contentions
metaphorically rather than quibble with all his facts. So using
left and right brain dominance as a cultural metaphor to explain
human history, he argues that goddess worship began to disappear
from the ancient western world at about the same time alphabets
were invented 5,000 years ago. As alphabets evolved, the shift to
the left brain reinforced so-called ``masculine values.'' For
example the first creation myths to be written down in Babylonia
elevated to supreme position a god who conquered and mutilated a
goddess. When pure alphabets appeared _ he argues the first was
invented by the Hebrews _ the shift was complete. New monotheistic
religions (Judaism, Christianity and Islam) appear in the Western
world saying that God is revealed by His words, sanctified in
written form. Conceiving of a deity with no image prepares the way
for abstract thinking that leads to law codes, dualistic philosophy
and objective science.
</P>
<P>
   Shlain attributes the differences between East and West to their
different routes to literacy. Alphabet cultures value imageless
gods, written laws, speculative philosophy, mathematics and
theoretical science, he concludes. Ideographic cultures do not have
imageless gods, rely on custom instead of law, don't value
individuals and have a different attitude toward time.
</P>
<P>
   So Confucianism, he says, which extols masculine values, began
to thrive in China during the Sung Dynasty when their printing
press was invented. (It's no coincidence that strips of linen used
to make paper were also used to bind women's feet.) In the Arabian
desert, Mohammed is given the gift of literacy by the grace of God,
and within a couple of hundred years men are veiling their women
and forbidding them to shop.
</P>
<P>
   And in Europe the world went mad when Gutenberg invented his
press. As more and more men became obsessed with the written word,
they became increasingly sexist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get me wrong,'' Shlain tells book tour audiences. ``I am
not against literacy. It's an exhilarating stimulant to human
progress. But it can carry undesirable side effects.''
</P>
<P>
   What's happening now is that the modern world is turning
left-brained literacy dominance upside down with the invention of
photography, motion pictures, television and now computers. New
media are reshaping styles of human cognition, he argues.
Cyberspace is the movement of mind into another dimension in which
the right brain has real clout. That's why women's rights have made
gains.
</P>
<P>
   Religion, women's rights, scientific development aren't the only
questions that Shlain claims to have explained. His theory even
presumes to answer some of the most baffling conundrums of all _
like why do men channel surf so much? It seems their poor left
brains can't stand the constant flow of images that the right-brain
loves so much. So they change channels to relieve the tension.

 &HT;    CIVIL RIGHTS LEADER JAMES FARMER REMEMBERED
 &HT;    With photos
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Their hair is gray now, but their eyes light up
behind the bifocals when they recall the years of sitting in at
segregated lunch counters and riding buses through the Jim Crow
South and calling each other ``freedom fighter.''
</P>
<P>
   They changed a nation, these aging brothers and sisters of the
civil rights movement who gathered Friday to share memories of
James Farmer -- their teacher, friend and leader who died in July
at the age of 79. They smiled as they joined voices on the familiar
lyrics to one of Farmer's favorite songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which side are you on, boy, which side are you on?,'' they
sang. ``Will you be an Uncle Tom or will you be a man?''
</P>
<P>
   America always knew which side James Farmer was on.
</P>
<P>
   ``At heart, Jim was always an activist,'' said Rep. John Lewis,
D-Ga. ``He was sitting in and standing up long before Rosa Parks
refused to give up her seat on the bus.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim was the great innovator of the Movement,'' said Eleanor
Holmes Norton, congressional representative for the District of
Columbia. ``Jim did not join the Freedom Riders -- he led them.
...His lifelong work was human freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Farmer ``was one of the giants of the African-American
experience,'' said Martin Luther King, III. He recalled that when
his father gave his famous ``I Have a Dream'' speech in the
nation's capital, Farmer was in a Louisiana jail for having
organized a civil rights protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never retreated from the billy clubs,'' said Major Owens,
D-N.Y., chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus. ``He was a man
with a booming voice and a penetrating vision.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Marshall, Texas, Farmer was the son of a minister and a
teacher. After graduating from divinity school, he founded CORE --
the Congress of Racial Equality -- and applied Mahatma Gandhi's
tactics of non-violent civil disobedience to the American struggle
for racial in equality. He organized the first sit-ins at
segregated restaurants and roller rinks two decades before such
protests gained national attention in the 1960s. In 1961, he led
the ``Freedom Riders'' who rode buses through the South -- and
often ended up beaten or in jail -- as they sought to integrate
interstate travel facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Martin Luther King, Jr., Whitney Young of the Urban
League, and Roy Wilkins of the NAACP, Farmer is remembered as one
of the ``Big Four'' civil rights leaders who organized the crusade
that ended racial segregation and pressured Congress to pass the
voting rights and civil rights reforms of the mid-1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred people congregated at the John F. Kennedy Center
for the Performing Arts for a three-hour tribute to Farmer, who
died of complications from diabetes in Fredricksburg, Va., where he
taught at Mary Washington College.
</P>
<P>
   His colleagues from CORE described a leader who inspired to them
to ``work for very little money'' on a cause that got them ``beat
up by people who knew how to beat people.'' But Farmer was always
at the front, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim was not just a speaker. Jim was a doer,'' said Gordon
Carey, a former CORE activist.
</P>
<P>
   Former Freedom Rider Rudy Lombard recalled the time Farmer
escaped from a Mississippi lynch mob by riding out of town in the
back of a hearse.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer once described his comrades as ``non-violent Marines,''
said Julian Bond, NAACP board chairman. From his Louisiana jail
cell, Bond said, Farmer sent a speech to be read at the 1963 March
on Washington that defiantly promised ``we will not stop until dogs
stop biting us in the South and rats stop biting us in the North.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a better country because of this man,'' concluded
Lewis, a former Freedom Rider himself.
</P>
<P>
   And Jim Farmer loved to sing, they all recalled. So when the
praise and prayers had ended, they stood and clasped hands and
swayed and sang the anthem to their -- and his -- movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shall overcome,'' they sang. ``Someday.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mark Montano is a believer. Montano, a designer and
New York boutique owner who is introducing his collection for
spring 2000 Sunday, he insists that the runway is still the launch
pad that can send a fashion newcomer rocketing into the big
leagues.
</P>
<P>
   No strategy, he argues, is too showy or shrill to help him reach
that goal. ``You want to get as big a hoopla as you can at the
show,'' said Montano, now in his second season under the tents in
Bryant Park. ``If you run out on the runways naked at the end, all
the better.''
</P>
<P>
   He may well have to. It takes that brash a stunt these days to
galvanize a crowd. But if he imagines that such an antic
performance will register as more than a blip on fashion's radar,
he'd better think again.

   As some 1,700 journalists and hundreds of retailers descend like
an avalanche for New York's twice-a-year Fashion Week, which
started Saturday and runs through Sept. 17, Montano is one of some
125 designers jousting for attention, each struggling to pierce the
consciousness of the style-dazed throng.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the shows remain a potent magnet. But as a source of
trends that influence what women will actually buy and wear next
spring, their power has waned, diminished to the point, some say,
that they are no longer fashion's main event.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a whole new world out there,'' said Howard L. Davidowitz,
a New York retail analyst, one in which ``the shows are just not as
important as they used to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, hot style bulletins are as likely to be issued from
boutiques and billboards, the street, over television or even from
the concert stage, the last expertly comandeered by Tommy Hilfiger,
the sponsor of Jewel's current tour. Trends equally emanate from
Hollywood, where every bag and bangle sported by the stars is
slavishly noted by a fawning press.
</P>
<P>
   Even the mall-based mega-chains are vying to seize fashion
leadership, like the Gap, whose latest ads decree ``Everybody in
leather.'' Who is to say that such an edict is less authoritative
than Michael Kors's catwalk endorsement of pony skin?
</P>
<P>
   Pashmina shawls, still blanketing the streets, made their debut
months ago, not on any runway but coiled around the shoulders of
New York's most visible socialites. Vintage knit sweaters
reminiscent of ``The Ice Storm'' first materialized on models and
film stars, who transmitted their taste for this thrift-shop staple
to hordes of fans; designers took the look to stores only this
fall. And baggy trousers, surely this decade's most widespread and
persistent trend, were introduced by Los Angeles street gangs,
mimicking prison garb, and were spread to the masses by rap stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fashion is just everywhere _ it's everybody's game,'' said
Teri Agins, a reporter for The Wall Street Journal who argues in a
new book, ``The End of Fashion'' (William Morrow, $25), that
runway-centered, high-fashion designers are too stuck in their ways
to notice that mass marketers like Hilfiger have stolen their show.
</P>
<P>
   Hilfiger's shrewd long-running promotional strategy has been to
align himself with rock stars and rappers, from Mick Jagger to Lil'
Kim to Sugar Ray, borrowing the musicians' built-in cool to sell
racy leather jeans and rugby shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Such endorsements complement a carpet-bomb advertising campaign,
which celebrates a hip young life style rather than cutting-edge
design creativity. When Hilfiger presents his runway show on
Tuesday at 8 p.m. _ tellingly, in the Theater at Madison Square
Garden, not at Bryant Park _ it will no doubt be packed, but it
will play like an afterthought in the communication of his fashion
message.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want fast fashion,'' said Bud Konheim, the president of
Nicole Miller. ``They're not waiting for the runways to find out
what these gurus think.''
</P>
<P>
   The notion of the high-fashion designer as oracle, his every
word and gesture drunk in by eager acolytes, seems as dated as the
shirtwaist dress. It was different in the 1960s, when the designer
had become a figure of nearly mythic stature. He was, in the words
of Marilyn Bender, who chronicled the '60s style world in ``The
Beautiful People'' (Coward-McCann, 1967), ``a far-ranging thinker
or activist,'' one who could, with the tweak of a seam, impose his
vision on a style-struck public and simultaneously reflect its
mood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't initiate my design; it's just an interpretation of
what people want,'' Rudi Gernreich told Ms. Bender, and she had no
reason to doubt him.
</P>
<P>
   Few couturiers could make such claims today, their dual role as
social bellwethers and tastemakers usurped by a cluster of apparel
titans. In recent years fashion giants like Liz Claiborne, Ralph
Lauren, Calvin Klein and Nautica have diverted much of the
creativity that used to flourish on the runways into canny ads that
telegraph a message of luxury and ease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Feel comfortable,'' Liz Claiborne urges in its latest print
ads, built on the image of a tousled model wearing a twin set and
satin skirt. Lauren conveys the same idea wordlessly in a campaign
that features a model half-reclining in a ballgown on a plump white
chaise.
</P>
<P>
   Such messages resonate with readers, who, research shows, study
them as deeply as the editorial content of fashion magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Further weakening designers' authority, many of them have
narrowed the distinction between high fashion and casual clothes.
They have sent sweatshirts, schoolgirl skirts and anoraks down
runways, all done in sumptuous fabrics, to be sure, but inspired by
generic sportswear. If shoppers are hard-pressed to tell Marc
Jacobs's expensive pleated skirts from a pert look-alike at Club
Monaco, can they be blamed?
</P>
<P>
   ``People are now defining the Gap and Banana Republic as
fashion, even if those stores are charging $30 for a dress.'' said
Patrick McCarthey, the editorial director of Women's Wear Daily and
W magazine, as quoted by Ms. Agins in her book.
</P>
<P>
   The convergence of high-fashion and mass-market clothes has been
hastened by the public ownership of apparel companies. Under
pressure from investors to show steady growth, publicly traded
companies like Nautica, the Jones Apparel Group (which makes some
of Ralph Lauren's most popular lines under license) and Tommy
Hilfiger are reluctant to make waves. Instead they offer reliable
variations on a stripped-down silhouette, which varies little from
one season to the next.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``On the runways,'' said David Wolfe, the creative director of
the Doneger Group, a New York buying office for about 800 retail
stores worldwide, ``there's not that great a chasm between the
creative and the commercial anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   When a couturier like John Galliano does indulge in a moment of
l'art pour l'art _ unleashing a parade of belle epoque dresses on
his Paris runway, for example _ the look doesn't instantly
translate into bustles in the stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impact of such a show is more diffuse,'' said Stephen Gan,
the editor of Visionaire, a vanguard fashion publication. ``It
plants a seed. A year later, perhaps, a woman will want to buy an
old-fashioned choker, but she's not sure why.''
</P>
<P>
   Some designers defend the importance of the runway. It can be
particularly important for small and mid-sized companies, which
don't have the money for advertising or courting celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   After Montano showed his first collection in Bryant Park last
February, retailers from as far off as Toyko began to trickle into
his showroom. ``Showing at the tents was the best career move I
could have made,'' he said, ``It allowed me to broaden my profile,
and retail attention was built right in.''
</P>
<P>
   Diane Von Furstenberg, who will forgo a catwalk show in favor of
a series of tableaux vivants Sunday at her West Village studio,
said: ``Shows are a pain. The expense is so large, and so many
times the people who come are irrelevent.'' But not to show is to
court isolation, she said, giving voice to designers' worst fear.
As she put it: ``It's tough to beat the system. Ignore it, and you
get ignored.''
</P>
<P>
   But some of today's shrewdest merchants aren't even selling
someone else's clothes _ they're initiating trends, appropriating
the designer's role for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a Saks or Nordstorm, the designer business now makes up no
more than 5 percent of the store's selling space,'' said Ike
Lagnado, the president of Tactical Retail Solutions, a New York
market-research company. The rest is reserved for mega-brands and
private-label merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Davidowitz, the retail analyst, said, ``Private label is the
fastest growing segment of the apparel business.'' Pressed to carve
out a unique identity, ``the stores are setting fashion, developing
tremendous expertise in product design,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're selecting their own colors and fabrics,'' he
continued. ``They're going all over the world and interpreting
trends themselves. They're not waiting for some designer to do it
first.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider Target, which few people on Seventh Avenue would
associate with being a fashion-forward brand name. But maybe they
ought to. The 881-store chain, which is owned by the Dayton Hudson
Group in Minneapolis, has its own design team.
</P>
<P>
   A year and a half ago in Paris, the team noticed how young
professionals had adopted cargo pants as a uniform, because the
deep pockets were handy for stashing cell phones. Within weeks
Target had funneled cargo pants into its stores across the country
_ many months ahead of Ralph Lauren, who paraded his own version,
in silk faille for $1,150, on a New York runway last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're influenced by the runway, absolutely,'' said Robin
Waters, Target's vice president for merchandising. ``But that
influence is balanced by what we're seeing in the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Barneys New York, the specialty retailer that in the '80s
hitched its fortunes to those of avant-garde designers like Dries
van Noten and Azzedine Alaia, has devoted larger chunks of floor
space to its own brand. Designed by Bahnaz Sarafpour, it sells
under the Barneys New York Collection label for $900 to $1,250.
</P>
<P>
   Like Donna Karan and Michael Kors, Ms. Sarafpour, a former
design assistant at Isaac Mizrahi, seeks inspiration each season at
Europe's major fabric shows. Her collection, replete with such
novelties as a long-haired camel skirt and an evening dress with
rickrack on the bodice, are selling briskly, said Judy Collinson,
the general merchandising manager of Barneys.
</P>
<P>
   The buyers are women who view the designs as their own secret
resource. ``And we never did a show,'' Ms. Collinson added.
</P>
<P>
   Progressive merchants like Fred Segal in Los Angeles have been
well ahead of fashion's curve in recent seasons, stocking mala
beads, saris and Chinese slippers, for example, and selling them to
Hollywood's elite long before they made a splash on Seventh Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Kalinsky, who owns the recently opened Jeffrey store in
New York and another in Atlanta, said he was tie-dying cashmere
sweaters on his porch last April. ``Now they're one of next
season's biggest trends,'' he boasted.
</P>
<P>
   Still, merchants like Kalinsky remain designers' biggest
cheerleaders. Jeffrey stocks a smattering of Courreges, not because
the clothes are expected to sell but to make an esthetic point.
</P>
<P>
   This week, those designers who insist on staging a full-scale
extravaganza will likely find it has sailed above the heads of
their ultimate critics, the women who shop at the stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``The connection between runway shows and salable fashion is
increasingly hazy,'' said Lagnado, the market researcher. ``Most
women are not going to gamble on what Jean Paul Gaultier or even
Karl Lagerfeld is doing.'' Instead, they see their shows as a
diversion, an entertaining detour that can safely be ignored.

KEVIN BACON SETS HIS OWN RULES IN CHOOSING ROLES, AND HE AND THE
FANS WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kevin Bacon may be the biggest star to act in movies that hardly
anyone goes to see.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, sure, there were hits like ``Footloose,'' ``JFK'' and
``Apollo 13.'' But aside from the ensemble drama ``Sleepers,''
which barely cracked the magic $50 million mark that signifies a
minor hit, and the guilty-pleasure twistfest ``Wild Things,'' which
found a niche on video and premium-cable, few of Bacon's movies
during the past five years have made even as much as $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad, because they contain some of his best work _ especially
1995's ``Murder in the First,'' in which he plays a tormented
Alcatraz convict on trial for killing a fellow inmate, and 1997's
``Telling Lies in America,'' in which he plays an early-'60s
Cleveland disc jockey not above taking a little payola.
</P>
<P>
   He may be so familiar that his name has become a party game, but
it doesn't mean that he is above taking risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a kid I had a wall of hats,'' Bacon says,
explaining his choice of roles during a telephone interview. ``It
was like a hat rack. There was an Indian headdress, a fireman's
hat, a baseball cap. And that was the way I played; I put on
different hats and became somebody new every day. To me, that's
what being an actor is about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Kevin Bacon is really all that interesting to go
to the movies to see,'' he adds. ``I don't have anything that's
innately interesting about me. I need to have a good character to
play; that's what I'm looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Bacon's wish is granted in his latest movie, ``Stir of Echoes,''
which opened Friday. He plays Tom Witzky, a Chicago telephone
repairman who begins having disturbing visions after he undergoes
hypnosis at a party. Little does Tom realize that his young son has
been having visions as well, without any outside help. Their
behavior begins to disturb Tom's wife and disrupt their
relationships with their friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty cerebral kind of freakout,'' Bacon says of the
movie. ``It's not an animatronic monster that jumps out at you;
it's about what's going on in your head.''
</P>
<P>
   It also echoes another movie. See if this sounds familiar: A
little boy has visions of the dead. He guesses they want to tell
him something, but he's not sure what. A troubled adult begins to
empathize.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, ``Stir of Echoes'' resembles ``The Sixth Sense.'' The
execution is different, however; ``Stir'' director David Koepp (who
wrote the screenplay for ``Jurassic Park'') substitutes a
nerve-racking tautness for ``Sense's'' leisurely pace.
</P>
<P>
   But although Bacon (who hasn't seen ``Sense'') and Koepp
acknowledge similarities between the two films, ``Stir of Echoes''
is based on a 41-year-old Richard Matheson novel. The question is
whether audiences will flock to another ghost story. It's a
question Bacon wishes he didn't have to deal with.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first started making (movies) ... the general public
just went to films because it was about something that was
interesting to them, or they liked the star, or they read good
reviews, or they liked the director,'' Bacon says. ``Nowadays,
people go to movies because they're hits. Everybody picks up their
paper and sees what does well over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sister, who's a smart and sophisticated woman, said to me,
`Y'know, I didn't really want to see ``Sixth Sense,'' but now I do
because it's doing so well.' Her decision was based purely on the
amount of business it did. Which is an odd thing, if you think
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   At least ``The Sixth Sense'' is a worthwhile movie, as is ``Stir
of Echoes.'' They're both a far cry from an earlier horror hit of
Bacon's _ ``Friday the 13th.'' Bacon says he'd like to forget that
film, but he acknowledges that it influenced _ even if indirectly _
the current wave of less gory horror movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had `Friday the 13th,' which was a runaway smash that cost
like $900,000 to make, and it spawned a whole wave of teen/slasher
movies,'' Bacon says. But ``you also have a slightly more
sophisticated audience that also wants to go to movies and be
scared. A guy going around in a mask and stabbing people isn't
really that scary to a more savvy kind of filmgoing crowd. As a
reaction to that, you have movies like `Blair Witch' and `Stir.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Movies like these can mess with an actor's sleep patterns as
well as an audience's, but Bacon says he's pretty good at leaving
his work at the office. He has a nonacting outlet, the Bacon
Brothers, the ``folk-rock-soul-country'' band he's in with his
older sibling, Michael. They're currently wrapping up work on their
second album. For Bacon, making music can be a lot scarier than
playing with ghosts.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, there's nothing more vulnerable than standing up,
holding a guitar, singing a song you wrote about something that
happened in your life,'' he says. ``I've done God knows how many
interviews in my life, but to me the lyrics of the songs on the new
record are more revealing than anything I've ever done before.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Early Friday afternoon, Hurricane Floyd started to get better
organized as a distinct center emerged on satellite imagery. On
Saturday, strengthening is likely as Hurricane Floyd continues on a
west-northwest path.
</P>
<P>
   Clusters of thunderstorms will erupt over the central Plains
near a strengthening warm front that will span from Kansas to the
middle Mississippi Valley. The spark for the storms, which will
form over northeast Kansas and then spread into parts of Iowa and
Missouri, will come from a jet stream disturbance heading east from
the Rockies. Fueled by increasingly humid air from the Gulf of
Mexico, a few of these storms may reach severe levels. Isolated
tornadoes are possible. Isolated, potent thunderstorms are possible
from southwest Kansas to northwest Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, thunderstorms will develop across southwest South
Dakota and western Nebraska as increasing moist air from the south
is lifted by a cold front approaching from the northern Rockies.
Severe weather is possible from a few of these storms.
</P>
<P>
   Warm weather will build across much of western Washington and
western Oregon as winds from the east circulating around high
pressure in British Columbia warm on descent from the Cascade and
Olympic Mountains and then push the cool marine layer of Pacific
air out to sea.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the Northeast will start clear and cool under the
auspice of high pressure. But cumulus clouds will bubble up over
the Adirondacks of upstate New York and the mountains of northern
New England.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Hurricane Poll
</P>
<P>
   Determining the wind speed in a hurricane is almost like taking
an exit poll in a political election _ a projection is sometimes
used to arrive at a result. On Friday, Tropical Storm Floyd was
upgraded to a hurricane, yet no measurement of its surface winds
was taken. As Air Force reconnaissance flew toward the center of
Floyd at an altitude near 5,000 feet, instruments measured a wind
speed of about 100 mph. Using models of the wind structure of
tropical systems, a surface wind speed close to 80 mph was then
extrapolated from flight-level winds, thus qualifying Floyd as a
hurricane.

movies. It's not as easy as you'd think; as well-known as Bacon is,
his movies can be hard sells because of the risky choices he makes.

mixed race in a diversity-starved TV landscape, it's being treated
as a socially significant event. But it's not perfect, much like
the family it depicts. By ROBERT PHILPOT. Story has moved in ``e''

LET'S HOPE VIACOM-CBS DON'T GO FOR THE SYNERGY THING 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Everything we know we learned from television:
Here's the deal. You get your billion, we'll get ours, we'll tap
some friends for another couple of billion, and we'll gobble up
NBC.
</P>
<P>
   If you're not a multinational media conglomerate, you're soooo
yesterday's news.
</P>
<P>
   How many billions will the next sale be? More than even Carl
Sagan can count.
</P>
<P>
   Thank you if you got that. One bad Carl Sagan joke per year.
</P>
<P>
   That's all we ask.
</P>
<P>
   Lord help us if Viacom-CBS _ can they please settle on a new
name? _ takes a hint from Disney-ABC and goes in big for this
synergy thing. You know, promoting all your toys throughout your
vertically integrated empire. If so, we may see Dan Rather hosting
the MTV Video Music Awards next year. And ``60 Minutes'' would have
to kill that investigative piece about ``The Rugrats.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our undercover cameras followed that bitch Angelica as she
endorses dangerous toys and chewing tobacco for small kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Le petite mort: Word from Nickelodeon is that production is
under way for ``Rugrats in Paris _ The Movie.''
</P>
<P>
   To which we say: Bring on the endless movie tie-ins, let the
sellout continue. ``Hi, I'm Chucky. I like French toast. Buy our
special recipe for your kid. And only frequent the French laundry.
And, hey, kids love French bread.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, we'll stop.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Jamie Tarses is out as entertainment president for ABC,
a new fall sitcom _ or alleged sitcom _ called ``Then Came You'' on
her former network can now get its rightful name: ``The Jamie
Tarses Show.'' Let's see, the woman is 33, has curly brown hair
like Jamie, is a busy professional, divorced and living in a hotel.
</P>
<P>
   She meets a 22-year-old room service waiter who looks a lot like
the guy on ``Two Guys, A Girl and a Pizza Place'' whom Tarses was
linked with. There is no plot. They just have sex a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry, when we merge our billions, we'll put on thinly
veiled shows about our private lives as well. But, you know, with
spice. You can be sleeping with a Ricky Martin clone, and we can be
sleeping with, well, uh, our wife.
</P>
<P>
   But in the second episode we slaughter ``The Rugrats.''
</P>
<P>
   If we're going to grab NBC, we better do it fast. Those
knuckleheads just blew more than $400 million on a percentage of
Paxson Communications, which owns the struggling Pax Net, which you
probably didn't know was the country's No. 7-ranked broadcast
network, behind UPN. Way behind.
</P>
<P>
   Why did NBC buy? Partly because it wants to use the Paxson
stations _ mostly tiny ones that are impossible to get without
cable _ as a club to hold over its affiliates. Basically, if the
affiliates get out of line, NBC could say, ``Fine, we'll put `ER'
on our other station.'' That ends most discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Still, we better get our billions in order fast. Studios looking
to buy NBC include Sony, Universal, MGM, Time-Warner and even USA
Networks, the cable conglomerate owned by Barry Diller.
</P>
<P>
   How's your credit?
</P>
<P>
   PBS president and CEO Ervin Duggan resigned Thursday, ending his
5-and-1/2-year reign. In a statement, he said he was ready to
``move on to new challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   But for a guy as slick and sophisticated as Duggan, the
announcement was poorly timed. He recently gave a huge PBS mea
culpa to Congress for the donor-list controversy that has
embarrassed the public system.
</P>
<P>
   And the Corporation for Public Broadcasting put out its report
Thursday _ same day as the resignation _ where it reportedly said
mistakes were made but will be corrected. A PBS spokesman said it
was all coincidence, but Duggan looks to either be the scapegoat
for the scandal, or a martyr for the system.
</P>
<P>
   Is PBS now unstable? Hmmm. Let's buy it.
</P>
<P>
   You've already been warned about the teen takeover on
television. If you read the New York Times Magazine this past
Sunday, which tracked the lifestyles and attitudes of said teens,
you'd be ready to call up an army.
</P>
<P>
   You may have noticed that ABC _ that's the American Broadcasting
Company _ has made a little adjustment, calling itself ``America's
Broadcasting Company.''
</P>
<P>
   Now CBS will want to fix that Columbia thing.
</P>
<P>
   The High Fives: 1. Ann Curry. 2. Finally, a good fall TV season.
3. ``Beggars and Choosers,'' one of the best, unseen dramas on
television. Showtime, by the way. 4. ``The Chris Rock Show,'' back
on HBO, Sept. 17. A great piece of work. 5. The Outdoor Life
Network. Honestly, we're hooked on those surfing shows.

</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ Here's a Kevin Bacon game to play: Name his last five
movies. It's not as easy as you'd think; as well-known as Bacon is,
his movies can be hard sells because of the risky choices he makes.
The latest is ``Stir of Echoes,'' a ``Sixth Sense''-style ghost
story with chills all its own. Bacon talks about ``Stir of Echoes''
and his acting choices. By ROBERT PHILPOT. Story will move in ``e''
entertainment category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PBS-LOVE STORY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ On Sunday night, PBS will debut a 10-part documentary
series, ``An American Love Story,'' depicting a year and a half in
the life of a mixed-race family. Because it's a rare portrait of
mixed race in a diversity-starved TV landscape, it's being treated
as a socially significant event. But it's not perfect, much like
the family it depicts. By ROBERT PHILPOT. Story has moved in ``e''
entertainment category. &QL;

   COMPUTERS-BOMBAY &QL;

<P>
   UNDATED _ A question for computer maven Dr. Emilio Bombay:
``America Online continues to bill me after I canceled my account.
Calling them doesn't do any good. My wife finally got through to
them, but they refused to do anything because she was not the one
who subscribed. I called and spent my entire lunch period waiting
for a pick-up. When that failed, I got on their Web site and sent
an e-mail. No answer. What do I have to do to get my money back?
Why doesn't some government stop this fraud?'' By DR. EMILIO
BOMBAY. Story has moved in ``l'' lifestyle category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CARS-WILLIAMS-COLUMN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ With the Kia-built Festiva subcompact gone from the
Ford lineup, and the compact Contour failing to find favor with
American consumers, Ford has rolled out the European-designed
Focus, an all-new small car for 2000. Although it was originally
designed to replace the compact Escort, which has been Ford's
smallest and least expensive model since the Festiva went away, the
Focus will be sold alongside the Escort for the time being. By G.
CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III. Story has moved in ``l'' lifestyle category.

   THOMPSON-COLUMN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ Bill Bradley is a liberal, and proud of it. Unlike
President Clinton and Vice President Gore, Bradley does not feign
disdain for a federal government that he believes can be the
driving force in delivering the American dream to those who have
been left behind. By BILL THOMPSON. Story has moved in ``k''
commentary category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LABBE-COLUMN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ How do you think the Southern Baptists' mission board
would have reacted if the Jews, Muslims and Buddhists got together
on Dec. 24 and called for prayers the next day encouraging all
Christians to turn away from their misguided beliefs in the
Redeemer? Can you say, ``Offended and provoked''? Intolerance is an
acceptable attribute among Bible literalists who believe that the
printed word consists of God's actual proclamations _ not
metaphors, not parables, but literally what he said. And according
to the New Testament of the Christian Bible _ which is not part of
the Hebrew Bible, the Torah _ God said the only way to everlasting
salvation is through belief in his son, Jesus Christ. By J.R.
LABBE. Story has moved in ``k'' commentary category. &QL;

INVENTION DELIVERS MEDICINE TO INNER EAR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Minn., Ala.)   (bl)  
 By STEPHEN G. REED   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARASOTA, Fla. _ Dr. Herbert Silverstein, a physician here, has
won approval from the Federal Drug Administration for a device
called the Silverstein MicroWick that delivers medicine to the
inner ear.
</P>
<P>
   Getting medicine into the inner ear has been something of a
challenge. The eardrum is an effective barrier, so eardrops won't
work.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors can inject medication, but Silverstein said that can
result in medicine being lost through the eustachian tube, which
connects the inner ear to the throat. Medicine can be delivered
through a catheter, but patients must wear a tube and pump.
</P>
<P>
   The MicroWick is designed to surmount these problems by
delivering medication directly from the outer ear to the ``round
window membrane,'' a permeable patch of tissue leading to the inner
ear.
</P>
<P>
   To install the MicroWick, doctors zap a hole in the eardrum with
a laser and insert a tiny plastic collar. The wick, a collection of
polyvinyl acetate fibers measuring 9 millimeters long, slips
through the collar and rests end-first on the round window
membrane.
</P>
<P>
   After the device is installed, patients can then use prescribed
eardrops according to their doctor's instructions. The wick funnels
the medicine to the round window, where it is absorbed into the
inner ear.
</P>
<P>
   The wick is not easily visible. It stays in place about four
weeks, and after its removal the eardrum heals.
</P>
<P>
   Installation and removal are outpatient procedures that do not
require hospitalization. Silverstein said it's far cheaper than
other treatments, with a wholesale price of $68.
</P>
<P>
   Silverstein implanted the first MicroWicks about a year ago,
when he began developing the idea. Back then, they were made by
hand, he said. The device received approval from the FDA on Aug.
26. MicroWicks will be manufactured by Micromedics of Eagan, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   Innovation is not new to Silverstein, who has created numerous
surgical techniques and medical devices, including a laser
treatment for childhood earaches and a nerve monitor to protect
facial nerves during surgeries.
</P>
<P>
   Angelia Mansnerus, a 39-year-old clerical worker for the Alabama
state government, is one of more than 50 patients to benefit from a
MicroWick.
</P>
<P>
   Mansnerus has Meniere's disease, a relatively common disorder
thought to result from abnormalities in the fluids of the inner
ear. The organs that control the body's sense of balance are
located there.
</P>
<P>
   Once the spinning started, only time could stop it, she said. If
she was at work, she would grasp the sides of her desk chair for
support. She'd be unable to walk. At their most intense, the
attacks lasted about half an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'd be sick for maybe six hours,'' she said. ``I'd have to
go somewhere and lay down and take something to make me sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   About seven weeks ago, a MicroWick began delivering an
antibiotic to her inner ear. She said her condition has improved
dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so afraid I was going to be stuck like this for the rest
of my life, and I would be a homebody,'' Mansnerus said. ``I really
feel great. I am really relieved.''
</P>
<P>
   Meniere's disease affects an estimated three people in every
1,000. In addition to balance problems, patients often report an
unpleasant ringing in the ears. Treatments have existed for years,
but not without drawbacks, Silverstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Surgical methods include cutting the nerve that connects the
inner ear's balance mechanisms to the brain or destroying the
balance and hearing centers on one side. But they require
hospitalization, and the latter is only considered when the patient
already has poor hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, an antibiotic called gentamicin can be injected into
the inner ear, where it kills the balance cells that contribute to
the condition. The body can compensate for the lost cells, so
normal balance is restored.
</P>
<P>
   The MicroWick delivered the antibiotic to Mansnerus' inner ear
without the problems caused by injections or catheters.
</P>

   No. 10 GEORGIA TECH 1-0
</P>
<P>
   No. 1 at FLORIDA STATE 1-0
</P>
<P>
   Even with Florida State quarterback Chris Weinke a bit rusty and
Georgia Tech quarterback, Joe Hamilton so dangerous, Florida State
seems clearly better. The Seminoles have won 41 in a row at home,
and as Yellowjackets Coach George O'Leary said, ``It's going to be
a difficult place to play.''
</P>
<P>
   No. 14 UCLA 1-0
</P>
<P>
   No. 13 at OHIO STATE 0-1
</P>
<P>
   Both offenses need help. After his UCLA team beat Boise State by
38-7, Coach Bob Toledo said, ``We ran right at them and didn't go
anywhere.'' After the Buckeyes lost to Miami by 23-12, Coach John
Cooper said, ``We almost played as if we didn't want to be there.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Time ran out on Notre Dame when it had the ball on Michigan's 12

because Drew Brees passed for 273 yards and four touchdowns against
Central Florida.

   In two games, Major Applewhite of Texas has passed for 353 yards

offense.

DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS COME OUT SWINGING 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Southern Exposure is the weekly political notebook from the
Washington Bureau of the New York Times Regional Newspapers)  
 (bl)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Absence doesn't always make the heart grow fonder.
Four weeks of relaxed life outside of Washington certainly didn't
make Republicans and Democrats miss one another.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately upon their return from the August recess, GOP
lawmakers locked horns with congressional Democrats and President
Clinton over his promised veto of a $792 billion tax cut plan.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott was griping that the president
was in no mood to compromise. ``I don't see any indication the
president wants to work with us,'' Lott said. Democrats charged
that Republicans were willing to sacrifice the financial security
of the nation in their push for a tax cut. House Minority Leader
Dick Gephardt belittled them, saying they failed to get voters
enthusiastic about their tax plan during the break.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost as if the one thing they want to do is the one
thing the American people don't want them to do,'' Gephardt said.
</P>
<P>
   The stalemate over that tax package has slowed action on the 13
annual spending bills that Congress must pass each year by Oct. 1.
So far, only one of the 13 bills has cleared both chambers.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Allen Boyd, D-Fla., a member of the Democratic Blue Dog
Coalition pushing for a spending plan that commits most of the
projected surplus to reducing the national debt, warned that both
sides need to give a little to avoid a legislative log jam.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be bad for the American people,'' Boyd said. ``They
don't want a train wreck. They want us to sit down and figure this
thing out.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Mike McIntyre, D-N.C., another Blue Dog member, agreed.
``People are sick and tired of the political posturing and that's
all this debate has been about,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the spending bills, a few issues will likely
dominate the landscape: bankruptcy reform, a juvenile justice bill,
gun control and health-care reforms such as a patient bill of
rights and Medicare expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Opening a new front in the gun control debate, Sen. Jeff
Sessions, R-Ala., joined a press conference of conservative
activists and called for the administration to enforce existing gun
laws, rather than pressing for new restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   BARNSTORMING BAGHDAD
</P>
<P>
   A top aide to Rep. Earl Hilliard, D-Ala., said his recent trip
to Iraq proved to him that U.S. economic sanctions against that
country are not working.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people are being made increasingly impoverished,'' said
Jack Zylman, a legislative aide to Hilliard. ``They're ill and
they're dying.''
</P>
<P>
   In a highly unusual move for a congressional staffer, who
usually prefer to stay in the background, Zylman talked about his
journey with a contingent of other Democratic staff members from
the International Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The trip had drawn the ire of the State Department, which has
severed diplomatic ties with Iraq since the Persian Gulf War. But
Zylman defended the trip as part of Congress' oversight
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to look and see what was going on over there,'' said
Zylman who said that his boss would likely release a report on
Iraqi situation later this fall.
</P>
<P>
   CLOSING THE DOOR ON THE DRAFT
</P>
<P>
   One might expect a conservative think tank to support the idea
of mandatory military service. Think again. After some experts ran
the idea of reinstating the draft up the flag pole, the libertarian
Cato Institute decided not to salute.
</P>
<P>
   In a report, analysts for the group said that recruitment
problems the military is experiencing have nothing to do with lack
of interest in the military but instead are related to the way
troops are being used.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clinton administration's promiscuous use of military force
in conflicts irrelevant to U.S. security drives many potential
recruits away from and current career personnel out of the
service,'' wrote senior fellow Doug Bandow. He noted the army has
deployed 29 times in the past 10 years compared with 10 times
during the previous 40. He recommends retaining the voluntary
military, saying it attracts motivated people who want to serve.
</P>
<P>
   OIL-DRUM BLUES
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Breaux's heart must have been breaking. On the Senate
floor, several of his colleagues were denouncing as a taxpayer
rip-off a federal program that requires petroleum companies to pay
to the federal treasury only a fraction of the royalties they earn
on oil drilled on federal lands and waters.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the floor, Breaux, D-La., referenced all the talk he had
just heard about ``cheating and stealing and lying'' by the oil
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was listening to a country-western song,'' quipped
Breaux, who went on to defend the program as fair and responsible.

TWO VIEWS ON HOW TO GET JOHNNY TO READ AND THINK

<P>
   School began this week for most students, and so has another
round of debate over how it should be run.
</P>
<P>
   So The New York Times posed a question to two education gurus:
How can schools produce educated students?
</P>
<P>
   Howard Gardner, a Harvard professor and the author of the new
book ``The Disciplined Mind: What All Students Should Understand''
(Simon &AMP; Schuster), Gardner argues that critical thinking and
analytical skills in various disciplines should be the backbone of
any educational approach, and that these do not depend on studying
a particular subject matter or using a core curriculum. Gardner,
who is perhaps most well-known for his theory of multiple
intelligence, which posits a broader kind definition of
intelligence than can be measured by IQ scores, e proposes a focus
on a limited number of subjects. Such case studies _ like the
theory of evolution, Mozart's ``Marriage of Figaro'' and the
Holocaust _ would teach students how to think, respectively, like a
scientist, and artist or a historian.
</P>
<P>
   E.D. Hirsch Jr., the author of ``Cultural Literacy,''
(Houghton-Mifflin, 1987), is a professor of education and
humanities at the University of Virginia and president of the Core
Knowledge Foundation. Hirsch, whose book ``The Schools We Need and
Why We Don't Have Them'' was published by Anchor in paperback last
month, argues that to function well in society, people need a
vocabulary of common information, of _ facts, stories and skills
that make up a shared literacy. His approach is being used in some
of New York City's newest charter schools. He argues that the
progressive tradition in education, which Gardner represents, has
miserably failed students, particularly disadvantaged ones, and
that a school combining drills and practice where needed with a
demanding core curriculum will continue to produce the most
successes.

PROGRAM EXAMINES LINK BETWEEN VIDEO GAMES AND SCHOOL SHOOTINGS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Military training provides raw recruits with two skills:
discipline and the will to kill.
</P>
<P>
   Take away that will to kill and you have a soldier useless in
the field. But take away the discipline and you have a murderous
sociopath.
</P>
<P>
   And that is what video games do: train youths to be remorseless
killers, while not instilling the discipline needed as a safeguard
against wanton violence, according to a former Army Ranger who is
also a psychologist.
</P>
<P>
   In a compelling Court TV ``Crime Stories'' special, ``Virus of
Violence'' (Tuesday at 10 p.m.), Ret. Lt. Col. David Grossman, an
Army Ranger who trained troops and who is also a former professor
of psychology at United States Military Academy at West Point,
argues that video games are nothing more than ``murder
simulators.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing military training being given to children,''
Grossman said.
</P>
<P>
   In the documentary, narrated by Martin Sheen, Grossman said the
blame for youth violence must be parceled out to several root
causes, including guns, television, movies and the news media.
</P>
<P>
   But Grossman reserved much of his analytical wrath for video
games, which he said employ the same training tactics used by the
military.
</P>
<P>
   In making his argument, Grossman uses anecdotal and hard
evidence garnered from the recent spate of youth shootings in towns
that have become shorthand for violence in schools. ``Littleton,
Paducah, Pearl, Jonesboro. We all searched for explanations,''
Sheen intoned.
</P>
<P>
   Grossman, who coincidently hails from Jonesboro, Ark. (the site
of another youth school shooting), said the December 1997 shooting
in Paducah, Ky., that killed three and wounded five is a perfect
example of the link between video games and violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Paducah, a 14-year-old boy who had never handled a pistol
in his life steals a gun, fires a few practice shots, takes it to
school and fires eight shots,'' Grossman told television critics in
July during a story repeated in the special. ``Now, the average
law-enforcement officer in the average engagement hits with about
one bullet in five. It's hard to hit moving targets, real targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many hits does (the youth) get? Eight shots, eight hits,
on eight different targets,'' Grossman continued. ``Five of them
are head shots.''
</P>
<P>
   So how does a youth with no formal gun training or experience
exhibit marksmanship under duress unmatched by even professionals?
</P>
<P>
   ``He held the gun up in a two-handed stance,'' Grossman said.
``He never fired far to the left, he never fired far to the right,
never fired up, never fired down. He just put one bullet in every
target that popped up in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was he doing? He was playing a video game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Virus of Violence'' offers dissenting viewpoints from other
experts disputing Grossman's conclusions on video games and
television, noting that while millions of youths play these games
and watch TV, only a handful ever act out in a deadly manner. But
Grossman stands fast by his conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are normal kids who have been fed a consistent diet of
death and horror. You add a couple of outside variables to the
equation and the result is tragedy.''
</P>

<P>
   As one concerned with precollege education, I'm gratified by the
attention paid to this topic over the last two decades. At the same
time I have to signal my uneasiness that so much of the discussion
centers on means: should we have charters, vouchers, teachers'
unions, national tests etc. I think it is essential that we step
back, at least periodically, and ask about the ends or aims of
education.
</P>
<P>
   My own answer can be stated succinctly. A dozen or more years of
education should yield students who can think well about the
essential questions of human life: who are we, where do we come
from, what's the world made of, what have humans achieved and what
can we achieve, how does one lead a good life? Many people,
institutions and experiences can contribute to formulating these
questions and the answers. The distinct contribution of formal
education is to equip students with the ways of thinking, the
scholarly disciplines, that have been constructed over the years to
allow individuals to think well and deeply about these questions
and some viable answers.
</P>
<P>
   In speaking of disciplines, I have something specific in mind.
Disciplines did not always exist; they are human-created methods
and structures for approaching long-standing puzzles. Historians
evaluate documents and testimony to reconstruct plausible accounts
of past events. Scientists generate hypotheses about how the world
works, collect data relevant to those hypotheses, analyze the data
objectively and then revise or endorse the original hypotheses or
theories. The arts are also disciplines: they involve clear
procedures for production (how does one write a fugue, stage a
ballet, render a portrait) and for interpreting the productions of
others. For those inclined to dismiss the disciplines, imagine a
world without such mental furniture.
</P>
<P>
   By a convenient pun, the attainment of disciplines requires
discipline. This is because our natural, common-sense ways of
making sense of the world are non- or even anti-disciplinary. Only
through years of asking questions and following well-honed
strategies can we replace common-sense accounts (e.g., human beings
have always existed, the best portraits are photographs) with more
nuanced and grounded disciplinary accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The disciplines are arguably the most important human inventions
of the last two millenniums. Yet their importance tends to be
obscured, especially in the rhetoric-filled discourse of education.
Instead, we hear a lot about facts, skills, tests and subject
matter. None of these terms should be dismissed, but they attain
fresh significance when they are considered in a disciplinary
context.
</P>
<P>
   First, skills. I know no one who opposes the acquisition of
basic skills: reading, writing, calculation. One cannot even enter
the disciplinary worlds unless one has mastered the three R's.
Basic skills are the means for acquiring the disciplines, just as
the disciplines (and ultimately interdisciplinary amalgams) provide
the means for thinking well about important issues.
</P>
<P>
   Next, facts. You cannot think well about a topic or question
unless you have information, data, facts. However, that information
should be acquired not for its own sake but as a means of finding a
better answer to a consequential question. Facts can only be well
used if they relate to one another in a meaningful way: otherwise,
to use Alfred North Whitehead's term, they are simply ``inert
knowledge.'' Facts need the connective tissue of disciplines, or
they are undisciplined, rote information.
</P>
<P>
   Subject matter is typically collapsed with disciplines, but it
is important to honor a distinction. One can have lots of facts in
a subject without having any disciplinary understanding. Too often
a person is considered a master because she or he has taken a
certain number of courses, often called Carnegie units. A person
understands to the extent that he or she can apply knowledge
appropriately in a new situation. Only an individual in possession
of disciplinary moves can do this.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to tests, or assessments. There may be some who
oppose assessments, but I am not in their ranks. Not in the least!
At the same time, I reject as inadequate most of the short-answer
instruments currently being adopted at the state level. These
instruments may probe factual or subject-matter knowledge, but they
typically fall short of probing disciplinary mastery and
understanding. In life no one presents us with four choices, the
last of which reads ``none of the above.''
</P>
<P>
   I favor instruments that actually determine whether a person can
think in a disciplined way. So rather than ask students to name
nine Civil War battles, I would ask them to assess two historical
accounts based on the same primary documents (or create their own).
Rather than asking students to recall a chemical formula, I would
provide them with data from an experiment and ask them to extract
the regularities (and perhaps indicate which other data need to be
collected next). Rather than asking students to memorize authors or
lines from a poem, I would ask them to edit or complete an
unfinished poem.
</P>
<P>
   Every educational philosophy reflects a certain knowledge base
and a certain value system. My educational regimen builds on
findings from cognitive science. These findings indicate that, when
young, individuals develop intuitive theories that are very
powerful and difficult to eradicate. While some are on the mark,
most are remote from the disciplines. Only a concerted effort over
years to establish disciplinary ways of thinking can eradicate or
educate the unschooled mind. My own belief is that this goal is
best achieved by focusing in depth on certain important topics; not
only does one come to understand those topics well, but in the
process one gains incipient mastery for what it is like to use the
methods of a discipline.
</P>
<P>
   This incipient mastery can be built upon for the rest of one's
life. I am idealistic enough to believe that once individuals have
genuinely understood a theory like evolution, a historical period
like the Holocaust, a work of art like ``The Marriage of Figaro,''
they will insist on commensurate understanding of other topics in
the future.
</P>
<P>
   Pursuing this line of reasoning, I find myself out of sympathy
with a preordained canon. One can acquire disciplinary ways of
thinking from a variety of topics, and it simply does not matter
that much which ones happen to be used. It is more important, in my
view, to use examples that are valued by the community and that
come alive for students than to insist that everyone read the same
play or master the same theorem or learn the same topics in
science. I don't care that much if one can name the planets; one
can always request that information from a Palm Pilot. I care
mightily that half of the American population (and perhaps some of
our recent Presidents) can't distinguish astronomical from
astrological ways of thinking and that two-thirds of Americans
don't see the disciplinary difference between evolutionary and
creationist accounts of the origins of human beings.
</P>
<P>
   In putting forth these views, I find myself at odds with much of
the program put forth by E.D. Hirsch Jr. Perhaps it is possible to
reconcile our work to some extent _ for example, by emphasizing his
``Core Knowledge'' in early grades and my disciplinary focus for
the later grades. I have admiration for his democratic vision, his
belief in public education and his sponsoring of programs in our
schools. Still I think it is valuable to put forth these quite
different educational visions: one focusing on questions and on
ways of thinking, the other on factual answers and on shared
knowledge. The value is in part epistemological, different views of
the mind's use; in part cultural, different views of an educated
society.

THE ANSWERS LIE IN DRILLS AND RIGOR, NOT PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION

<TEXT>
<P>
   The most interesting debate about American education concerns
why the United States has not fulfilled the egalitarian aims of
schooling as well as other democracies have. The main cause of
inequality in American schools, I have argued, has been the
dominance of the progressive-education tradition, which has
seriously misconceived itself as the guardian of social progress
and democratic ideals. I hope Howard Gardner is right that my work
poses a threat to the assumptions of the progressivist tradition.
</P>
<P>
   If we are lucky, the end of the 1990s will mark the end of
spurious connections between educational ideas and political
affiliations. During the last two decades, when Democrats have
controlled a school board, the district has tended to favor the
whole-language method of teaching reading, to encourage the use of
calculators for ``math understanding'' (instead of memorizing the
multiplication table) and to disparage multiple-choice tests, all
positions connected with progressive education but not logically
with the platform of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, when a majority of school-board members have been
Republican, the district has tended to favor the explicit teaching
of phonics, the memorization of the multiplication table and the
use of standardized tests, positions properly associated with
educational conservatism but not necessarily with political
conservatism. On the contrary, political conservatism, understood
as the preservation of the social status quo, is best achieved by
progressive educational methods.
</P>
<P>
   There have been recent signs that the politics of education is
belatedly becoming more sophisticated. As long ago as the 1930s,
Antonio Gramsci, a brilliant Communist opponent of Mussolini,
denounced the new ``progressive'' ideas that were being introduced
into Italy from the United States. He argued that social justice
required educational conservatism because only if the poor worked
hard in school to accumulate the ``intellectual baggage'' of the
rich could they earn money and wield the levers of power. Gramsci,
the Communist, serving on a modern American school board, might
surprise fellow board members by voting with Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   So might James S. Coleman. Progressive methods failed
disadvantaged students, he concluded after a decade of inquiries
into the implications of his famous 1966 report, ``Equality of
Educational Opportunity.'' What people remember about his 1966
report is that schools appear to count for little in determining
educational achievement, whereas family background matters a great
deal. This statistical fact upset many people, including Coleman,
because it dashes the democratic hope of giving all students an
equal chance by simply putting rich and poor together in the same
common school. If the common school does not in fact reduce the
advantages of wealth and privilege, then the premises of democratic
education must be re-examined.
</P>
<P>
   After the Coleman report, one had a choice of two positions: one
could become an advocate of compensatory education to narrow the
achievement gap between groups, or one could adopt the determinist
view that the schools can do little to rectify the ills of the
wider society. The deterministic position, which excuses the
schools for failing to reduce the test-score gap between groups, is
widely held in the American educational world. But after further
research, Coleman adopted the compensatory position.
</P>
<P>
   Published in the '80's, that research showed that most Roman
Catholic schools were better at achieving equity than most public
schools. Catholic schools followed a rich and demanding curriculum,
required a lot of drill and practice, and expected every child to
reach minimal goals in each subject during the year. As a result
disadvantaged children prospered academically, as did their
advantaged peers, and the schools narrowed the gap between races
and social classes.
</P>
<P>
   This deeper inquiry of Coleman's started a controversy almost as
fierce as the one surrounding his 1966 report. It was seen as an
attack on public schools, but, as Coleman unanswerably pointed out,
his findings were not limited to Catholic schools; the very same
democratic results were being achieved by the few public schools
that defied progressivist doctrine. Consistent with that finding is
the fact that recent improvements in equity have been achieved only
by school reforms that use conservative methods like drill and
practice (e.g., the Success for All program at Johns Hopkins) and a
demanding curriculum (e.g., the ``Core Knowledge'' series of
books).
</P>
<P>
   After so many practical failures, few educational experts
overtly label themselves progressivists, but one can detect de
facto progressivists by certain distinctive traits. First, there is
their belief that knowledge and skill will be gained incidentally
from intensive study of a few subjects. This incidental method
claims, against all evidence, to achieve greater depth, as if there
were a simple trade-off between depth and breadth. A claim is made
under various labels and slogans such as ``the project method'' and
``less is more'' that exposure to a few complex experiences will
cause understanding to occur naturally, an idea that first gained
currency during the Romantic movement.
</P>
<P>
   The persistent attractions of this ``natural'' method may
possibly be explained by the vestigial Romanticism of American
culture, but as Lisa Delpit observes in her book ``Other People's
Children,'' the progressivist mode of teaching has consistently
failed to benefit African-American children (and many advantaged
children as well).
</P>
<P>
   Another mark of progressivism (and another vestige of the
Romantic movement) is its criticism of an ``overemphasis'' on
language. Emerson said: ``We are shut up in schools and college
recitation rooms for 10 or 15 years and come out at last with a
bellyful of words and do not know a thing.'' But as Ms. Delpit
points out, these antiverbal ideas have done the most harm to the
most disadvantaged students. Their greatest deficits are in
vocabulary and the conventions of literate language; they make up
math deficits much more readily than language deficits.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Stanovich and his colleagues have shown that a score on a
standardized reading test in first grade is the best predictor of
11th-grade academic achievement, a shocking indictment of
present-day schools and a powerful illustration of the accuracy of
standardized tests and of the centrality of verbal training for
determining life chances.
</P>
<P>
   Disparagement of objective tests is a third way to detect
progressivists. Their hostility to tests is not surprising, given
that progressive methods fail to improve test scores. Yet
standardized reading tests are among the most valid and reliable
assessments that exist and among the most important instruments for
measuring excellence and fairness in education. To take a reading
test, a student has to perform the very skill being assessed. These
tests, even in their much-maligned multiple-choice forms, are
highly correlated with each other and with real-world reading
skills.
</P>
<P>
   Competence in reading (that is in comprehension) is central to
academic achievement and to participation in economic and political
life. High school graduates who read well enough to get into top
colleges know about 100,000 words, which means an average learning
rate of more than 15 new words a day, an astonishing number
attainable only by wide reading and by psychological mechanisms
that are only beginning to be understood.
</P>
<P>
   A broad vocabulary is an index to broad knowledge, and broad
knowledge, extended over time, is the key to depth of knowledge and
to a general ability to learn new things.
</P>
<P>
   Since the late '60s it has been known that high literacy entails
prior background knowledge over many different domains. Within a
given literate culture, the most literacy-enhancing background
knowledge can be identified and taught to all students. Theory
predicts that teaching such a high-octane curriculum will raise
everyone's reading and learning levels and narrow the achievement
gap between social groups. This prediction has now been confirmed
by independent researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Teaching a curriculum that produces high literacy for all is a
potent way of fostering the egalitarian goal of democratic
education. But before we can advance toward that goal on a broad
front, many progressivist ideas will have to be discarded.

IMAGE OF TEACHERS HAS CHANGED OVER THE YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The first day back is always a killer.
</P>
<P>
   My bride worked late, doing paperwork and organizing stuff in
the classroom. I wasn't surprised that I'd arrived home before she
did. When she came through the front door, a forlorn expression
shrouded her face.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the matter?` I asked.
</P>
<P>
   She smiled wanly. ``They're gone, so many of my friends. I was
back at school today, and they weren't. It wasn't the same.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the other day, when school started up again. Last
spring, the school where my wife teaches was hit with a huge wave
of retirements. Nearly a millennium of teaching experience vanished
when those people hit 55 and split at half-pay pensions.
</P>
<P>
   New York's Tier One retirement plan is amazing. Any Tier One
government worker who stays until normal retirement age either has
really expensive bad habits or a serious mental disorder. That's
why the governor and the Legislature finally did away with it.
</P>
<P>
   The teachers who retired in June from my wife's school had
entered the profession in the late 1960s and early 1970s. It was a
time when teaching enjoyed a deceptively romantic image.
</P>
<P>
   Sidney Poitier was the ideal teacher in, ``To Sir, With Love.''
Belle Kaufman's ``Up the Down Staircase` was a best-seller. ``Room
222` was the hottest thing on network TV. In Bill Cosby's first TV
show with his own name on it, he played an affable gym teacher with
an Angela Davis afro. ``The White Shadow` was a Chicago Bulls
forward who'd quit the NBA to teach and find true career
gratification.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds quaint, doesn't it? Today, teachers are more often
reviled than revered, especially in blue-collar districts where
they earn more money than the average taxpayer.
</P>
<P>
   It take almost as long to earn the master's degree that teaching
demands as it does to get an M.B.A. or a law degree, fields where
starting salaries far outstrip what beginning teaching jobs pay.
</P>
<P>
   And science majors? Math majors? Go into teaching? Bite your
tongue.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that the job isn't really as romantic as it once was
presented. Ask any teacher. Kids are out of control. Administrators
are so terrified of parents and the parents' lawyers that teachers
seldom are backed in matters of discipline. Classrooms overflow. In
urban districts, and in the older suburbs, the school buildings
themselves literally are falling apart.
</P>
<P>
   The result, not surprisingly, is a huge teacher shortage, both
nationwide and in my state of New York. In the next 10 years,
nearly half of the nation's 4 million teachers -- and New York's
206,000 -- will retire.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning teachers endure a few years of low pay and rotten
conditions. Then they dust off their degrees and split for more
lucrative occupations. Nearly one in four new teachers gets out
within three years. Roughly half have laid down skid marks by the
five-year mark. At 10 years, three in six have ditched the
profession.
</P>
<P>
   This is happening, by the way, at a time when the student
population is projected to grow by 12 percent nationwide in the
next decade and by nearly that percentage in New York. New York
City alone will need as many as 40,000 new teachers within the next
five years.
</P>
<P>
   Later this month, U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer will propose a
``Marshall Plan for Teachers.'' He wants to spend $15 billion over
five years to recruit and retain teachers nationally. Schumer would
forgive undergraduate loans if new teachers hang in five years. His
plan would offer special benefits to new math and science teachers.
</P>
<P>
   It's a complex proposal, and it certainly won't solve all the
problems the public schools face. But it might solve the most
pressing and immediate problem. That's this: These cushy teaching
jobs?
</P>
<P>
   Too few people qualified to do the work are willing to put up
with the grief that comes along with it.
</P>

   GA-INSURANCETAX _ ATLANTA _ Georgia's hefty insurance premium
tax has been a gold mine for the state and local governments, but
critics say the tax has spoiled the state's opportunity to develop
into a national insurance hub. Because Georgia charges insurers one
of the higest premium tax rates in the country, at more than twice
the national average, other states routinely penalize Georgia-based
insurers by imposing a retaliatory tax on them when they do
business outside Georgia. The tax penalty has discouraged big
insurers from moving their headquarters here and has driven several
Georgia-based insurance companies out of other states. State
insurance commissioner John Oxendine hopes to get the tax repealed
or at least reduced so Georgia can compete with lower-taxation
states. (Mantius, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

Insurance America Inc. in Macon, figures he'll need to move his

   MEXICO-COMEDY-$ADV11 _ MEXICO CITY _ Mexican presidential
candidate Manuel Bartlett confessed to cheating on a French exam so
he could get a scholarship. Candidate Vicente Fox submitted to
being part of a comic sketch. Candidates gunning to become the next
president of Mexico in 2000 are going on television talk shows
similiar to the Tonight Show with Jay Leno or the Late Show with
David Letterman. It's a phenomenon unheard of before this year's
unprecedented political season. Chalk it up to Mexicans testing the
boundaries of freedom of speech and to candidates actually having
to compete for office as Mexico's leaps toward greater democracy.

   GERMANY-SYNAGOGUE -$ADV11 _ DRESDEN Germany _ Sixty-one years
after the Nazis burned the century-old temple to the ground,
Dresden Jews plan to break ground soon an a new synagogue, the
first new place for Jews to worship in what was East Germany since
before WWII. Before the war, there were 6,000 Jews in Dresden.
After the war, there were fewer than 100. But with the end of the
Cold War, Jews again are moving to Dresden, which is now now to
more than 250 Jews with more coming all the time. Yet, the backers
of the new temple are more than $5 million short of the
approximately $20 million needed to build the temple. They wonder
what to think of this given the fact that more than $200 million
was raised easily to rebuild the major protestant chuch, which was
destroyed in Allied bombing. (Roughton, Cox News Service). WITH

   GA-INSURANCETAX _ ATLANTA _ Georgia's hefty insurance premium
tax has been a gold mine for the state and local governments, but
critics say the tax has spoiled the state's opportunity to develop
into a national insurance hub. Because Georgia charges insurers one
of the higest premium tax rates in the country, at more than twice
the national average, other states routinely penalize Georgia-based
insurers by imposing a retaliatory tax on them when they do
business outside Georgia. The tax penalty has discouraged big
insurers from moving their headquarters here and has driven several
Georgia-based insurance companies out of other states. State
insurance commissioner John Oxendine hopes to get the tax repealed
or at least reduced so Georgia can compete with lower-taxation
states. (Mantius, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

 &HT;    ATTN EDs: adds news 9-13 grafs with update on Texas Rangers
probe and lawsuit
 &HT;    DANFORTH TRIES TO DRAW LIMITS FOR WACO PROBE
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ So far, Jack Danforth has only a team of three
lawyers, including himself, for his daunting new job of finding the
truth about the federal assault outside of Waco, Texas, six years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, an essential first phase concludes this weekend: his
public visibility.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Cox Newspapers Friday, and a blitz of
television appearances through Sunday, the former Missouri senator
said his strategy has been to set precise and narrow boundaries for
his investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to focus exclusively on Waco and the events of
that day,'' when the FBI led a tear-gas assault on the Branch
Davidian compound that exploded into an inferno and some 80 people
died, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He is promising to tell the country if government officials
killed civilians, if the military had an improper involvement, and
if there was a cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   Answering those questions is crucial, he said. ``It relates to
something fundamental to our country _ the confidence that the
American people have in their government.'' And that's why he
accepted the task, the former Republican lawmaker said.
</P>
<P>
   What he won't do, he stressed again and again, is decide whether
the FBI used poor judgment in raiding the cult headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Having made those points, Danforth plans to disappear from
public view for the next months, delving into mountains of evidence
and the stacks of documents from past, failed Waco probes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on Friday, a report of theTexas Rangers'
investigation of the Waco affair were delivered by overnight
courier to the House Committee on Government Reform. A spokesman
said the report would be reviewed over the weekend by the
committee's staff but would not be released by the committee.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman, Mark Corallo, said he understood the Texas
Department of Public Safety intended to make it public on Monday by
posting it to an Internet web page.
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, the Austin American-Statesmen filed a lawsuit under
the Texas Open Records Act, seeking to force the state agency to
release the subpoenaed records immediately, rather than holding
them until Monday. The Austin American-Statesman is owned by Cox
Newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   In its suit, the paper argued that in admitting that the records
were public information and choosing to withhold them until Monday,
the department was ``presuming to decide what information the
public needs to know and when the public needs to know it.''
</P>
<P>
   A judge was hearing arguments in the suit late Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from his law office in St. Louis, Mo., Danforth
expressed confidence that he had ``every investigative tool''
necessary to search out the truth. If criminal wrongdoing is found,
``we will prosecute,'' he said. ``We have absolute latitude to
follow this wherever it leads.''
</P>
<P>
   And if the Justice Department tries to restrict his
investigation in any way?
</P>
<P>
   ``You will hear about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the public may hear very little from the Danforth
probe until it issues a final report.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth also promised a probe free of news leaks, which would
be a sharp contrast to the independent counsel investigation of
President Bill Clinton in the Monica Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they leak, they're gone,'' Danforth said of his soon-to-be
chosen staff for the St. Louis-based operation. He has picked the
local U.S. attorney and long-time associate Edward L. Dowd Jr. as
the full-time overseer of the investigation. Danforth and Dowd will
be paid $118,000 each annually.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth's law partner, Thomas Schweich, has also joined the
effort.
</P>
<P>
   Other details are still not sketched out. Yet to be decided: How
many people to hire, whether he needs a Washington office, or how
much funding will be required. He has 60 days to complete his
budget. And he plans to recruit private lawyers and government
investigators from agencies which are not targets of the probe.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth will continue to practice law and work on his community
and charitable projects. Even so, he said, ``I will be personally
very deeply involved in this.''
</P>
<P>
   An ordained Episcopal minister, he will continue assisting at
services at the Church of the Holy Communion in University City,
where he is an associate priest. His religious role has been cited
for adding to the credibility of his investigation.
</P>
<P>
   However, Danforth discussed the effect of his church work in
only the most general terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``You bring to any job what you are,'' he said. ``That's what I
am. You are the totality of your experience.''

BACK TO SCHOOL, ONE LAST TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JANE GANAHL  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Some parts of the back-to-school ritual are more
pleasant than others.
</P>
<P>
   I always liked shoe shopping for my daughter. It enabled me to
get a gander at the new fall styles for myself _ and dressing her
up like the little china doll she was.
</P>
<P>
   I even liked loading up on school supplies, including the newest
pencils that were not only fluorescent, but edible.
</P>
<P>
   Other aspects of the yearly first trip down the walkway to the
classroom were less rewarding. I have vivid memories of looking
straight into my painfully shy daughter's tear-filled eyes, telling
her to be brave, assuring her she would enjoy herself ... and then
prying her little fingers off my leg, feeling like the meanest,
least empathetic mother in the world.
</P>
<P>
   And then I'd cry. Because she was getting older, because I was
getting older, because time and the state were having their way
with us. Because her constant, puckish laugh filled the house like
helium, and I'd miss that.
</P>
<P>
   What a relief that we all mature. Sort of.
</P>
<P>
   As she heads off this week for her senior year in college back
East, we are faced with our 16th and final back-to-school ritual.
And I think we just might have it mastered. I hear her talking on
the phone to her housemate, discussing her senior thesis (should
she go with wetlands legislation?), their furniture situation,
getting her internship research published.
</P>
<P>
   And I'm still thinking shoes.
</P>
<P>
   She is well set with casual ones, but could use a new pair of
sturdy hiking boots to get through the Maine winter. (On the other
hand, I could use some new ankle boots.) She needs some socks, too
_ the kind you can only buy in outdoor stores. Some new gloves. No
edible pencils _ but how about that new software?
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, the back-to-school dance is complicated by the
distance betwixt here and there. Running out of time before her
departure, she begs me to send this last box to Maine after she's
gone. A casual glance at the overflow reveals an odd mix of CDs,
some tokens that belonged to her adored late grandmother, surfing
magazines, photos of me.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of her looking at those at 1 a.m. on a frigid New
England night while writing her thesis, and missing me, makes my
throat constrict.
</P>
<P>
   Our relationship has also changed. This summer we became grownup
friends. I am stunned by this formerly awkward and sensitive
child's grace and aplomb. And she no longer thinks I'm such a dork.
Now that she's 21, there's no avenue of my life she can't walk
down. No club she can't walk into. This has made for some
interesting moments.
</P>
<P>
   And I can no longer boss her around _ even a little bit.
</P>
<P>
   Which sort of makes sense since she usually does the right
thing.
</P>
<P>
   The only really heated debate this summer had to do with her
taking six months or a year off before applying to law school at
Duke.
</P>
<P>
   I tell her I think this is a bad idea. She tells me _ adamantly
_ to back off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not open for discussion,'' she says, throwing her opinion
at me like a dart. How dare she? That was my job.
</P>
<P>
   The trip to the airport is filled with last-minute chat about
Christmas, when she will next come home. She is charged up, excited
to see her friends and her boyfriend. Her favorite professor is
having a reception; she's thinking of calling this state senator
about an internship.
</P>
<P>
   But as they announce her flight, it's suddenly like we're
standing again outside classroom 2-A at Woodside Elementary School.
Her big blue eyes fill with tears and she clutches my hand, as if
suddenly doubting the very idea of leaving home. She tells me she
loves me.
</P>
<P>
   Me too, I tell her, resolute as always. Have a wonderful
semester. Go forth and be amazing.
</P>
<P>
   She smiles and is gone. Alone, it's time for my part in the
ritual: a good cry, because she is grown and there are no more of
them to look forward to.

COMMENTARY: INCOMING COLLEGE FRESHMEN: WHAT THEY DO AND DON'T
KNOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Monday, Sept. 13)  
(lh) 
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new crop of young people is trooping off to college, which
means its time for the rest of us to feel old and useless and
wallow in self-pity.
</P>
<P>
   Helping us in that regard are some good folks in Wisconsin at
Beloit College who recently gave us an idea of what American
popular culture does and doesn't mean to the average 18-year-old
incoming freshman (freshperson?).
</P>
<P>
   Young people born in the year 1981, for example, have probably
never dialed a telephone.
</P>
<P>
   PCs, NutraSweet and AIDS have been around their entire lives.
(You are showing your age if you think these things are somehow
interconnected.)
</P>
<P>
   Three Mile Island, Jonestown and the Panama Canal Treaty all
happened before they were born.
</P>
<P>
   They recognize the moonwalk as a Michael Jackson dance step, not
a Neil Armstrong ``giant step.''
</P>
<P>
   Ketchup has always been a vegetable to them.
</P>
<P>
   They have never seen white smoke over the Vatican and do not
know its significance.
</P>
<P>
   For all they know, ``Squeaky'' Fromme was a singer at Lillith
Fair, not a Charles Manson disciple and attempted assassin of
President Gerald Ford.
</P>
<P>
   They do not remember Gerald Ford pardoning Richard Nixon, Jimmy
Carter lusting in his heart or that brief, chilling moment when
Alexander Haig declared himself ``in charge.''
</P>
<P>
   The artist formerly known as Prince was 21 years old when they
were born.
</P>
<P>
   By the time they were born, punk rock was on its way out.
</P>
<P>
   They never heard Walter Cronkite say ``That's the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   For them, there has always been a woman on the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   For them, John Belushi and John Lennon have always been dead.
</P>
<P>
   Time began for them the year Prince Charles and Lady Diana
Spencer got married.
</P>
<P>
   Mount St. Helens has never erupted in their lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   They have always known strikes by highly paid athletes to be a
routine part of professional athletics.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, they have no recollection of President
Carter's boycott of the 1980 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The movies ``The Empire Strikes Back,'' ``The Shining,''
``Alien'' and ``Apocalypse Now'' all came out before they were
born.
</P>
<P>
   The year after they were born, in 1982, the box-office smash was
``E.T.'' In 1953, the year after this old, tired columnist was
born, the hit movie was ``Shane.''
</P>
<P>
   Some things haven't changed that much. The year the class of
2003 was born, reports condemned violence on television and in
Hollywood films for producing the likes of John Hinckley. Today,
reports condemn violence on television and in Hollywood films for
producing the likes of Columbine.
</P>
<P>
   For the class of 2003, ``Cats'' has been on Broadway all their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   They never heard anyone say ``Book  &UR; ' &LR; em, Dano,'' ``Good night,
John-boy'' or ``Kiss my grits'' in prime &UR;  &LR; time.
</P>
<P>
   As far as they know, Yugoslavia never existed. They have always
been able to get their news from USA Today and CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the class of 2003 is familiar with a lot of things
that fuddy-duddies of my generation are not. In about 30 years,
they can use this knowledge to write a similarly smug,
sanctimonious column about the class of 2033.
</P>
<P>
   People born in 1981:
</P>
<P>
   1. Have owned and know how to operate a ``trapper keeper.''
</P>
<P>
   2. Know the meaning of ``Wax on, wax off.''
</P>
<P>
   3. Can name at least half the members of the ``Brat Pack.''
</P>
<P>
   4. Know who Tina Yothers is.
</P>
<P>
   5. Wanted to be on ``Star Search.''
</P>
<P>
   6. HAD to have their MTV.
</P>
<P>
   7. Collected Garbage Pail Kids.
</P>
<P>
   8. Remember when Atari was the state-of-the-art video game
system.
</P>
<P>
   9. Owned, or knew someone who owned, a Swatch watch.
</P>
<P>
   10. Thought ``Dirty Dancing'' was a REALLY good movie.

 &HT;    Melodies evoke sense of historical importance
 &HT;    By Douglas Belkin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Stephanie Shore is adamant about the
word used to describe her work tonight. It is not a performance, it
is a prayer. And the 2,000 people in the sanctuary at Boca Raton's
Congregation B'nai Israel who will listen to her _ and in some
cases cry because of her _ are not an audience, they are a
congregation who will be praying as well.
</P>
<P>
   At no time during the Jewish year does the cantor become as
central to the life of the Jewish community as he or she will this
week. The distinctive, emotional chanting of Hebrew prayers is a
part of Jewish liturgy year-round, but during the Ten Days of Awe
it bears on its back centuries of sorrow, of pride, of fear and of
hope.
</P>
<P>
   The period between Rosh Hashana, which begins Friday at sundown,
and Yom Kippur, which starts on Sept. 19, is a time for Jews to ask
God for forgiveness for their sins and to give them another year of
life.
</P>
<P>
   On Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, tradition has it that God
makes that decision, and the haunting and almost visceral music
that accompanies the holidays is reflective not only of that
life-and-death import but of the history through which the music
has welled up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's encoded in our DNA, it wakes up something deep
within us,'' Shore said. ``It really is the thread that weaves our
tapestry together as a Jewish people.''
</P>
<P>
   In synagogues around the world, congregations will welcome the
year 5760 with many of the same prayers and many of the same
melodies, and it will be the cantor who will deliver them. On the
new year, the cantor is invested with an almost otherworldly
responsibility to relate to God the prayers of the entire
congregation through ancient melodies.
</P>
<P>
   And while some synagogues will incorporate a choir, a cello or
another string instrument into the service, the focus will be on
the words of the prayer as delivered through the voice of the
cantor. Because many American Jews do not read or understand
Hebrew, the melody of the prayer becomes even more integral to the
meaning of the holiday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be able to inspire the congregation,'' said Rita
Shore, the cantor at Temple Judea in West Palm Beach and the mother
of Stephanie Shore. ``I want to be a worthy channel for God's
voice. If I can help (the congregation) to pray, that's a wonderful
feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   To reach the point of being an effective conduit, an invested
cantor studies three or four years after college, learning
thousands of Hebrew prayers as well as the ability to read Hebrew
music through an intricate series of 28 small marks that accompany
every word in the Torah. Each of these markings, called
cantilations, represents more than a note _ it represents ``a
mini-musical phrase,'' said Cantor Paul Offenkrantz of Temple
Israel in West Palm Beach. The cantilation is translated
differently, depending on where it appears.
</P>
<P>
   The chants, which date back in some cases more than 2,500 years,
serve two purposes: to help people remember the prayers and to
invest them with an emotional energy and a sense of urgency.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a passage in the Talmud that says someone who reads
the Torah without a melody is not doing it the proper way,'' said
Cantor Bernard Beer, the director of the Belz School of Music at
Yeshiva University in New York. ``The melody can make the prayer
mean more.''
</P>
<P>
   In many synagogues, the most anticipated prayer of this week is
Kol Nidre, which translates to All My Vows. It was written not in
Hebrew but in Aramaic as a contract between man and God at a time
when Jews were often forced to swear they were abandoning Judaism.
The Kol Nidre says that all oaths and promises that were made
between last Yom Kippur and this one are null and void, said Cantor
Ann Turnoff of Temple Beth-El in Boca Raton.
</P>
<P>
   The prayer is traditionally sung a few minutes into the evening
Yom Kippur service and often evokes tears in the congregation.
Though musically it is not the most difficult prayer to chant, it
is challenging in that the melodies soar through several notes on a
single syllable to emphasize the importance of the meaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kol Nidre has really kind of taken on a life of its own,''
Turnoff said. ``I think it has almost become a watchword of our
persecution through the centuries.''
</P>
<P>
   To get ready for the High Holy Days, which can incorporate three
services a day for two or three days, most cantors begin preparing
in June or July, strengthening their bodies, their voices and their
spirits.
</P>
<P>
   Many synagogues with volunteer choirs often fill out their sound
with a few ringers during the High Holy Days. Temple Emanu-El in
Palm Beach usually brings in three or four professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Gordan Longhofer is a Baptist with a deep bass voice who sings
in his church choir as well as professionally. He has been singing
at Temple Emanu-El during the High Holy Days for 10 years and finds
the music very lyrical and rich in harmonies _ and at times very
mournful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the music (in the synagogue) tends to be a little more
formal, to reflect tradition and a very proper mourning for the
Holocaust,'' Longhofer said. ``There's a lot to be said for binding
yourself to tradition because you know where you come from, you
know where you're going and there's a lot of respect for the people
who came before you.''
</P>
<P>
   The expectations of the congregation and that rich tradition
raise the bar for cantors. Beer has been a cantor for more than a
quarter of a century, but the butterflies in his stomach always
reappear at this time if year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if you don't get nervous, you're not supposed to be a
cantor,'' Beer said.

HOUSE MEMBERS URGE CUTOFF IN INTERNATIONAL AID TO INDONESIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: STANDS for budgeted TIMOR-CONGRESS)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A group of House members pressed for legislation
Friday that would require the United States to officially oppose
any more International Monetary Fund and World Bank loans to
Indonesia until violence in East Timor has ended.
</P>
<P>
   While the two international financial institutions have already
suspended funding under a $49 billion aid package they negotiated
last year with the vast archipelago nation, the legislation is
intended to send a strong message to the Indonesian government,
said Rep. Ken Bentsen, D-Texas, the primary sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sends a very clear message ... that we are quite serious
about pulling the economic plug that will sink the country,''
Bentsen said. The legislation, if adopted by Congress, would ``only
strengthen the hand of the U.S. government,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bentsen, a member of the House Banking Committee, which oversees
U.S. activities in international financial institutions, has been a
longtime supporter of loans to Indonesia. However, he said its role
in the bloodletting, arson and forced evacuation of residents of
East Timor since the tiny province voted on Aug. 30 for
independence persuaded him to reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us can stand by and continue to provide taxpayer
dollars ... for a government that has not lifted a finger to stop
violence against its people,'' Bentsen said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the referendum in East Timor, hundreds of people,
including Catholic priests and nuns, are reported to have been
slaughtered by anti-independence militias backed by segments of the
Indonesian military.
</P>
<P>
   East Timor, a former Portuguese colony of about 800,000, was
invaded and annexed by Indonesia, a nation of more than 200 million
people, in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Bentsen's bill would permanently halt loans to Indonesia until
President Clinton certifies that the violence has been quelled.
Clinton has suspended military ties to Jakarta and has strongly
rebuked the government there for allowing what he called ``gross
abuses'' of human rights in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   The United States contributes about 15 percent of the
International Monetary Fund's budget, and it has considerable
influence over existing loans and veto power over new credit.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's economy, which was devastated by the Asian economic
crisis, has improved recently, largely because of the infusion of
billions of dollars of aid funneled through the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., a member of the House
Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, co-sponsored the
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day that goes by, there is more killing in East Timor,''
Pelosi said at the news conference. ``The message has to get
through that they must stop the slaughter and butchery there'' and
that ``there is a price to pay'' for the massacres.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bruce F. Vento, D-Minn., a senior member of the House
banking panel and another co-sponsor of the legislation, said
international loans to Indonesia should be halted for economic as
well as humanitarian reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this kind of chaos and anarchy, there can be no kind of
free market system that functions,'' Vento said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., said Gen. Wiranto, Indonesia's armed
forces commander, ``is making himself one of the greatest villains
of history. He is perpetuating one of the greatest slaughters in
history.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank also criticized the Clinton administration for not being
tougher on Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been warning (White House officials) for some time
that the signals they have been sending have been ambivalent at
best.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank also said the case for military intervention in East Timor
``is far stronger than it was in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Bentsen's measure is also co-sponsored by Republican Rep. John
Edward Porter of Illinois and Democratic Reps. Steny H. Hoyer of
Maryland, Robert A. Weygand of Rhode Island, Darlene Hooley of
Oregon and Nita M. Lowey of New York.

WISCONSIN FIRM EYES OCEAN SPRAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   An executive for a Wisconsin cranberry company told the
Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Friday he may be interested in a
strategic alliance with embattled rival Ocean Spray Cranberries
Inc., which is exploring merger options.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might make sense to merge brands,'' said John Swendrowski,
chief executive of Northland Cranberries Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a cranberry glut and stiff competition, Ocean Spray
recently hired Bain &AMP; Co., a Boston strategic consulting firm, to
explore a range of options, including mergers.
</P>
<P>
   During a telephone interview, Swendrowski said he had not
contacted Ocean Spray, and his suggestion for a strategic merger
was made during an interview with a Milwaukee reporter who was
writing a story about the future of Ocean Spray, which has many
growers in Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will look at everything,'' Ocean Spray spokesman Chris
Phillips said, but he added Northland's overture ``was 100 percent
speculation on their part'' and that Ocean Spray has not had any
formal discussions with possible merger partners.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, A.D. Makepeace Co., Ocean Spray's largest
shareholder, urged the Lakeville, Mass. cooperative to consider
merging with a global company with major marketing resources.
</P>
<P>
   Firms that might fit that description include the Coca-Cola Co.,
Quaker Oats Co., and Cadbury Schweppes PLC.
</P>
<P>
   But speculation has centered on Pepsi-Cola Co. as perhaps the
most logical candidate to buy all or part of Ocean Spray.
</P>
<P>
   Ocean Spray has a distribution agreement with Pepsi, though that
agreement is the subject of a pending lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman said Pepsi doesn't ``comment on rumors.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert L. Rosbe Jr., Makepeace's vice president of finance, said
he had no comment on Northland's offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our focus is to educate growers'' about the merits of a
possible strategic merger, he said. ``The issue of who a merger
partner should be will be addressed by Bain.''
</P>
<P>
   Bain referred all comment to Ocean Spray.
</P>
<P>
   With about $200 million in annual sales, Northland hardly
qualifies as a global giant, but Swendrowski said an alliance
between the two cranberry growers still might make sense for Ocean
Spray, which has about $1.5 billion in annual revenues.
</P>
<P>
   While Northland is a publicly traded company, Ocean Spray is a
cooperative.
</P>
<P>
   As such, Ocean Spray may be hard pressed on its own to finance
new initiatives that could help it regain the momentum it enjoyed
in the early 1990s, Swendrowski suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``A cooperative can only get money from borrowing or getting it
from their growers,'' he said. But if there were an alliance
between Ocean Spray and Northland, ``we could take a plan to the
investment community and raise money.''
</P>
<P>
   An alliance between Ocean Spray and Northland could be ``a
solution for growers that's better than anything else,'' one that
leaves them as part of a ``cranberry focused'' company rather than
as a small part of a big beverage empire, Swendrowski said.

9/9/99, APOCALYPSE NOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The dread date of 9/9/99 passed and nothing bad
happened except some thunder and light ning that blew a lot of us
out of bed in the morning. Alas, it wasn't a comet destroying the
Earth, the Antichrist arriving at SFO (but who ever arrives there
on time?) or the sound of computers crashing.
</P>
<P>
   Now we have to live without the threat of an apocalypse for
another three months. Don't you hate it when that happens? Or
doesn't happen? The ninth day of the ninth month of the 1999th year
A.D. was supposed to be as big a deal as finding three upside-down
nines on a kid's skull. So much for all the bits and bytes expended
on the Internet by numerologists and computer glitch fans.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers 9999 used to mean ``end of file'' in some old
computer languages, but the predicted preview of a mini-Y2K crash
never occurred. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson made a big public
relations display of showing that the nation's energy grid still
worked.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, folks, the power was still on, and computers were working
as badly as ever.
</P>
<P>
   The Niners don't look good and Willie Brown still is dressed to
the nines and has nine lives. That's it in the 9 department.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans don't give a hoot about numerology, except on
birthdays. But we love potential apocalypses, and have a way of
looking for a new apocalypse when an old one goes pop.
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it, mass disorder or death in Biblical proportions
beats the heck out of living alone in a messy apartment or being
run over by a bus.
</P>
<P>
   Not having to go to work because civilization collapsed is
easier than trying to come up with some other excuse.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of having a perfect society rise from the ashes
of the old is more satisfying to think about than George W.
</P>
<P>
   Bush or Al Gore as president.
</P>
<P>
   We don't have much in the way of community anymore, so the idea
of surviving communally is attractive. It's easier than trying to
get to know those neighbors with the yappy dogs.
</P>
<P>
   These are the reasons Y2Whatever stuff is a big deal. We don't
care if computers go blank. Most of us want them to go blank. The
problem is that our heads and lives are blank, so we fill them with
extreme dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Those dreams have spawned their own cheapo literature.
</P>
<P>
   A book called ``Y2K Crisis: Doomsday 2000'' advertises dried
food and guns and ammo. ``Y2K: The Millennium Bug'' celebrates the
turn of the year, when well-armed survivalists in the desert can
slaughter pillagers from the cities.
</P>
<P>
   Haven't we heard of that one before, back when folks were
building bomb shelters in preparation for nuclear apocalypse?
</P>
<P>
   On the left, we have books on Y2Kommunes, such as ``The Simple
Living Journal's Y2K Preparation Guide: 110 Ways to Create a
Sustainable Life _ Crisis or Not.''
</P>
<P>
   But will we have to wear headbands and sing folk songs?
Obviously, many Americans need to get a life, sustainable or
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   In the good old Old Testament days, an apocalypse really meant
something. The world burned for decades and Beelzebub strode
through the flames.
</P>
<P>
   The apocalypse wasn't a bunch of computers getting confused
about what year it is.
</P>
<P>
   In the Middle Ages, hell was portrayed by painter Hieronymus
Bosch as crammed with devils with weird appendages molesting
naughty women and duck-monsters swallowing gluttonous men.
</P>
<P>
   Hell wasn't having your ATM go down.
</P>
<P>
   If that's what hell and the apocalypse are like, imagine how
disappointing heaven will be. It'll probably have cubicles.
</P>
<P>
   While the thunder boomed and the lightning flashed through the
sky early in the morning of 9/9/99, I began rethinking the end of
the world.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a good apocalypse is that you survive.
</P>
<P>
   You're supposed to be part of a cult of chosen people, an elite
militia band or a savvy and kind commune. Or else you're a
self-sufficient Rambo or Thoreau.
</P>
<P>
   You aren't supposed to be huddling in bed, listening to the
windows rattling, wondering if lightning strikes are going to set
the hills on fire.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of apocalypse burns you and only a couple of thousand
other people, at most, out of their homes? Precisely the kind we
had in the Oakland hills in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Up close and personal, apocalettes like fires, landslides and
earthquakes aren't very appealing. It's hard to know why some
people want to move up to final battles between the forces of good
and evil.
</P>
<P>
   It's even harder to know why other people fear numbers coded in
computers. No computer crash ever sounded like a eucalyptus tree
exploding in the hills of Berkeley or a building falling in the
Marina.
</P>
<P>
   But we're ready for anything, if all those spare flashlight
batteries haven't gone dead.
</P>
<P>
   Apocalypse next: Computer glitch fans say there is one more
possible computer glitch to worry about before New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   That's on Oct. 1, when the federal government begins the
1999-2000 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   What if the apocalypse happened, and the funding didn't come
through?

   TIMOR-RDP (Jakarta, Indonesia) _ No sooner had most of the staff
evacuated the besieged U.N. compound in East Timor on Friday, when
men with hand grenades menaced remaining workers and the 1,000
terrified refugees taking shelter there. Witnesses said the men
looted supplies with the help of uniformed soldiers and fired at
refugees who tried to flee. By Seth Mydans.
</P>
<P>
   NC-SCHOOL-BUSING (Charlotte, N.C.) _ The school system that
pioneered busing for desegregation 30 years ago was ordered to halt
the program Friday by a federal judge, who ruled that forced
integration was no longer necessary because all vestiges of prior
discrimination had disappeared. By Emily Yellin and David
Firestone.
</P>
<P>
   PUERTORICO-CLEMENCY (Chicago) _ After vowing to renounce
terrorism, some 11 members of a Puerto Rican nationalist group on
Friday walked out of federal prisons around the nation, granted
freedom by an act of clemency by President Clinton that sparked a
political firestorm in the White House and in the Senate race in
New York. By Dirk Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   NY-HEALTH-SCARES (New York) _ News analysis: Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani must tread carefully as he navigates the first real public
health crisis in his tenure. Both the mayor and public health
officials are challenged to appear extremely aggressive at
controlling the illness, which has claimed the lives of three
people, while at the same time quelling public hysteria. Indeed as
helicopters clatter ominously above the city dumping insecticide,
the mayor held a press conference in which he convivially chided
reporters for failing to wear socks. Vans with bull horns have
crawled down city streets, bellowing public health warnings, but
along those same streets, vans were set up with officials whose job
it was to calm a nervous public. By Jennifer Steinhauer.
</P>
<P>
   CALIF-INDIAN-CASINOS (Los Angeles) _ The state of California and
more than 50 tribes reached agreements overnight to keep Indian
casinos open; the agreements include a change in the allocation of
slot machines that could more than double their number. By Todd S.
Purdum.
</P>
<P>
   LABOR-GORE (Undated) _ The nation's labor movement is sharply
divided over how to handle its endorsement in next year's
presidential race election, with a bloc of powerful unions _ the
auto workers, steel workers and Teamsters _ expressing deep
dissatisfaction over the labor positions of Vice President Al Gore.
The divide pits service-sector and government-employee unions,
which wants to issue an endorsement of Gore as soon as possible,
against industrial unions, which complain that the Clinton
administration has done too little to prevent expanded trade from
wiping out thousands of jobs. By Steven Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   CONGRESS-TAX (Washington) _ Rep. Baron Hill, a moderate Democrat
from Indiana, spent a good part of August walking across his
district and talking with constituents about what to do with the
federal budget surplus. Perhaps not surprisingly for a Democrat, he
says he heard little enthusiasm for the $792 billion Republican tax
cutting plan, which President Clinton has pledged to veto. But he
heard a remarkably consistent call for Congress and the
administration to use the surplus for a purpose long supported by
economists but seen as a political yawner by both parties: reducing
the $3.6 trillion national debt, the financial hangover from
decades of deficit spending. By Richard W. Stevenson.

NEW SOUNDS ON THE SEINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Sept. 12)  
(lh) 
 By JAMES COLLARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the Quai Francois Mauriac in Paris, on the banks of the
Seine, two institutions are staking a claim to uphold the glory of
French culture. One is the late President Francois Mitterrand's
intimidating Bibliotheque Nationale. Most architecture critics
agree that while you can't fail to notice it, it is flawed as the
home for a working national library. But just across the street,
dwarfed by the library's four giant glass and steel towers, a boat
moored on the Seine, painted blood-red and illuminated by a bright
star atop the mast, is in its own small way doing something for
France.
</P>
<P>
   The boat is a nightclub called Le Batofar, and as one of the
preferred venues for parties given by some of the country's small,
cutting-edge record labels, it's the perfect starting point in a
quest for the new French pop music known variously as the French
touch, the French sound or even, in a phrase guaranteed to confuse
cinema fans, the French new wave.
</P>
<P>
   Known in France, that is. Ask most Americans to name a French
pop song and, in a pinch, they might recall Plastic Bertrand's late
1970s pogo dance hit ``Ca Plane Pour Moi,'' or the steamy '60s
anthem ``Je T'aime (Moi Non Plus)'' by Jane Birkin and Serge
Gainsbourg, or a chanson from Charles Aznavour (perhaps ``She,'' as
recently covered by Elvis Costello). Truth be told, the story of
pop music is essentially the story of music from the United States
and Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Ouch. It's a painful conclusion for a proud nation, and French
legislators have tried to hold back the anglophone invasion with a
kind of cultural Maginot line, insisting that at least 40 percent
of the music played on French radio be sung in French. But the real
challenge for French musicians is to produce pop that's
authentically French and that the rest of the world might actually
want to listen to.
</P>
<P>
   Which is where Le Batofar comes in. It is a vital port of call
for anyone pursuing the current French music scene, which in the
last year and a half has exported electronic-music acts that have
become international hits in clubs, on fashion runways and even on
MTV. What they have in common is a penchant for slightly cheesy
musical genres, many of them French, which they manage to send up
and reinvent as something new and exciting.
</P>
<P>
   Dimitri from Paris, a deejay and producer, has an album of
neo-lounge music, ``Sacrebleu,'' whose accordions have seduced club
goers worldwide. ``Moon Safari,'' an album by the duo known as Air,
was heard during a Nicole Miller fashion show in New York and on
MTV. Its harmonies are as lush as a Michel Legrand film score, and
its lyrical qualities are reminiscent of the '60s chanteuse
Francoise Hardy. (Miss Hardy herself enjoyed an unexpected vogue in
New York, with her old songs played in temples of swank like
Barneys New York and Balthazar.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks to Air, French people know that they can produce music
which isn't just copying what happens in the U.K. and the U.S.,
that they can do something which is from their French heritage, and
people outside will listen,'' said Philippe Grundlar, a co-founder
of Catalog Records in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Grundlar was the host of a party earlier this summer at Le
Batofar, where a number of his label's artists _ the newest to join
the new wave _ performed. Among the knot of club goers threading
their way over a gangplank were several foreign music journalists
keeping tabs on the French scene.
</P>
<P>
   Guests stepped gingerly across the deck, toward a doorway where
a young woman guarded a staircase leading down into the hold of the
ship. In the manner of front-door dominatrixes everywhere, she was
smiling but strict, checking off names from her clipboard. She knew
how to say ``I'm sorry, but your name's not on the list'' in
several languages.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Once inside the boat, a visitor can't help but feel that Le
Batofar is not most people's idea of a cultural showcase or, for
that matter, the most user-friendly nightclub. It is dimly lit, par
for the course, but the staircases are steep, the floor is uneven
and, all in all, it's not the kind of place to attempt after a
couple of cosmopolitans. It's a small venue, made all the more
intimate by the thought that one heedless step could send you and
your drink into noisy collision with cold steel. French touch
indeed.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the party seemed a world away from the energetic
dancing found in a Manhattan club, or the frenzied hedonism of
European club capitals like London and Berlin. Once inside the
boat's cavernous interior, it was a scene from ``An American in
Paris'' that sprang to mind: the one with Gene Kelly strutting his
stuff among the existentialists and Juliette Greco look-alikes in a
Left Bank dive.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The mood was almost _ dare one say it? _ intellectual. The crowd
of stylish, often beautiful young Parisians were taking their music
(and themselves) very seriously. In the absence of Gene Kelly, they
looked toward the stage, from which various French sounds were
emanating.
</P>
<P>
   First on was a handsome young Parisian known as Avia, with a
haunting, very slinky, very mellow, electronic sound. He is
Catalog's hottest new talent. In fact, this was the first time he
had played live, so he was nervous at the start, and very
unstarlike when congratulated afterward. Asked to define ``the
French sound'' or ``the French touch,'' he laughed and replied
modestly, ``I can only talk for myself and for my music, but for
me, I want my music to be _ how you say? _ welcoming.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He has succeeded, delivering a sound that makes the perfect
post-club chill-out music. But just what exactly does Avia share
with Air or Dimitri from Paris, or other successful French exports
like Cassius, a two-man deejay and production team, who wowed New
York's Twilo club earlier this year with a disco sound that draws
on their experience as producers of hip-hop and gangsta rap? Or
with Daft Punk, whose distinct brand of techno has won global
recognition under the banner of ``twisted disco''?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is that all share an interest in electronic music.
Not the booming thump of American house music, considered a bit
passe in France, but the more melodic sounds of easy listening
synthesizers _ a throwback that the French consider avant-garde.
They have long loved electronic music, said Frederic Sanchez, a
Parisian record-store owner and deejay. He added, ``Air's music
succeeds because it is very melodic, almost an easy sound, but it
seems so modern because it is electronic.''
</P>
<P>
   More than just a sound, ``electronic'' in France describes a
whole esthetic. French style and music magazines like Self Service,
Magic and Crash serve up cyber-imagery, futurist fashion and
features on techno dance music and ``les rythmes digitales'' to
eager hip consumers like the folks at Le Batofar.
</P>
<P>
   The folks at Le Batofar were looking a bit digital themselves,
funnily enough, as a kind of sci-fi installation that was projected
to the side of the stage spilled out and over their bright young
faces, pixilating them like something out of ``The Matrix.''
Williams Traffic took the stage. A thin rather earnest looking
young man sang and strutted a little with a guitar; another made
various startling noises on a keyboard, while a young, wild-haired
woman in a slip dress shuffled and pouted her away across the
stage.
</P>
<P>
   And the music? It fitted the one-word description offered by
Patrick Thevenin, a French music journalist, for the typical
Batofar sound: ``Difficult.'' Difficult to describe or simply
difficult? Thevenin laughed and repeated, ``Difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In France,'' he added, ``we have sometimes a distrust of
popular culture, in a way that doesn't perhaps apply in England or
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams Traffic's brand of electro-pop might not be welcoming,
but the audience lapped it up. One of the distinguishing features
of the French sound might not be a sound at all so much as an
approach to music that is distinctly French: namely, a
high-mindedness.
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly happy that the glory of French culture had been
musically upheld, the beautiful young people drifted out of Le
Batofar and onto the quai, beside the Seine. There, under the stars
and the towers of Mitterrand's library, they wandered off to cars
and motor scooters and taxis, saying goodbye and filling the air
with that most French sound of all: the sound of kissing.

 &HT;    Paralyzed patients control computer just by thinking about it
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Sept. 12.
 &HT;    By J. Matthew Aldag
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A paper sign is taped above the head of John Ray's
hospital bed. It says he likes watching country music on television
and that the overhead light hurts his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Ray would need several minutes on a good day to convey these
thoughts on his own: ``Kill the lights and turn on CMT!'' The
53-year-old Vietnam veteran has been rendered immobile by a
debilitating brain stroke and left speechless by a tracheotomy. Ray
can only blink his eyes to express how he feels _ two blinks for
yes, one for no.
</P>
<P>
   But those blinking eyelids are no longer the only windows to his
soul.
</P>
<P>
   An Emory University neurologist, Dr. Philip Kennedy, wants to
open those windows, build a double door and invite the world in.
Ray is a willing host.
</P>
<P>
   Ray is one of a few people in the world who are able to directly
control a computer with their minds. Bypassing the keystroke or
``double click,'' he can move a cursor around a computer screen
solely by willpower. The new technology _ a product of scientists'
increasing knowledge of how the brain functions _ translates the
electrical nerve cell signals in Ray's brain into signals a
computer can understand.
</P>
<P>
   If Kennedy and other specialists can refine the technology that
allows Ray to communicate, they may provide a remarkable new
communication tool for the estimated 1 million Americans each year
who suffer injuries or strokes that leave them unable to speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying to do is help locked-in patients communicate
by connecting their brain directly to a computer,'' Kennedy says.
Spelling it out
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy leans over Ray's hospital bed and inspects the tangle of
instruments that have become Ray's constant companions. They are
about to resume their regular training session.
</P>
<P>
   A computer screen is directly in front of Ray's face. On his
left, a collection of electronics stands ready: an oscilloscope,
amplifiers and a receiver made of an old black Patrolman SW-80
radio. On a cart to Ray's right are a speaker and another computer.
</P>
<P>
   Sensors are taped to Ray's left shoulder and above his left
eyebrow. A receiver rests between his head and pillow. A couple of
millimeters underneath his skull, an electrode is embedded in his
brain.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy checks his instruments. An assistant opens up a logbook
and says, ``Day 472.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy asks Ray to spell the name of his visitor: Matt.
</P>
<P>
   Ray furrows his eyebrows. The sensor taped to his forehead
registers the electrical activity of his muscle contractions. The
cursor in the upper left corner moves vertically down the screen in
front of him, which contains a grid of letters. Ray's target, the
``M,'' now lies to the right of the cursor.
</P>
<P>
   Ray's mind goes to work. The oscilloscope registers the firing
of the brain cells in Ray's motor cortex _ transmitted from an
electrode implanted there _ and the attached speaker sounds off
each impulse with static. The cursor moves to the right and comes
to rest on the edge of the square marked with an ``M.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's it,'' Kennedy says. ``Good job!'' The letter then
appears in the text box at the top of the screen.
</P>
<P>
   M.
</P>
<P>
   The cursor appears in the upper left corner again. The ``A'' is
directly to the right. Ray makes quick work of it, but appears to
be tiring.
</P>
<P>
   M-A.
</P>
<P>
   Ray tries for and misses the ``T.''
</P>
<P>
   M-A-K.
</P>
<P>
   He tries several more times to spell the four-letter,
one-syllable name. Another 30 minutes of effort and Ray has managed
only ``M-A.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Johnny, do you want to rest?'' Kennedy asks. Ray blinks twice
_ ``Yes.'' The neurologist sighs.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a good day, Johnny can do three letters a minute,'' he
says. But not this evening.
</P>
<P>
   Ray is done for the day. His eyes close. 'Very brave man'
</P>
<P>
   Ray can't reach out with his hand to move a computer cursor. But
he can think about trying to do so. Kennedy and his colleagues have
essentially found a way to harness Ray's thoughts to allow him to
communicate. They have done this by creating a system that
translates the nerve cell signals in the brain that accompany his
thoughts into electrical signals a computer can process.
</P>
<P>
   For years, scientists have experimented with connecting
electrical circuits to the brains of primates and rodents. Kennedy
has developed the first system that connects a computer's circuitry
to human nerve cells. Ray is Kennedy's second patient. The first, a
woman with Lou Gehrig's disease, died before she could learn to
form words with the technology.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Emory neurosurgeon Dr. Roy Bakay implanted a pair of
electrodes in Ray's brain. Inside the 1.5 mm glass cones, two gold
wires lead to a small transmitter capable of sending electric
signals out of the skull to the scientists. The doctors also
inserted a substance that encouraged Ray's brain cells to grow into
the electrodes and establish an electrical connection. One
electrode worked.
</P>
<P>
   The electrodes were placed in the region of Ray's brain that
controls body movements: the so-called primary motor cortex. When a
person decides to move his or her arm _ or any other part of the
body _ an electrical signal is generated in the cortex that travels
through the brain stem and to muscles, telling them to flex. But
Ray's stroke killed the neural cells of his brain stem, blocking
the neurological tunnel linking his brain to his body.
</P>
<P>
   By hooking the electrodes directly to the source of Ray's
thoughts, Kennedy is able to capture nerve cell signals and put
them to use. After the surgery, Kennedy began teaching Ray to move
the cursor of the computer by simply thinking about moving his arm
to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Those thoughts trigger activity in Ray's motor cortex,
specifically the area that controls arm movement, and those signals
are picked up by the electrode and transmitted to a computer. Read
as electric impulses, the neural signaling is understood by the
computer as commands to move the cursor across the screen as per
Ray's desires.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have moved the mouse into his head,'' Bakay explains.
</P>
<P>
   His eyes fixed to a screen containing a grid of letters and
commands such as ``Back'' and ``Space,'' Ray is now able to point
and click his way through a steady regimen of exercises and
conversations with his doctors. Kennedy remembers the first time
Ray spelled his own name, ``J-O-H-N,'' and then the doctor's name,
``P-H-I-L,'' six months after the implant surgery. He has since
become more proficient with the cursor and types one- or two-word
messages with programs written by Georgia Tech students.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have demonstrated learning curves in Ray's performance that
show he is getting better control,'' Kennedy says.
</P>
<P>
   With practice, Ray has been able to refine the process. He no
longer needs to think about moving his arm to push the cursor. He
simply needs to think about moving the cursor to get the computer
to respond.
</P>
<P>
   In top form, Ray can spell three letters a minute. But he is
plagued by bedsores and infections that keep him distracted by
pain. Painkillers can numb neural signals.
</P>
<P>
   But he never backs down from a training session with Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Johnny is a very brave man,'' Kennedy says. ``He is always
game to try, even if he is in a lot of pain. He has got amazing
courage.'' Battling back
</P>
<P>
   A former drywall contractor, Ray often worked seven days a week
before his stroke. One stepson, Chris Mitchell, describes him as a
man with a great sense of humor who ``liked to drink his beer'' and
spend time at the VFW, sometimes singing karaoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``He liked to work and hang around with his buddies,'' says
Mitchell, a 31-year-old truck driver. ``He was just a normal guy,
an everyday Joe.''
</P>
<P>
   In November 1997, Ray was on the phone with his stepson Scott
when a blood vessel burst at the base of his skull. The cells in
his brain stem, suddenly deprived of oxygen, died. The stroke,
Ray's third and most serious, left him unconscious for weeks. His
life would change forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``For months we didn't know if Johnny was going to live or
not,'' recalls Mitchell's wife, Barbra.
</P>
<P>
   Ray's family waited three months for him to open his eyes and
blink his way back into their lives.
</P>
<P>
   When he finally did, it wasn't easy on Ray or his family. ``He
was real bad; down in the dumps, just like anybody else would feel
if in his position,'' says Chris Mitchell, remembering that Ray at
one point asked his family to take him off the ventilator that was
keeping him alive. ``Not being able to do anything. Not speak. Not
move your head. Not move your arms. You're just there.''
</P>
<P>
   Early last year, Kennedy heard about Ray through a colleague and
asked whether he'd be willing to participate in his research. In
March 1998, surgeons implanted the electrodes in Ray's brain,
offering him the chance to communicate once again.
</P>
<P>
   Within months, Ray began making progress. But last September, he
was dealt another setback: His wife died 10 months after his
stroke. Ray could only blink to express how he felt. And cry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Johnny absolutely adored her,'' Barbra Mitchell says.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Ray has battled back. His spirits have improved and
his health has followed suit. Five months ago, Ray was again able
to breathe without a ventilator.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has come a long way,'' says Barbra Mitchell, 37, who
manages a finance corporation. ``Especially since coming off the
ventilator.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mitchell family makes the 60-mile trip from Carrollton
nearly every weekend to visit Ray and ``treat him like he's at
home,'' Chris Mitchell says. He hears about his grandkids _
Heather, 16, and Jeremy, 14, who are both attending Mount Zion High
School _ and catches up on other family news. Chris Mitchell also
takes time to scratch Ray's head _ a five-star luxury in his
condition _ and keep him comfortable and happy.
</P>
<P>
   Ray's advancing skills at controlling the computer cursor aren't
yet part of the weekend visits; Ray's use of the computer is
restricted to his sessions with Kennedy and his colleagues. But the
Mitchells hope the training sessions may one day allow him to do
more than blink ``yes'' and ``no'' when his family comes to visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard for him, but he's getting the hang of it,'' Chris
Mitchell says. Hopes for the future
</P>
<P>
   A few miles from the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Decatur,
Ga., which has become Ray's home, lies the next step in Kennedy's
implant research. Tim Tinius, 38, has been bedridden for four years
as a result of a rare muscle disease. He can't move the large
majority of his body _ but what a grin he manages when project
researcher Kim Adams enters his room to begin his training.
</P>
<P>
   Tinius, who lives in Beverly Manor Convalescent Center in
Decatur, was implanted with two electrodes similar to Ray's in
July. And Adams and other researchers have been working with him to
help him communicate.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors hope both will function, possibly allowing Tinius to
build on Ray's capabilities to move a cursor up, down and ``double
click,'' all with neural signaling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are real pleased,'' says Melody Moore, assistant professor
of computer information systems at Georgia State University, who is
working with Kennedy to refine the system. ``Tim came through just
great and seems to be very happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore envisions refining the system one day to allow users to
manipulate the environment around them _ to turn off the lights in
a room, change television channels, adjust the heat or air
conditioning _ all simply by thinking about making those things
happen. Moore and her students also are working on software that
would allow patients to surf the Internet, granting access to
online books, shopping and electronic mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``They might even be able to hold a job,'' Moore says.
</P>
<P>
   But it could take years before the technology is refined and
brought to wider use. For now, the goal is to get Ray to ``easily
access the alphabet,'' Kennedy says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that within the next decade, locked-in patients will be
able to communicate again with a simulated voice, e-mail, or even
run their business on the Internet,'' he says.

 &HT;    Paralyzed patients control computer just by thinking about it
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Sept. 12.
 &HT;    By J. Matthew Aldag
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A paper sign is taped above the head of John Ray's
hospital bed. It says he likes watching country music on television
and that the overhead light hurts his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Ray would need several minutes on a good day to convey these
thoughts on his own: ``Kill the lights and turn on CMT!'' The
53-year-old Vietnam veteran has been rendered immobile by a
debilitating brain stroke and left speechless by a tracheotomy. Ray
can only blink his eyes to express how he feels _ two blinks for
yes, one for no.
</P>
<P>
   But those blinking eyelids are no longer the only windows to his
soul.
</P>
<P>
   An Emory University neurologist, Dr. Philip Kennedy, wants to
open those windows, build a double door and invite the world in.
Ray is a willing host.
</P>
<P>
   Ray is one of a few people in the world who are able to directly
control a computer with their minds. Bypassing the keystroke or
``double click,'' he can move a cursor around a computer screen
solely by willpower. The new technology _ a product of scientists'
increasing knowledge of how the brain functions _ translates the
electrical nerve cell signals in Ray's brain into signals a
computer can understand.
</P>
<P>
   If Kennedy and other specialists can refine the technology that
allows Ray to communicate, they may provide a remarkable new
communication tool for the estimated 1 million Americans each year
who suffer injuries or strokes that leave them unable to speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying to do is help locked-in patients communicate
by connecting their brain directly to a computer,'' Kennedy says.
Spelling it out
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy leans over Ray's hospital bed and inspects the tangle of
instruments that have become Ray's constant companions. They are
about to resume their regular training session.
</P>
<P>
   A computer screen is directly in front of Ray's face. On his
left, a collection of electronics stands ready: an oscilloscope,
amplifiers and a receiver made of an old black Patrolman SW-80
radio. On a cart to Ray's right are a speaker and another computer.
</P>
<P>
   Sensors are taped to Ray's left shoulder and above his left
eyebrow. A receiver rests between his head and pillow. A couple of
millimeters underneath his skull, an electrode is embedded in his
brain.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy checks his instruments. An assistant opens up a logbook
and says, ``Day 472.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy asks Ray to spell the name of his visitor: Matt.
</P>
<P>
   Ray furrows his eyebrows. The sensor taped to his forehead
registers the electrical activity of his muscle contractions. The
cursor in the upper left corner moves vertically down the screen in
front of him, which contains a grid of letters. Ray's target, the
``M,'' now lies to the right of the cursor.
</P>
<P>
   Ray's mind goes to work. The oscilloscope registers the firing
of the brain cells in Ray's motor cortex _ transmitted from an
electrode implanted there _ and the attached speaker sounds off
each impulse with static. The cursor moves to the right and comes
to rest on the edge of the square marked with an ``M.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's it,'' Kennedy says. ``Good job!'' The letter then
appears in the text box at the top of the screen.
</P>
<P>
   M.
</P>
<P>
   The cursor appears in the upper left corner again. The ``A'' is
directly to the right. Ray makes quick work of it, but appears to
be tiring.
</P>
<P>
   M-A.
</P>
<P>
   Ray tries for and misses the ``T.''
</P>
<P>
   M-A-K.
</P>
<P>
   He tries several more times to spell the four-letter,
one-syllable name. Another 30 minutes of effort and Ray has managed
only ``M-A.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Johnny, do you want to rest?'' Kennedy asks. Ray blinks twice
_ ``Yes.'' The neurologist sighs.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a good day, Johnny can do three letters a minute,'' he
says. But not this evening.
</P>
<P>
   Ray is done for the day. His eyes close. 'Very brave man'
</P>
<P>
   Ray can't reach out with his hand to move a computer cursor. But
he can think about trying to do so. Kennedy and his colleagues have
essentially found a way to harness Ray's thoughts to allow him to
communicate. They have done this by creating a system that
translates the nerve cell signals in the brain that accompany his
thoughts into electrical signals a computer can process.
</P>
<P>
   For years, scientists have experimented with connecting
electrical circuits to the brains of primates and rodents. Kennedy
has developed the first system that connects a computer's circuitry
to human nerve cells. Ray is Kennedy's second patient. The first, a
woman with Lou Gehrig's disease, died before she could learn to
form words with the technology.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Emory neurosurgeon Dr. Roy Bakay implanted a pair of
electrodes in Ray's brain. Inside the 1.5 mm glass cones, two gold
wires lead to a small transmitter capable of sending electric
signals out of the skull to the scientists. The doctors also
inserted a substance that encouraged Ray's brain cells to grow into
the electrodes and establish an electrical connection. One
electrode worked.
</P>
<P>
   The electrodes were placed in the region of Ray's brain that
controls body movements: the so-called primary motor cortex. When a
person decides to move his or her arm _ or any other part of the
body _ an electrical signal is generated in the cortex that travels
through the brain stem and to muscles, telling them to flex. But
Ray's stroke killed the neural cells of his brain stem, blocking
the neurological tunnel linking his brain to his body.
</P>
<P>
   By hooking the electrodes directly to the source of Ray's
thoughts, Kennedy is able to capture nerve cell signals and put
them to use. After the surgery, Kennedy began teaching Ray to move
the cursor of the computer by simply thinking about moving his arm
to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Those thoughts trigger activity in Ray's motor cortex,
specifically the area that controls arm movement, and those signals
are picked up by the electrode and transmitted to a computer. Read
as electric impulses, the neural signaling is understood by the
computer as commands to move the cursor across the screen as per
Ray's desires.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have moved the mouse into his head,'' Bakay explains.
</P>
<P>
   His eyes fixed to a screen containing a grid of letters and
commands such as ``Back'' and ``Space,'' Ray is now able to point
and click his way through a steady regimen of exercises and
conversations with his doctors. Kennedy remembers the first time
Ray spelled his own name, ``J-O-H-N,'' and then the doctor's name,
``P-H-I-L,'' six months after the implant surgery. He has since
become more proficient with the cursor and types one- or two-word
messages with programs written by Georgia Tech students.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have demonstrated learning curves in Ray's performance that
show he is getting better control,'' Kennedy says.
</P>
<P>
   With practice, Ray has been able to refine the process. He no
longer needs to think about moving his arm to push the cursor. He
simply needs to think about moving the cursor to get the computer
to respond.
</P>
<P>
   In top form, Ray can spell three letters a minute. But he is
plagued by bedsores and infections that keep him distracted by
pain. Painkillers can numb neural signals.
</P>
<P>
   But he never backs down from a training session with Kennedy.

<P>
   ``Johnny is a very brave man,'' Kennedy says. ``He is always

   The Global Ceiling?
</P>
<P>
   Women account for about half of the United States work force,
though only 14 percent of those posted abroad by corporate America.
Researchers at two universities say the opinion of some American
managers _ that women cannot be effective overseas _ is not shared
by either women working abroad or foreign managers.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Linda K. Stroh at Loyola University of Chicago surveyed 261
women on foreign corporate assignments and 78 of their supervisors,
88 percent of them men. The survey found that 60 percent of the
supervisors agreed or strongly agreed that prejudice in some
countries prevented women from being effective on the job. Only 10
percent of the women on assignment thought so.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Charles M. Vance at Loyola Marymount University in Los
Angeles found that among 323 managers in the United States, Germany
and Mexico, the Americans were more likely than those in the other
countries to see cultural barriers to women abroad.

<P>
   Finding the Leader
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Gifted Boss'' (William Morrow, 1999), Dale Dauten of
Tempe, Ariz., a former market research consultant, analyzes the
styles of managers like Dan Schweiker of China Mist Tea, who was so
determined to lighten the atmosphere in a stuffy workplace that he
replaced the conference table with a pool table.
</P>
<P>
   The gifted boss, Dauten concludes, not only trusts and motivates
employees but creates a workplace so magnetic that the most
talented workers are easy to attract. But the book leaves one
question unanswered: How does a worker find such a boss?
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep your eyes and ears open,'' Dauten advised in an
interview. Find a division in your own company where everyone is
smiling. Listen to people who gush about their jobs at parties.
</P>
<P>
   When you have identified the boss you want, ``get your work in
front of him,'' Dauten says, even if that means doing a project
without pay. Then comes a crucial point in approaching gifted
bosses. ``You have to plead with them to take you in,'' Dauten
said.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not so long ago, Internet brokerage firms were the Home Depots
of the investing world, offering customers a way to do it
themselves for less. Now, as the battle for on-line accounts heats
up, some of them seem more like Saks.
</P>
<P>
   Gold and platinum status. Dedicated toll-free numbers. Valuable
freebies. Discounts for loyal customers. The same advertising
pitches used by upscale retailers, credit card companies, airlines,
and, yes, traditional, full-service stock brokers are becoming
familiar online as well. The marketing push is aimed at wealthy
investors who have caught the stock-trading buzz but still want the
perks they receive at traditional brokerage houses.
</P>
<P>
   E(star)Trade, Charles Schwab, Fidelity Investments, DLJ Direct
and others now give the red-carpet treatment to anyone who invests
big sums _ usually $100,000 or more _ or to people who trade stocks
often. To start, preferred customers can receive free stock
research.
</P>
<P>
   But the perks are even better for more important clients: they
may get priority access to initial public offerings, a chance to
invest in private partnerships and even some hand-holding from
dedicated advisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole point is to make the best customers feel special
compared to the regular guy,'' says Dan Burke, an on-line brokerage
industry expert with Gomez Advisors in Lincoln, Mass. ``It's the
kind of thing full-service brokers have done for years, but it's
new on line.''
</P>
<P>
   The on-line industry itself is new, of course, and evolving
quickly. Only a couple of years ago, the first Internet brokerage
houses began to take aim at Wall Street's fat commissions with
cut-price trading and a do-it-yourself investing ethic.
</P>
<P>
   But the field has become crowded. At least 55 such companies are
fighting for a share of the $600 billion that investors have so far
devoted to on-line accounts. Schwab and E(star)Trade seem as
worried about distinguishing themselves from lower-priced rivals
like Datek and Suretrade as they are about slaying the full-service
dragon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trading is a commodity,'' said Jamie Moldafsky, a senior vice
president at Schwab, the San Francisco-based firm that was founded
on the principle of making trading easy and inexpensive. ``We are
taking a value-added approach, not going after the most
price-sensitive customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most arresting changes are at E(star)Trade. The firm
once teased Wall Street with bargain-basement trades at $14.95 each
_ until rivals came along charging a third as much to buy or sell a
stock. Now E(star)Trade says it is going after the premium
customer.
</P>
<P>
   Those who trade regularly _ E(star)Trade defines the entry level
as 30 trades a quarter; 75 or a quarter for its ``Platinum Power
Trader'' benefits _ will receive discounts for some trades as their
tradng volume rises, with prices falling as low as $4.95 a trade.
The company will also waive fees for stock research and provide
free streaming NASDAQ price quotes, including bid-ask spreads.
</P>
<P>
   When E(star)Trade serves as an underwriter for an initial
offering, it will reserve a pool of stock for its Platinum
investors.
</P>
<P>
   E(star)Trade once touted its common-man approach to new issues,
with shares allocated by lottery. It still uses a lottery, but one
in which different classes of investors have different odds of
winning. Patrick Di Chiro, a vice president, said the firm had
decided to tailor products and ``give something back'' to its best
clients.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab was among the first to divide its customers into classes.
Benefits kick in for those who make at least 12 stock trades a year
or entrust at least $100,000 to Schwab. For those at its Platinum
level, which requires $1 million invested or 48 trades a year,
Schwab offers a dedicated team of brokers, help in designing
structured products or derivatives, free research, free news wires
and discounts on Schwab's $29.95 standard commissions for Internet
trades.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Schwab seems determined, at least for now, to maintain
its leading market share in the on-line business by adding services
rather than cutting prices.
</P>
<P>
   It recently rolled out a program called Velocity for top
clients. Schwab says the software makes it much easier for clients
to trade stocks held in multiple accounts at once from a single
screen. The trading window stays active at all times, even while
the client browses the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The program also allows trading commands to flow faster over the
Internet than is typical for Web-based trading, Schwab says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The results will blow you away,'' said Ms. Moldafsky of
Schwab, who suggested that Velocity, depending on Internet traffic,
could speed trade execution by up to 20 seconds, giving an edge to
those who depend on moving in and out of stock positions quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity has also joined the parade, It has unveiled a Web
service that will be limited to active traders and has been a
pioneer in portability, offering trading services through pagers
and Palm Pilot personal organizers.
</P>
<P>
   Like Schwab, Fidelity is also inching closer to offering the
kinds of personal attention that investors expect from a
full-service broker. Looking for a New Jersey municipal bond that
offers a 5.5 percent yield? A Fidelity representative will keep her
eyes peeled and call you when she finds one, says Tracey Curvey,
who directs Fidelity's brokerage operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want more than a transaction; we want a relationship,'' Ms.
Curvey says. Merrill Lynch couldn't say it any better.

SOME BIRTHDAY CAKE FOR A TOOTHLESS WONDER  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 12) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ A decade ago, the rising powers of the
Pacific organized a loose economic confederation known as APEC to
bind together their fractious region. Each year since 1993, the
region's leaders have donned silly shirts, flown to some
spectacular setting and held a summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The latest one starts here Sunday morning, in a country much
more like England in the '50s than Asia in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   An opportune time and place, then, to pose this question: Should
everyone acknowledge that this whole idea of creating a ``Pacific
Community'' to rival the European Community has been a failure and
put APEC out of its misery?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so. After 10 years, no one quite knows what the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation _ the name just stops there
because its members could not agree on ``Organization'' or
``Forum'' or even whether some among them were really countries at
all _ is supposed to do.
</P>
<P>
   When its big chance to ride to the rescue arrived _ in the form
of the Asian economic meltdown of 1997 _ APEC froze in the
headlights. It could not come up with an agenda of economic reforms
or even coordinate emergency financial aid. That work was left to
the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the United
States Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   APEC's record on trade is only slightly better. The first summit
conferences produced agreements in principle to dismantle all
tariffs and other trade barriers in the Pacific by 2020. But like a
vow from the Red Sox to win the World Series by 2020, those are
hopes, not plans.
</P>
<P>
   Tariffs were indeed reduced on some high-technology goods, but
on everything else, Japan dug in its heels, and many other
countries, reeling from economic crises, slammed on the brakes.
These days, the WTO does most of the globe's rule-setting and
dispute arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the biggest failure of all: the enormous
hesitation to turn an economic organization into a political one,
capable of decision-making on issues that affect the world's
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   The phrase ``Pacific Community'' was first used by President
Clinton at the initial conference, in Seattle in 1993. ``We can't
imagine now how we could have weathered the cold war without
NATO,'' Clinton said then. ``In the same way, future generations
may look back and say they can't imagine how the Asian-Pacific
region could have thrived in such a spirit of harmony without the
existence of APEC.''
</P>
<P>
   As he attends the meeting this weekend, Clinton won't be talking
much about the Pacific Community. His theory that economic
cooperation would beget political cooperation was appealing when
Asia was in economic ascendancy. But now the region is doing more
fraying than knitting. From North Korea to the Taiwan Strait, from
unrest in Indonesia to nuclear tensions in the subcontinent, Asia
appears more chaotic, more unstable and more susceptible to
implosion than at any time since the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean that meetings like this one are useless. They
create an easy, natural forum for leaders to talk. Imagine what
diplomatic gymnastics it would take to get Bill Clinton and
President Jiang Zemin of China speaking face to face without the
cover of an annual regional get-together.
</P>
<P>
   But many former optimists in the Clinton administration
acknowledge, at least privately, that APEC's utility is
diminishing. ``If we come out of this with nothing, absolutely
nothing, on Indonesia and East Timor, you've got to wonder, what's
the use?'' one cabinet member said the other day.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is partly that the so-called community is an
artificial one. NATO was bound together by a common desire to
contain communism. The European Union is bound together by tight
geography and a semblance of ethnic and cultural cohesion. But
these days, APEC stretches to include the United States and
Vietnam, Canada and Papua New Guinea, Mexico and Malaysia, Japan
and Russia _ an easy recipe for political paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a disappointment,'' said Robert D. Hormats, vice
chairman of Goldman Sachs International, who has long experience in
Asia. ``The idea was right, but it involves too many countries with
too many diverse agendas.''
</P>
<P>
   One result is a growing racial divide. The largely Anglo-Saxon
nations of North America, Australia and New Zealand keep pressing
for faster trade liberalization, Western-style economic reforms and
United Nations peacekeeping forces in places like East Timor,
against resistance from the Asians, who are far more loath to mess
with the internal affairs of neighbors and who resent what they
view as American-inspired domination.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a sense that Washington is trying to use this as
another tool of influence,'' a senior Japanese official complained
recently.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that is all it is good for. Clinton will endure the
leaders' meeting in the hope of accomplishing some serious work on
the side, chiefly with the Chinese. As for the community, the trade
ministers have so far agreed on nothing of substance, and
Indonesia's president, B.J. Habibie, has decided not to show up _
for fear, many here think, of a coup while he is chatting with the
neighbors.

TEXAS SCHOOL BANS AWARD-WINNING BOOK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ZEKE MacCORMACK  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOERNE, Texas _ An award-winning novel about a Japanese-American
man charged with murdering a fellow salmon fisherman on the Puget
Sound after World War II has been banned from classes and removed
from the high school library here because of graphic violence,
racial bigotry and honeymoon sex.
</P>
<P>
   English teacher Frances Riley, who assigned 80 seniors to read
``Snow Falling on Cedars'' after receiving authorization from
school officials, faces disciplinary action for what school
administrators now call ``poor judgment'' in using it in her
classes.
</P>
<P>
   Riley, 45, still supports using the novel by David Guterson that
she described as ``a murder mystery, love story and history lesson
all in one.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids love it and were very disappointed that we stopped
just when it was getting good,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main reason I chose it is I believe in utilizing current
fiction to teach morals, values and issues,'' said Riley, who has
taught English here since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   She said Guterson's book is used in high school classrooms
across the nation and was advertised in scholastic supply
catalogues as appropriate for grades 10 and up.
</P>
<P>
   R.L. Bien, English Department chairman, said he approved the
book ``without reading the material.'' He now deems it
inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Riley said she will consult the American Federation of Teachers,
her union, about challenging the reprimand.
</P>
<P>
   She volunteered to stop using the book after administrators
objected to several passages Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one-page sex scene didn't fly,'' she said, adding another
scene with soldiers using racial slurs during war ``sent (the
school administrators) into tizzies.''
</P>
<P>
   Boerne High School Principal Sam Champion said two parents and
several students complained about the racially charged thriller
that was named book of the year by the American Booksellers
Association in 1995 and won the PEN/ Faulkner Award.
</P>
<P>
   The book, which was on the New York Times's best-seller list for
more than a year, has sold more than 3 million copies.
</P>
<P>
   But Champion said the book's popularity was not the point.
``Parents entrust their kids to us, and we want to ensure it's a
wholesome learning environment. We're a conservative community,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   School Superintendent John Kelly called parts of the book
``highly offensive'' and said he ordered it removed from the
library and barred from classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has 17 obscenities on one page, for example, and a graphic
scene involving the sexual organ of a dead boy, and it has an
inappropriate sex scene not suitable for our high school
students,'' Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   Students had mixed reactions to the ban.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it's sad that these simple-minded people here can't put
aside sexual things and appreciate the real literature,'' said Lara
Hutto, 17, one of Riley's students. ``I'm going to finish it.''
</P>
<P>
   A classmate, Jerald Meadows, labled the book ``kind of
grotesque'' and ``not school material.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said it was its 460-page length, not the content, that
generated many student protests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids complained to their parents about it just to get out of
reading it,'' Meadows, 17, said.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Lowrance, the parent of a student in the class, supports
the ban and wants a refund of the $16 she spent on the book.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did anybody read this book'' before assigning it?, she asked.
</P>
<P>
   Riley said she had forgotten about the questionable passages
since reading the book two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   She still considers it appropriate for seniors, but said, ``I
wouldn't teach it to 10th-graders.''

MEDIA MERGERS, WRITTEN LARGER  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 12) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In what is supposedly a business that fosters and rewards
creativity, the people who run big entertainment companies
certainly look like a bunch of copycats.
</P>
<P>
   Time was, network television, radio and the movies more or less
operated in their own orbits. Cable and then the Web shook up that
structure, helped to break down the barriers and strengthened the
argument for what is now a vertically integrated industry.
</P>
<P>
   The need for size and control over all facets of the production
and distribution process was a driving force behind last week's
announcement of a $37 billion merger of Viacom and CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to keep up with its peers, NBC, a subsidiary of General
Electric, seems on the verge of buying a stake in Paxson
Communications, which not only has a big stable of television
stations but also a sizable cable presence. Of course, just because
everybody has the same idea doesn't necessarily make it a good
idea.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Wolzien, a senior media analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP;
Co., took some time last week to talk about the Viacom/CBS
combination and other developments in the entertainment business.
Here are excerpts from the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)What were the most important considerations driving
this merger?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. The first thing was a perceived need for parity with the
other big players, the Time Warners, Disneys and News Corps of the
world. The ability to sell more advertising within all these
interrelated businesses that are part of Viacom/CBS was probably
the second reason. And there may have been some cost benefits.
</P>
<P>
   This is now the fourth company that is vertically integrated.
Once the laws, regulations and consent decrees that prevented
networks from owning studios or vice versa, went away in the early
1990s, it was inevitable that this sort of a deal would happen.
</P>
<P>
   What is refreshing about this deal is that no one is saying we
are getting huge immediate synergies out of this. They seem to be
saying this is a good thing for the long term.
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)That said, has the concept of owning and operating
television and movie production studios proved successful?(end
italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. What it does provide is negotiating parity with the other
players who have the same thing _ production and distribution.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have that, you find yourself in a situation like
NBC had with hit shows like ``E.R.'' and ``Friends,'' where they
would end up spending record amounts to re-sign those programs that
they didn't own.
</P>
<P>
   It may be that if NBC had been selling product to Time Warner,
which owned those shows, they would not have been taken to the
cleaners, because Time Warner would want to make sure that if the
tables were turned, it would get a fair deal from NBC.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of corporate structure, that is the argument for
parity: Once you get the A-bomb, I have to have an A-bomb.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with this is costs. As you create additional product
for your outlets, it costs you money.
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Before cable, network television was a cozy,
controlled oligopoly. Isn't the consolidation we are seeing now
creating a bigger, broader version of the same thing?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. In the end, this is a world of five or six big guys, versus
three in the previous period. Those five or six players _ Disney,
Time Warner, News Corp, Viacom, NBC _ will control the bulk of the
business through multiple distribution pathways.
</P>
<P>
   It's a bit like Coca-Cola at the supermarket. Twenty or 30 years
ago, Coke didn't have as much shelf space as it has today. But it
occupied one-third of the space that was there. Today, the
soft-drink aisle at the supermarket is much longer, but Coke's
percentage of it is about the same.
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Is there much left for the big guys to gobble
up?(end italics) &QL;

<P>
   A. NBC is the only thing left on the network television side. On
the studio side there is Barry Diller's USA Networks' studios. Sony
has a television studio, but no network. And there are MGM and
Dreamworks, which does some television work.
</P>
<P>
   The combination you can't rule out is one between Time Warner
and NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)What happens in the next recession?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. Everyone would suffer in a recession. But a downturn would be
ugly for Viacom, because it is now almost entirely based on
advertising revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Disney would suffer differently. Their broadcasting operations
would get whacked first, but the impact on their theme parks would
be delayed. The impact of a recession at Disney would not be as
sharp as at Viacom, but it would last longer.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner has the buffer of the cable systems, which have
proven to be more resistant to recessions.
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Which of the stocks do you like?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. With the CBS deal, I think there is upside potential for
Viacom. Time Warner has tremendous potential on the Internet. And
Disney, despite its big near-term problems, is a tremendous value
play.

INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE GROWS AS VIOLENCE CONTINUES IN EAST TIMOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ No sooner had most of the staff evacuated
the besieged U.N. compound in East Timor on Friday, then men with
hand grenades arrived to menace the remaining workers and the 1,000
terrified refugees taking shelter there. Witnesses said the men
looted supplies with the help of uniformed soldiers and fired at
refugees who tried to flee.
</P>
<P>
   As international pressure grew, the armed forces chief, Gen.
Wiranto, said for the first time that Indonesia might in the future
accept the deployment of the U.N. peacekeeping force that has been
the insistent demand of foreign nations.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure this week came from a broad range of sources, but it is
not clear which influence might have changed the general's mind. A
U.N. delegation came to Indonesia to press the government to allow
peacekeeping troops to try to bring order to East Timor. And
Secretary-General Kofi Annan Friday said that continued violence in
East Timor and repeated rejections of outside help could lead to
charges of crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, en route to an economic meeting in New
Zealand, said Friday in a statement from Air Force One: ``It is now
clear that the Indonesian military is aiding and abetting the
militia violence.'' He has already warned the government that the
violence must stop.
</P>
<P>
   The commander of U.S. military forces in the Pacific, Adm.
Dennis Blair, traveled to Jakarta to emphasize to Wiranto his
responsibility to control the Indonesian military, and the chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Henry Shelton, has talked by
telephone with the Indonesian military commander several times this
week about East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   The turbulence in East Timor has begun to shake the political
position of President B.J. Habibie, who has come under criticism
from his own party as well as his political opponents and who is
the subject of increasing derision in the press.
</P>
<P>
   Reports on Friday from the East Timor capital, Dili, described a
scene of continuing tension and fear.
</P>
<P>
   Staff members who had evacuated the compound said, upon arriving
in Darwin, Australia, that they had been fired on as they headed in
a convoy to the tiny airport in Dili. Around them, they said, lay a
devastated city where almost every building had been burned or
vandalized and where the only people in evidence were armed men on
motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
   As night fell, Brian Kelly, a U.N. official reached at the
compound by telephone, said the air of tension at the unguarded
compound had intensified as the armed men continued to threaten the
occupants.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this is is a further racheting up of intimidatory tactics
and a further example of the porosity of the security fence we have
been offered by the military,'' he said. ``It's all part, I'm sure,
of a game plan. The fact is that there is no way of predicting
day-to-day how much more they will attempt.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent violence has included the burning of churches and the
killing of priests an nuns around the territory. Pope John Paul II
sent a telegram to Catholics in East Timor condemning the violence:
``I implore those responsible for so many acts of wickedness to
abandon their murderous and destructive intentions,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   In what seemed to be a plea for international understanding,
Wiranto said, ``We do not object to the idea of foreign
peacekeeping troops but it is not really the appropriate time for a
foreign security force to enter East Timor. But we are open for
future discussions on such matters.''
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of absolute refusal to consider the involvement of
foreign troops, the admission by the general that he might need
outside help to control the situation _ and even to bring to heel
some units of his own military _ illustrated the political toll
East Timor has begun to take here in the Indonesian capital.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The violence is the direct result of what now clearly seems to
have been a precipitate offer of independence by Habibie and of
what also clearly seems to have been a deliberate plan by the
military to undermine the process by instigating a campaign of
terror by irregular, military-backed militias.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week Wiranto send battalions supposedly to protect
people, but in the night they dress as militia with guns and
weapons and they go around the villages shooting,'' said East
Timor's spiritual leader, the Roman Catholic bishop, Carlos Belo.
He spoke in London after having been forced to flee the territory
when gunmen burned his home in Dili and shot some of the 6,000
refugees who had taken shelter there.
</P>
<P>
   In the referendum on Aug. 30, the former Portuguese colony voted
overwhelmingly for independence from Indonesia, which invaded it in
1975 but never completely subdued a separatist insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Habibie's political stock had already been falling sharply. Many
commentators now say his disastrous policy regarding East Timor,
and the weakness he is now demonstrating, have doomed his hopes for
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   The chief opposition leader, Megawati Sukarnoputri, has
maneuvered adeptly around the issue of East Timor, voicing support
for the politically powerful military, which is resisting the
separation of East Timor, while asserting that she will honor the
East Timor's legal status.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday she said Habibie was ``not fit to be a presidential
candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion, which has only begun to be aroused here, was
violently divided Friday. In one demonstration, protesters set fire
to the flags of the United States and Australia, whom they accused
of meddling in Indonesian affairs. In another, a group of 80 women
demonstrated outside the Defense Ministry calling for an end to
military violence.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In Dili, the United Nations evacuated about 300 staff members,
including all local workers, who are under threat of reprisals from
the militias. The militias opposed the holding of the referendum
under the auspices of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   About 80 staff members remained in the compound, most of them
having refused to leave as long as the refugees there remained
under threat. A handful of journalists remained with them, and in
telephone interviews their voices shook with exhaustion and
emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation here deteriorated dramatically after the convoy
left evacuating the U.N. staff and local staff and their
families,'' said Marie Colvin, a British journalist reporting for
the Sunday Times of London.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took away most of the army, and we were almost
immediately besieged by militia. But this is not chaos. The militia
certainly, from what I could see, was operating closely with the
army. When the militia threatened to throw grenades over the wall,
the army came and said we should give them a truck and they would
go away.''
</P>
<P>
   When the members of the militia tried to break into a truck
filled with supplies that was parked adjacent to the compound, she
said, ``We saw that when they were unable to smash in the
windshield, the army came over and smashed it in with a rifle
butt.''
</P>
<P>
   In Jakarta, the chief military spokesman, Brig. Gen. Sudrajat,
denied that the militia had threatened the U.N. compound.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are soldiers there to protect it,'' he said.

CAUSE OF MOSCOW BLAST STILL UNCERTAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Fear and grief engulfed Moscow Friday as rescue workers
pulled the last victims from the wreckage of a nine-story apartment
building destroyed by an explosion early Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians and law enforcement officials were still trying to
figure out if the blast, which killed 90 and injured 249, was
caused by a terrorist's bomb or the accidental detonation of
explosive materials stored on the building's first floor.
</P>
<P>
   The blast leveled all nine stories of the central part of the
building, located in a working-class district in southeastern
Moscow. Survivors, many of whom were sleeping when the blast
occured, recalled waking up covered with blood and debris.
</P>
<P>
   President Boris N. Yeltsin has decreed Monday a national day of
mourning for victims of explosion as well as for those of a Sept. 4
car bomb that killed 64 in the southern region of Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Bogdanov, a spokesman for Russia's Federal Security
Service, which is investigating Thursday's explosion, said the
blast was caused by ``an industrial explosive.'' While
investigators say they are leaning toward a terrorist attack as an
explanation for the explosion, they have still not ruled out that
the blast could have been accidental.
</P>
<P>
   Explosive materials were reportedly found in an abandoned first
floor office in the building, and police say they are questioning
the owners of the company listed as renting the space.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's explosion was the third in Russia, and the second in
Moscow, in 10 days. On Aug. 31, a bomb ripped through a video
arcade in an upscale shopping center in downtown Moscow, just yards
from the Kremlin. On Sept. 3, an explosion in Dagestan _ where
Russian forces are trying to put down an Islamic insurgency _
destroyed a building housing military families. Law enforcement
officals have blamed the Dagestan explosion on Islamic terrorists
and announced Friday that two suspects have been detained.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow's mayor, Yuri Luzhkov, said he was convinced the
explosion was the work of Islamic terrorists and related to tension
in Russia's volatile Caucasus region.
</P>
<P>
   The Interfax news agency on Thursday reported receiving a call
from an unidentified man taking responsibility for the blast, in
retaliation for ``the bombing of peaceful villages in Dagestan and
Chechnya.'' Friday's front page headline in the daily newspaper
Segodnya read: ``The war in the Caucasus has come to Moscow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When a terrorist act claims the lives of peaceful people this
is a tragedy,'' Alexei II, patriarch of the Russian Orthodox
Church, said in televised comments.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Vladimir Putin was more cautious. In a nationally
televised address Friday, he said the blast could have been caused
either by ``negligence'' or by ``terrorism.'' The explosion was
initially attriuted to a gas leak, although that possibility was
hardly discussed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Experts will draw conclusions on what caused the explosion, be
it criminal negligence or a terrorist act,'' said Putin. ``If it
was a terrorist act, then we are facing a cunning, imprudent,
treacherous, and bloodthirsty opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin said law enforcement forces were taking extra security
measures to combat terrorism in the capital. Although no details
were given, police have increased security in Moscow's subway and
other public places. The apartments of alleged criminal elements
were being raided, news agencies reported.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, frightened and bewildered Muscovites worried that
terrorist attacks in their city may become routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course we are all very frightened,'' said Irina Zorina, a
46-year-old linguist. ``We can't help but feel that a war is coming
right into our homes. I am afraid that terrible things may be
coming soon.''
</P>
<P>
   The popular Ekho Moskvi radio station conducted a call-in poll
asking listeners the quesstion: ``Are you afraid of an explosion in
your apartment building?'' Of 974 callers, 828 said yes.

WALKING TO CALL ATTENTION TO CRIME, A SOUTH AFRICAN DOES WHEN HE
GETS MUGGED

<TEXT>
<P>
   GRABOUW, South Africa _ It was either an awful start or the best
one he could have hoped for. But last month, on the second day of a
2,800-mile walk around South Africa to call attention to the
nation's notorious crime rate, Roger Russell was mugged.
</P>
<P>
   As one hyperactive bandit pointed a gun at Russell's groin and
others took his watch, backpack and camping gear, it did not seem
the best time for his motivational speech on how South Africans can
unite to stop violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was too hectic,'' Russell, 51, said early this week as cars
whizzed past him on a gorgeous pass 50 miles outside Cape Town.
``The guy was so wound up. All I wanted him to do was just relax.''
</P>
<P>
   For better or worse, the robbery proved a point that no one here
really doubted. With headlines of shootings in schools and daily
attacks on the roads, crime has become one of the biggest problems
in South Africa and an issue the new government of President Thabo
Mbeki is eager to make a priority.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Mbeki unleashed an elite police unit called the
Scorpions to dismantle organized crime. His public safety chief is
refusing to back down on a contentious decision to allow off-duty
officers to carry guns. Law enforcement officials deemed
unaggressive have been dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Russell has become a gray-bearded, big-bellied symbol of the
chaos behind those measures, whose walk was pretty much ignored
until he was robbed on Aug. 24. Now, as he treks east from Cape
Town in newly donated gear, he is a fixture in the papers, on
television and radio, and so he gets hundreds of calls on his
cellular phone from people urging him to keep going.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm trying to tell people was underlined by what
happened,'' he said. ``There is no point in trying to run away from
this issue and pretend it doesn't exist. We've actually got to do
something.''
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to assume that a man with no particular home, now on
a seven-month walk alone and unarmed, is either a kook or a
publicity hound. But Russell seems like neither.
</P>
<P>
   He is an earnest and soft-spoken former gold miner who took to
walking in 1993 after his wife of 25 years, Sharon, died of breast
cancer and he narrowly survived lung cancer. Then he walked across
South Africa for the cause of cancer and hospice care. Since then
he has earned most of his money giving talks to people and groups
going through hard times.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought I was going to die and she was going to live,''
he said. ``It worked the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is why I'm a motivational speaker. I learned lessons,
hard lessons, at that time. Sometimes when it's black all around
and you've got no other options, you have to put your head down and
put one foot in front of the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus the walk against crime, which he decided on this spring
after six South African police officers were videotaped beating up
a suspect. His walk has two aims: as a general protest against
crime and to support police officers who are not engaged in
brutality.
</P>
<P>
   He has a program, too. Because South Africa cannot afford a much
larger police force, he believes that ordinary citizens can do more
to prevent being crime victims. They can hide their cell phones
(which are ubiquitous), lock and set alarms on their cars, stay out
of places they believe are dangerous. Then, he said, the police can
focus on serious offenses.
</P>
<P>
   It is no surprise that the police force is behind him. ``I think
it means much more for the police officers than it does for the
public,'' said Riaan Steyn, a police inspector in this town where,
he said, crime has increased with a dip in the local economy.
``Because he is the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Russell is white _ and whites say that because they are
generally richer, they are particular targets for crime _ he is
careful to say he is marching on behalf of everyone in South
Africa. A group of people from this town who are white, black and
Colored (racially mixed) walked with him for two hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a certain amount of empathy from white people,'' he
said. ``But at the same time there is a lot of enthusiasm from
black and Colored people. Gladys _ I don't know what to do about
Gladys. Gladys called and said, `You're not going to like me
because I am big and fat and black.' She called about four times.
And I do like her.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, Gladys Mothoa, a 38-year-old receptionist from
outside Pretoria, made her fifth call about an hour later.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weather is not too good,'' he told her as he walked down a
slope. ``It's drizzling. It's cold. It's cloudy. No, don't worry.
I'll be fine. I'll be staying in a hotel tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mothoa, who seems to be a mischievous woman, said her main
interest in Reese was that she might have lost weight had she
joined him on his entire walk. ``I am challenging the sexy ladies
who say that fat people can't do it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But then she became more serious, saying she decided to call him
the first time after he was mugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was robbed, I was concerned,'' she said. ``I spoke to
him right after that. He's doing this to stop crime. How could they
do that to him?'' She plans to join him for a few calorie-burning
miles when he passes through Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
   But that will be many months from now, and meantime Russell will
pass through most of this beautiful (if still divided) nation: from
Cape Town to Durban, Johannesburg, Pretoria, Bloemfontein, Kimberly
and back to Cape Town. He hopes he can do it without being robbed
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should be able to do this any time they feel like it,''
he said, ``because it's stunning _ this is such a great country.''

TENTATIVE APRIL DATE SET FOR LEWIS MALPRACTICE RETRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- A judge has set a tentative April date for the retrial
of the Reggie Lewis medical malpractice case, even as he indicated
that a pretrial settlement still might be possible.
</P>
<P>
   During a status conference Friday with lawyers in the case,
Superior Court Judge Thayer Fremont-Smith said a second trial would
tentatively begin April 3. Jury selection would start March 27.
</P>
<P>
   Yet after emerging from a closed-door meeting in his chambers
with attorneys for both sides, Fremont-Smith said the parties
``have had some (settlement) discussions that hopefully may be
fruitful.'' A settlement would avoid a second trial.
</P>
<P>
   A claims adjuster from Risk Management Foundation, which insures
all Harvard-affiliated doctors and hospitals, also attended the
private meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Fremont-Smith originally wanted to begin the trial in January
but an attorney for Dr. Gilbert H. Mudge Jr., Lewis's chief
cardiologist, said he had a scheduling conflict that would make a
January retrial impossible.
</P>
<P>
   In June, after nearly seven weeks of testimony, Fremont-Smith
declared a mistrial when a Suffolk Superior Court jury was unable
to decide whether Mudge's alleged negligence contributed to Lewis's
1993 death.
</P>
<P>
   But the same jury cleared two other cardiologists, Drs. Peter L.
Friedman and Mark A. Creager, of malpractice charges. Those
verdicts have been appealed.
</P>
<P>
   Fremont-Smith also said a gag order he imposed on lawyers for
both sides during the first trial is no longer in effect. But, he
added, ``I have requested the parties voluntarily to refrain from
trying the case in the press. I hope to gain their cooperation.''

HELLENIC COLLEGE REINSTATES FOUR FIRED PROFESSORS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. -- As part of an effort to heal a rift within
the Greek Orthodox Church, four professors at Hellenic College
fired two years ago for allegedly refusing to cover up alleged
sexual misconduct on campus have been reinstated.
</P>
<P>
   The former president and three professors at the college, which
includes the Holy Cross School of Theology, were ousted by
Archbishop Spyridon, the former leader of the Greek Orthodox
Archdiocese of North America.
</P>
<P>
   Their firings triggered a firestorm of controversy and
eventually led to Spyridon's forced resignation last month. The
campaign against Spyridon was led by a group of influential and
affluent Greek-Americans who accused Spyridon of having an
authoritarian leadership style that alienated many of the faithful.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to reinstate the school's former Hellenic College
president, the Reverend Alkviadis Calivas, as well as the reverends
Economos Emmanuel Clapsis, Theodore Stylianopoulos and George
Papademetriou, was made by the college's board of trustees Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The firings were the start of a rift between Spyridon and many
Greek Orthodox clergy and laity that threatened to cause a schism
within the 1.5 million member church.
</P>
<P>
   Spyridon was the first leader in the church's 77-year history to
be forced out. He is to be officially replaced this month by
Metropolitan Demetrios Trakatellis, 71, leader of the Orthodox
Church in Greece and a former professor at Hellenic College as well
as Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   Calivas and the three professors have either been on sabbatical
or held on to their professorships without having any teaching
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Clapsis, Stylianopolos and Papademetriou served on the college
committee that recommended expelling a priest accused of sexual
harassment against a seminary student. The recommendation was
overruled by the dean of theology at the school.
</P>
<P>
   The committee later rejected the dean's ruling and reaffirmed
its decision. After Calivas refused to end the proceedings, the
four priests were fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a new beginning, a new chapter I think for the church,''
said the Rev. Nicholas K. Krommydas, chancellor of the Greek
Orthodox Diocese of Boston. ``I think you'd be foolish to think
that . . . (these) past several years haven't been productive. It
hasn't helped us stay as focused as we could be. It's been on
everyone's mind and everyone has an opinion or an idea of what the
future looks like. Hopefully now, this will all end.''
</P>
<P>
   Hellenic College is regarded as the church's flagship academic
institution, and the turmoil the firings set off has dealt the
church a black eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is with deep joy and relief that the faithful of the
Archdiocese of America receive the news that this unhappy situation
has come to a rather satisfactory conclusion,'' wrote Bishop George
of New Jersey, the Archiepiscopal Vicar for the Greek Orthodox
Archdiocese of America.

CHREBET A MISSING LINK FOR JETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Wayne Chrebet never was supposed to play in
the NFL. Now that he isn't, it's amazing how much he's wanted.
</P>
<P>
   The fairy tale from football lightweight Hofstra, who against
all odds made the Jets as a free agent in 1995 and developed into
one of the league's most prolific, reliable wide receivers in the
next four years, finally encountered an opponent he couldn't
outmaneuver last week. While making a slight alteration in his pass
route during the first quarter of New York's exhibition finale,
without a Minnesota Vikings defender in sight, Chrebet was
victimized by the notorious artificial concrete _ er, turf _ at
Giants Stadium. He suffered a broken bone in his left foot and will
miss at least the first six weeks of the season, beginning with
Sunday's opener against the Patriots on the Meadowlands hardcourt.
</P>
<P>
   If Chrebet _ who was considered too small (5 feet 10 inches, 188
pounds) and too slow to ever visit the Jets' Hofstra training
complex as anything but an undergraduate _ has any lingering doubts
about his status, he need only listen to the sound of Bill
Parcells's teeth gnashing. He probably can hear them all the way
from the coach's home in Sea Girt, N.J., because the absence of his
third-down virtuoso is causing Parcells 24-hour daily angst.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Chrebet is inactive. Only his legs are. ``He's
been in the weight room,'' Parcells reported. ``He's lifting
weights and using the upper-body cardiovascular machine until he
throws up.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Parcells is experiencing indigestion as he
contemplates an immediate future without Chrebet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lost a very good player,'' he said. ``It's the same way
when anyone loses a player. You just try to fill in as best you can
with what's available.''
</P>
<P>
   What's available around the NFL waiver wire and unemployment
office doesn't excite Parcells, so at least for the time being,
he'll go with what he has left. All-Pro Keyshawn Johnson is a given
on one side, and a tag team will man Chrebet's spot. Dedric Ward,
the man Patriots fans mournfully will recall burned the home team
for the clinching touchdown in the Jets' 24-14 victory last
October, will step in as the starter. Supplementing Ward will be
two old hands Parcells brought in last month as insurance for just
such a calamity as this: Long Island native Quinn Early, a veteran
of 11 seasons and 454 catches, and Dwight Stone, who has spent most
of his 12 seasons on special teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was more a case of preventive medicine for what happened
to us last week,'' said Parcells. ``I've always believed that you
try to take care of a problem before it happens rather than trying
to find the cure for the disease after you've got it. I wasn't
happy with our depth at receiver.''
</P>
<P>
   If he needs to go even deeper, Parcells will call on his former
Patriots project, renaissance player Ray Lucas, who will be a
backup quarterback, special-teams ace, and No. 5 receiver if he can
keep all that straight Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   How the patching pans out is a guessing game, which Parcells
hates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say without actually playing a game,'' said
quarterback Vinny Testaverde, the man who will have to make do.
``There are some things (Chrebet) does that no other receivers can
do. You go from there to the next guys and see what they can do.''
</P>
<P>
   What Ward can do is outrun anyone else on the roster. And
Parcells has lauded him as the most improved player in camp. ``But
you know,'' the coach cautioned, ``it's a little different between
coming off the bench and playing 15 or 20 snaps and having to
sustain competitiveness for the whole game.''
</P>
<P>
   The ever-confident Johnson anticipates no change in his
situation: ``Same person, same plays, same team, just a different
receiver on the other side.''
</P>
<P>
   But even the Jets' deep threat, a onetime critic of Chrebet,
acknowledges that his absence could dramatically affect the
dynamics of the passing game. At 5-9, 184 pounds, Ward is even
smaller than Chrebet. But he's a speed burner; Chrebet is a speed
bump. And that fast-paced change may not necessarily be
advantageous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vinny has built a kind of nest relationship with Wayne on
certain down-and-distance situations,'' said Johnson. ``He'll try
to build that with Dedric. Dedric is the fastest guy on the team;
that's what he brings to the table. What Wayne does that's very
good is when we go vertical (in three-receiver sets), me and Dedric
go (deep) and Wayne can go underneath, get mismatches in coverage.
Now when I go vertical and Dedric goes underneath, it may be too
fast.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, third-year veteran Ward believes he'll be a quick
study.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm starting to feel more comfortable,'' he said. ``Playing
more last year, I came in hoping to compete for a starting role.
Due to an unfortunate situation, I'm in the rotation. I'm very
excited. I don't think any player comes into the league wanting to
be a backup for their career. I'm excited about the chance to be a
starter someday, here or someplace else.''
</P>
<P>
   It had better be here and now. Or else.

HELLENIC COLLEGE REINSTATES FOUR FIRED PROFESSORS 
</HEADLINE>

 By MAC DANIEL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. -- As part of an effort to heal a rift within
the Greek Orthodox Church, four professors at Hellenic College
fired two years ago for allegedly refusing to cover up alleged
sexual misconduct on campus have been reinstated.
</P>
<P>
   The former president and three professors at the college, which
includes the Holy Cross School of Theology, were ousted by
Archbishop Spyridon, the former leader of the Greek Orthodox
Archdiocese of North America.
</P>
<P>
   Their firings triggered a firestorm of controversy and
eventually led to Spyridon's forced resignation last month. The
campaign against Spyridon was led by a group of influential and
affluent Greek-Americans who accused Spyridon of having an
authoritarian leadership style that alienated many of the faithful.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to reinstate the school's former Hellenic College
president, the Reverend Alkviadis Calivas, as well as the reverends
Economos Emmanuel Clapsis, Theodore Stylianopoulos and George
Papademetriou, was made by the college's board of trustees Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The firings were the start of a rift between Spyridon and many
Greek Orthodox clergy and laity that threatened to cause a schism
within the 1.5 million member church.
</P>
<P>
   Spyridon was the first leader in the church's 77-year history to
be forced out. He is to be officially replaced this month by
Metropolitan Demetrios Trakatellis, 71, leader of the Orthodox
Church in Greece and a former professor at Hellenic College as well
as Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   Calivas and the three professors have either been on sabbatical
or held on to their professorships without having any teaching
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Clapsis, Stylianopolos and Papademetriou served on the college
committee that recommended expelling a priest accused of sexual
harassment against a seminary student. The recommendation was
overruled by the dean of theology at the school.
</P>
<P>
   The committee later rejected the dean's ruling and reaffirmed
its decision. After Calivas refused to end the proceedings, the
four priests were fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a new beginning, a new chapter I think for the church,''
said the Rev. Nicholas K. Krommydas, chancellor of the Greek
Orthodox Diocese of Boston. ``I think you'd be foolish to think
that . . . (these) past several years haven't been productive. It
hasn't helped us stay as focused as we could be. It's been on
everyone's mind and everyone has an opinion or an idea of what the
future looks like. Hopefully now, this will all end.''
</P>
<P>
   Hellenic College is regarded as the church's flagship academic
institution, and the turmoil the firings set off has dealt the
church a black eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is with deep joy and relief that the faithful of the
Archdiocese of America receive the news that this unhappy situation
has come to a rather satisfactory conclusion,'' wrote Bishop George
of New Jersey, the Archiepiscopal Vicar for the Greek Orthodox
Archdiocese of America.

THE CHECK IS IN THE MAIL AND SO IS A HEADACHE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 12) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass., N.Y.)   (af)  
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was two days before Christmas in 1996 when Virginia Keenan
received a phone call that left her dumbfounded: Avco Financial
Services wanted to know why she had not made any payments on a
$2,500 loan that she knew nothing about.
</P>
<P>
   What happened, she said, was that Avco, then a consumer-finance
and insurance subsidiary of Textron Inc., with which she had no
previous dealings, sent her a mass mailing that included a blank
check that she could use to write herself a loan.
</P>
<P>
   But her mail was somehow intercepted, she said, and the loan
check was cashed without her knowledge. It took nearly two months
to clean up the mess.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Keenan said the company eventually told her not to worry
about the bill any longer. But in the meantime, the Keenans feared
that a blight on their credit could prevent them from buying a new
house.
</P>
<P>
   Avco has since been sold to the Associates First Capital Corp.,
and a spokesman for Associates said the company could not comment
on the Keenan case because it ``predates our purchase of Avco.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Keenan, 56, an administrative assistant who lives in
Woburn, Mass., said, ``I was afraid it was going to affect the
mortgage we were applying for.'' Not only did she have trouble
setting things straight, but she says the stress contributed to a
mild heart attack her husband suffered.
</P>
<P>
   Stories of the misuse of checks _ as well as other reports, some
involving desperate consumers buried under mountains of expensive
debt _ are behind a fresh push to outlaw loan checks, formally
called live-check loans by mail. The loans, typically for a
specific four-figure amount, are negotiable checks from a bank or
other lender with which the recipient has had no relationship.
</P>
<P>
   By signing and cashing them, the recipients are effectively
borrowing money at interest rates as high as 25 percent, according
to the Consumer Federation of America.
</P>
<P>
   A similar product, called a convenience check, is issued by
companies with which the consumer already does business. These
checks, typically mailed in sets of three, let the recipient write
in the amount of cash he wants to borrow. Issuers often send them
during the holiday shopping season, but sometimes attach them to
monthly bills, too.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how many Americans have been victims of loan-check
fraud or have used the checks to borrow beyond their means. Last
summer, a General Accounting Office report said that there were no
comprehensive figures on the extent of loan-check use, but that one
institution, Fleet Financial Group, had provided some data. Between
1995 and 1997, Fleet mailed 4.35 million live-loan checks; about
155,000 borrowers cashed checks, thereby accepting loans totaling
more than $680 million. Fleet told the GAO that there were 68
confirmed cases of fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups and some legislators are urging measures to ban
loan checks. ``These checks serve no useful purpose while
endangering many consumers,'' said Jean Ann Fox, director of
consumer protection for the Consumer Federation of America. ``The
nation is awash in consumer credit that is readily available to all
who can afford it _ and to many who cannot.''
</P>
<P>
   Calling the checks ``pernicious,'' she compared their issuance
to the mailings of credit cards that were outlawed in 1970. The
mail is still full of card offers, but the consumer must respond to
the offer before being sent a card. ``Instead of sending
unsolicited credit cards, now they're sending unsolicited live
checks,'' Ms. Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   Lenders stoutly defend loan checks, saying that they are
convenient and useful for millions of people and that there has
been relatively little fraud or abuse. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers ultimately make the final decision about these
offers _ if they don't want them, they can simply tear them up and
throw them away,'' said Randy Lively, president of the American
Financial Services Association, when first faced with a hostile
federal bill in 1997. He reiterated that position last week. That
bill went nowhere, but it did prompt the association _ a trade
group that includes finance companies and credit-card issuers but
not banks _ to create voluntary standards for disclosure and fraud
protection.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota incorporated the voluntary standards into law and
Massachusetts legislators are collecting information for possible
action. In New York, the legislature has been unable to pass a bill
regulating the practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lending institutions have crossed the line,'' said Cheryl
Jacques, chairwoman of an investigative arm of the Massachusetts
Senate, noting that consumers sometimes confuse the checks with
government benefits or insurance reimbursements.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, Rep.e John J. LaFalce, D-N.Y., and the ranking
minority member of the House Banking Committee, introduced a new,
more narrowly focused bill to ban loan checks. Quick congressional
action is unlikely, however.
</P>
<P>
   While critics contend that the industry has neither confined
solicitations to financially qualified consumers nor lived up to
its standards _ for example, requesting that offers not be
forwarded by the post office _ government regulators have expressed
little urgency on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Unsolicited loan checks are less prevalent than unsolicited
credit cards were in the late 1960s, the Federal Reserve told
Congress two years ago, and some consumers undoubtedly value the
ability to get credit instantly without making a formal
application. ``We are inclined to let the market work without the
intervention of new legislation,'' the Fed concluded then.

GORE BRINGS EDUCATION MESSAGE TO R.I. SCHOOL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CENTRAL FALLS, R.I. _ Vice President Al Gore brought a simple
message Friday to the school children of this struggling, largely
Latino city: I care about you. That other guy does not.
</P>
<P>
   His unnamed target? Texas Governor George W. Bush, who not only
touts a plan to shut off federal funds for failing schools _ a plan
Gore derides _ but also skipped a planned visit to the Ellis Risk
School earlier this week, so as not to be late to a $1,000-a-plate
fundraiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, you're getting a lot of attention at this school,'' Gore
told the 160 students and their teachers who were gathered in the
same gym where they'd awaited Bush the other day. ``And you know
why? Because your education is the most important thing to the
people who came here.''
</P>
<P>
   And what about Bush's plan to penalize underperforming schools,
providing vouchers for private school tuitions and tutors in the
troubled districts?
</P>
<P>
   Gore was blunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people have said that if a school is falling behind, all
the money ought to be taken away and the school should be shut down
and the parents should be given a little bit of the money to hire
tutors or to make a downpayment on private schools,'' Gore said.
``I think that would be a disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Gore and Bush have made education a centerpiece in their
presidential campaigns. The subject is one that most Americans say
is more important to them than any other, according to surveys.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has proposed making pre-school available to every child,
limiting classrooms to 18 students per teacher in the early grades
and 20 students per teacher in high school. He would also test new
teachers before they enter the classroom and provide bonuses to
good teachers.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Bush said he prefers to let local communities
decide how to run their schools, rather than dictate to them from
the federal level. He also said he thinks federal funding should be
redirected from chronicly failing schools.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Bush, Mindy Tucker, said the governor's plan
would help public schools improve, not shut them down. ``It's
actually a plan that ensures we will have success in our public
schools,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore clearly wowed the children here as he answered and asked
questions and spoke a few words of Spanish, eliciting oohs and
aahs. The majority of the students in the school speak Spanish;
many others speak Portuguese and Creole.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was asked four times what he would do first if he becomes
president. Three times he said he would work on improving schools
and education. The fourth time, he told the students that the
economy is important, too, and he would work to keep the nation's
prosperity going.
</P>
<P>
   When Gore asked the students how many go home after school with
no one waiting for them, many raised their hands. When he asked who
is afraid of violence in their neighborhood, all raised their
hands. And most indicated that they have heard gunshots in their
neighborhoods, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes when I'm home alone I get really scared because
someone could break in and hurt you really bad,'' one young girl
told the vice president. ``I usually lock the door so no one can
get in.''
</P>
<P>
   The students asked Gore if he has a guard at his house, if he
has a butler and what kind of car he owns. The vice president said
the Secret Service protect him, he does not have a butler but
people from the Navy work for him. He said he owns a Mercury Sable.
</P>
<P>
   He was also asked what he liked about school when he was young.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to read,'' Gore said, in another dig at Bush. (The
Texas governor recently said he didn't know when asked what his
favorite book was as a child.) ``I loved to read books. One of my
favorite books was Mr. Popper's Penguins.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore was also asked if he liked being vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do like it, it's fun,'' he said, before heading off to other
campaign stops in Manchester and Nashua, N.H. ``But I think being
president would be better.''

NEC SHARES SOAR ON REPORTS OF REORGANIZATION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Shares of NEC Corp. skyrocketed Friday after a report in
Japan's leading business daily suggested that the technology and
telecommunications giant would implement a sweeping overhaul that
would consolidate business units, give division heads greater
authority and responsibility for profits and losses and shed
loss-making businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Although those changes are in line with various statements made
by NEC executives the last several months, NEC shares jumped 12
percent, to 2,160 yen, in heavy trading.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the company announced that it would cut 11,600
jobs, one of the biggest single cutbacks ever in Japan, and
promised it would revamp its business to emphasize speedy decision
making and profitability.
</P>
<P>
   Company spokesmen refused to confirm Friday's report in the
Nihon Keizai Shimbun, though they noted that NEC had been scheduled
to take the wraps off a major restructuring plan later this month
or early next month.
</P>
<P>
   They did, however, confirm that NEC would consolidate its
various military-related businesses into a single unit, NEC Network
and Sensor Systems Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper said NEC would liquidate NEC Home Electronics,
which produces everything from monitors and CD-ROM units to
refrigerators, rice cookers and light bulbs, and cluster its other
businesses into three or four ``companies'' that would have greatly
expanded latitude to make decisions and set priorities.
</P>
<P>
   It also said the company planned to sell its Tokyo headquarters
building and lease it back, which would generate cash and lower
costs over the long term.
</P>
<P>
   Left unanswered was what NEC might do with Packard Bell, the
struggling personal computer manufacturer in which it owns majority
control. The company has spent at least $2 billion since it first
bought into Packard Bell in 1995, and many analysts would like to
see it throw in the towel.
</P>
<P>
   NEC began writing down its investment in Packard Bell this year.
It has already written off the book value of its Home Electronics
division.
</P>
<P>
   According to the newspaper, the company will take a 100 billion
yen charge for the restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   NEC has been taking restructuring charges of between 20 billion
yen and 30 billion yen ($184 million to $276 million) for many of
the last several years, according to Steven W. Myers, senior
analyst at Jardine Fleming Securities in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is taking this as a sign that management is finally
willing to act, when, in fact, this looks like it is simply the
latest of a series of restructuring charges of this magnitude,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the enthusiasm for the stock reflects optimism for
the company's reform strategy. The shares have been gaining ever
since last week, when the company announced plans to invest 30
billion yen in developing and expanding its business as an Internet
service provider. Its so-called Biglove service, currently
available only in Japan, is expected to grow from 2.7 million
subscribers to 10 million subscribers worldwide by September 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Myers said some investors have come to regard NEC as a credible
alternative investment to the Fujitsu Corp., whose commitment to
building its Internet services has made it a darling of the
investment community.

 By DEBORAH SONTAG    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The slick posters, with their multihued Stars of
David, came down as quickly as they had gone up.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is more than one way to be a Jew,'' their slogan read.
</P>
<P>
   In this town, the center of ultra-Orthodox life in Israel, it
was not a thought that everybody wanted plastered on the walls, and
especially not on the eve of the Jewish New Year, which began
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   But the Reform and Conservative Judaic movements had considered
the timing perfect. To kick off the New Year, they began a large
and extraordinary American-financed public education campaign to
explain liberal Judaism, much maligned here, to secular Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   The posters, plastered on and then ripped off of bus stop
shelters, were only a part of their effort. Reform and Conservative
organizations also put up billboards, ran commercials and stuffed
newspapers with fliers inviting Israelis to their few synagogues
here for the High Holy Days.
</P>
<P>
   Secular Israelis know little about Reform and Conservative
Judaism, apart from the groups' clashes over who is a Jew with
ultra-Orthodox parties, which do not recognize the liberal
movements as Judaism at all. But the movements, to which the
majority of American Jews belong, were wagering that Israelis are
looking for a modern way to practice their religion.
</P>
<P>
   As could have been expected, however, the nationwide campaign,
which is financed by a $360,000 grant from a family foundation in
San Francisco, quickly stumbled on roadblocks and controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intent of this campaign was to de-demonize liberal
Judaism,'' said Bonnie Boxer, Israel representative for the
backers, the Richard and Rhoda Goldman Fund of San Francisco. Rhoda
Goldman, who died in 1996, was a great-grandniece and heir of Levi
Strauss, the denim manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to show the Israeli public that these are sincere
religious movements in Judaism that have something to offer the
secular or moderately religious Israelis,'' Ms. Boxer continued.
``We also wanted to do it in a way that was removed from contention
and controversy. That part didn't exactly happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Israel Broadcasting Authority and the army radio station at
first refused to broadcast the movements' commercials, saying they
were politically contentious. This immediately forced the campaign
into the courts.
</P>
<P>
   The movements themselves antagonized even some supporters by
alternating a positive message stressing religious pluralism with a
more combative one.
</P>
<P>
   The second message, critics said, purposely exploits the
conflict between secular and religious Israelis by in effect
blaming the supposed religious coercion of the Orthodox for turning
Israelis off religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mommy, Daddy,'' says a little girl on their brochure, ``it's
not your fault that you've developed such a negative attitude
toward Judaism.''
</P>
<P>
   It would have been surprising if such a campaign had gone
smoothly, given the considerable tension between the tiny Reform
and Conservative communities here and the powerful ultra-Orthodox
movement, which controls religious life in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The ultra-Orthodox antagonism toward the liberal Jewish
movements was bluntly summed up in 1997 by one of Israel's two
chief rabbis, Eliyahu Bakshi-Doron, who described all Reform rabbis
as ``clowns.''
</P>
<P>
   In battles that have become international Jewish issues, the
Reform and Conservative movements have fought with the
ultra-Orthodox for the right to perform conversions and weddings
that would be recognized by the state. The ultra-Orthodox have
fought back and won, for now.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict, meanwhile, has been followed closely by
non-Orthodox American Jewish groups. Many of them are supported by
ardent Zionists who feel personally attacked when their Jewish
credentials are challenged by the Jewish homeland's chief rabbis.
</P>
<P>
   What bothers many American Jews most of all is that secular
Israelis have absorbed some of the Orthodox hostility toward Reform
and Conservative Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   Secular Israelis, the saying here goes, do not go to synagogue,
but the synagogue they do not go to is Orthodox.
</P>
<P>
   As alienated as many of them are by the strictly Orthodox, the
secular are also married and buried by their rabbis, according to
state law, and many see them as the most genuine Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Some secular Israelis are as dismissive of Reform and
Conservative Judaism as the Orthodox. They, too, see the liberal
movements as watered-down Judaism: religious clubs for non-Israeli
Jews _ a way to keep their Jewish identity alive. To residents of
the Jewish homeland, where Jewish identity comes naturally, Reform
and Conservative Judaism can seem irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   But the determined campaign seeks to build on a small base of
Reform and Conservative synagogues and schools in Israel that
traditionally catered to English-speaking immigrants. Now they are
drawing a growing number of native Israelis, as well as Russian and
Ethiopian immigrants. The movements' polls indicate that there is a
growing appetite for liberal rabbis and a more modern
interpretation of traditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this country's first 50 years, Israelis were either
Orthodox or secular,'' said Rabbi Uri Regev, who is Israeli-born
and a leader of the Reform movement here. ``What we find now is
that Israelis are eager to relate to and seek an alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it represents a more comprehensive change in Israel _
a growing pursuit of personal fulfillment, a growing appreciation
of diversity and a growing resentment of collectivism and
collective thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   In a backlash against the Orthodox control of religious
services, a number of Israelis are seeking Reform rabbis to
officiate at bar and bat mitzvahs and weddings. (But since only
Israeli weddings conducted by Orthodox rabbis are recognized,
couples must then travel abroad for a civil ceremony to obtain a
marriage certificate.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Our rabbis are sought after beyond endurance to provide life
cycle services,'' Regev said. ``It's so crazy that we find
ourselves seeking rabbis willing to immigrate because we simply
don't have enough.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday the Israel Broadcasting Authority _ although not the
army _ consented to run the campaign's commercials after some
wording changes were made.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court had given the authority 17 days to explain why
it was unwilling to broadcast the ads, and the authority worked out
a compromise with Reform and Conservative representatives.
</P>
<P>
   The first of 370 advertising spots, in Hebrew and Russian, were
broadcast on Wednesday, offering toll-free numbers to those
interested in a Jewish movement where ``we don't just pray.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Shalom,'' Rabbi Motti Rotem, chairman of the Movement for
Progressive Judaism, says in the ad. ``I want to wish you all a
Happy New Year and invite you to our communities around the
country. We have full equality between men and women.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultra-Orthodox politicians blamed the Supreme Court for
indirectly allowing the commercials on the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are being progressively squashed and trodden upon,'' said
Meir Porush, a member of Parliament from the United Torah Judaism
faction. ``If this situation continues, we will have a cultural war
here, the likes of which we have not seen in a hundred years.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 500,000 brochures, inserted into community and national
newspapers, included the picture of the little girl who tells her
parents not to feel guilty about being secular.
</P>
<P>
   That approach, Regev said, was insisted upon by advertising
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not wish to be confrontational,'' he said. ``But you
have to get people to want to open it up and look at it, they said.
They said we should be provocative.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Rosenblum, a spokesman for the strictly Orthodox
community and a columnist for The Jerusalem Post, said he doubted
that the campaign would greatly benefit the liberal movements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judaism is not a commodity to be sold on billboards and in
newspaper ads,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblum added that the campaign was highly professional and
that, in contrast, the Orthodox were ``complete shlemazels when it
comes to PR.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said he believed that ``the Reform have barely made a
dent on Israeli religious life.'' He added: ``Orthodox Jews believe
in the Torah and its power to transform lives. Reform, on the other
hand, lacks a comparable confidence in what it is offering. The
movement spends millions on large press offices and teams of
lawyers, as if the Israeli Supreme Court or Madison Avenue could
somehow mandate Reform belief.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CAN END HERE.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In front of the Jerusalem convention center, a defaced campaign
poster testifies to the controversy. Its slogan, in Hebrew, was
altered by one letter, which transforms the word ``Jew.''
</P>
<P>
   It reads, ``There is more than one way to be an Indian.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   TURIN, Italy _ For most of Fiat's 132,000 Italian employees,
breakfast usually consists of little more than an espresso and a
newspaper. But on a recent morning, Paolo Fresco sat ramrod
straight in a dining room of Fiat's executive suite and, in vaguely
accented English, ordered ``scrambled eggs, very soft, and a side
order of bacon _ very, very crisp.''
</P>
<P>
   Fresco, 66, a large athletic man with silvery hair, was born in
Italy and holds an Italian passport. Fourteen months ago, he became
chairman of Fiat SpA, the industrial giant that is one of Italy's
biggest corporations. He is, in short, as Italian as they come.
</P>
<P>
   But as his culinary preferences reflect, Fresco's fabric goes
well beyond his heritage. For nearly four decades, he worked for
General Electric, a darling of American investors, climbing the
corporate ladder to become vice chairman under John F. Welch Jr.
before retiring from the company last year.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is bringing some of his _ and perhaps Jack Welch's _
American ways to the task of revitalizing Fiat.
</P>
<P>
   Fresco is not the first of Welch's disciples to carry GE's
genetic code elsewhere. In 1991, Lawrence A. Bossidy left the
company to lead a turnaround at Allied Signal; the next year, Glen
H. Hiner departed to test his mettle at Owens Corning.
</P>
<P>
   What makes Fresco's story intriguing is his effort to take a
chapter from the Welch book of American-style management to Italy,
a land of cosseted industries and traditions like lifetime
employment.
</P>
<P>
   The tenets of GE management include being No. 1 or No. 2 in a
business, or getting out of it; picking managers that can motivate
people and make them work as a team; encouraging communication;
thinking long-term and strategically, instead of just tactically;
building shareholder value.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company that doesn't change doesn't survive,'' Fresco
said, downing his bacon and eggs while quoting Welch, then washing
it all down with a cup of American coffee topped with a dollop of
cream.
</P>
<P>
   Americans think of Fiat as an auto company, but its empire
extends far beyond cars, to farm equipment, insurance and even a
daily newspaper here, La Stampa. This year, for the first time,
cars will account for less than half of Fiat's roughly $50 billion
in revenue, and it is Fresco's charge to run Fiat as a modern
conglomerate, like GE.
</P>
<P>
   That could entail fundamental change for a company celebrating
its 100th birthday. Fiat's car division is losing ground in global
rankings.
</P>
<P>
   Producing fewer than three million cars a year, it lacks the
scale of General Motors, Ford Motor or Toyota Motor and faces
powerful new alliances like the DaimlerChrysler combination and the
Renault's tie-up with Nissan Motor. Losses in the last four
quarters underscore Fiat's weakness.
</P>
<P>
   And so Fresco, a lawyer by training, may end up presiding over
the company's departure from the car business, through a merger or
sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can continue to be alone,'' he said. But, he added, ``that
doesn't mean you turn down an offer if it comes across.''
</P>
<P>
   His comment echoes the views of Gianni Agnelli, Fiat's chief
shareholder and honorary chairman. Agnelli's grandfather founded
the company and has known Fresco since the early 1960s, when Fresco
was hired by an Italian GE unit of which Fiat was part-owner, to
set up a legal department.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, Fiat cars is in a position to proceed on its own, but
it neither can nor wants to do that forever,'' Agnelli, 78, told a
shareholders meeting in July. ``It is destined to find some form of
alliance. Which and when, I do not now know. I do know, however,
that it is equipping itself.''
</P>
<P>
   One Fiat executive with regular access to Fresco is more blunt:
``Fresco's role is to get the bride ready for a suitor.''
</P>
<P>
   The chairman has wasted no time putting to work for Fiat the
deal-making skills that he honed at GE.
</P>
<P>
   In May, he rushed to Racine, Wis., to sign a $4.3 billion deal
to buy the Case Corp., the heavy-equipment manufacturer that he is
combining with Fiat's New Holland unit. The size of the merged
company will rival that of Deere &AMP; Co. in farm machinery and that
of Caterpillar and Komatsu in construction equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Two months earlier, he agreed to pay $350 million to acquire
Progressive Tool and Industries of Southfield, Mich., for Fiat's
Comau unit, now among the world leaders in automobile manufacturing
systems. Before that, Comau acquired control of Renault Automation,
which also makes auto factory equipment.
</P>
<P>
   And there have been other deals. Last year, for instance, Fiat
and Renault agreed to merge their foundry units, which cast heavy
metal parts, and their bus-building businesses. At the same time,
Teksid, Fiat's foundry company, struck a deal with the Eaton Corp.
of Cleveland to make cylinder head systems, following a trend for
components manufacturers to produce large subassemblies for cars
and trucks. This summer, Fiat agreed with Mitsubishi to develop a
sport utility vehicle for sale in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But Fresco's most daring bid failed. Earlier this year, he and
Paolo Cantarella, Fiat's chief executive, offered $15 billion to
acquire Volvo, whose car, bus and truck operations Fresco says were
a perfect fit for Fiat's similar businesses. Volvo's unwillingness
to sell the entire operation _ and a $6.5 billion counterbid by
Ford for Volvo's car business alone _ thwarted the plan. The
episode has been the lone major setback for Fiat shareholders since
markets shook off Russia's financial problems last fall.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Fiat shares closed on Friday at 32 euros, up from about 21 euros
early last October.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're striving for excellence,'' Fresco said with a soft
reserve that sets him apart from more vociferous executives in his
country. ``The best way is obviously to pursue growth of the
organizaton by a focus on quallity and customer satisfaction. But
acquisitions can accelerate it.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he said, ``Cantarella and I have been accelerating the
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Fresco has the global grasp needed to face Fiat's
problems.
</P>
<P>
   He has traveled widely, first while based in Italy from the time
he joined GE and then from the company's headquarters in Fairfield,
Conn., where Welch hauled him in 1990. When based in the United
States, an office and an apartment in London.
</P>
<P>
   At Fiat, he keeps an apartment in Turin, not far from Fiat's
headquarters, but has a home in Florence. An avid sailor and
mountaineer, he has summer homes in Portofino, on the
Mediterranean, and in Cortina d'Ampezzo, in the northern Italian
Alps. His British secretary followed him to Fiat, providing
continuity for his global reach.
</P>
<P>
   It was in the 80s, as head of GE's operations in Europe, the
Middle East and Africa, that Fresco became a corporate star. He had
told his superiors that the fall of inner-European trade barriers,
scheduled for 1992, would offer enormous opportunities to companies
with a strong European and global presence. Partly in response,
Welch began a major globalization drive _ and Fresco was his chief
lieutenant.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, they were side by side as GE agreed to swap its
consumer electronics division _ America's biggest maker of
television sets and videocassette recorders _ for the medical
imaging unit of Thomson-CSF SA, the French electronics giant.
</P>
<P>
   Soon thereafter, the team snagged several big international
prizes, acquiring control of Tungsram, the Hungarian light bulb
maker, in 1989 and, the next year, the light bulb division of
Britain's Thorn EMI. The acquistions, gave GE's lighting division
the size to face down global competitors like Royal Philips
Electronics of the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Through these deals and others, the men cemented a close
friendship. ``He is an incredibly thoughtful, strategic guy,''
Welch said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Fresco also served as Welch's roving ambassador, smoothing the
way for the American's annual worldwide tours to meet government
and business officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's remarkably _ what's the right word? _ sociable,'' Welch
said. ``He adjusts to any culture. He's an American in America.
He's a Saudi in Saudi Arabia.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Welch is paying back the favors. In July, he joined the
Fiat board _ his only such membership, besides his post as GE's
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``That exactly reflects the depth of the relationship,'' said
Noel M. Tichy, a University of Michigan business professor and
co-author of ``Control Your Destiny or Someone Else Will''
(Doubleday, 1993), an analysis of Welch's management methods.
``Jack Welch does not go on boards.''
</P>
<P>
   Welch's role is still undefined, though he will serve on a
committee examining executive compensation. Fresco ``has been a
great sounding board for me over the years,'' Welch said. ``I'd
like to repay him for what he's done for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Fresco is equally effusive. ``He's the best chief executive in
the United States,'' he said of Welch. ``It's nice to have him
around.''
</P>
<P>
   At least in part, Fresco's arrival here is a result of big
changes in Fiat's corporate governance _ changes that demanded
someone with a global perspective on business.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the company was a fief of the Agnellis. But the
family's holdings have dipped to 30 percent, from 70 percent right
after World War II. At the same time, the Agnellis have increased
their investments outside Fiat and Italy, most notably in France.
Ten years ago, Fiat represented 80 percent of the Agnellis'
holdings; today the figure is 57 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At Fiat, too, the strategic thrust has been out of Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The company vastly expanded its presence in Poland after the
collapse of communism there in 1989, as a base for serving Central
European markets, and it has joint ventures to produce cars in
China and Russia. Fiat has built factories in Latin America for its
Palio world car _ a vehicle intended for sale in many countries,
with few modifications _ and other plants are planned or are under
construction in India, Russia, South Africa and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian government, nonetheless, has been a friendly
partner.
</P>
<P>
   When Fiat decided in 1994 to lay off 14,000 Italian workers,
Rome jumped in with about $100 million for early-retirement
packages and for a fund to pay the workers 90 percent of their
salaries for up to a year. A few years earlier, the government
provided infrastructure and other aid worth about $1 billion for an
innovative factory at Melfi, in southern Italy. And in recent
years, much of Fiat's success in Italy was a result of government
incentives that subsidized purchases of new cars.
</P>
<P>
   Some Welch-like changes were evident even before Fresco's
arrival. By 1998, the number of employees at Fiat's core holding
company had been cut by more than half, to 257 from 565 five years
earlier, shortening lines of command between the center and Fiat's
10 operating companies. Fiat had been selling businesses, too _
shedding interests in chemical fibers and bioengineering and even a
stake in the port of Genoa, which it sold to the Singapore port
authority.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Fresco attributes Fiat's car problems to a pernicious
combination of internal and external factors. The economic meltdown
in Brazil, where Fiat is market leader, has hurt badly; in Italy,
the end of the government incentives in July 1998 led to a drop in
sales that was aggravated by a vicious price war with European and
American competitors, including Renault and Ford.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Within the company, the product cycle was of no help: the
original Punto compact car _ Fiat's entry, in the early '90s, into
the biggest and most lucrative market segment in Europe, and
Europe's best-selling car in 1997 and 1998 _ was reaching the end
of its shelf life. And Fiat's top-of-the-line Alfa Romeo and Lancia
models were also reaching the end of their cycles.
</P>
<P>
   But Fresco says the car division is now on the right track. In
July, Fiat introduced a redesigned Punto. And the company is
reviving the sporty Alfa Romeo brand with two stylish models, the
156 and 166, and the big-car Lancia brand with a new model called
the Lybra.
</P>
<P>
   Fresco also defends Fiat's strategy of focusing on emerging
markets. ``Those are the only markets where you can expect
growth,'' he said, adding, ``I believe our specialization in small
cars, where we have competence, puts us in an attractive strategic
position.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiat, he said, will continue to hunt aggressively for
partnerships with other car and component makers and will work on
cutting costs in production and distribution, where it has already
begun to weed out dealerships. By the last quarter of the year, he
vowed, Fiat cars will be back in the black.
</P>
<P>
   With nine years to go before he reaches Fiat's mandatory
retirement age, Fresco may find that his success will depend at
least in part on his ability to get the company's work force to
match his energy and focus on results.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, Fiat's ability to reward merit has been bogged
down by internal rules, often demanded by powerful labor unions,
requiring carefully staggered pay raises and at least two years
between promotions, said Nevio Di Giusto, senior vice president for
development.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Fiat had a weakness, we were accused of treating people
indifferently of their performance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That must change, Di Giusto said _ and managers must learn to
bring weaknesses to light mercilessly, rather than trying to
conceal them. ``The world's getting more open, and this has to find
expression in Fiat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Fresco has proposed stock options for Fiat's top 700
executives, and he wants to spread the reward system down to middle
management. His own compensation and that of Cantarella includes
stock options and is also linked directly to the performance of
Fiat's stock, a rarity not only in Italy but in the United States
as well.
</P>
<P>
   His success may also depend on his ability to identify new areas
of growth. In his Welch-style search, he is stressing services,
including financial products.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is not so much to give some new widget to the
customer, but total solutions,'' he said. ``And in the car
business, that means selling peace of mind.'' In one planned
solution, he said, if a customer's car broke down, Fiat would
supply a new one; in commercial vehicles, a total solution could
mean expanding the leasing business. A plus is that the required
investment is minimal, compared with changing manufacturing lines.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare for the growth of the company's financial services
businesses, Fresco has recast the financial management, appointing
Damien Clermont, a Frenchman who previously was senior vice
president for management control at Fiat, as chief financial
officer.
</P>
<P>
   Here, too, parallels with GE are inescapable. ``Welch ran a top
team, very informally, with lots of interaction,'' Tichy said.
``Everyone is expected to add value. It's not a one-man show.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Fresco bristles at those who refer to a Fresco era at
Fiat. On a recent Sunday, he watched television aboard his yacht as
Fiat's fabled Ferrari racing team finished one-two in the German
Formula One Grand Prix. Mika Salo, a Ferrari driver, moved aside to
let Eddie Irvine, another Ferrari driver, win the race, raising
Ferrari's overall standing in the season's ranking under a complex
tallying system.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not just one man; it was a team,'' Fresco exulted.
``And that's the way we want to be _ a team. We want to win.''

AFGHANISTAN PRODUCES 75 PERCENT OF WORLD'S OPIUM, U.N. REPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: This story, filed Sept. 9 and held, is now released. Please
use this version.)  
 (bl)  
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Benefiting from a bumper harvest and wider cultivation,
Afghanistan more than doubled its production of opium in the past
year and now accounts for three-quarters of the world opium crop,
according to a U.N. report issued Friday in Vienna, Austria.
</P>
<P>
   The jump in production, to an estimated 5,060 tons from 2,310
last year, has alarmed the head of the U.N. Office for Drug Control
and Crime Prevention, Pino Arlacchi. Arlacchi said he had advised
Secretary-General Kofi Annan that Afghan opium production was
spinning out of control.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a policy for Afghanistan,'' Arlacchi said this week in
a telephone interview from Moscow, where he has been discussing
drug control with Russian officials. ``We cannot stay and wait and
see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Afghanistan's record output could potentially flood
Western Europe, the primary market for heroin refined from Afghan
opium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seventy-five percent of the world's production is simply not
tolerable'' from Afghanistan, Arlacchi said.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a customary 10-to-1 ratio for refining opium into
heroin, the jump in production could mean as much as 270 additional
tons of heroin on the world drug market in coming months, if the
estimate is accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Afghan traffickers have been encountering added difficulties in
transporting opium after a smuggling crackdown by neighboring Iran.
Arlacchi said hundreds of tons of opium, and possibly some heroin,
were believed stockpiled in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, Myanmar, which for years was believed to be the
leading opium producer, reaped an estimated 1,320 tons in the last
year, said the survey, conducted for the U.N. International Drug
Control Program in Vienna. Arlacchi said Myanmar, formerly Burma,
had reduced its output 8 to 10 percent over the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller quantities of opium were reportedly grown in Colombia,
the source of most heroin that reaches New York City, and in Laos,
Thailand and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Arlacchi said Afghanistan's emergence as the leading producer
confirmed a trend toward concentrating drug production in fewer
countries, a factor that could make the threat simpler to combat.
Colombia produces most of the world's cocaine and has increased its
cultivation of coca leaf, while Peru and Bolivia have curtailed
their plantings.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. survey reported opium poppy cultivation for the first
time in Jawzjan and Kunduz Provinces of northern Afghanistan,
meaning that opium is now grown in 18 of the 31 provinces.
Ninety-seven percent of the opium is cultivated in areas controlled
by the Taliban, the militant Islamic movement that dominates the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The production increase follows heavy rains, hailstorms and
earthquakes last year, problems that reduced the harvest by a
quarter and led to failures in parts of central and southern
Afghanistan. Farmers scrambled to make up losses by planting more
poppies and now have little incentive to scale back what has been a
43 percent increase in cultivation, the report found.
</P>
<P>
   Afghanistan's remote terrain, absence of an effective central
government and continuing civil warfare have helped opium thrive.
The Taliban leadership has expressed disapproval of opium as
contrary to Islam, but tolerates its cultivation as a cash crop and
even levies an agricultural tax on it.
</P>
<P>
   Arlacchi has contended that drug crops could be eradicated by
having farmers substitute legal crops in return for development
projects like schools, health clinics and roads. The new survey
reports that opium production in Afghanistan declined in the
Maiwand, Ghorak and Khakrez districts, where the United Nations has
introduced experimental programs in cooperation with local
officials.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When Arlacchi visited Afghanistan in November 1997, he asked
Taliban leaders to crack down on opium production in return for
development aid, but he says now that they have not followed
through.
</P>
<P>
   Arlacchi described Russian officials as extremely worried that
profits generated by Afghan opium could be used by Islamic
militants to destabilize Tajikistan and other neighbors in Central
Asia. He said he planned to ask the United States and other U.N.
members to draft a strategy to block opium exports through the
countries that border Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   To compile its annual survey, the U.N. program employed Afghans
to travel through rural areas where opium cultivation had been
reported and to interview farmers and officials.
</P>
<P>
   The United States takes a similarly pessimistic view of
Afghanistan's expanding production. But its estimates, based on a
different methodology that involves satellite imagery, are more
conservative. The State Department reported in March that
Afghanistan produced 1,485 tons of opium in 1998. The department
has not released its 1999 estimate.

LITTLE HOPE FOR FINDING MORE SURVIVORS OF QUAKE IN GREECE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Greece _ As a towering power shovel tore through the
debris of what was once the Fourlis appliance showroom, the
exhausted chief of the rescue team, Mihalis Gaitatzis, acknowledged
Friday what most Greeks accepted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to give up hope, but what we're doing now is
looking for dead bodies,'' Gaitatzis said. ``We've figured out
where one is, and there are at least two more left to find. Bodies
are pretty much all we can hope to find at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Three days after a powerful earthquake struck Athens, hopes of
finding more survivors had faded. The death toll was reported to
have reached 101, with more than 24 people still missing.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the foreign teams that arrived to help the rescue
effort, including one from Germany that was working at the Fourlis
site, called off their searches Friday after concluding that there
was no longer a realistic chance of finding survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Because the quake struck at midafternoon, most of those killed
were at work. Their misfortune was to be in buildings unable to
bear the shock.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Fourlis showroom collapsed almost entirely, killing
about 10 people and trapping seven others for many hours, the
buildings on both sides of it survived without so much as a broken
window. Prosecutors are investigating whether anomalies like that
were a result of shoddy construction, and they have pledged to
bring charges against any contractors found to have violated
building codes.
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors walked slowly Friday along streets where houses were
damaged, spray painting them with crosses. They painted red crosses
on buildings that were so unsafe that they had to be condemned.
Yellow crosses mark those that are temporarily unsafe, and green
ones mean that residents are free to move back in.
</P>
<P>
   By midday, red crosses had been painted on more than 800
buildings. The government has promised owners help in buying new
houses. But in most cases, the aid is not expected to cover the
full cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is scared and wants his house checked,'' said Yiannis
Chrysikopoulos of the Public Works Ministry. He also urged
contractors to stop pouring concrete at building sites here until
further notice. He said that aftershocks could prevent the concrete
from settling properly and render it unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   A government spokesman, Dimitris Reppas, said 20,000 tents would
be ready for occupancy by Monday. He said he expected the tents to
be used for several months, suggesting that people would be living
in them well after the weather began to turn cold.
</P>
<P>
   Tent communities have sprung up in Kifisia, Metamorfosi and
other northern neighborhoods, where the quake struck most strongly.
One community is on the grounds of a Greek Orthodox monastery.
</P>
<P>
   Reppas said the government had deployed 8,000 police officers in
the neighborhoods to guard against theft and looting.
</P>
<P>
   Earthquakes are not uncommon in Greece. But Tuesday's was the
most serious in more than 40 years, occurring less than four weeks
after a huge earthquake in Turkey killed more than 15,000 people.
There have been aftershocks, and many people continue sleeping
outdoors rather than take what they consider the risk of returning
to their houses. Many others are taking advantage of the weekend to
travel to their ancestral villages in other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The Mendini neighborhood, where the quake caused much damage, is
where athletes who are competing in the 2004 Olympic Games are to
be housed. After the Games, the Olympic village is to be converted
into a permanent housing complex.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic organizing committee spokesman Yiannis Sinodinos said
construction of the village would proceed as planned, ``with
specific earthquake-proof standards, so that there will not be any
damage in the circumstance that there is a new earthquake.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not foresee any changes in the location,'' Sinodinos
said.
</P>
<P>
   The government began investigating why most mobile telephone
system ceased to operate immediately after the quake. News reports
said phone companies had increased their number of subscribers
beyond their capacity to handle surges of calls. The companies
attract prospective customers in part by promoting the usefulness
of mobile phones in emergencies. But many users found themselves
unable to use their phones after the quake.

   AUSTIN, Texas _ Talk about information overload.
</P>
<P>
   A day after making the identities of individual campaign donors
available for the whole cyberworld to see, the presidential camp of
Gov. George W. Bush was scrambling to keep its overtaxed database
afloat on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Aides for the GOP frontrunner said the unprecedented move to
offer a daily update on political donors through the candidate's
Internet site had generated higher-than-anticipated interest from
web crawlers who want to see what a $50 million war chest looks
like.
</P>
<P>
   ``|We nearly crashed the system this (Friday) morning,'' said
Mindy Tucker, a Bush spokeswoman. ``But it's good because it means
people are really interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Many visitors to the candidate's official Internet home
www.georgewbush.com experienced severe delays on Friday trying to
access the donation lists which number more than 874 pages.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker said technicians were working to add more capacity to the
system to accommodate the crush of users. Exact figures for the
number of people who visited the site _ or ``hits'' in computer
jargon _ were not available, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is the first presidential candidate to release the names of
his donors prior to the next federally mandated reporting period,
which is in October.
</P>
<P>
   Bush donor retired Air Force Lt. Col. John Gross of San Antonio
said he had no problem with his identity being made available on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea he (Bush) was going to do this, but I don't give
a darn,'' said the 65-year-old Gross, who contributed $30 on Aug.
4.
</P>
<P>
   Gross, who estimates he gave Bush a total of $2,000 during both
of his gubernatorial races as well as his current bid for
president, said he hoped the effort at more disclosure doesn't
deter more privacy-conscious individuals from contributing to Bush
in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he'll make it. I hope so,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer watchdogs have given Bush mixed reviews on his effort
to open his campaign books for public inspection. Critics say the
information on the web site isn't user friendly because searches
are almost impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We give him an A+ for the concept, but we give him a D- for
the execution,'' said Craig McDonald, the director of Texans for
Public Justice.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald said the site is of little value to the recreational
computer user because it is difficult to identify groupings of
contributors, such as lobbyists or members of special interest
groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the average citizen to make something meaningful of this
information, it would take them all the way to end of the
inauguration,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald, however, did reserve some praise for Bush. He said he
wished every presidential candidate would at least follow Bush's
lead when it comes to the disclosure of contributions.

 &HT;    Tax burden causes one insurance firm to threaten to leave
Georgia
 &HT;    By Peter Mantius
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Doyle Kelly, president of CNL Insurance America Inc.
in Macon, figures he'll need to move his company's headquarters to
another state within two years if Georgia doesn't ease up on its
insurance premium tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't afford to wait a lot longer,'' Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   CNL would be the latest in a growing list of Georgia insurers
that have moved their legal headquarters to states like Illinois,
Massachusetts, Connecticut and New Jersey because of the tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``The premium tax was everything. We wouldn't have moved absent
that,'' said Scott Thompson, president of American Southern
Insurance Co., which moved from Georgia to Kansas in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Under a law imposed in 1983, Georgia taxes as much as 4.75
percent of premiums on auto, homeowners and other property/casualty
risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several (property/casualty) companies were brighter than us
and left immediately after that law was passed,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   The high tax rate doesn't hurt Georgia insurers competitively
within the state, because all insurers have to pay the Georgia rate
_ and all pass the cost on to their policyholders.
</P>
<P>
   The problem arises when Georgia companies sell policies in other
states and are crushed by retaliatory taxes that their competitors
don't have to pay.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when a Florida company sells a policy in Georgia,
it pays Georgia's 4.75 percent tax, just like every other company.
But when a Georgia company sells a policy in Florida, Florida
collects the high Georgia rate from Georgia-based companies.
Florida companies pay the 1.75 percent Florida rate.
</P>
<P>
   Retaliatory taxes have hurt CNL as it has expanded outside
Georgia. Kelly said the company, which earned about $500,000 on
sales of about $50 million last year, had to pay $142,000 in
retaliatory taxes in Tennessee alone last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Georgia will never become any kind of insurance center if the
current tax structure remains,'' Thompson said. ``But nobody's been
able to crack the nut of how you replace the lost revenue. That
short-term issue has been driving the long-range problem.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   If you like sausage or legislation, the saying goes, you
shouldn't look too closely at how it is made. I suggest that we add
stock market averages to that list. The more closely we examine
these indexes, the less confidence we should place in conclusions
drawn from comparisons to them.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not referring here to the obvious, apples-and-oranges
mistake of comparing, say, the performance of a
small-capitalization stock fund to an index of large-cap stocks.
The problem is more basic: The construction methods for popular
indexes can create significant biases.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index. It is
capitalization-weighted, meaning that a stock's contribution to its
overall return is a function of the company's size. Microsoft, for
example, with a market cap near $500 billion, has an index
weighting more than 1,000 times that of Fruit of the Loom, which
has a market cap of under $300 million, the smallest in the index.
</P>
<P>
   Such weighting can lead to absurd comparisons. Imagine what the
S&AMP;P 500's performance would be during a hypothetical year in which
498 of its component stocks were unchanged, Fruit of the Loom
doubled in price and Microsoft fell by 6.25 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   The index would be slightly negative for the year, because the
slight decline in Microsoft's price would reduce its market cap by
more than the increase at Fruit of the Loom.
</P>
<P>
   Using the same hypothetical year, consider a financial adviser
who regarded both of these companies as equally good bets and
invested the same amount of money in each. His portfolio would gain
about 50 percent, stomping the S&AMP;P 500; many investors would
conclude that he was a genius. Yet, in fact, this adviser would
perform no better than the average of those two stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The S&AMP;P 500, of course, is a closely followed index, its
popularity seen in the proliferation of mutual funds that track its
performance. But the index is an appropriate benchmark only to the
extent that you or your adviser insist on weighting your
investments in favor of large-cap stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The only investors for whom this is even remotely relevant are
some huge institutional managers, who are prevented from investing
heavily in the smallest stocks. But if you're putting equal amounts
of money into stocks of different sizes _ say Microsoft and Fruit
of the Loom _ you should find an index that gives equal weight to
each.
</P>
<P>
   That is more easily said than done. Because of a statistical
quirk, indexes that give equal weight to each stock's percentage
change, known as arithmetic indexes, are upwardly biased: They
inevitably overstate the performance of component stocks. A
prominent example is the Value Line Arithmetic index.
</P>
<P>
   The upward bias results from the fact that arithmetic indexes
are rebalanced daily, to give equal weight to each stock's
percentage change. To mimic such an index, an investor would have
to sell small amounts of the component stocks that did better than
average on a particular day and buy small amounts of those that
fared below average.
</P>
<P>
   By constantly buying low and selling high, the investor would
inevitably turn in a relatively stellar performance _ provided that
he didn't have to pay commissions on those myriad trades. A
commission-paying investor who tracks an arithmetic index can't
hope to come close to it.
</P>
<P>
   Some statisticians have suggested a correction for this upward
bias, using logarithms to determine the proper weighting for each
stock's percentage change. The resulting gauges are called
geometric indexes _ the best known being Value Line's.
</P>
<P>
   But the averaging method in geometric indexes has the opposite
effect _ it is biased downward. So geometric averages always have
returns that are less than corresponding arithmetic versions. In
fact, geometric indexes are about as biased on the downside as
arithmetic indexes are on the upside.
</P>
<P>
   An ideal gauge, then, lies somewhere between arithmetic and
geometric indexes. So I suggest averaging the two, and using this
composite in judging portfolio performance. The comparison will be
much more valuable than one based on the S&AMP;P 500. &QL;

with crimes against humanity while they were imprisoned and
tortured during his 1971-86 rule. Duvalier, now 49, has lived in
France since he was overthrown in 1986, although his present
whereabouts are not known. The case may not make it to court,
lawyers said, because the crimes of which he is accused took place

crimes against humanity.

INDEPENDENCE LEADER SAYS MILITARY BEHIND CARNAGE

<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ East Timor independence leader Jose Ramos-Horta
Friday accused the Indonesian military of slaughtering Catholic
clergy in the ravaged territory and pleaded again for the
international community to keep his homeland from being destroyed
and its population annihilated.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from New Zealand, Ramos-Horta said he
had received eyewitness reports of Indonesian security forces
singling out and murdering Catholic clergy, along with widespread
accounts of troops taking part in torching, looting, and forced
relocation of tens of thousands of East Timorese.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations in New York, Secretary-General Kofi Annan
told Indonesia to accept immediately a peacekeeping force for East
Timor or face responsibility for ``what could amount . . . to
crimes against humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In any event, those responsible for these crimes must be
called to account,'' he told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   UN spokeswoman Marie Okabe said about 500 UN staff had been
evacuated to Darwin, Australia, from the UN compound in Dili, the
East Timorese capital, including some 350 Timorese U.N. employees
and their families. Remaining behind in Dili were some 100 staff,
most of them international staff, and Ian Martin, the head of the
mission.
</P>
<P>
   Annan said a number of governments in the region, including
Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines and Malaysia, had assured
him of their willingness to take part in an international force to
help Indonesia fulfill its responsibility to bring order and
security to the people of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I urge the Indonesian government to accept their offer of help
without further delay,'' he said. ``If it refuses to do so, it
cannot escape responsibility for what could amount, according to
reports reaching us, to crimes against humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   The violence has been widely blamed on civilian pro-Jakarta
militias angered by the last week's decisive referendum vote in
favor of independence from Indonesia. But Ramos-Horta said the
extreme violence could only be the work of Indonesian security
forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the worst East Timorese militia would never torch the
bishop's house or chop off the heads of priests. East Timor is a
Catholic country. These killings are being done by Kopassus,'' the
special forces branch of Indonesia's military. ``These killings are
being done by Indonesians.''
</P>
<P>
   He scoffed at Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas's assertion
that any violence inflicted by soldiers was the work of rogue
elements. ``How many rogue elements is he talking about? Two-thirds
of the armed forces? In the countryside where there are no foreign
observers or journalists left, they are not even pretending to be
militias anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Journalists in Dili last week witnessed soldiers removing their
uniforms and donning the black t-shirts of the Aitarak (``Thorn'')
militia.
</P>
<P>
   Church leaders in East Timor, including Bishop Carlos Ximenes
Belo, who shared the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize with Ramos-Horta, have
been associated with resistance to the Indonesian occupation that
began in 1975. They have also been the leading voice for
reconciliation between pro- and anti-Indonesia forces.
</P>
<P>
   Belo, who fled East Timor this week after his home was stormed,
torched and shot up, said Friday from Portugal, ``We can verify
that there is a genocide, a cleansing of villages and towns'' of
both pro-independence and pro-Indonesia residents of East Timor.
He, too, begged the international community to stop the slaughter
and ``save whatever can be saved'' in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   The former Portuguese colony on the eastern end of the
Indonesian archipelago is the only predominantly Catholic province
in Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim nation. Nearly 79 percent
of East Timor's people voted last week in a United
Nations-sponsored referendum to separate from Indonesia, which
invaded East Timor in 1975. In the first five years of the
occupation, an estimated 200,000 East Timorese _ a quarter of the
population _ died as a result of civil war, famine, and disease.
Indonesia's rule over the terribity has never been recognized by
the UN, the United States, or most nations.
</P>
<P>
   Ramos-Horta said he has also received reports that pro-Indonesia
East Timorese who refused to go along with the orgy of violence
have been rounded up and taken away. Rui Lopes, a pro-Indonesia
leader and ``one of the most respected men in Suai,'' was taken
against his will to West Timor, said Ramos-Horta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what else they can do to destroy the country,''
said Ramos-Horta, speaking by telephone from Auckland, where he
hoped to pressure leaders of Pacific Rim countries to take action
against Jakarta during this week's Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation summit.
</P>
<P>
   Ramos-Horta said that if nations ``are not prepared to go to
war, then they must use all financial muscle to make Indonesia pay
the price.'' He urged the World Bank and International Monetary
Fund to cut off bailout funds that are keeping Indonesia's battered
economy afloat, and appealed to consumers to boycott Indonesian
goods and tourism.

CITING INJURY TO WHALES, CANADA HALTS COUSTEAU PROJECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW LONDON, Prince Edward Island _ Canadian officials have
halted a research project of the world-famous Jacques Cousteau
Society as authorities probe allegations that scientists and
filmmakers from the organization have harassed and endangered
breaching whales on the St. Lawrence River.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard acted after eyewitnesses _ including marine
biologists, recreational boaters, and operators of whale-watching
tours _ complained that small outboard-powered craft operating from
the Cousteau research ship Alcyone had repeatedly buzzed and bumped
whales. There are also allegations that some of the whales were
slashed by the propellers of the inflatable powerboats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never had a case with such a huge number of complaints
about harassing whales,'' said Michael Hamill, a scientist with
Canada's Department of Fisheries and Oceans. ``That it should be
the Cousteau people _ it's kind of bizarre.''
</P>
<P>
   The allegations, supported by videotapes aired by Canadian
Broadcasting Corp. that showed Cousteau boats riding onto the backs
of whales, have touched off an international furor.
</P>
<P>
   The France-based Cousteau Society Friday denied that its
research and film team had harmed whales on the St. Lawrence. The
organization _ founded by the late sea explorer who raised the
world's consciousness about the ecological importance of marine
life _ pledged to cooperate with Canadian investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish to emphatically denounce the allegations,'' said
Francine Cousteau, Jacques Cousteau's widow, who is president of
the Society.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian Coast Guard patrol vessel L'Isle-Rouge intercepted
the Alcyone late Thursday off Tadoussac, Quebec, where the
confluence of the St. Lawrence and the Saguenay rivers create
krill-rich feeding grounds that attract scores of minke, fin,
humpback, pilot, and beluga whales every summer.
</P>
<P>
   Fisheries officials boarded the Cousteau craft and ordered the
captain, Pascal Quesnel, to stop research and film making,
suspending the Society's special research permit on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   Francine Cousteau defended the Society's work in Canada, saying
that photographs appearing to show research boats veering close to
a herd of whales were ``clearly nonconclusive.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the Society's reputation had ``remained unblemished for
more than 30 years now,'' but added: ``We will take whatever
measures are necessary if ever there were unfortunate actions on
our part.''
</P>
<P>
   The Alcyone, descendant vessel of the famed Calypso that carried
Cousteau himself on so many deep sea adventures, was serving as
waterborne base for Society researchers shooting a documentary film
about whales near the mouth of the Saguenay, about 250 miles
northeast of Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Under a special permit issued by federal authorities, the
Cousteau researchers were allowed to approach whales closer than
the 200-yard limit placed on other craft. They were instructed, in
writing, to be extremely cautious and not undertake any activity
that might annoy, agitate, or harm the whales.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, eyewitnesses said, the Costeau craft charged amid fin
whales surfacing for air, occasionally slamming into the huge sea
mammals.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were roaring straight into the herds, anyone could see
this was something terribly wrong,'' said Damien Lajoie, captain of
a whale-watching boat. ``People who'd come from around the world to
watch the whales were very upset and angry.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cousteau Society this year launched several educational and
research projects in Canada, and has operated the Alcyone out of
Montreal since spring. The project on the St. Lawrence involved a
study of the various sea mammal species that cavort off Tadoussac,
as well as a documentary film on whale behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Fisheries officials said they acted after dozens of complaints
flooded their Quebec offices from whale watchers, local
environmental groups, and other federal agencies, including the
national parks service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We judged it serious enough to revoke the permit and open an
investigation,'' said Francois Mivelle-Deschenes of the Fisheries
Department.
</P>
<P>
   The Cousteau crew, headed by French explorer Bernard Delemotte,
faces fines of up to $400,000 if found guilty of violating federal
regulations on sea mammals, which forbid harassment of whales.
</P>
<P>
   Quebec naturalist Chantal Sainte-Hilaire, who said she had
witnessed ``almost unbelievable'' incidents of harassment, said
several whales have been observed with fresh cuts since the arrival
of the French research crew off Tadoussac. She said she suspects
the wounds were caused by props of the inflatable craft, used for
close filming of the animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was stunned, because I have always had so much respect for
the work of Jacques Cousteau. It is one of the most prestigious
organizations in the world,'' she said. ``But this wasn't research.
This was a chase and attack against the whales of the St.
Lawrence.''

COMMENTARY: WHO WILL SAVE US FROM OUR SAVIORS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By FRANK RICH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's one unexpected dividend in being Jewish this New Year: No
presidential aspirant is going to use a Rosh Hashana service as a
campaign opportunity to advertise his or her piety to potential
voters. While this is the election in which, as Alan Dershowitz has
put it, the candidates are ``running for bishop rather than
president,'' none of them want to be rabbi.
</P>
<P>
   Christians, alas, don't have it so good. Our aspiring chief
executives are falling over themselves to be holier than thou, not
to mention each other, as they ostentatiously declare their
devotion to Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   We have come to expect such uplift from religious conservatives,
but now it's de rigueur across the ideological spectrum, with
moderates and liberals offering up a strange new brew that might be
called Religious Right Lite.
</P>
<P>
   Witness the pilgrim's progress of Al Gore. Though he has talked
and written about his faith in the past _ as have all his rivals _
he has pumped up the volume big time as he seeks the presidency. In
late May he summoned reporters on the religion beat to break the
news that he believes ``the purpose of life is to glorify God.''
Four days earlier he had endorsed ``charitable choice'' _ a concept
coined by Sen. John Ashcroft, a Pat Robertson acolyte, to siphon
federal dollars into religious institutions.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Gore hedged about the teaching of creationism _
who would have thought that the inventor of the Internet would
believe that the Earth was invented in seven days? _ until an
outcry from his own supporters led to a hasty retreat. Scheduled
for Monday on ABC's ``World News Tonight'': an interview with the
religion correspondent Peggy Wehmeyer in which the vice president,
when asked if he is a born-again Christian, affirms that he ``had
an experience that would come under that heading.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's assume that Gore is entirely sincere _ and that so are all
his religious brethren seeking the presidency, including George W.
Bush, who has long sermonized about how faith helped him end his
youthful hell-raising at age 40. Why do they _ must they _ share
their spiritual bona fides with us now? Only a cynic, it's often
said, would believe that polls had anything to do with it _ polls
that show some 95 percent of Americans believe in God and that a
majority of Americans see the country's moral fiber as its most
pressing concern post-Columbine. But when a Gore adviser, Elaine
Kamarck, declares that ``the Democratic Party is going to take back
God this time,'' at least a little cynicism may be called for.
</P>
<P>
   Another motive for our presidential aspirants' strenuous
sermonizing, of course, is, as historian Thomas Reeves told Laurie
Goodstein of The New York Times, ``to distance themselves from the
squalor of the Clintons.'' By this logic, Gore, who needs to
distance himself the most, may have no choice but to take up
residence in a monastery, though presumably not a Buddhist one,
between now and the New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   That logic doesn't parse politically. There isn't a single
candidate for president in 2000 who can top Bill Clinton in
religiosity. He has been the P.T. Barnum of public shows of faith _
from the '92 campaign, in which he campaigned in full preaching
mode in black churches, to his Monica mea culpa of a year ago this
week, when he worked in allusions to both the New Testament and the
Yom Kippur liturgy while confessing his sins at an annual
Washington prayer breakfast. ``It was like talking to a Sunday
school teacher,'' says ABC's Ms. Wehmeyer of her own interview with
Clinton about his religious convictions earlier in his presidency.
``He knows his Bible inside out.'' But if talking the talk was no
indicator to voters of private morality in the case of our current
president, why should it be for any of those who wish to succeed
him?
</P>
<P>
   While the God-fearing homilies spouted by politicians do not
necessarily guarantee Godly behavior in private, they may well
ensure bad policy in public, such as the post-Columbine
congressional vote to allow the posting of the Ten Commandments in
public schools. ``Charitable choice,'' endorsed by Bush as well as
Gore, has something to offend everybody. Liberals should object to
the use of taxpayers' money for the possible religious coercion of
welfare recipients; conservatives should be alarmed that an
infusion of federal money will bring an intrusion of government
bureaucrats into houses of worship. We too easily forget that there
was a certain genius to our system's separation of church and
state.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, sadder-but-wiser conservatives, who have
been-there-done-that when it comes to the mixing of religion with
politics, can be among the more trenchant critics of the syndrome.
``Blinded by Right,'' the book co-written by two former lieutenants
of Jerry Falwell in his Moral Majority phase, the columnist Cal
Thomas and the Rev. Ed Dobson, offers a disillusioned inside
portrait of how religious-right leaders were co-opted or
flimflammed by their supposed GOP allies in Washington during the
Reagan-Bush era. The authors end up rejecting the very notion that
any president, however religious, can change or legislate American
morality. ``We will never have `trickle-down' morality in
America,'' writes Thomas. ``We can only hope for `bubble-up'
morality'' _ that which comes from Americans themselves, not that
handed down by their government or its leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The book also wittily observes that ``Democrats are trying hard
to become as adept at misusing and abusing God as Republicans, but
they have a long way to go because they haven't been at it as long.
...'' When I asked Thomas this week for his view of the current
scene, he noted with amusement the ``theological shoplifting'' of
religious language by both parties. ``The Democrats are no more
sincere than the Republicans,'' he said. ``And, even if they are,
what difference does it make, except to make some people feel
better about their faith?''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas remains a religious conservative, but when Bush started
talking to him about Jesus, the columnist deflected him by telling
the candidate he was ``less interested in how he's getting to
Heaven than in how he plans to get to Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   In this climate, it is a miracle to find any politician who can
resist playing preacher. One example may be Bill Bradley, who,
incredibly enough, was the only candidate in either party who
unhesitatingly took exception to the downgrading of evolution in
Kansas schools. He has in the past been public about his religion,
but, blessedly, may be swearing off chapter-and-verse in his run
for president. When George Stephanopoulos asked him Wednesday, on
``Good Morning America,'' to match his rivals by describing the
role that faith plays in his life, Bradley refused, drawing a line
of privacy. In his speech that day declaring his candidacy, he
invoked God only in a quote from the Pledge of Allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Another potential infidel is the Republicans' John McCain, the
sole GOP candidate whose name is missing from the Christian
Coalition's published list of invitees to its fall convention.
McCain is on record as having said that his faith is ``something
that's between me and my family.'' Not the least of the many
virtues of his remarkable new memoir, ``Faith of My Fathers,'' is
that he does not use his 5 1/2 years' imprisonment during the
Vietnam War as an occasion for a religious sermon. Though he speaks
broadly of his faith in God and country, the inspirational faith of
his book's title is that instilled by the Naval Academy, a code of
honor that's neither pious nor sectarian.
</P>
<P>
   Does this mean that Bradley and McCain are less religious than
their competitors? We can't know and shouldn't care. As Jonathan
Rauch has argued in National Journal, ``The more genuinely devout
the president, the less likely he is to fuss about God'' _ such as
Jimmy Carter, who ended his speeches with ``Thank you very much''
rather than the usual God-bless. Carter also proved that
religiosity, even when genuine, is no predictor of a great
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley and McCain aren't saints, either; they're politicians
who can flip-flop with the rest of them (Bradley on ethanol
subsidies, McCain on abortion). But it is telling that the only two
candidates who are not making a cause out of their spiritual bona
fides this year are the two who lived significant lives before
entering the political arena. Perhaps that gives them a perspective
that the others lack. Heretically enough by the standards of their
calling, they may even believe that a few things, such as the
private matter of one's religion, are more sacred than praying for
votes.

11 PUERTO RICAN PRISONERS RENOUNCE TERRORISM AND GO FREE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Puerto Rico, N.Y., Ind., Ill., Conn.)  (jw) 
 By DIRK JOHNSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ After vowing to renounce terrorism, 11 members of a
Puerto Rican nationalist group walked out of federal prisons around
the nation Friday, freed under an act of clemency by President
Clinton that sparked a political firestorm in the White House and
in the Senate race in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm elated that I'm free, here with my family,'' Ricardo
Jiminez, one of the released prisoners, told reporters as he left a
federal prison in Terre Haute, Ind., in a gold Mercedes.
</P>
<P>
   Those released belonged to the Puerto Rican independence
organization, FALN, which was responsible for 130 bombings in the
late '70s and early '80s. None of those granted clemency, however,
had been convicted of crimes that resulted in death or injuries,
the White House has said.
</P>
<P>
   A Puerto Rican nationalist group was staging a celebration and
rally Friday night in Chicago, where Mayor Richard Daley and police
officials have been highly critical of the president's act of
clemency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was wrong then, it's wrong today,'' Daley said earlier this
week of the crimes committed by the Puerto Rican nationalists. He
said Clinton was wrong to grant clemency without consulting local
police officials, and he said he would ask the FBI to keep abreast
of the two released prisoners who said they planned to live in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Others among those released were said to be going to Puerto
Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Charges against the FALN members stem from three different cases
in Illinois and Connecticut in the early '80s. Ten of those
released Friday were convicted of seditious conspiracy, weapons
charges and other counts after being arrested in a stolen van in
Evanston, a Chicago suburb, in 1980. They were charged in
connection with the armed robbery of a car rental agency in
Evanston and were charged with plotting another armed robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Four others were convicted of seditious conspiracy and other
charges in connection to what prosecutors said was a 1983 plot to
bomb two military installations in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Enrique Segarra-Palmer, another of those granted clemency,
but eligible for release in five years, was convicted of planning
the robbery of a Wells Fargo depot in Hartford, Conn., in 1983,
with plans to use the $7.1 million stolen for the militant Puerto
Rican group Los Macheteros.
</P>
<P>
   Nine of the 15 FALN members who were offered clemency lived in
Chicago when they were arrested. Two refused to renounce terrorism
and remain in prison. FALN is an acronym for the Spanish name of
the organization, Armed Forces National Liberation.
</P>
<P>
   In granting clemency, Clinton said the FALN members, who were
serving sentences of up to 90 years, had been given punishments
that were disproportionate to their offenses.
</P>
<P>
   The move has drawn angry criticism, including outrage from some
law enforcement officials. Chicago Police Superintendent Terry
Hillard this week bitterly denounced the release of the prisoners,
saying it made a mockery of the law. ``We say we are not going to
negotiate with terrorists,'' he said. ``Are we going to let the
Unabomber go now?''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of Clinton have accused him of releasing the prisoners
to help his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, win support among Puerto
Rican voters in New York, where she is considering a bid for the
Senate. In the face of criticism from New York Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, who is weighing a bid for the Senate as a Republican,
Mrs. Clinton called on the president to rescind his clemency offer,
a move that infuriated some Hispanic leaders in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still angry,'' said Rep. Jose Serrano, D-N.Y., one of
those who criticized Mrs. Clinton, ``and I've heard nothing to
change my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Groups that had called for the release of the prisoners hailed
the newfound freedom of the FALN members, but nonetheless
criticized the terms of the clemency agreement as too harsh.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, those released cannot associate with one
another. Two of the 11 prisoners released Friday, Alejandrina
Torres and Alberto Rodriguez, have said they plan to live in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a long overdue homecoming,'' said Lin Velazquez, a
spokeswoman for the National Committee to Free Puerto Rican
Political Prisoners, based in Chicago. Despite what she called the
``horrible conditions'' of the clemency agreement, she said that
supporters and family members urged them to accept the terms
because they wanted them home.
</P>
<P>
   One of the prisoners, Juan Segarra Palmer, must serve another
five years in prison before he is granted clemency.
</P>
<P>
   Two prisoners, Oscar Lopez Rivera and Antonio Camacho-Negron,
rejected the clemency. No offer of clemency was made to Carlos
Alberto Torres, who is serving a 70-year sentence.

FORBES SEEKS LOW-INCOME VOTE WITH FLAT-TAX PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Steve Forbes, the multimillionaire Republican
presidential candidate who was viewed by some in 1996 as a champion
of the rich, is preparing a fall campaign strategy that relies on
the unlikeliest of allies: the nation's lowest-income workers.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy, dubbed the ``Heartland plan'' by some campaign
aides, is part of a carefully conceived effort to recast Forbes' 17
percent flat tax as a boon for lower-income people, with a family
of four earning under $36,000 a year paying no taxes. That is a
pool of 20 million potential supporters, Forbes said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, like a marketing maven who tries to revive an old product
with a new jingle, Forbes is tapping his fortune to launch an
advertising campaign that focuses on the way he says lower-income
workers would save thousands of dollars in taxes under his plan.
That is a marked contrast to 1996, when Forbes' plan was portrayed
as the epitome of ``trickle-down economics,'' with the candidate
explaining that the nation's wealthy theoretically could use large
tax cuts to create jobs for lower-income people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to explain the thing, but obviously it did not succeed
the way I had hoped,'' Forbes said in an interview. ``In business
and in marketing you figure out how to get the message across and
figure out what works. I'm going to keep at it till it works. We
will hammer home how it affects real people.''
</P>
<P>
   But some critics said the new strategy is just an attempt to
re-package what they still perceive as a giveaway to the rich.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is basically just crazy,'' said Robert McIntyre of the
labor union-backed Citizens for Tax Justice. ``He is saying that we
can cut the government revenues that pay for all the non-Social
Security programs by half and still run the country. That is just
not plausible. It is in excess of a $400 billion tax cut.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, McIntyre said many lower-income people would actually
pay higher taxes under the plan, a point hotly disputed by Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   The source of the disagreement over the impact of the plan is
that Forbes' program would change many aspects of the way
government collects revenues beyond imposing a flat tax. For
example, McIntyre assumes that Forbes' plan would eliminate the
earned income tax credit, which can be used by lower-income people
to offset federal taxes. But Forbes said the tax plan does not deal
directly with the earned income tax credit, and he declined to say
whether he thinks it should be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be part of a welfare reform plan,'' Forbes said.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes may be optimistic thinking lower-income workers will
flock to support his plan. Under current law, a family of four with
an income of about $28,000 pays no federal income tax as a result
of exemptions and credits, according to the Internal Revenue
Service. McIntyre said the Forbes plan would result in the taxation
of fringe benefits paid by businesses for employees, such as health
insurance and certain Social Security taxes. That could lead to
higher costs passed on to workers.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Mitchell, a senior fellow with the conservative Heritage
Foundation who is one of the nation's leading proponents of the
flat tax, said McIntyre is correct that employers would have to
swallow higher employee costs under the flat tax, as much as $1,000
for benefits for the $36,000-per-year worker supporting a family of
four. While McIntyre believes that cost would be passed on to the
employee, Mitchell said businesses would eat the expense because of
so many other savings under the flat tax. The tax on profits, for
example, would drop to 17 percent from 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell is not allied with any candidate but has spoken
informally on numerous occasions with the Forbes campaign.
</P>
<P>
   As for Forbes, he dismissed questions about whether businesses
would have to face higher costs for employee benefits, saying such
details didn't affect his contention that the flat tax would be
better for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time Forbes has tried to re-package the
flat tax. Previously, Forbes said the flat tax would be optional,
with taxpayers allowed to stay in the current system if they like.
Forbes has also recast his appeal on other fronts: Earlier this
year, for example, Forbes worked to underscore his standing as a
social conservative, hiring former top officials of the Christian
Coalition and taking a strong antiabortion stance.
</P>
<P>
   But Forbes knows the bottom line of his campaign is how the flat
tax is perceived by the public.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' strategy is part of a broader attempt by the magazine
publisher to contrast his own proposal with what he considers a
vague call by Texas Governor George W. Bush call for
``compassionate conservatism.'' Bush, the GOP front-runner, has
said he favors tax cuts but has yet to outline a specific plan or
say whether he would support a flat tax, leaving the field open for
Forbes. Forbes aides are trying to portray their candidate as a
``conservative with meaningful solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no dispute that the flat tax would be a boon for the
wealthiest Americans. Instead of the current top rate of 39.6
percent for federal income taxes, the top rate would be 17 percent,
although the effective rate might be higher due to the elimination
of most deductions.
</P>
<P>
   ``A flat tax is very, very good for Michael Jordan and Bill
Gates,'' Mitchell said, referring to the benefits for wealthy
Americans. But it is also a ``boon for lower-income people,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' new flat tax strategy is previewed in his just-published
book, ``A New Birth of Freedom.'' ``Some critics say it's an attack
on the middle class, but nothing could be further from the truth,''
Forbes wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to eliminating federal income taxes for those
families with an income of less than $36,000 per year _ which
Forbes said would save them as much as $1,600 per year _ Forbes
also wants to eliminate the tax on personal savings, Social
Security benefits, dividends, capital gains and the ``marriage
penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, in the least-publicized aspect of the plan, Forbes
also would impose the flat tax on businesses, with no tax on basic
operating expenses, wages and pensions _ a potential bonanza for
corporate America. All this would cost the Treasury many billions
of dollars in revenue and, according to some analysts, put the
nation back on a budgetary path with red ink.
</P>
<P>
   While Forbes has opened the debate on taxes, all the candidates
are expected to come forth with plans in the coming months. Former
Vice President Dan Quayle already proposed a 30 percent tax cut,
similar to that proposed by Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential
campaign. Elizabeth Dole plans to unveil her tax plan later this
month.
</P>
<P>
   While Mitchell still believes Forbes was right in the 1996
campaign to focus on the trickle-down effect of tax cuts, the
Heritage Institute scholar said he knows it's difficult to explain.
So Mitchell has this advice for a candidate espousing the flat tax:
``Don't focus on economic theory. Focus on getting the IRS out of
people's hair. That resonates with people.''

FORBES SEEKS LOW-INCOME VOTE WITH FLAT-TAX PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Steve Forbes, the multimillionaire Republican
presidential candidate who was viewed by some in 1996 as a champion
of the rich, is preparing a fall campaign strategy that relies on
the unlikeliest of allies: the nation's lowest-income workers.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy, dubbed the ``Heartland plan'' by some campaign
aides, is part of a carefully conceived effort to recast Forbes' 17
percent flat tax as a boon for lower-income people, with a family
of four earning under $36,000 a year paying no taxes. That is a
pool of 20 million potential supporters, Forbes said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, like a marketing maven who tries to revive an old product
with a new jingle, Forbes is tapping his fortune to launch an
advertising campaign that focuses on the way he says lower-income
workers would save thousands of dollars in taxes under his plan.
That is a marked contrast to 1996, when Forbes' plan was portrayed
as the epitome of ``trickle-down economics,'' with the candidate
explaining that the nation's wealthy theoretically could use large
tax cuts to create jobs for lower-income people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to explain the thing, but obviously it did not succeed
the way I had hoped,'' Forbes said in an interview. ``In business
and in marketing you figure out how to get the message across and
figure out what works. I'm going to keep at it till it works. We
will hammer home how it affects real people.''
</P>
<P>
   But some critics said the new strategy is just an attempt to
re-package what they still perceive as a giveaway to the rich.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is basically just crazy,'' said Robert McIntyre of the
labor union-backed Citizens for Tax Justice. ``He is saying that we
can cut the government revenues that pay for all the non-Social
Security programs by half and still run the country. That is just
not plausible. It is in excess of a $400 billion tax cut.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, McIntyre said many lower-income people would actually
pay higher taxes under the plan, a point hotly disputed by Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   The source of the disagreement over the impact of the plan is
that Forbes' program would change many aspects of the way
government collects revenues beyond imposing a flat tax. For
example, McIntyre assumes that Forbes' plan would eliminate the
earned income tax credit, which can be used by lower-income people
to offset federal taxes. But Forbes said the tax plan does not deal
directly with the earned income tax credit, and he declined to say
whether he thinks it should be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be part of a welfare reform plan,'' Forbes said.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes may be optimistic thinking lower-income workers will
flock to support his plan. Under current law, a family of four with
an income of about $28,000 pays no federal income tax as a result
of exemptions and credits, according to the Internal Revenue
Service. McIntyre said the Forbes plan would result in the taxation
of fringe benefits paid by businesses for employees, such as health
insurance and certain Social Security taxes. That could lead to
higher costs passed on to workers.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Mitchell, a senior fellow with the conservative Heritage
Foundation who is one of the nation's leading proponents of the
flat tax, said McIntyre is correct that employers would have to
swallow higher employee costs under the flat tax, as much as $1,000
for benefits for the $36,000-per-year worker supporting a family of
four. While McIntyre believes that cost would be passed on to the
employee, Mitchell said businesses would eat the expense because of
so many other savings under the flat tax. The tax on profits, for
example, would drop to 17 percent from 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell is not allied with any candidate but has spoken
informally on numerous occasions with the Forbes campaign.
</P>
<P>
   As for Forbes, he dismissed questions about whether businesses
would have to face higher costs for employee benefits, saying such
details didn't affect his contention that the flat tax would be
better for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time Forbes has tried to re-package the
flat tax. Previously, Forbes said the flat tax would be optional,
with taxpayers allowed to stay in the current system if they like.
Forbes has also recast his appeal on other fronts: Earlier this
year, for example, Forbes worked to underscore his standing as a
social conservative, hiring former top officials of the Christian
Coalition and taking a strong antiabortion stance.
</P>
<P>
   But Forbes knows the bottom line of his campaign is how the flat
tax is perceived by the public.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' strategy is part of a broader attempt by the magazine
publisher to contrast his own proposal with what he considers a
vague call by Texas Governor George W. Bush call for
``compassionate conservatism.'' Bush, the GOP front-runner, has
said he favors tax cuts but has yet to outline a specific plan or

Forbes. Forbes aides are trying to portray their candidate as a

although the effective rate might be higher due to the elimination

<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ With Elton Truss owing the mothers of his four young
children more than $4,000 in back child support payments, court
officials here prescribed a novel remedy.
</P>
<P>
   They dispatched Truss to write his own obituary _ from the
perspective of the short-changed children he will someday leave
behind.
</P>
<P>
   Writing it was no problem. Reading it aloud was.
</P>
<P>
   A hard-bodied man in a black T-shirt and gold chain, Truss, 32,
stood before a half-dozen similar fathers last week and gulped for
air.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't really involved in our lives,'' Truss stammered,
imagining what his 2-year-old twins might say over his coffin. Then
he added a hopeful, ``but we respect him,'' and wiped his
unexpectedly moist eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reality check, man _ reality check,'' he said of the ordeal.
``Reading it brings it home.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the nation, policy-makers are pondering ways to make
better fathers of down-on-their-luck men. There are tougher new
laws to make them pay child support. There are new job-training
programs to help them atTain skills.
</P>
<P>
   Now, once a week, in a Milwaukee strip mall, a growing program
adds an unusual twist: an obituary-writing session to force the
absent fathers to see themselves through their children's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the men respond as earnestly as Truss. At 22, Quashe
Granville insisted he remains death-proof. And if his funeral ever
does come, Granville said, he imagines an obituary in which his
young daughter joins those who celebrate him for leaving behind ``a
harem of ladies for men to pick over.''
</P>
<P>
   After serving nearly 20 years in prison for attempted murder,
Trent Triplett, 50, had no thoughts of immortality. He imagined a
mixed assessment coming from his daughter: ``His life was full of
bad as well as good.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the men are referred to the program, Children Up Front,
by the courts after falling behind on their child support payments.
But some come on their own, looking for parenting advice, peer
support, legal help or job training. The men write their obituaries
on the fourth day of a week-long course, theoretically after they
have built up enough trust of each other to let down their guard.
Many then go on to a second, 13-week course in becoming better
fathers. The program is run by Goodwill Industries and financed by
federal welfare money.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Wary, earnest, hardened or brash, the men filing into the
classroom here represent welfare policy's next frontier. A landmark
1996 law has succeeded in pushing large numbers of welfare
recipients, mostly single mothers, off the rolls and into low-wage
jobs. But there is little evidence yet that the law is achieving a
second, and perhaps more important, goal spelled out in the law _
bringing fathers back into the lives of poor children.
</P>
<P>
   Operating with a sudden infusion of government and foundation
dollars, a burgeoning industry is being formed to help absent
fathers earn more, pay more, and parent more. Though the programs
differ, the apostles of the movement share a common faith, that the
men care more about their children than the public generally
thinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perception is these guys don't care _ they're `deadbeat
dads,''' said Jerry Hamilton, the director of Children Up Front.
``I don't believe that. I see an average of 500 parents a year.
I've only heard one father say he didn't care about his children.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is caring, and there is acting on the concern. In
their obituaries, the men presented themselves as better at the
former than the latter.
</P>
<P>
   Calvin Robinson, 44, left town in 1983 and saw his children only
three times over the next 15 years. He returned to Milwaukee last
year and was sent to the program after serving four days in jail
for failing to pay a 16-year-old child support bill that has
reached more than $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   A quiet man with sleepy eyes who shares a room at a transient
motel and works as a day laborer, Robinson showed little emotion in
conjuring his funeral.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our father was not around too much in our lives,'' he imagined
his children saying. ``But when he did come back into our lives, he
added the one thing we missed and that was his love.''
</P>
<P>
   The word ``love'' appeared in almost every obituary. And so did
the theme of forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   It ran through the obituary of William Jackson, 37, who has
seven children by six women. He, too, wound up in jail for not
paying child support. He grew so desperate at the state of his
life, he said, he thought of committing suicide. But he recently
found a job, and he now takes care of his 5-year-old son after the
child's mother, a welfare recipient, became homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Williams hopes that his children will look at his mixed record
and offer a gentle judgment: ``In his most recent years, William
realized that the most important thing in his life was his kids.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the new fatherhood programs, Children Up Front is
staffed, in part, by men with backgrounds in common with their
clients. Leondis Fuller, a counselor, brings the heavy heart of a
father who lost his child. His 12-year-old son, Monte, was killed
five years ago in a drive-by shooting. A long-time alcoholic,
Fuller shared three sober years with his son before his death, and
he brings a missionary zeal to the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I carry my son with me every day _ he's my inspiration,'' said
Fuller, who has been sober for nine years and holds a second job as
a Baptist minister. ``The men see if I can do it, they can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes men abandon their children?
</P>
<P>
   The question is hotly debated, of course, and sheer
irresponsibility is often an answer. But inside the classroom, the
men insist they are not as cavalier as they may seem. Sometimes
former girlfriends bar them from seeing their children, especially
if either parent is involved in a new relationship. ``It's a
defense with a lot of women,'' Jackson said. `If you don't want to
be with me, you're not going to see your son.'''
</P>
<P>
   Seeing themselves less as deadbeats than dead broke, many of the
men fault the system for criminalizing their poverty. In Wisconsin,
the failure to make any child support payments for three
consecutive months constitutes a felony, and the most egregious
cases do draw jail time.
</P>
<P>
   To a man, the class rang with support for the state's tough new
welfare laws, arguing that if the men have to work, the women
should, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't just sit back,'' Granville said. ``Now it's, `I got
to get up and get out of the house.' They see the pressure we've
been facing.''
</P>
<P>
   No one imagines that a one-week program can reverse decades of
family decline. When Triplett showed his obituary to his daughter's
mother, she scarcely gave it a thought. ``She said, `Who wrote
this? You ain't dead,''' he said the next day. ``Then she put it
down and went and got a beer.''
</P>
<P>
   But the next week, Truss, a former steel mill worker from
Chicago, was still mulling the exercise. He has a 5-year-old son by
his former wife; 2-year-old twins from a extramarital affair, and
an 18-month-old daughter from an affair after that one. Thinking
about his funeral, what bothered him most was anticipating how
short his children's eulogies would be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized there wasn't very much for them to say about me,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Truss said his shortcomings are all the more difficult to
ponder, since he himself was a fatherless child. ``I never knew
what it was like to love a man the way you love your mother,'' he
said. ``I always said when I had my son, he would know what it was
like to have a father.''
</P>
<P>
   The day after pondering his end, Truss took a modest step toward
a new beginning: He caught a ride to see his son in Chicago and
took his son to the mall.

LIGHT THIS CANDLE

 (For release Sunday, September 12, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank will hold
their annual meetings in Washington later this month.
Representatives of their 184 member nations will throng to parties.
A particularily bitter brew of recriminations will be served,
because of the lenders' disappointments in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Elections are looming, here and in Russia. Ideologues on two
continents are trying to kindle a fire.
</P>
<P>
   Not that there isn't plenty to be learned from the Russian
tragedy. And the next administration surely will try its hand at
reforming these two old internationalist honey-pots, the Fund and
the Bank. But while waiting, why not try something new and very
promising and slightly different?
</P>
<P>
   In the medical, world health and international development
communities, sentiment has been building in recent months for a
Vaccine Purchase Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The world's three worst infectious diseases _ malaria,
tuberculosis and HIV _ kill something like 7 million persons a
year. The overwhelming majority live in the world's poorest
countries. Some 90 percent of malaria cases and 70 percent of new
HIV infections occur in sub-Saharan Africa, according to various
world health authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Opinions differ about the feasiblity of developing successful
vaccines _ opinions always differ on the furure course of science.
All three diseases vary from place to place. They evolve rapidly
and produce myriad variants. Yet advances in immunology and
molecular biology are coming with stunning rapidity. Many
scientists belive that successful vaccines are within reach of a
determined effort.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that there's no money in it. The big
pharmaceutical houses and biotech companies that spend practically
without limit on anti-obesity drugs fear that if they did spend
hundreds of millions of dollars on, say, a succesful malaria
vaccine, that their reward would be either be expropriated by
international agencies or ripped-off by well-meaning pirates
sanctioned by governments.
</P>
<P>
   The solution: establish an international vaccine board, fund it
adequately, and promise that a vaccine that meets specified
standards of efficacy will be purchased in sufficient volume at a
price high enough _ say $10 a dose _ to guarantee a favorable
return to a successful developer.
</P>
<P>
   An especially clear prospectus for such a fund was set out last
summer by a trio of researchers at the Center for International
Development at Harvard University, Professors Jeffrey Sachs and
Michael Kremer and Amar Hamoudi. (You can read it at
www.cid.harvard.edu/malaria.htm). Other proposals have been
circulating for years. Action is in the air.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the plan is being pushed by a trio of advocates who
are considered devils by some portion of the population. They are,
respectively, the richest man in the world, the most compassionate,
and the most powerful.
</P>
<P>
   For example, there is Bill Gates, the business genius who, for a
time, learned how to corner the market for computer operating
systems. The $17.1 billion Gates Foundation, now the second largest
in the world, already has given $100 million for the Gates'
Children's Vaccine Program, $50 million to the Malaria Vaccine
Initiative and another $25 million to the HIV Vaccine Initiative.
These sums are hefty, especially where seed money is concerned, but
they are nowhere near the magnitude of spending required for
successful vaccine development.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Jeffrey Sachs. In 15 years since he was styled the
``Indiana Jones'' of country-doctoring (he advised stabilization
and transition programs in Bolivia, Poland, the former Soviet Union
and Mongolia,) the boyish Sachs has become a tireless advocate for
the poor. He also has contributed greatly to our understanding of
the links between climate and economic development, but Sachs'
populism has won him enemies among the rich and the practical.
``The failure of the United States to pay its UN dues is surely the
world's most significant default on international obligations,'' he
says, ``far more egregious than any defaults by impoverished
(nations).'' Nobody fights harder for the underdog than Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is Bill Clinton. So far the president's
willingness to go to bat for the Vaccine Fund has been limited to
quiet encouragement expressed behind the scenes in meetings. But
functionaries throughout his administration have been working on
legislation that would make the United States a major investor in
an international purchase fund. Yes, this is the same Bill Clinton
who in 1993 excoriated companies that ``profit at the expense of
our children'' by selling vaccines at ``shocking'' prices. But then
what is Clinton's presidency about if not redemption?
</P>
<P>
   It is the system of incentives at the heart of the Vaccine
Purchase Fund that is particularily ingenious. It is largely the
work of Harvard economist Michael Kremer, who makes something of a
specialty of mechanism design where research and development are
the issues. There are two reasons why a commitment to purchase
vaccines is preferable to public funding for the later applied
stages of the development process, he says, or to patent extensions
or cash prizes.
</P>
<P>
   First, by paying for results rather than the process itself, the
government keeps researchers' noses to the grindstone, instead of
indulging their intellectual curiosity and permitting their career
incentives to drive the process. Second, by placing the onus
squarely on pharmaceutical companies themselves to decide which
lines of inquiry to pursue, the government avoids making such
agonizing decisions itself _ and perhaps overpaying by keeping too
many competing scientists at work at the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Nations in the 20th century have had pretty good luck when they
mobilized resources to solve a problem. The Manhattan Project (and
the corresponding Russian and Chinese efforts to build nuclear
weapons) were the original crash programs. They were followed, most
famously, by the race to the moon.
</P>
<P>
   True, the American ``war on cancer'' of the 1970s disappointed
its designers, though the plentiful application of money to
medicine accelerated the genetic revolution. And the rapid
development of an AIDS therapy _ not a vaccine, but a treatment _
shows how much we have learned about what is easy and what is hard.
</P>
<P>
   In a world a rich as this one, whose blessings are as unevenly
distributed, the Vaccine Purchase Fund appears to be just hard
enough to make it worth doing well, without complaint, and soon.

   Testimony in the trial, which was moved to Bryan, Texas, at the
lawyers' request, is scheduled to start Monday.
</P>
<P>
   After qualifying 48 potential jurors over the past couple of
weeks, lawyers on Friday seated 12 jurors and two alternates. The
panel includes seven Anglo men, five Anglo women and two Hispanic
men. They range in age from 29 to 69.
</P>
<P>
   State District Judge Monte Lawlis of Jasper, who is presiding
over the case in Bryan, asked Brazos County court personnel to
personally inform the jurors who had been selected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're happy with the way jury selection went,'' defense
attorney Doug Barlow told The Associated Press, ``and we're looking
forward to trying the case in front of a Brazos County jury.''
</P>
<P>
   Brit Featherston, an assistant U.S. attorney from Lufkin, Texas,
who is serving on the prosecution team with Jasper County District
Attorney Guy James Gray, also said he was satisfied with the jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish we had had a little bit better cross-section of the
community as far as race went, but I'm not concerned,'' Featherston
said. ``I'm very comfortable with the jury we have. I believe these
jurors will follow their oath, do their duty and come up with a
result they think is just. If they do that, it will be a fair
verdict, whichever way it goes.''
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment was echoed by Mary Verrett, a sister of James
Byrd Jr., a 49-year-old divorced father of three who was beaten,
chained to the back of a pickup and dragged to his death on June 7,
1998. Byrd's decapitated, dismembered body was found on a rural
road outside Jasper, next to a black cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing to the Byrd family is that they find 12
impartial jurors who can listen to the evidence and come to a fair
decision,'' said Verrett, of Houston. ``We do not care about the
color of their skin, but the integrity of their hearts. I have
trust in these jurors that they will know what is right and what is
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Blacks make up 11 percent of Brazos County's population, while
19 percent of Jasper County residents are black.
</P>
<P>
   The first defendant in the case, John William ``Bill'' King was
convicted last February by a Jasper County jury of 11 whites and
one black. The jury, which had elected the black juror as foreman,
sent King to death row.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer, a 32-year-old ex-con who met King in prison and belonged
to the same racist inmate gang, would face life in prison or death
by injection if he is convicted in this trial. A third defendant,
Shawn Allen Berry, is to be tried in Jasper this fall.

`HOPE ISLAND' RUNS AGROUND ON SHALLOW ACTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hope Island, the little state park in Skagit Bay, isn't likely
to become the next Roslyn. For one thing, Roslyn, Wash., is where
much of ``Northern Exposure'' was actually filmed, lending it a
certain Hollywood cachet; Hope Island is merely a namesake for a
new series that's filmed in Canada. Second, ``Northern Exposure''
was a finely tuned show about kooky people trying get along in a
rural setting; ``Hope Island,'' premiering Sunday at 9 p.m. on Pax
TV, is pretty much about the same thing, but calling it ``fine''
would be way too charitable.
</P>
<P>
   As another new entry in Pax TV's slate of family-themed
programming, it is undeniably sweet. Sweetness seems to be the
yardstick by which all Pax TV shows are measured. But, just as a
great play can be undone by a bad performance, ``Hope Island'' runs
aground on the shallow acting of an amateurish cast.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the wildly popular British hit ``Ballykissangel,''
``Hope Island'' focuses on a young minister trying to resurrect a
congregation on a rural island not far from Seattle. Cameron Daddo
is effective as the newly minted clergyman, Daniel Cooper, and he
gets sturdy support from Suki Kaiser, who plays tavern owner Alex
Stone. Their friendly/feuding relationship parallels that of Joel
Fleischman and Maggie O'Connell in ``Northern Exposure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hope Island'' falters in the work of its supporting
characters, which was one of the hallmarks of ``Northern
Exposure.'' Duncan Fraser, who plays Brian Brewster, the eccentric
big shot on the island, is an annoyingly shallow copy of Barry
Corbin's Maurice Minnifield. And Nub Flanders (Haig Sutherland),
the island's enigmatic loner, is no Ed Chigliak.
</P>
<P>
   Even more distressing is knowing that ``Hope Island'' has the
same message _ compassion, fellowship, respect for others _ as
``Nothing Sacred,'' an outstanding show that ABC canceled. Pax TV,
which is more about reruns of old shows anyway, would have been
better off buying the rights to ``Nothing Sacred'' reruns. It may
not be as sweet as ``Hope Island,'' but, in the end, it leaves a
much better taste.
</P>
<P>
   Hope Island. Hourlong dramatic series about a minister trying to
rebuild a church and its congregation on a rural island near
Seattle. Starring Cameron Daddo, Suki Kaiser, Haig Sutherland,
David Lewis, Allison Hossack and Duncan Fraser. Season premiere 9
p.m. Sunday on Pax TV.

 &HT;    Bradley confirms opposition to school vouchers in Iowa
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWTON, Iowa _ Shifting course on the controversial subject of
school vouchers, presidential candidate Bill Bradley said Friday
that he would not support using government subsidies for private
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley acknowledged that as a senator from New Jersey he had
voted for pilot voucher programs, and he defended those votes as an
``experimental'' way to help poor, urban school districts in his
home state.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Bradley told a group in Ottumwa that he
would seek legislative changes to allow greater anti-trust
oversight of the hog and cattle industries.
</P>
<P>
   Both positions should appeal to Democratic primary voters,
particularly in Iowa. Vouchers are vigorously opposed by the
teacher's unions, a core constituency of the Democratic Party, and
hog farming is a huge issue in Iowa, the largest pork producing
state in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's comments about school vouchers came at a luncheon and
in response to a question from the wife of a member of the local
school board.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not in support of school vouchers as the answer to the
problems of public education in our country,'' Bradley told Jamie
Swaim. ``There are 6 or 7 million kids in private school. There are
47 million kids in public school. It would be preposterous to say
that the answer for the 47 million kids is to build a separate
school system, particularly since the private schools are at
roughly 85 percent capacity.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked later if, as president, he would sign legislation that
provided for school vouchers, Bradley said he would not. But he
appeared to give himself a little room. He noted that both
Milwaukee and Cleveland have voucher programs in their school
districts. He said he would not endorse voucher legislation ``until
we get the results of these experiments.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said that as a senator he had been opposed to vouchers
for the first 13 of his 18 years in the Senate. But then he grew
concerned about the parents of children in poor school districts
who repeatedly pressed him about the inferior quality of their
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``So after 13 years ... I thought well, no, why don't we try an
experiment,'' Bradley said. None of the bills Bradley voted for
ever became law. Vice President Gore also opposes vouchers, but
Gore never voted for any of the pilot programs while a senator from
Tennessee. Most Republican candidates for president support some
form of vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   On the issue of hog farming, Bradley responded to a question
about the recent merger of Smithfield Farms in Iowa and Murphy
Farms in North Carolina, the two largest pork producers in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said he would transfer anti-trust oversight of such
mergers from the Department of Agriculture to the Justice
Department and put some ``teeth'' into the Packers and Stockyards
Act, which regulates the hog industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very clear to me that ... ownership concentration ... is
making one price for family farms and another price for large hog
producers,'' Bradley said. ``We need to look at that not just in
the United States but also the world so that competition, which we
all believe in, actually produces a better result for consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day at a speech to students at Grinnell College,
Bradley said he would support adding sexual orientation into the
rights covered under the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964. While
opposing same-sex marriages, Bradley said he supported domestic
partnership initiatives aimed at allowing gay and lesbian couples
to have health insurance benefits.

USING BUDGET SURPLUS FOR DEBT REDUCTION BECOMING A POLITICAL
OPTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind., Texas) (rk) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Baron Hill, a moderate Democrat from Indiana,
spent a good part of August walking across his district, talking
with constituents about what to do with the federal budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not surprisingly for a Democrat, he says he heard little
enthusiasm for the $792 billion Republican tax cutting plan, which
President Clinton has pledged to veto. Instead, he heard a
remarkably consistent call for Congress and the administration to
use the surplus for a purpose long supported by economists but seen
as a political yawner by both parties: reducing the $3.6 trillion
national debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people get this,'' Hill said. ``They want the
national debt paid down.''
</P>
<P>
   Having failed to rally strong public pressure in support of
their tax cuts, Republicans as well, now, increasingly see debt
reduction as having far more appeal to voters than they previously
assumed. And that changing political calculation could prove to be
crucial in determining whether the White House and the two parties
in Congress push this year for a big compromise deal on taxes and
spending or leave the issue to be fought out on the campaign trail
next year.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is that if there is partisan gridlock over how to
divide the surplus , it automatically gets channeled into debt
reduction. To the degree that debt reduction is seen as a political
winner, both parties will be more willing to walk away from any
proposed deal on the surplus, and that seems to be what is
happening.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders said over the past few days that they will
consider the issue closed for the year if Clinton vetoes their tax
bill when they send it to him next week.
</P>
<P>
   They left open the possibility of negotiating with the White
House to salvage a tax cut, their most cherished legislative goal.
But they said that locking away most of the surplus for debt
reduction _ and keeping Democrats from spending it _ would be
enough of an accomplishment for them to take home to voters in an
election year, especially since cutting the debt would leave the
nation in better financial condition to deal with looming
shortfalls in the Social Security and Medicare programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the president vetoes the tax bill, we believe that $792
billion ought to go right into that lock box, and once again it
should be used for debt reduction, Social Security and Medicare,
and only those things,'' said Rep. Richard Armey of Texas, the
House majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by a reporter on Thursday if this session of Congress
would be a failure if it did not produce a tax cut, Speaker Dennis
Hastert responded that preserving for debt reduction the biggest
portion of the surplus _ the part generated by excess Social
Security revenues _ would be ``a real step forward in most people's
minds.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also has a case for refusing to budge. Blocking the
Republican tax cut, in the White House's view, would not be about
denying taxpayers their due or about fueling wasteful government
spending, as Republicans assert. It would be about ensuring that
surpluses go primarily to reducing or perhaps even eliminating the
debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an historic opportunity to lift the burden of debt off
the next generation,'' Clinton said in an appearance at the White
House on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Many liberals say that spending on education and health, for
example, yields greater benefits to the nation than debt reduction.
Many conservatives say tax cuts can do more to stimulate economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
   But centrist economic thought holds that debt reduction brings
great benefits by holding down interest rates, freeing capital for
investment in new technologies, factories and jobs and giving the
government greater borrowing power in the future if needed to deal
with a problem like a shortfall in Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been astounded by how positively that message has been
received'' by the public, said Martin N. Baily, the White House's
new chief economist.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show substantial if widely varying backing for tax cuts,
but also support the notion that debt reduction has become a
priority for voters. In a poll by ABC News and the Washington Post
last week, 43 percent of respondents identified shoring up Social
Security as the best use for the surplus, with 24 percent
supporting debt reduction and 20 percent backing tax cuts. Given
that debt reduction and shoring up Social Security are closely
linked, the polls may even understate the support for debt
repayment.
</P>
<P>
   While they have argued all year about whose plan would do more
to reduce the debt, the two parties are not far apart. Both parties
have agreed that the portion of the surplus generated by excess
Social Security revenues _ about $2 trillion over the next decade _
should be used only for debt reduction (although some Republicans
would use a portion of it to allow individuals to invest some of
their Social Security money in the stock market).
</P>
<P>
   The battle has been over the remaining $1 trillion in projected
surpluses, the portion that comes from general tax revenues. The
Republicans would use that money for their tax cut, saying they
could find additional money for debt reduction by cutting spending
further. The White House wants to divide it among spending programs
and a complicated plan under which the interest savings from
additional debt reduction would go to help Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Whether either approach is credible remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Even without a tax cut, Congress is on track to spend next
year's non-Social Security surplus of about $14 billion, and
Republicans are resorting to every gimmick they can think of to
avoid dipping into the $147 billion projected Social Security
surplus, money that would otherwise go to debt reduction. Democrats
and the White House have also pledged to keep their hands off the
Social Security surplus next year, but are having as much trouble
as the Republicans in making the numbers in their proposals add up.

MINORITY-OWNED BOSTON BANK BUYS STRUGGLING MIAMI BANK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Boston Bank of Commerce, the city's only black-owned
banking company, acquired a black-owned bank in Miami Friday after
it was shut down by federal regulators due to financial problems.
</P>
<P>
   Peoples National Bank of Commerce will reopen on Monday morning
as a unit of Boston Bank of Commerce and will be renamed Peoples
Bank of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Bank of Commerce, in announcing the acquisition of
Peoples National, said the deal would make it ``America's first
interstate African-American owned bank.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston Bank of Commerce's chairman, Kevin Cohee, speaking in a
telephone interview from Peoples' main office in the Liberty City
neighborhood of Miami, said, ``What this is about is strengthening
the African-American communities across the country, to make sure
these communities can be viable and strong financial institutions
to meet their needs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Florida bank is the first acquisition of a financial
institution by Boston Bank of Commerce. But Cohee has in recent
months been rumored to be pursuing deals on various fronts in an
aggressive bid to expand his company's reach into new markets
outside of New England.
</P>
<P>
   Cohee has also made overtures to Carver Federal Savings Bank in
New York, the nation's biggest black-owned bank.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Bank of Commerce is also trying to beef up operations
closer to home. The company was still a frontrunner Friday among
community banks negotiating with Fleet Financial Group Inc. to buy
some local branches being spun off as part of a merger with
BankBoston Corp., banking sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohee said Fleet talks are also ``going great,'' though nothing
has been finalized.
</P>
<P>
   Federal banking regulators, after closing Peoples National's
doors Friday evening, turned over operation of the bank to Boston
Bank of Commerce. Explaining reasons for the closing, the US Office
of the Comptroller of the Currency said in a statement that Peoples
National was ``critically undercapitalized and in a very weak
condition'' after ``several years of heavy losses.''
</P>
<P>
   The Comptroller said it would transfer all of Peoples National's
assets, deposits and customer accounts to Boston Bank of Commerce.
All customers will automatically become customers of Boston Bank of
Commerce under the agreement with regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Cohee said Boston Bank of Commerce will use its capital to shore
up Peoples Natoinal. He said the acquisition of the financially
troubled bank was good for Boston Bank of Commerce, because it was
purchased at a ``very, very good price.''
</P>
<P>
   He could not disclose details of the transaction, which was
still being finalized.
</P>
<P>
   By buying Peoples National, Boston Bank of Commerce in one sweep
has expanded its asset base by $37.6 million, to nearly $150
million, and its geographic reach to southeastern tip of the East
Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Cohee said an undisclosed amount of fresh capital would be
injected into Peoples National. Federal regulators cited a number
of reasons for the Miami bank's difficulties in a statement,
including an ill-fated acquisition of Jefferson Bank of Broward
County, Fla., that it was ``ill equipped to handle.''
</P>
<P>
   Peoples National ``suffered from poor lending practices,
improper record keeping and accounting, and ineffective board and
management supervision, the comptroller's statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohee touted the deal as being good for both cities, Boston and
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement makes Boston Bank of Commerce, which earned
$704,000 in profits last year, a bigger, healthier financial
institution.
</P>
<P>
   And it preserves a black-owned financial institution in Miami
``would've disappeared,'' Cohee said. ``Instead of it
disappearing,'' he said, ``now the communities of Florida have a
$150 million bank that's capitalized and growing.''

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Ahead of schedule and with little fanfare, Israel
completed its first set of obligations under the new peace deal
Friday, transferring civilian control of a chunk of West Bank to
the Palestinians a day after it released about 200 prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the event of the day was a signing of the maps by
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. After meeting with Israeli
officials in Gaza City on Friday morning, Arafat agreed to Israel's
assignment of land _ an additional 7 percent of the West Bank,
about 160 square miles.
</P>
<P>
   There was no withdrawal of Israeli troops Friday because there
are no Israeli army bases in the area, which is hilly and sparsely
populated. In fact, there was little if any action on the ground to
mark the moment. Many Palestinian officials seemed unsure even
where exactly the new land is located.
</P>
<P>
   It apparently cuts across the West Bank. It touches and in some
cases connects areas that belong to almost all the existing
Palestinian local governments, from Nablus and Tuklarm south to
Ramallah and Bethlehem, according to Palestinian officials.
</P>
<P>
   The actual change-over of civilian authorities will take place
Monday, when Israeli and Palestinian officials will jointly tour
the land.
</P>
<P>
   Most important to the Palestinian residents, who had chronic
conflicts with the Israelis over land ownership, the Palestinian
Authority will take over the land registries and the issuing of
building permits. It will also assume control of the antiquities,
archeological sites and tourism in the new land.
</P>
<P>
   Israel will continue to run the security operations to protect
the Jewish settlers in the area and fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leaders seemed heartened by Israel's quick
compliance with its obligations under the agreement, which was
signed last weekend. The new plan revives a 1998 agreement that was
frozen by the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who
was later defeated by the new prime minister, Ehud Barak, in May.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``There was no movement at all until this new government came
and expressed its commitment to resolving all the unresolved
issues,'' said Jamil Tarifi, the Palestinian minister of civil
affairs, in an interview. ``Yesterday and today we have had
positive signs, and we are starting to restore confidence in this
process on both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   As Israelis prepared for the Jewish New Year, which started
Friday night, they paid little attention to the turnover of land
that many fought so hard to hold on to. It received only brief
mention in Friday morning's newspapers and on the day's radio
shows, and there were no significant protests.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat called Barak to wish him a happy New Year.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday their representatives _ Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy and Mahmoud Abbas, Arafat's most senior adviser _ will sit
down to the first session of the ``final status'' talks, which aim
to establish a permanent peace between Israel and the Palestinians
by next September, an ambitious goal.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new deal, a framework agreement, providing an overview
of thorny issues like the status of Jerusalem and the right of
return of refugees, is to be sketched out by February.
</P>
<P>
   Many Israeli political experts have expressed skepticism that
such deeply emotional issues can be resolved so quickly. But
Friday, on Israeli army radio, Barak defended his goal. ``Whoever
can't make a framework agreement in five months won't be able to
forge a full, permanent accord even in five years,'' he said.

 &HT;    Big tax has chilling effect on Georgia insurers
 &HT;    By Peter Mantius
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia's hefty insurance premium tax has been a gold
mine for the state and local governments, but critics say the tax
has spoiled the state's opportunity to develop into a national
insurance hub.
</P>
<P>
   The state collected $211 million from the tax in fiscal year
1998, while local governments took in $232 million.
</P>
<P>
   But because Georgia taxes insurers at more than twice the
national average, other states routinely penalize Georgia-based
insurers by imposing a retaliatory tax on them.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say that retaliatory tax penalty has discouraged big
insurers from moving their headquarters here and has driven several
Georgia-based insurers out of the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``No insurance company in its right mind that has a national
base would ever move here,'' said Martin Grace, a public policy
professor at Georgia State University.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at Atlanta, it is a regional center with the
airport and telecommunications. But it's missing finance. The
region's major banks are in North Carolina, and there's no big
insurance industry in Atlanta or Georgia,'' Grace said.
</P>
<P>
   State Insurance Commissioner John Oxendine, who called the
premium tax ``stupid,'' hopes to get it repealed, or at least
reduced, so Georgia can compete with lower-taxation states.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Jacksonville, Fla., every single tall building has an
insurance company name on it,'' Oxendine said. ``It's become a
mecca for insurance companies, and they've brought in jobs. That
could have been Savannah or Macon or Columbus.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's premium tax is particularly hard on property/casualty
insurers, which cover auto, homeowner and other property and
liability risks. They pay up to 4.75 percent of their premiums in
taxes, compared with the national average of slightly more than 2
percent. Life and health insurers in Georgia are taxed on a
different scale and average paying about 2 percent of premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Insurers pass the cost of the tax on to policyholders, who
generally don't realize they're being taxed.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia collects its premium tax from all insurers _ whether
based in Georgia or elsewhere _ on all policies sold in the state.
Other states collect the high Georgia rate only from Georgia-based
companies while collecting lower rates from non-Georgia companies.
</P>
<P>
   Those retaliatory taxes put Georgia companies at a severe
competitive disadvantage in other states, such as Florida, which
taxes insurance premiums at 1.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Oxendine said his top legislative priority in the 2000 General
Assembly is to cut the premium tax back to the national average. He
wants to do it by eliminating the portion of the tax that goes to
the state _ 2.25 percent. Cutting the tax revenue to local
governments would be more difficult politically, he said, because
of the lobbying power of groups like the Georgia Municipal
Association and the Association County Commissioners of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Oxendine said the state might recoup most or all of that by
collecting new retaliatory taxes of its own from out-of-state
insurers once the Georgia rate is lowered below that of other
states.
</P>
<P>
   Even without local government opposition, Oxendine may have
trouble building legislative support because his tax cut would trim
state revenues by more than $200 million a year. Gov. Roy Barnes
doesn't plan to support Oxendine's initiative.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. David Lucas (D-Macon) headed a legislative study
committee last year to consider ways to cut the premium tax, but it
folded after failing to overcome the problem of replacing the lost
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speaker (Rep. Tom Murphy) gave me latitude to see if there
was any way to do it,'' Lucas said. ``But I think we are stuck with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ben Harbin (R-Martinez), author of the bill Oxendine
supports to eliminate the state portion of the premium tax, said
the time is right to cut the tax because both the economy and state
finances are strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've just got to make that movement,'' Harbin said. ``With
our air quality, we need clean industry. With insurance, there are
no smokestacks, and the pay is good.''
</P>
<P>
   Randy Cardoza, commissioner of the state Department of Industry,
Trade and Tourism, whose mission is to recruit business to the
state, said the insurance industry isn't his agency's highest
priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our focus has been on high-tech, telecom, aerospace,'' Cardoza
said. ``The insurance industry has a different twist to it. These
premium tax rates are very key.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get that changed would take a good bit of political energy
and capital,'' Cardoza said. ``It is not a primary focus of Gov.
Barnes or his administration. It wasn't in Gov. (Zell) Miller's
administration either.''
</P>
<P>
   Grace at Georgia State said the premium tax is having roughly
the same effect on the insurance industry as Georgia's old
protectionist branch banking laws had on the state's banking
industry.
</P>
<P>
   For many years, branching laws that favored community banks
prevented Georgia's big banks from growing as fast as the big banks
in North Carolina, which had much more liberal branching rules. So
when interstate bank mergers were first allowed in the 1980s, five
of Georgia's six largest banks were swallowed up by out-of-state
banks, four by banks headquartered in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the insurance premium tax rate in North Carolina is
less than half the Georgia rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they have three to four times as many domestic insurers as
Georgia,'' Oxendine said of North Carolina. ``That should worry
us.''

CALIFORNIA KEEPS THE SLOTS SPINNING
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Nev.)  (jw) 
 By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Gov. Gray Davis and more than 50 California Indian
tribes agreed Friday to binding compacts intended to keep slot
machines operating at Indian casinos around the state.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Legislature voted to put a referendum on the
ballot in March to exempt tribes from the state constitution's ban
on casino gambling, paving the way for substantial expansion of
gambling in the West.
</P>
<P>
   The agreements, reached after an overnight scramble at the end
of the annual legislative session in Sacramento, were aimed at
averting a threatened federal shutdown of tribal slot machines in
the wake of a state Supreme Court ruling last month. That ruling
overturned an earlier ballot measure that would have expanded the
$1.4 billion annual industry.
</P>
<P>
   The constitutional amendment would have to be approved by voters
before the tribes would have the right to offer slot-machines and
blackjack card games, and they still would not be allowed to offer
roulette or crap games.
</P>
<P>
   But if the constitutional amendment is approved, the number of
slot machines at Indian casinos around the state could more than
double, to 43,000, and so could jobs in an industry that already
employs about 16,000 people statewide in a no-frills, close-to-home
alternative to the grander temptations of Las Vegas. A separate
agreement giving casino employees the right to organize a union
must be endorsed by each tribe by Oct. 13, or the 20-year compacts
will be nullified.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those tribes that adopt it, this compact offers security
and economic promise,'' said Davis, a Democrat who received more
than $750,000 in Indian contributions during his successful
gubernatorial campaign last year.
</P>
<P>
   He had vowed to help the tribes find a way to preserve their
gambling after the court decision last month, but was also under
pressure from allies in organized labor to assure rights to
collective bargaining.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Tucker, vice chairman of the Sycuan Band of Mission
Indians and a spokesman for the California Indian Gaming Nations
Association, said the compacts and the proposed constitutional
amendment would ``finally allow California Indian tribes to achieve
the self-reliance that we have long been seeking.''
</P>
<P>
   Indian gambling has been hotly disputed in California for much
of the last decade, as impoverished tribes expanded from
traditional bingo games into more lucrative slot machines and card
games.
</P>
<P>
   But under federal law, tribes are not allowed to offer such
gambling without first signing compacts with the state, and former
Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican and a staunch opponent of gambling,
refused to negotiate a compact with any tribe that already had slot
machines, though he did reach limited compacts with a handful of
tribes.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to get around Wilson, about 40 other tribes
sponsored a ballot measure, Proposition 5, that essentially
required the state to sign a gambling compact with any tribe that
wanted one.
</P>
<P>
   That measure passed with 63 percent of the vote after a $100
million spending campaign that pitted the tribes against Nevada
casino interests wary of competition.
</P>
<P>
   But the Supreme Court ruled last month that the statute violated
the state constitution's longstanding ban on Nevada-style casinos,
rejecting the tribes' arguments that their machines and card games
operated more like a lottery than a traditional casino bank. As a
result, federal prosecutors, who had previously won court orders
against about 10 casinos, threatened to seize their machines by
mid-October unless tribes reached compacts with the state.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors had said that if the tribes signed compacts as a
show of good faith, they would hold off any further action until a
constitutional amendment could be considered by the voters. Thom
Mrozek, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's office in Los Angeles,
said today that it would have no immediate comment.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   At least 58 tribes agreed to sign the new compacts. But Richard
Milanovich, chairman of the Agua Caliente band of Indians in Palm
Springs, whose 1,150 video slot machines are among those federal
officials have threatened to seize, said his tribe was leaning
against signing the measure and would seek a vote of the whole
tribe next week.
</P>
<P>
   Among his objections was that the tribe would have to contribute
some of its gambling profits to a state fund that would then be
distributed to tribes that choose not to have gambling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have difficulty with that because it sets artificial limits
on the economic viability of those machines and it creates another
state bureaucracy that handles money for tribes,'' said Milanovich,
whose tribe's casino is one of the state's biggest. He said that
ceding such authority to the state could violate Indian
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Under the compacts, tribes without slot machines would have the
first chance to draw from a pool of new machines and would be
allocated 350 machines each. Tribes that already offer gambling
could increase their number of machines by acquiring unused
allocations from other tribes.
</P>
<P>
   There is a cap of 2,000 machines per tribe. A percentage of
gambling revenues will also be turned over to the state to be used
for programs to treat gambling addiction and to finance local needs
like roads generated by gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Under the compacts Wilson, the former governor, had reached with
a handful of tribes, they were limited to no more than 990 machines
each. Those agreements were superseded by the new compacts
announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Indian gambling interests have become a major political force in
the state and this week, Common Cause announced that for the first
time three tribes had earned places on the group's list of the 10
biggest donors to state legislators over the past two years.
Together, the three tribes gave more than $3.6 million to
legislative campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Other businesses in the state, including race tracks and card
clubs, have pressed for expanded gambling rights to match
privileges given to the tribes, and bills to allow such expansion
moved through the Legislature this week.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Davis, Michael Bustamante, said that Davis would
not support any such efforts this year and had no intention of
``allowing a major expansion of gambling in the state, period.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the governor was ``still very optimistic'' that the
handful of the state's tribes yet to sign the agreement would do so
before the deadline next month.
</P>
<P>
   But Cheryl Schmit, co-chairman of Stand Up for California, a
statewide group opposed to gambling expansion, said, ``This was not
a moderate expansion of gambling, this was a huge expansion.``
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature's decision to place a constitutional amendment
on the ballot in March eliminates the need for a costly
petition-gathering effort that the Indians were preparing, but both
sides predicted there could yet be a costly replay of last year's
battle over Proposition 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the campaign is going to be very heated,'' said Penny
LeDoux, one of the plaintiffs who sued to overturn Proposition 5 as
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're disappointed in the compact. It just allows for huge
expansion of gambling and has no requirements for involvement or
approval by local communities that are affected.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schmit added: ``This is an unending saga. We're bitterly
disappointed with the compacts that the governor signed. There is
money given from tribes to the state to help local communities, but
now we'll have to go lobby our legislators to persuade them to help
individual communities. That doesn't seem very fair.''

 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS , Calif. _ Stephen F. Bollenbach, president of the
Hilton Hotels Corp., likes to make playful $1 bets with his company
executives about the price of Hilton's stock. He stuffs the dollar
bills representing those wagers into the frame of a picture _ of
him and Barron Hilton, the company chairman _ hanging on the wall
behind his desk.
</P>
<P>
   Recently that stock has been a poor bet, even with the
announcement by Hilton last week that it would pay $3.1 billion in
cash and stock to acquire the Promus Hotel Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Bollenbach has found it hard to live up the gargantuan
expectations Wall Street had for him. From the moment he joined the
company three and a half years ago, bringing a reputation as a
master deal maker, investors have been disappointed that he has not
done a big acquisition. Now that he has, many investors are
wondering whether Bollenbach was desperate and paid too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the time he walked in the door as CEO, there were great
expectations that his Mark McGwire-like reputation would be
extended to Hilton,'' said John Rohs, an analyst at Schroder &AMP; Co.
``The stock clearly reflects the fact that he hasn't hit the home
run, but it's not for lack of trying.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bollenbach, at 57, is frustrated, he didn't show it in an
interview at his office last week. Nor did he express any sense of
relief at finally having made a big acquisition. Like Mark McGwire,
Bollenbach says he is not out to hit home runs, just to win ball
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``My approach isn't trying to measure success by the number of
transactions,'' Bollenbach said. ``It's kind of a lousy measure.
The shareholders are interested in value for the company.''
</P>
<P>
   But creating that value, as measured by stock price, has been
difficult. Hilton's stock, which fell slightly after the deal with
Promus was announced, closed on Friday at $10.8125, down more than
$6 so far this year. An investor who owned a share of Hilton worth
about $20 when Bollenbach took over, would now own a share of
Hilton and Park Place Entertainment, the gambling company spun off
at the beginning of this year, together worth only about $22.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, most hotel stocks have been falling because of
fears about softness in the business. And rather than rushing into
the Promus deal, in fact, Bollenbach passed on it more than a year
ago because the price was even higher then.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts agree that the deal should help Hilton
strategically in the long run. The agreement will give Hilton
several new brands, including Doubletree Hotels, Embassy Suites and
Hampton Inns, and move it into segments of the market beyond luxury
business hotels. And it will make Hilton one of the Big Three of
the hotel business along with Marriott and Starwood Hotels and
Resorts Worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the other companies are going to be marginalized,''
Bollenbach said, referring to those outside the Big Three. ``To me,
it's like being a soft-drink seller when you're not Coke or not
Pepsi. How do you deal with it?''
</P>
<P>
   If Bollenbach did not purposely market himself as a deal maker,
his history spoke for him. In the last 10 years, Bollenbach, mainly
working as a chief financial officer at various companies, has
rapidly engineered big deals and moved on _ often taking loyal
aides with him. He helped rescue Donald Trump from financial
difficulties. He helped break the old Marriott into two companies.
As chief financial officer of the Walt Disney Co. in 1995, he
engineered the acquisition of ABC.
</P>
<P>
   So when Bollenbach came to Hilton in February 1996, the stock
climbed more than 20 percent in two days. Within months, Hilton
agreed to pay $2 billion to buy Bally Entertainment, to make Hilton
the largest gambling company.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he engineered the spinoff of Park Place
Entertainment, of which he is chairman. One rationale was that the
gambling business, with its low valuation, was weighing down the
hotel company's stock. But in the last couple of weeks, Park
Place's share price rose past Hilton's, causing Bollenbach to lose
a dollar in a bet with Park Place president Arthur Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But in 1997, Hilton lost out to Starwood in a protracted battle
to buy the ITT Corp., owner of the Sheraton hotels and Caesars
casinos. Hilton also had talks in the past about buying Circus
Circus, the casino company now known as Mandalay Resort Group, and
some of the hotels of Patriot American Hospitality, now known as
Wyndham International.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another possible deal explored from time to time has been a
merger with Hilton Group PLC, the British company once known as
Ladbroke that controls the Hilton name overseas.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies have become so closely aligned, sharing
reservations systems and sales forces, that if they eventually
merge, as seems likely, Bollenbach said, ``it'll be a non-issue.''
</P>
<P>
   And the unsuccessful ITT bid, which was widely portrayed as the
biggest failure of Bollenbach's career, doesn't look so bad in
retrospect. Park Place managed to buy Caesars from Starwood this
year at a price lower than what Hilton would have effectively paid
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doing an acquisition is the easiest thing in the world,''
Bollenbach said. ``The hard thing is making sure you don't overpay
and the second hard thing is managing what you bought.''
</P>
<P>
   It is that second challenge _ integrating Promus _ that will
occupy him for the near future.
</P>
<P>
   The word in the industry on Bollenbach is that he is not a true
hotelier like Bill Marriott, who is said to walk into his company's
properties to check if the beds are being made correctly. Asked if
he ever stayed in a Hilton hotel incognito to check out the
service, Bollenbach replied: ``What do you think, I'm nuts? Of
course not.''
</P>
<P>
   He goes in style, escorted by the hotel manager. Much of the
actual hotel operations are left to the executive vice president,
Dieter H. Huckestein.
</P>
<P>
   But Bollenbach is involved in the company's advertising
strategy, its fledgling Internet operations and in major hotel
renovations. And while he doesn't check the temperature of the
soup, he said, ``I promise you that's not what made Marriott get
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   What did, he said, was getting other people to spend $20 billion
to build hotels that Marriott can manage _ an operation in which
Bollenbach had a hand during previous stints at Marriott.
</P>
<P>
   Bollenbach, the son of a milkman, grew up in Southern California
and got his start in business working for Daniel K. Ludwig, the
industrialist who was once one of the richest men in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Bollenbach's work for a string of hotel companies helped prepare
him to work for Barron Hilton, the hotel company's chairman and
biggest stockholder and the son of the company founder, Conrad
Hilton.
</P>
<P>
   Hilton, 71, is now little involved in the company, spending his
time flying gliders and helicopters on his Nevada ranch and taking
fishing trips to Alaska. Bollenbach's pleasures consist largely of
travel _ tacking side trips with his wife, Barbara, onto his
business trips around the world. They have two grown sons.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his job-hopping, Bollenbach has said Hilton will be his
last job. Since his deal-making has yet failed to excite investors,
Bollenbach's effectiveness in transforming Hilton will be judged
only over time.

   NEW YORK _ Corporate profits are surging this year, to the
delight of those who thought a slowdown might crimp results at
United States companies. Earnings at S&AMP;P 500 companies rose 10.5
percent in the first quarter, 14.7 percent in the second.
</P>
<P>
   All the more remarkable, then, that corporate tax receipts are
down this year from last. Through July, according to the Treasury,
corporations paid $140.7 billion, 6.4 percent less than in the
corresponding period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, companies are reporting lower earnings to the
government than they are to their shareholders. Nothing new there.
After all, tax accounting methods differ from those used to compile
shareholder reports.
</P>
<P>
   But the downturn in tax receipts is new. Corporate tax receipts
have not dropped since 1983, and that was when the United States
was shaking off a crippling recession. And the decline comes at a
time when individual tax receipts are running 6.7 percent ahead of
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Forget, for a moment, what the drop might say about how inflated
the earnings reported to shareholders have come to be. What's
behind the decline?
</P>
<P>
   Corporate tax shelters are an explanation offered by Christopher
E. Bergin, editor of the magazine Tax Notes, which published an
article about falling tax receipts in late July. ``Increasingly,
U.S. corporations are looking at their tax departments as profit
centers,'' he said. Once, tax staffers were ridiculed as numbers
nerds; now they are revered.
</P>
<P>
   Martin A. Sullivan, the economist who wrote the Tax Notes
article, said that if the decline in taxes continues through the
rest of fiscal 1999, which ends in September, overall taxes paid by
American companies as a percentage of their profits would be about
19.9 percent, the lowest rate since 1984. Five years ago,
corporations paid 24.6 percent of profits in taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The trend may indicate ``that corporate tax receipts are being
adversely affected by corporate tax shelters,'' Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   What sorts of shelters? Only the financial engineers know for
sure. But Robert Willens, managing director at Lehman Brothers,
said corporations could legitimately reduce their tax bills by
structuring asset sales as tax-free exchanges and using
government-bestowed tax credits, like the one benefiting companies
with heavy research and development costs. And, the more income a
company generates overseas and leaves there, the lower its tax
bill.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the biggest contributors to the falloff in tax
receipts may be stock options.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why: Under shareholder accounting, stock options are not
considered an employee compensation expense, even though they
clearly are. So companies that use them _ and rare is the publicly
traded company that doesn't _ effectively overstate their earnings.
</P>
<P>
   But for tax accounting purposes, when an employee exercises an
option, the difference between that option's strike price and the
prevailing market value of the underlying stock is an expense to
the company that issued the option.
</P>
<P>
   So the widespread use of options not only hypes corporate
earnings, it cuts companies' tax bills and Treasury receipts. What
a combination. &QL;

LONGSTANDING ISSUE

essentially two stories, each of which can stand independently. The
first 8 grafs are a spot report on Annan's remarks on Friday. The
rest of the piece, about 800 words, is a backgrounder on what U.N.

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Friday that
if Indonesia does not accept immediate international military
assistance to restore order in East Timor, the Indonesian
leadership may be judged guilty of crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the eyes of the world, the people of East Timor are
being terrorized and massacred because they exercised their right
of self-determination,'' he said at a news conference. Later, in an
interview, Annan said that he was surprised at the weakness of the
initial response by the United States and other nations when the
violence erupted last weekend, after the results of a referendum in
which the East Timorese voted decisively for independence were
announced. He said he welcomes the pressure that has finally begun
to mount against Indonesia in recent days. ``I wish the pressure
had come sooner,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At his news conference, Annan said that a force led by
Australia, with troops from New Zealand, the Philippines and
Malaysia, was ready to deploy to East Timor, where the capital city
of Dili is on fire and hundreds of thousands of people have been
driven from their homes over the last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I urge the Indonesian government to accept their help without
further delay,'' Annan said. ``If it refuses to do so, it cannot
escape responsibility for what could amount, according to reports
reaching us, to crimes against humanity. In any event, those
responsible for these crimes must be called into account.''
</P>
<P>
   The secretary-general said he had been stung by ``thousands of
messages'' reaching his office accusing the United Nations of
abandoning the East Timorese.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me assure you most emphatically that this is not the
case,'' he said. About 100 U.N. staff members remain in Dili after
a partial evacuation today, and Annan said he is concerned about
their safety.
</P>
<P>
   He rejected accusations that the United Nations shared
responsibility for the turmoil that continues to rage despite daily
assurances from President B.J. Habibie and his military chief,
General Wiranto, that East Timor is under their control.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation has clearly gone beyond what a small mission,
which was sent to organize the popular vote and never equipped or
mandated to enforce law and order, can possibly be expected to cope
with,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Long before the planes took off from Dili on Friday evacuating
U.N. workers, the post-mortems over what went wrong in East Timor
had begun at U.N. headquarters in New York. There is no shortage of
accusations about who is to blame for the catastrophe that followed
the independence vote.
</P>
<P>
   But there seem to be two points of agreement: that for the first
time in a quarter-century, the world has a chance to settle the
question of East Timor's future _ and that it was worth the gamble
to try.
</P>
<P>
   ``People saw this as a very small window of opportunity,'' said
a Western diplomat, referring to the months that followed the fall
of President Suharto a year ago in May. By August 1998, Indonesia
and Portugal, the former colonial power in East Timor, had agreed
to a plan for a vote in the territory, which the United Nations has
never recognized as part of Indonesia. The final agreement on that
referendum was signed on May 5 of this year.
</P>
<P>
   By that point, U.N. officials said, the Portuguese _ who in 1974
deserted the poor territory they had never developed and had used
in part as a penal colony _ were so eager to see movement on the
East Timor issue that they were willing to sign a pact that experts
thought had significant flaws. The officials also say that even
earlier, in 1997, when Annan took office, Portugal lobbied him to
get involved in East Timor. Annan got the negotiating process going
the same year.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations caused some dissension within the U.N.
Secretariat, where, a diplomat said, the experts of the
peacekeeping department were often sidelined by Annan's political
team, led on a day-to-day basis by Francesc Vendrell, a Spaniard
with long experience in Southeast Asia, and Jamsheed Marker, a
retired Pakistani diplomat who served as a special envoy for the
talks.
</P>
<P>
   Peacekeeping experts are among the most bitter now, saying that
when they saw the agreement days before it was signed, they knew
there were serious flaws, given the history of the issue and the
strong interests of the Indonesian army, which had treated East
Timor as virtually a private domain since seizing it in 1975.
Portugal was far too willing, these officials say, to take
Indonesia's word that violence would not be permitted.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Monteiro, Portugal's representative at the United
Nations, dismisses these accusations as a typical response by
officials ``trying to save the face of the United Nations.'' He
said that Annan had concluded a secret side memorandum
strengthening security guarantees that laid out very specifically
what was expected of Indonesia. That memorandum, Monteiro said,
also had the approval of the Timorese independence leader, Jose
Alexandre Gusmao, known to Timorese as Xanana.
</P>
<P>
   Monteiro said that since Indonesia had in effect subsequently
broken its promises, the Security Council should now be free to
act. If East Timor is allowed to be destroyed, he said, the United
Nations is in trouble everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you believe that anyone else in this world from now on will
ever believe that the United Nations is capable of keeping an
agreement respected if this happens to East Timor?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis erupted because no concrete plans had been made by
U.N. officials for safeguarding the East Timorese in a predictably
dangerous period after the vote but before a new Indonesian
Parliament could ratify its results and formally cede power to the
East Timorese. Indonesia had agreed that peacekeeping troops could
be sent then, no earlier, and until now no government has been
willing to breech that pact.
</P>
<P>
   But, warned repeatedly by political as well as peacekeeping
experts, U.N. officials and diplomats did work on hypothetical
worst-case scenarios and what to do about them but never wrote
anything down for fear of leaks that would alert Indonesia, a
diplomat said. Only now are concrete plans taking shape for an
international force.
</P>
<P>
   In Jakarta on Friday, Jeremy Greenstock, Britain's
representative at the United Nations and one of five envoys on a
mission to meet high-level officials in Indonesia, was asked in an
interview with CNN International whether the United Nations had not
been naive in assuming that the road to East Timorese independence
would be smooth if that's what the people wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, not at all,'' he said. ``I think the holding of the
ballot, the organizing of the consultation was a huge success. And
that part of it was carried out against a very difficult
background. It was done courageously and ably. What has happened is
that under the agreement trust was placed in the government of
Indonesia to carry out its part of the bargain and be responsible
for the security situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the U.N. could have done anything about it,'' he
said. ``It wasn't the U.N.'s job. It was Indonesia's job.''

<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ It's the eve of the New England Patriots'
first game of the season, and NFL fans here are looking forward to
it with all the bluff good sportsmanship of a girl who has been
stood up on prom night.
</P>
<P>
   In April, when owner Robert Kraft canceled a stadium deal that
would have brought the team to Hartford, the giddy prospect of a
Patriots stadium _ the one thing that could have improved
Hartford's mood after the 1997 departure of their NHL franchise,
the Whalers _ dissolved into yet another operatic betrayal. The six
months that have elapsed since Kraft pulled out have not been long
enough to secure the city's forgiveness; discuss the Patriots'
coming season with local sports fans and you are still likely to
encounter sarcasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be interesting to see what the Pats do to market their
team this year in the state of Connecticut,'' said Robert Plante,
program director at Hartford's all-sports ESPN Radio 1410, with a
small, bitter smile. ``I haven't seen a whole lot of bumper
stickers. In fact, it'll probably be a while before any Patriots
fans come out and support them openly, for fear of being beaten up
or mugged or something.''
</P>
<P>
   From the shuttered Connecticut Sports Museum and Hall of Fame _
which, stripped of its teams, is hyping a display of handmade
fishing flies _ to the ribbon-festooned football still hovering
atop Plante's office building, Hartford is full of reminders of the
spring's great disillusionment.
</P>
<P>
   During the pre-season at Coach's, a downtown sports bar with 37
flickering televisions, Tom Parker noticed a curious upwelling of
interest in the Minnesota Vikings. Above the bar at the Arch Street
Tavern, someone has taped over the logo on a massive Patriots
helmet and scribbled the name of those suddenly appealing rivals to
the south, the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   And every morning Plante has to face that enormous football,
which his station erected to welcome the Patriots, but which now
represents the station's support of football in general. No one
knows quite what to do with the billboard, but Plante muses they
may eventually ``cut the ends off and turn it into a basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the circumstances, it's hard to imagine the love that
swamped Hartford last November, when Kraft and Governor John
Rowland signed a tentative agreement to relocate the team to
downtown Hartford. ``Touchdown!'' exulted the Courant in a special
edition; fans who had been hurt by teams again and again finally
invested in Drew Bledsoe jerseys.
</P>
<P>
   When Kraft had trouble passing stadium legislation in
Massachusetts, Connecticult Governor John Rowland offered to build
one for him _ to the tune of $374 million. Where Massachusetts
House Speaker Thomas Finneran suggested that Kraft was a ``fat-ass
millionaire,'' Hartford Mayor Michael Peters gave him a golden key
to the city.
</P>
<P>
   But even in its most promising days, Rowland's extraordinary
offer underlined the desperation of a city which has watched Boston
and New York boom while its own industrial mainstays, defense and
insurance, were still staggering from the recession. The Patriots
deal offered the city more than jobs, and its collapse is more than
a disappointment. Asked how long it will take for local fans to
forgive the Patriots, several people use the word ``generation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to understand, that the whole city was preparing for
the Patriots,'' said Parker, who during pre-season at Coach's has
switched on one Pats game on one television, in a corner. ``It
wasn't just the team,'' he said. ``Hotels were remodeling. It was
just an uplifting time for Hartford. It was like a light at the end
of the tunnel.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, ``people could care less,'' he said. ``We're tired
of being used as a patsy.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut sports fans are an emotionally naked crowd to begin
with. Wedged between sports powerhouses to the north and the south,
Hartford fans have been forced to select allegiances or wait,
interminably, for a team that could really be theirs. They were
disappointed in the early '90s, when an earlier plan to bring the
Patriots to Hartford fell through, and again in 1997, when Hartford
lost the Whalers.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, north of the Merritt Parkway, loyalty breaks
down roughly 60-40 split Yankees-Red Sox, Giants-Patriots _
depending, some say, on whether the fan is more Irish or more
Italian. But judging from interviews this week, Bob Kraft has done
some damage to that equilibrium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're once again a lot of Bill Parcells fans,'' said Thomas
Ritter, who was Connecticut's Speaker of the House until recently,
and a scant nine months ago appeared publicly waving a ``Pats
2001'' t-shirt. In their first game, the Patriots will face the New
York Jets, under the direction of former Patriots coach Bill
Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter doesn't know what happened to that t-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will say the Pats probably got a lot of money from all the
paraphernalia people down here bought,'' said Ritter, who left the
state government this summer to practice law. ``And my guess is
that on the first day the Giants win, a lot of that will be
burned.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Hartford Civic Center, which itself represented the
city's best hope back in the 1970s, fans who were fully prepared to
love the Patriots said they were waiting for someone to come up
with another plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We deserve something,'' said Altimont Rhule, 18, a student at
Capitol Community Technical College. ``I'd take WNBA right now.''
</P>
<P>
   But when the Patriots game kicks off at 1:00 p.m. Sunday, it
will not go totally unnoticed in Hartford. Through generosity or
habit, certain Patriots fans have found their loyalty unresponsive
to current events. Kevin Fox, a marketing consultant who pledged
his allegiance to the Patriots when he was a 15-year-old in
Manchester, N.H., tried to keep an emotional distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends were waiting to see how I'm going to react to this
whole thing just for yuks, and I said, `I'm not going to root for
them,' '' Fox said. ``And then training camp opened up and I'm
buying the Globe again because I gotta read about my Patriots. If
you're a fan, you're a fan.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox sighed heavily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did it cost me any money? No. Did it break my heart? Yeah. But
you know what?'' he said. ``I'm 53 years old. It's not the first
time.''

   ``You have to understand, that the whole city was preparing for
the Patriots,'' said Parker, who during pre-season at Coach's has
switched on one Pats game on one television, in a corner. ``It
wasn't just the team,'' he said. ``Hotels were remodeling. It was
just an uplifting time for Hartford. It was like a light at the end
of the tunnel.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, ``people could care less,'' he said. ``We're tired
of being used as a patsy.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut sports fans are an emotionally naked crowd to begin
with. Wedged between sports powerhouses to the north and the south,
Hartford fans have been forced to select allegiances or wait,
interminably, for a team that could really be theirs. They were
disappointed in the early '90s, when an earlier plan to bring the
Patriots to Hartford fell through, and again in 1997, when Hartford
lost the Whalers.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, north of the Merritt Parkway, loyalty breaks
down roughly 60-40 split Yankees-Red Sox, Giants-Patriots _
depending, some say, on whether the fan is more Irish or more
Italian. But judging from interviews this week, Bob Kraft has done
some damage to that equilibrium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're once again a lot of Bill Parcells fans,'' said Thomas
Ritter, who was Connecticut's Speaker of the House until recently,
and a scant nine months ago appeared publicly waving a ``Pats
2001'' t-shirt. In their first game, the Patriots will face the New
York Jets, under the direction of former Patriots coach Bill
Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter doesn't know what happened to that t-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will say the Pats probably got a lot of money from all the
paraphernalia people down here bought,'' said Ritter, who left the
state government this summer to practice law. ``And my guess is
that on the first day the Giants win, a lot of that will be
burned.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Hartford Civic Center, which itself represented the
city's best hope back in the 1970s, fans who were fully prepared to
love the Patriots said they were waiting for someone to come up
with another plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We deserve something,'' said Altimont Rhule, 18, a student at
Capitol Community Technical College. ``I'd take WNBA right now.''
</P>
<P>
   But when the Patriots game kicks off at 1:00 p.m. Sunday, it
will not go totally unnoticed in Hartford. Through generosity or
habit, certain Patriots fans have found their loyalty unresponsive
to current events. Kevin Fox, a marketing consultant who pledged
his allegiance to the Patriots when he was a 15-year-old in
Manchester, N.H., tried to keep an emotional distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends were waiting to see how I'm going to react to this
whole thing just for yuks, and I said, `I'm not going to root for
them,' '' Fox said. ``And then training camp opened up and I'm
buying the Globe again because I gotta read about my Patriots. If
you're a fan, you're a fan.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox sighed heavily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did it cost me any money? No. Did it break my heart? Yeah. But
you know what?'' he said. ``I'm 53 years old. It's not the first
time.''

<P>
   MITROVICA, Yugoslavia _ Violence exploded on the streets of this
divided city for a second day, forcing French and Italian troops to
disperse hundreds of stone-throwing demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   The peacekeepers were taking no chances Friday, and moved
quickly to stop a crowd of some 300 Albanian youths pushing through
their lines and crossing the bridge to the Serb side where another
jeering crowd gathered.
</P>
<P>
   As the youths pelted them with stones and bottles, the troops
broke up the protest, firing tear gas and stun grenades.
</P>
<P>
   Another demonstration ended in casualties late Thursday when two
grenades exploded in a crowd of French troops and Serbs
demonstrators, wounding 37 civilians and eight French soldiers. It
was probably the worst ethnic violence in Mitrovica since the
arrival of NATO troops; the friction comes from the Serbs blocking
the return of Albanians to the north side of the Ibar river and the
Albanians protesting almost daily.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions were running high Friday, with crowds gathered on
either side of the bridge, jeering and shouting taunts. The
demonstration ended after the French troops intervened, but some
Albanians claimed to have been injured by the stun grenades. One
French soldier was reportedly injured by flying glass.
</P>
<P>
   A Serb official described the mood in the Serb quarter as one of
panic after the grenade explosions, and said women and children
were being bused to safer areas closer to Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is enough for us to see a crowd of Albanians and explosion.
That's enough, we have panic,'' said Nikola Kabasic, a member of
the Serbian National Council, a new body set up by the local Serbs
to administer their enclave. The two telephones in his office were
constantly ringing as people called to find out what was happening.
</P>
<P>
   Mitrovica has witnessed almost daily demonstrations on the main
bridge that spans the Ibar river since the arrival of NATO troops
two and a half months ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the clashes Thursday were much more serious than the usual
noisy protests and a sign that the potential for armed clashes
between the ethnic groups or against the peacekeeping force remains
real. Although the deadline for complete demilitarization is just
ten days away, both communities remain heavily armed.
</P>
<P>
   It all began towards the end of the afternoon when groups of
Albanian and Serb men confronted each other in an outlying district
on the north-western edge of the city where the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees has been moving Albanian families back
home.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs had been protesting the move for several days, cutting
off the water to the settlement, then organizing a protest of women
and children. But Thursday it was more organized, led by a former
policeman and well-known leader in Mitrovica, Olivier Ivanovic,
equipped with walkie-talkie and a group of well-muscled men.
</P>
<P>
   It was part of a new effort to protect themselves, the official,
Kabasic, said. ``For the first time in two months we have some
defence.''
</P>
<P>
   Up until now they had just watched the bridges to prevent
Albanian men cross into their quarter, he said. Now they were more
organised, he said. ``We are a minority now and we have civil
rights as a minority,'' said Kabasic, who is a lawyer by
profession.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the self-defense groups were armed, he said: ``I know
many Serbian families have weapons for self-defense.'' But to
stress the element of self-defence, he added that no Albanians have
been killed or kidnapped in recent months, whereas he had a list of
eight Serbs killed and 15 kidnapped in the district.
</P>
<P>
   The first protest turned violent, however, when the Serbs began
throwing stones. The Albanians, led by Rrahman Rama, the commander
for Mitrovica of the Kosovo Liberation Army, suddenly produced
weapons, including a Kalashnikov, and began firing. The Serbs began
to shoot back until the French Gendarmes stepped in and disarmed
three Albanians, after shooting one in the leg.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb crowd then swept off towards the center of town, to the
bridge, to continue the demonstration, and the Albanians organised
a counter-demonstration on the other side. French troops and an
Italian special police unit were positioned in between them to keep
them apart.
</P>
<P>
   In a tense moment, as recounted by a French official in
Mitrovica, the KLA commander Rama and several of his men, made
their getaway across the bridge at that moment, and had to be
protected from the Serb crowd by French troops as they drew back
the barbed wire barrier to let him through.
</P>
<P>
   It was close to 8 p.m., and already dark, when a group of young
men crossed the shallow river beneath the bridge. As they reached
the other side, someone lobbed two grenades from below the bridge
up to the top of the bank where French troops had maneuvered an
armored vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The explosions ripped into the Serbs demonstrators and French
soldiers, causing chaos in a city which was already in pitch black
with no electricity. Some 37 Serbs civilians were treated at the
central hospital, the French hospital director confirmed to the
military Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve of the Serbs were seriously wounded, including one Vojkan
Draskovic, who was evacuated to Belgrade with injuries to his eyes,
according to the Serb official, Kabasic.
</P>
<P>
   Eight French soldiers were wounded in the blast too and seven
more were injured from flying stones. ``We are not feeling too
happy today,'' commented a press spokesman, Lt. Raffray Meriadec.
No arrests were made.
</P>
<P>
   Several young Albanians were also sporting bandages, and one
even had stitches in his head from the previous day's fracas. Many
seemed to relish the tension and by mid-afternoon were chanting
like a soccer crowd, some standing on a kiosk to get a better view
of their opponents across the bridge, others pushing against the
Italian police lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see they are very young. For them it's a joke,'' said a
French soldier on the bridge. ``But for the ones on the other side,
it's not a joke,'' he said with a gesture of his head towards the
Serb side.
</P>
<P>
   Kabasic says the Serbs are living in fear, on their own, and
feel betrayed by the government in Belgrade. ``Our government are
traitors, we know that we are alone, but we know that the bravest
decision is to stay here to protect our families, a store, our
schools and our community,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   French troops say nevertheless that Serbs are infiltrating
weapons and people from Serbia into northern Kosovo, which remains
predominantly Serb. ``It's an administrative border, so there is a
free flow of people and traffic. We check cars but we cannot cover
them all,'' said the press officer, Meriadec.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the KLA is equally behind much of the protesting, and at
least some of the violence, on the Albanian side. ``Our first
objective is to prevent confrontation and also to use only relative
force,'' said Meriadec. He added on a more hopeful note: ``This
blew up very quickly but it also tends to die very quickly.''

 &HT;    La. mayor to wed TV anchor in star-studded ceremony
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Louisiana ladies, grab your hankies: This city's
No. 1 bachelor has found himself a first lady.
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans Mayor Marc Morial, 41, will marry local TV newswoman
Michelle Miller, 31, today at St. Louis Cathedral in the French
Quarter. ``MM and MM,'' as they are called, will then celebrate
with thousands of guests at the Ernest N. Morial Convention Center
_ named for Marc Morial's dad, a former mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Morial is only the second New Orleans mayor to wed while in
office: The first, Robert Maestri, married his secretary in 1938.
</P>
<P>
   The Morial-Miller ceremony has an Atlanta twist: Andrew Young,
former mayor of Atlanta, will be one of two presiding ministers.
Young, a native of New Orleans, is a family friend of the couple.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of guests, mostly family and friends, are invited to
the 4 p.m. ceremony, which will feature performances by Aaron
Neville, the choir of the Greater St. Stephen Full Gospel Baptist
Church and the Louisiana Philharmonic Orchestra. Thousands of
guests, including quite a few celebrities and politicians, received
invitations only to the reception at the convention center. A more
private reception _ only for intimates _ will be held tonight at
English Turn Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   The two-tier invitation system caused a stir among the etiquette
set, especially since the more common invitations were affixed with
pre-printed address stickers. Hand-written addresses are considered
proper.
</P>
<P>
   Even more gauche to social purists than the ``A'' and ``B''
lists was that the small card included in every envelope listed the
stores where the couple has registered for everything from muffin
tins to works of art. Miss Manners and etiquette guru Emily Post
would not approve of such gift-grubbing.
</P>
<P>
   Although Miller has said she will keep working after she gets
married, someone must be planning to cook _ a lot. The couple is
registered at the upscale Williams &AMP; Sonoma for every possible
cooking utensil, from Bundt pans to rolling pins and wire whisks.
They've already received most of their cookware, according to the
Williams &AMP; Sonoma gift registry Web site. For those who waited
until the last minute, don't despair. No one has bought the balloon
whisk ($12), or the pizza cutter ($16).
</P>
<P>
   For guests with money to burn, Coleman E. Adler &AMP; Sons on Canal
Street still has some goblets for $325. Each. They're by St. Louis,
described as stemware ``favored by kings, emperors and heads of
state.''
</P>
<P>
   Morial is keeping the honeymoon location a secret, and Miller is
keeping her dress a secret, but it is known that local designer
Harold Clarke created it. He designed the spicy red gown Miller
wore when she was the only woman asked to dance by President
Clinton at a White House function.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, a Los Angeles native, first met Morial at a news
conference at City Hall not long after he took office in 1994. She
works as a news anchor and reporter for WWL, the CBS affiliate
here. Sparks flew while they were at a mutual friend's house
watching a boxing match, said the mayor's spokeswoman, Rhonda
Spears.
</P>
<P>
   Miller has been crazy about the mayor for years and has been
dreaming of a fairy tale wedding, a friend says.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid any conflict of interest, Miller now covers features
stories and is barred from stories that have anything to do with
Morial or city government.
</P>
<P>
   Will being first lady of New Orleans interfere with Miller's
job? Not much, Spears said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The role of first lady has changed,'' she said. ``She will
have her career and she won't have many official duties as first
lady.

   The Little Search Engine That Mostly Couldn't &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Alta Vista, the Internet search engine majority-owned by CMGI
Inc., is running ads _ its first _ in magazines like Business Week.
The ads feature a black-and-white photograph of an evocative scene
_ a young girl at a ballet lesson, for example _ superimposed with
intriguing queries in conversational English.
</P>
<P>
   Now, anyone who has used a search engine knows that phrasing a
successful query is something of a black art, involving carefully
chosen keywords, odd punctuation and Boolean operators in just the
right places _ in other words, nothing like those in the ads.
</P>
<P>
   Can Alta Vista's giant servers really return a useful answer to
the ad's query, ``Are triple-turn fouettes considered neoclassical
exaggeration?''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, no, and not just because accent marks are well nigh
impossible to type into the search window on a Windows PC. (There
is no such problem with a Macintosh; Alta Vista plans to add a
Mac-like solution to its site this fall.)
</P>
<P>
   Searching without the accent found more than 1.8 million Web
pages. The first one didn't answer the question but was at least on
point: a dance school in Canada offered a Quicktime movie of a
fouette and some notes about the turn's history.
</P>
<P>
   After that came scores of pages about poetry, sculpture,
economics, typography, furniture; in short, none of the next 150,
enough to weary the most intrepid Web surfer, had anything to do
with ballet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't mean them to be taken literally,'' David Emanuel, a
spokesman for Alta Vista, said of the ads' queries. ``They are
supposed to be provocative, to get people thinking about the
Internet and what they might find.''
</P>
<P>
   Since they are also starting to provoke puzzled calls, Emanuel
said, the company is considering modifying its site to direct
anyone who types in one of the ad queries to a screenful of
searching tips. &QL;

A NIGHT AT THE OPERA: MTV ROCKS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ANN POWERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Popular music is experiencing what rappers might call
a phat moment. The financial boom is subsidizing the rise of
instant stars, and the public is fascinated with artists who
indulge in celebrity's most obvious pleasures. It is a great time
to be beautiful, rich and contentedly silly, especially if you're
smart enough to give your superficiality a sardonic twist.
</P>
<P>
   As the lively, self-satisfied MTV Video Music Awards ceremony
demonstrated on Thursday, there are many positive aspects to these
high times. The show's irreverent mood, which suited a Metropolitan
Opera House transformed into a color-saturated MTV set, highlighted
mainstream music's crazy openness.
</P>
<P>
   Most fruitful is pop's movement toward black-dominated racial
integration. The Moon Men, as the MTV statuettes are called,
overwhelmingly went to hip-hop-influenced stars. Lauryn Hill won
four, including Best Video. TLC, Will Smith, Jay Z and the Beastie
Boys all won prizes. The hip-hop-influenced band Korn won for best
rock video. The Backstreet Boys claimed the Viewers' Choice Award,
and Eminem won best new artist. Ricky Martin walked away with four
Moon Men for his Latin-proud ``Livin' La Vida Loca.''
</P>
<P>
   The commercial victory of hip-hop means that this genre, which
for too long was isolated and criticized by many as a moral menace,
is receiving some due respect.
</P>
<P>
   That regard produced the ceremony's most vibrant moments. Lauryn
Hill and Jay-Z both gave shining performances. Afeni Shakur and
Voletta Wallace, the mothers of the late rappers Tupac Shakur and
Biggie Smalls, received the evening's first full standing ovation.
Chris Rock, the night's host, gleefully belittled today's ascendant
white hip-hop and rhythm-and-blues artists, and two such artists
deferred to hip-hop pioneers during their acts.
</P>
<P>
   Kid Rock resurrected the 1986 partnership of Run DMC and
Aerosmith. Aerosmith's singer, Steven Tyler, and guitarist, Joe
Perry, strutted down an aisle in mid-set to join the rappers, DJ
Jam Master Jay and Kid Rock's band. Performing ``Walk This Way,''
which in the 13-year-old version first united rockers with a
hip-hop group, these musicians represented what pop might have
become in the 1980s, had not a decade of music industry segregation
ensued.
</P>
<P>
   Eminem facilitated the reunion of the rapper Snoop Dogg and the
producer Dr. Dre Performing ``Nuthin' but a `G' Thang,'' Snoop and
Dre got many of the famous black artists in the audience on their
feet in joy. Eminem asserted his punk side by stage-diving at the
song's end.
</P>
<P>
   Another quality of today's boom is the self-confidence of
``disposable'' stars like Martin. Martin, who is the spearhead of
the much-hyped ``Latin Pop Explosion,'' took many knocks from Chris
Rock for riding the success of his hit, ``Livin' La Vida Loca.''
But when that song won its first award, he triumphantly scoffed at
the comic's insults.
</P>
<P>
   Martin's performance was one of many that played better on
television than in the opera house. In person, Martin seemed to be
trying to realign an injured back; viewed onscreen, his gyrations
looked sultry. The Backstreet Boys spawned a similar dichotomy with
their elaborate production number, which looked like a chaotic mess
without the benefit of television's close-ups and angled shots.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, the much-anticipated return of Nine Inch Nails felt
more compelling in the flesh. Trent Reznor, the band mastermind,
makes studio-processed music but he fronts a rock band live. His
group worked through the refreshing subtleties of ``The Fragile,''
the title track of the band's new album. Translated to the screen,
the demanding song seemed too drawn out.
</P>
<P>
   MTV is suited to comical savvy, not musical sophistication. Wit
shone in the cutting repartee of Rock, who spared no one except a
few reigning legends like the Artist and Madonna, and the
performance of the mysterious Torrance Community Dance Group. The
directors Spike Jonze and Roman Coppola concocted that ungainly
troupe for the video for the club hit ``Praise You,'' by Fatboy
Slim, which won three awards. The group bumbled its way through a
live routine that poked sweet fun at the cliches of awards-ceremony
choreography, making sure this event came equipped with its own
parody.
</P>
<P>
   The assembled stars reflected the station's aura of sanguine
self-deprecation. Although a series of television-only MTV
promotions celebrated pop's emotional power (one showed an outcast
youth navigating his high school hallway armed with a blaring
portable CD player, another a gay man making a compilation tape for
a lost lover), the attitude in the opera house remained flip. This
made the evening fun, except in one way.
</P>
<P>
   Sexism in pop is getting to be a boring story. MTV presenters
like the exhibitionistic Lil' Kim and the feminist icon Susan
Sarandon shrugged off the anatomical jokes hurled their way.
Jennifer Lopez did not get to respond to Rock's incessant
references to her physique. Nor did the cameras show Heather
Locklear standing as far away as possible from her co-presenter,
the Limp Bizkit singer Fred Durst, after he spontaneously cheered
her breasts. Everyone seemed happy to act out the most simplistic,
grab-that-body-part approach to sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   In light of this, the brave stance taken by Adam Horovitz of the
Beastie Boys, who used his acceptance speech to plead for more
awareness about sexual assault at concerts, seemed weighty. But he
was heroic for acknowledging that most sexual encounters are not
spectacles staged for the camera. They involve real people, with
real consequences.
</P>
<P>
   It fit the cavalier attitude of these boom times that even the
ethical Horowitz advocated practical defenses instead of a change
in attitude. With everything so good in the pop world, nobody wants
to have to think about such bad stuff. So, as Horovitz suggested,
women in pop might as well just learn to fend for themselves.

INDUSTRIAL AND SERVICE UNIONS SPLIT ON EARLY ENDORSEMENT OF GORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The American labor movement is sharply divided over how to
handle its coveted endorsement in the 2000 presidential election
because several powerful unions _ the auto workers, the
steelworkers and the teamsters _ feel that Vice President Al Gore,
the Democratic front-runner, is not sympathetic enough to their
views on trade policy.
</P>
<P>
   The divide pits service-sector and government-employee unions,
which support Gore and want to endorse him as soon as possible,
against industrial unions, which complain that the Clinton
administration has done too little to prevent expanded trade from
wiping out thousands of jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Eager for the money and manpower that organized labor can
deliver, Gore is intensely courting union leaders in the hope of
getting the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial
Organizations to endorse him in October at its convention in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   But former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, who is challenging
Gore for the Democratic presidential nomination, is wooing unions
just as hard, embracing many of labor's positions as he tries to
prevent Gore supporters from mustering the two-thirds majority
needed for an endorsement by the 13-million-member AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high for both candidates because organized labor
is one of the most powerful forces in the Democratic Party and is
capable of mobilizing tens of thousands of members to distribute
campaign literature and conduct door-to-door drives for votes.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's supporters say they hope an early AFL-CIO endorsement
will strengthen him enough to enable him to knock Bradley out of
the race without a long, costly primary battle, thus enabling Gore
to save his campaign funds for a race against the Republican
nominee.
</P>
<P>
   The union leaders who oppose an early endorsement are trying to
make Gore sweat in an effort get him, and the Clinton
administration, to make concessions on trade before the labor
convention. One decision that could be influenced by Gore's
courting of labor, say political experts, is whether President
Clinton agrees to let China join the World Trade Organization _
something that organized labor bitterly opposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chances are an endorsement will come at the convention in
October, but it's not definite,'' said AFL-CIO president John
Sweeney, who favors Gore. ``If anything was to deteriorate in terms
of some of our major issues, we might delay it.''
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO has never made such an early endorsement, but it is
considering the possibility because the primaries are scheduled so
soon in this presidential cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders agree that Gore will have the support of at least
half the 1,000 delegates at the AFL-CIO convention, which will be
held Oct. 10-13. But it is unclear whether he will have a
two-thirds majority or whether Sweeney, who likes to work with a
consensus, will push through an endorsement if several powerful
unions oppose the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe there will be an endorsement if the major
industrial unions say no,'' said George Becker, president of the
United Steelworkers of America.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition to a Gore endorsement seems to be driven not so
much by a temptation to support Bradley but rather by a desire to
pressure Gore to be more forthcoming on trade and other matters. At
the same time, however, many union leaders who favor endorsing Gore
said they would feel comfortable backing Bradley if he ultimately
emerged as the Democratic nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, officials of the auto workers and several other
unions said there was a possibility they would sit out next year's
presidential campaign if the Democratic candidate did not move
labor's way on trade.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A Gore endorsement faces another obstacle: James P. Hoffa, who
in March became president of the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters, the largest union in the AFL-CIO. Hoffa has pledged to
make his 1.4-million-member union more bipartisan, asserting that
Democratic politicians have too often taken labor for granted and
that the teamsters were wrong to reflexively back Democrats under
his predecessor, Ron Carey.
</P>
<P>
   Teamsters political director Michael Mathis said, ``Even with a
compressed primary schedule, there is an opportunity for labor to
hold off because by holding off, we can make candidates work for
our support in a way that we can drive the agenda a little better
than if we give an endorsement in October, well before the first
primary.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO endorsement is important because the federation
coordinates union efforts in all 50 states, helps organize
volunteers and produces issue-oriented campaign literature. This
work is separate from, but often builds on, the individual
endorsements of the AFL-CIO's 68 member unions.
</P>
<P>
   Those wanting to endorse Gore point to a poll of 1,266 union
members that Peter Hart Research conducted in July for the
federation. In that poll, 55 percent of the Democratic union
members backed Gore and 25 percent supported Bradley. When asked
how they would vote if Gore faced Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the
Republican front-runner, 47 percent of the union members favored
Gore and 33 percent backed Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's labor backers are led by Gerald McEntee, president of the
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. While
the auto workers, steelworkers and teamsters usually prefer
delaying endorsements to squeeze more out of candidates, McEntee
believes in backing a candidate early because it can mean important
access and influence if that candidate wins.
</P>
<P>
   McEntee also sees other advantages in endorsing Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the whole primary process being moved forward, there are
real advantages of an early endorsement,'' McGee said. ``You can
get your people in place in terms of moving petitions, in terms of
delegate selection. We also have a major job in educating our
members, and moving early will make it easier for us to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``The train is on the track to endorse Vice President
Gore at the convention next month. I don't think you can hold up an
endorsement or not have an endorsement because two or three or four
unions are opposed.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is straining to prevent an AFL-CIO endorsement of Gore.
He has met with teamster leaders and, at the union's behest, has
opposed allowing more Mexican trucks to transport goods in the
United States _ a position that Gore has not embraced. And when
Bradley spoke at a convention of the International Brotherhood of
Painters and Allied Trades two weeks ago, he delighted the
delegates by saying he favored loosening laws that that make it
hard for unions to shut down construction sites that use nonunion
workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our delegates were chanting his name when he left the hall,''
said Bill Anderson, the painters' spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   But other union officials criticized Bradley for favoring
unrestricted trade.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Gore has long courted labor, regularly attending
AFL-CIO conventions and usually delivering pro-union goodies at
those meetings. At recent labor meetings he announced tougher job
safety rules as well as plans to deny federal contracts to
companies that violate labor laws. He has also spoken out on one of
labor's pet issues: condemning corporations that violate workers'
rights when they try to turn back unionization drives.
</P>
<P>
   American Federation of Teachers president Sandra Feldman said:
``Gore has spent his entire political life supporting the issues of
working people. He's fought for better schools. He's fought for
better health care. We ought to endorse him early and help in his
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Becker, the steelworkers' president, and United Automobile
Workers president Stephen Yokich are far less enthusiastic. They
are urging Gore and the president to take a more sympathetic view
on trade and to show more concern about the loss of manufacturing
jobs. Hurt by the strong dollar and the Asian financial crisis, the
nation's manufacturing sector has lost 500,000 jobs in 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fighting for our survival in the manufacturing sector,''
Yokich said. ``There are a lot of issues that we have to talk about
with both candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   Yokich expressed concern that the Clinton administration would
let China join the World Trade Organization, which would further
reduce trade barriers with China. ``They're just looking for a
place with cheap wages,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He praised Clinton for calling for labor protections in new
trade agreements, but he said the administration had a poor record
in enforcing trade accords.
</P>
<P>
   Becker said: ``We're concerned about the deindustrialization of
America. We want to reverse that, somehow.''
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, the unions that seek to delay an endorsement
represent about a quarter of the federation's membership.
</P>
<P>
   Labor leaders said that despite their complaints about Gore and
Bradley on trade, they feel far closer to the two Democrats than to
the Republican field of candidates on a number of issues, ranging
from Social Security to tax cuts and from the minimum wage to labor
law reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two fine Democratic candidates,'' Yokich said.
``Quite frankly, they're a lot better than what's out there on the
Republican side.''

<P>
   If Paolo Fresco's prospects for reinvigorating Fiat are
promising, that is largely because of the efforts of Paolo
Cantarella, 54, the mechanical engineer who became Fiat's chief
executive in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   A former aide to Cesare Romiti, Fresco's predecessor as
chairman, and then head of the Comau machinery unit and the Fiat
Auto division, Cantarella marries technical ability with strategic
vision.
</P>
<P>
   Fiat's innovative car factory in Melfi, Italy, designed for lean
production, and its main product, the Punto compact car, were
Cantarella's projects. So was the grand design to cast Fiat's net
wide in emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
   A man with gasoline in his veins, Cantarella often spends
Saturdays at Fiat's test track outside Turin, driving Fiat models
and those of the competition.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, when Le Journal de l'Automobile, a French magazine,
named him the industry's man of the year, Jacques Calvet, then head
of Peugeot, lauded him as an executive who ``fundamentally loves
the product.''
</P>
<P>
   The two Paolos get along well, according to John F. Welch Jr.,
chairman of General Electric and a member of Fiat's board, and each
has a clear sphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paolo Cantarella is very operational,'' Welch said. ``Paolo
Fresco is very strategic and very people-oriented.''
</P>
<P>
   Alec Shutze, an analyst at Merrill Lynch in London who follows
Fiat, said he expected Fresco to get his chief executive to focus
on shareholder concerns. Cantarella, he said, often spoke in the
past about ``economic value added,'' but could ``never give an
answer what it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Fresco, he said, will teach Cantarella to stress ``share price
appreciation, and building value.''
</P>
<P>
   Disciples of Welch, indeed.

 &HT;    Judge rules against race-based busing in N.C.
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ A federal judge ruled Friday that
Charlotte-Mecklenburg's public schools no longer may assign
students by race, dissolving a landmark desegregation order that
ushered in three decades of forced busing across America.
</P>
<P>
   In a ruling with potentially broad ramifications in public
education, U.S. District Judge Robert Potter criticized educators'
pursuit of classroom diversity, a longtime goal in
Charlotte-Mecklenburg and many other school districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court accepts that children may derive benefits from
encounters with students of different races,'' Potter wrote.
``Nevertheless, a major problem with the single-minded focus on
racial diversity is that it produces diversity in nothing but race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children are not viewed as individual students but as cogs in
a social experimentation machine,'' the judge wrote in a ruling
that disturbed some people in Charlotte who fear a return to
segregated schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``For our children to succeed in this society, we need to go to
school together and work together,'' said Sarah Stevenson, 73, a
Charlotte native who attended Friday's briefing by the school
board.
</P>
<P>
   School board member Jim Puckett countered that, in many cases,
desegregation has been a hollow victory. ``Education today is more
relevant than desegregation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The much-anticipated ruling was a victory for a group of white
Charlotte-area parents who sued in 1997 and 1998. They argued that
forced busing and race-based student placement violated their
constitutional guarantee of equal protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charlotte has a chance to be visionary,'' said Atlanta lawyer
Lee Parks, who represented the plaintiffs. ``It is the first time
that parents have done for a school board what the school board is
supposed to do for itself _ obtain unitary (desegregated) status
and end court supervision.''
</P>
<P>
   After reviewing the 115-page ruling, the Charlotte-Mecklenburg
Board of Education said it will decide over the next 30 days
whether to appeal the order. If the school board appeals the
ruling, it could prolong uncertainty among parents seeking stable
school assignments for their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not want more turmoil and diversity,'' Superintendent
Eric Smith said. ``But we do not want to sacrifice the quality of
education of large groups of students for a year or two of
stability.''
</P>
<P>
   In a three-month trial that ended in June, school officials
argued they needed several more years to achieve desegregation.
Potter concluded that the nation's 23rd largest school district has
achieved an acceptable level of desegregation among its 101,000
students.
</P>
<P>
   The judge wrote that the district ``has eliminated, to the
extent practicable, the vestiges of past discrimination in the
traditional areas of school operations,'' including student and
faculty assignment, facilities, transportation, staff and
extracurricular activities such as sports. The original plaintiff
in the current litigation, Bill Capacchione, who is white, sued
after his daughter had to wait two years trying to enroll in one of
the county's magnet schools. At the time of the lottery for seats,
spots reserved for black children had gone unfilled. Black children
eventually took the seats.
</P>
<P>
   In criticizing the policy of assigning students to magnet
schools, Potter wrote that the court ``is hard-pressed to find a
more restrictive means of using race than a process that results in
holding seats vacant while long waiting lists full of eager
applicants are virtually ignored. ... In fact, there is no
reasonable basis for the rigid set-asides.

   Hail to the ... Author &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was only a book party, of course. The book was ``Faith of My
Fathers,'' a family memoir by Sen. John McCain, the Arizona
Republican who in real life is seeking the Republican presidential
nomination. The party was a gathering at Michael R. Bloomberg's
Park Avenue offices on Wednesday evening, organized by Bloomberg,
Henry A. Kissinger and Georgette Mosbacher, who in real life is
co-chairwoman of McCain's campaign. Some of the fattest checkbooks
_ er, that is, most avid readers _ in the business world were
there.
</P>
<P>
   Rubbing shoulders with Norman Mailer (``Armies of the Night'')
was the investment banker Peter G. Peterson, a fellow author
(``Gray Dawn''). Marshall N. Carter, chief executive of the State
Street Corp. in Boston, dropped in after wrapping up the
acquisition of the Wachovia Corp.'s institutional trust and custody
units. Herbert M. Allison Jr., who in July resigned as president of
Merrill Lynch, looked cheerful and rested after a Vermont vacation.
Both Wilbur L. Ross Jr., executive managing director of Rothschild
Inc., and his estranged wife, former New York Lt. Gov. Betsy
McCaughey, were there _ but never in the same chattering cluster at
the same time.
</P>
<P>
   The conversation was of nothing but politics, and the applause
for McCain was loud and long. But as a twinkling Bloomberg reminded
the crowd after his endorsement-like introduction of the
candidate-author, ``This is only a book party.''

prestigious name: Boutros-Ghali. No, not former United Nations
Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, but Teymour Boutros-Ghali,

<P>
   The younger Boutros-Ghali, 44, born in Egypt and raised in
Europe, is a former publisher of Time Inc. International. He was
named chief executive of Allbusiness.com, based in San Francisco,
on Tuesday. The company, which is set to get its Web site rolling
later this week, aims to help small businesses find professional
services, like payroll processing, legal help and recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   While he hasn't run a dot-com yet, Boutros-Ghali has had a hand
in starting several, including Weddingnetwork.com, an online bridal
registry of which he is a co-founder and a director. He said he
ultimately decided to dive in full time with AllBusiness.com
because it suited his passion for building an enterprise that has
the potential to grow explosively.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the opportunity to become the premier, and one of the

   Ed Zander, president of Sun Microsystems, called the market's
reaction to his company's moves last week a ``sign of the times.''
</P>
<P>
   To backtrack a bit: Late last month, Sun announced an
acquisition that would let it distribute word processing and
similar software over the Internet _ free. The aim was to further
Sun's notion that software should reside on servers (which it
makes) rather than on personal computers (the software domain of
its archrival, Microsoft).
</P>
<P>
   Though Sun was laying out untold millions for products it
planned to give away, its stock jumped 13 percent in the days after
the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on Wednesday, Zander announced Sun's new generation of
network computers, promising products for which Sun actually plans
to charge.
</P>
<P>
   Sun's stock blipped upward, then started falling. By the end of
the day Thursday, the shares had dropped 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Zander joked that he had a new strategy in mind, saying, ``Why
don't we just give everything away for free?'' &QL;

   When Jerre L. Stead, chief executive of Ingram Micro, the
world's largest computer distributor, says he was hoping that his
stock options would be worth $100 million, he's unusual only in
acknowledging an ambition that other chief executives keep to
themselves. Stead was even more unusual in forgoing any salary
since his hiring in 1996 to get even more options.
</P>
<P>
   But his options, to buy shares at $18, have little immediate
value now; the shares closed last week at $15.9375.
</P>
<P>
   Stead, 57, says he has always planned to give away all his
options wealth. He has assigned blocks of options to each of his
four grandchildren. He plans to give the rest to causes including
homeless relief, research into Alzheimer's disease (his mother's
ailment) and the economic development of Maquoketa, Iowa, where he
and his wife, Mary Jo, grew up.
</P>
<P>
   He also plans to support the Center for Ethics and Values at
Northwestern University, where he teaches occasionally; the
University of Iowa, his alma mater, and some Presbyterian and
Methodist church projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never planned to spend the money,'' Stead said last week.
``Mary Jo and I lived on $2,800 a year in a 40-foot trailer when we
were in college.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, with Ingram's stock at $54 a share, Stead's options
were worth $126 million. Last week, the stock's slide accelerated
after the company announced a gloomy outlook and Stead's decision
to step down as chief executive, though he will remain chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Stead, professionally upbeat, with cards that read ``coach''
rather than ``chief executive,'' says that his options have not
expired and that the stock and the company will rebound.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, he won't go begging. At the Legent Corp., his
former employer, he pocketed $15 million from options. &QL;

EUROPEAN COMMISSION MAY BLOCK MERGER OF 2 BRITISH TRAVEL
COMPANIES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Germany)  By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The European Commission seemed to be preparing Friday
to block the proposed $1.4 billion merger of two leading British
travel companies. The deal would have created the country's biggest
single tour operator and narrowed competition in a cutthroat market
beset by price wars and falling sales.
</P>
<P>
   If the takeover of First Choice by Airtours PLC is blocked, the
move will mean the commission has extended its definition of unfair
competition. Analysts said the likelihood of such a move reflected
a significant toughening of the European Union's rules on
competition, with the 15-nation body showing itself increasingly
ready to enforce antitrust regulations across a broad range of
industries.
</P>
<P>
   First Choice is the fourth-largest travel company in Britain.
Airtours is the second-largest.
</P>
<P>
   The European Commission, the executive arm of the European
Union, has previously blocked mergers only when they would have
left a single company dominating a market. By contrast, the
Airtours-First Choice deal would have reduced the number of top
players in the ailing British travel market from four to three.
</P>
<P>
   A commission official in Brussels, Belgium, said a regulatory
panel Friday endorsed a veto of the British merger proposed by
Karel van Miert, the European Union's outgoing chief competition
regulator. Van Miert said this week that competitors had voiced ``a
lot of concerns'' about the proposed merger.
</P>
<P>
   Van Miert is to be replaced by Mario Monti before the scheduled
announcement of the commission's decision on Sept. 22. But he has
already said that his replacement ``will be in full agreement''
with him on this issue.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, Airtours could still withdraw the deal and resubmit
an improved offer later. Word of the pending decision sent stock in
both companies plummeting, with Airtours down as much as 6 percent,
to 417.5 pence, and First Choice shares tumbling 13 percent, to 154
pence.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies declined comment on the status of the deal, as
did a European Commission spokesman. Earlier this week, Airtours
offered to modify the deal in order to win regulatory approval, but
a commission official said the company's proposal to spin off some
of the merged business as a separate entity had not persuaded van
Miert to change his mind.
</P>
<P>
   He apparently felt that unless Airtours sold off travel agencies
as well, there would be no way of creating a fourth tour operator
capable of challenging the other three companies.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's leading tour operator is Thomson Travel Group PLC. The
fourth major player in the present lineup is Thomas Cook, owned by
Germany's Preussag AG.
</P>
<P>
   Some British travel companies are heading for the doldrums after
a summer marked by a price-cutting contest among companies vying
for customers in a market where the number of available vacation
packages outstrips the number of would-be travelers.
</P>
<P>
   The main loser has been the dominant Thomson Travel Group, which
Friday issued its second profit warning in six weeks. The company
said its sales had been hit by the war in Kosovo, which deterred
travelers from heading to resorts in the region, and a decline in
the number of vacationers going to the eastern Mediterranean.

BUSING TO END IN THE SCHOOLS WHERE IT BEGAN
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Colo., Del., Mass. Ohio, Okla., Tenn.)  (rk) 
 By EMILY YELLIN with DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ The school system that pioneered busing for
desegregation 30 years ago was ordered to halt the program by a
federal judge, who ruled Friday that forced integration was no
longer necessary because all vestiges of intentional discrimination
had disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, which affects about 28,000 students who now ride
buses past their neighborhood schools, has enormous symbolic
significance for the lingering institution of court-ordered busing,
since it was in a 1971 ruling on Charlotte's plan that the U.S.
Supreme Court first approved busing for desegregation in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the end of an era in American social policy,'' said Glenn
C. Loury, director of the Institute on Race and Social Division at
Boston University. ``The weight that was borne by school
desegregation, as the vehicle for trying to equalize opportunity,
will now have to be borne elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   When the busing plan was first imposed, the courts were trying
to break up a pattern of separate school systems for black and
white students, and the Supreme Court said that busing students
away from their neighborhoods was an appropriate tool to achieve a
racial balance.
</P>
<P>
   In the last five years, however, many busing plans have been
dismantled by the same courts that imposed them, as judges ruled
that the school districts had become ``unitary,'' ending their old
dual systems. Although many black parents in Charlotte say their
children's education remains inferior to that of whites, the
district now joins such cities as Nashville, Tenn., Oklahoma City,
Denver, Wilmington, Del., and Cleveland in having schools that are
now officially declared desegregated.
</P>
<P>
   The Charlotte-Mecklenburg school district ``has eliminated, to
the extent practicable, the vestiges of past discrimination in the
traditional areas of school operations,'' wrote U.S. District Judge
Robert D. Potter in his ruling Friday. The district has complied in
good faith with the original decision of the Supreme Court, he
said, and there is no indication that it will return to a
segregated system. He allowed the current system to continue
through the end of the school year.
</P>
<P>
   Potter is a former campaign worker for Sen. Jesse Helms of North
Carolina and was appointed to the bench by President Ronald Reagan
at the senator's recommendation. In 1969, as a private citizen, he
collected signatures on a petition against the busing plan.
</P>
<P>
   Some black parents and officials in Charlotte, along with the
school district itself, said they were not as confident as the
judge that black students could receive an equal education without
court supervision. The district has not decided whether to appeal
the ruling, but some of the lawyers involved said it should.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am disappointed with the decision,'' said Julius L.
Chambers, former director of the NAACP Legal Defense and Education
Fund, who helped represent the original plaintiffs in 1971. ``I
know that Charlotte has made a lot of progress and I was hoping
that it would be allowed to continue to promote its efforts.''
Chambers is now chancellor of North Carolina Central University in
Durham.
</P>
<P>
   Busing began in Charlotte after U.S. District Judge James
McMillan ruled in 1969 that the district was intentionally
segregating students, noting that almost every black student
attended schools that were entirely black. The decision, upheld two
years later by the Supreme Court in the case of Swann vs.
Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, was initiated by a black
family whose children were not allowed in white schools.
</P>
<P>
   The district, which now consists of about 100,000 students in
Charlotte and surrounding Mecklenburg County, is currently 60
percent white and 40 percent black, and district officials have
used busing to try to achieve a similar ratio in every school. In
many cases, that has meant that children cannot go to their
neighborhood school when there are slots open for others of a
different race, and that has angered many of the white newcomers
who have been drawn to Charlotte's suburbs by the region's
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's ruling comes out of a 1997 case in which the parents of
Christina Capacchione, a white girl who was then 6, said that she
was denied admission to her neighborhood school after she lost a
lottery that determined which white students could attend. Six
other white families eventually joined the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Potter wrote that it was particularly ``bizarre'' that the
school board _ which includes several black officials, including
the chairman _ argued throughout the trial this summer that it
should be forced to continue busing, taking the position that it
has not complied with the original order and needs further court
supervision. ``Now it wishes to use that order as a pretext to
pursue race-conscious, diversity enhancing policies in
perpetuity,'' the judge wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But school officials testified that busing was still necessary
because schools in black neighborhoods were far inferior to those
in white areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never argued that we needed court supervision, we argued
that the vestiges of a dual system remain in this district,'' said
Arthur Griffin, the school board chairman. ``I am a native
Charlottian. I went to all-black schools right here in this school
district, and the same conditions that I experienced in my old high
school when I graduated in 1966 are very similar to those in an
all-black school today. So this board argued that the vestiges of a
dual system remain and that we need a little bit more time to fix
it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   A study by The Charlotte Observer found that if busing ended,
more than half of the district's students would attend schools with
little or no racial diversity, because of housing patterns. The
number of children attending mostly single-race schools would
triple, from 17,000 to almost 50,000, the Observer concluded.
</P>
<P>
   And a series of recent studies by the Civil Rights Project at
the Harvard Graduate School of Education found that resegregation
is on the rise in the country's schools because of court rulings
dismantling busing programs. The studies, conducted by Gary
Orfield, an education professor at Harvard and a prominent
supporter of desegregation plans, found that much of the
backtracking is happening in the South, where schools until
recently had been more integrated than in the North.
</P>
<P>
   Gloria J. Browne, an attorney with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund
who defended the desegregation plan in the current case, said the
judge's decision simply ignored repeated testimony that schools in
mostly black, high-poverty areas were demonstrably inferior to
those in white areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad decision, because it doesn't deal with the massive
disparities in facilities,'' said Ms. Browne. ``It's a horrible
message for the rest of the country, because here we have a
district that confesses it is not giving equal access to
educational opportunity for black students, and it's still allowed
to get off the hook.''
</P>
<P>
   But A. Lee Parks, an Atlanta attorney representing the white
plaintiffs, said defenders of the system were mistakenly equating a
60-40 ratio of students with educational quality. Once busing ends,
he said, the district can start focusing its money and attention on
education instead of transportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the years, they forgot about the educational part of
their job, and the result has been a disheartening trend of
students leaving the public school system for private schools,''
said Parks, who often represents plaintiffs trying to eliminate
racial preferences in public institutions. ``This is a very
important decision to get public schools working again.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that residential segregation persists in the
Charlotte area, but noted the Supreme Court has explicitly ruled
that is not a school district responsibility to rectify. Busing, he
said, is only permissible in cases where there is still evidence of
intentional segregation.
</P>
<P>
   School officials, reading the political and judicial winds,
seemed to sense how the judge would rule, and last spring the board
approved a five-year plan that would eliminate the rigid 60-40
ratio and much of the busing in favor of a school choice plan.
Parents would be allowed to choose a school within one of seven
racially diverse zones in a lottery-style system. Board members
said they would re-evaluate the plan in light of the judge's
ruling, and would shortly announce a plan for the district's
future.

ASTRONAUT WILL APPEAL DECISION TO PULL HIM FROM MISSION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Astronaut Mark Lee said Friday he is appealing NASA's
decision to pull him from a shuttle crew assigned to a space
station construction mission next spring.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force colonel, 47, was bumped for reasons that neither
he nor his bosses at Houston's Johnson Space Center are willing to
disclose from a mission that is to deliver the U.S. laboratory
module to the growing orbital outpost in late May.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm appealing the decision,'' said Lee. ``I will have no
comment until the process is complete.''
</P>
<P>
   The space agency, which as a rule does not name backups to
shuttle flights, seldom pulls astronauts from flight crews.
</P>
<P>
   NASA, though, is treating the incident as nonpunitive, an
instance where a supervisor has exercised his administrative
prerogative to reassign personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Since Lee did not suffer a loss of salary or a reduction in his
employment grade, his request for reinstatement to the shuttle crew
will be referred to his boss, Jim Wetherbee, Johnson's director of
flight crew operations, said agency spokesman Ed Campion. A formal
hearing is not planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are such processes when there is a punitive action, if
somebody has suffered a loss of grade or loss of pay that they feel
is unfair, that they can take within the human resources office to
protest or appeal,'' said Campion. ``But what Mark Lee has
essentially done is ask his boss to reconsider the decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee was to join another crewman for at least three spacewalks to
link the research module to the station. He was assigned to the
flight in August 1998 along with four other astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   The four spacewalks he logged on previous missions make him one
of the agency's most experienced. He remains eligible for a future
flight assignment, NASA said.
</P>
<P>
   The astronaut corps was not informed of the reasons behind the
decision, according to one source. When news of the action became
public this week, the space agency would say only that the decision
was ``an internal astronaut office matter'' and intended to
``maintain a high level of professionalism necessary for the
overall integrity of the space flight program.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee was replaced by another astronaut who is in training for
another station assembly flight but with no previous spacewalk
experience.
</P>
<P>
   A former fighter pilot, Lee joined NASA's astronaut corps in
1984.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Lee became half of the first married couple to fly in
space when he wed a fellow crew member, Jan Davis, before their
launching. Lee listed himself as ``single'' on his most recent NASA
biography, and earlier this year, Davis took an administrative
assignment at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala.,
her hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Though as a rule NASA does not assign backup flight personnel,
the need for replacements has been limited primarily to cases where
crewmen died during training periods or were confronted with urgent
family matters that took them away from their NASA duties.
</P>
<P>
   However, in 1990 the space agency bumped two veteran shuttle
commanders from shuttle missions after flying infractions. The two
astronauts, Robert ``Hoot'' Gibson and David Walker, later resumed
their space flight activities.

A BOOM FOR BUILDERS, BUT NOT FOR THEIR STOCKS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 12) 
</HEADLINE>

is being sent to NYT graphic clients. Non-subscribers can make
individual purchase by calling (888) 603-1036 or (888) 346-9867.)  
 (af)  
 By MICHELLE LEDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is it tag-sale time for home-building stocks?
</P>
<P>
   Nobody disputes the causes for the sector's recent selloff:
Interest rates have generally been rising, prompting skittishness
over these notoriously rate-sensitive stocks. Investors worry that
the economic expansion is growing long in the tooth _ and fear that
Americans' zest for buying new homes will soon subside.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's Supercap home-building index, tracking 15
such stocks, is down 33.1 percent this year. Yet with most builders
trading at seven times 1999 earnings per share, or less, far below
the wider market, and with huge backlogs at many builders, some
analysts think the market has overreacted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The multiples are just absurd,'' said Timothy L. Jones, a
managing director at Southeast Research in Boca Raton, Fla., who
follows the industry. ``There's a paranoia about interest rates.''
</P>
<P>
   Highly cyclical, the sector has often required investors to have
strong stomachs. In 1994, when interest rates rose sharply, the
group was down 23 percent while the S&AMP;P 500 was flat. The next
year, the group climbed nearly 61 percent, while the S&AMP;P rose 34.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of new homes are, in fact, booming. Late last month, the
Commerce Department said sales of new single-family homes were
expected to reach 980,000 by year-end, up nearly 11 percent from
1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're surprised at how strong new-homes sales have been,''
said Michael Carliner, an economist at the National Association of
Home Builders in Washington. And while it typically takes about six
months for a mortgage-rate increase to put a damper on new-home
sales, Carliner sees rates remaining relatively stable the rest of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   Rates on 30-year fixed mortgages have recently dipped back below
8 percent, after climbing above that mark in mid-August for the
first time in two years, according to surveys by HSH Associates of
Butler, N.J., a mortgage research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Individual companies also report strong numbers, though you
wouldn't glean that from stock performance. The Kaufman &AMP; Broad
Home Corp., a Los Angeles-based builder, reported that earnings per
share for the quarter ended May 31 were up 36.4 percent and that
July orders were up 30 percent in California and 43 percent in the
rest of the country. But its stock, at $19.9375 on Friday, is down
more than 30 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Toll Brothers, of Huntingdon Valley, Pa., posted third-quarter
profit of 80 cents a share, beating the analysts' consensus by 6
cents. But that has not helped the stock, which, at $21.1875, is
down 6.1 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has nothing to do with individual companies,'' said
Barbara K. Allen, an analyst at Arnhold &AMP; S. Bleichroeder in
Manhattan. ``The market seems to be convinced that the housing
cycle has peaked.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Allen has buy recommendations on Kaufman and Toll Brothers,
and on the Centex Corp. of Dallas, down 37.3 percent since January,
the Lennar Corp. of Miami, down 30.2 percent, and the Pulte Corp.
of Bloomfield Hills, Mich., off 15.5 percent. She says the stocks
should trade at 10 to 12 times analysts' estimates of 1999
earnings, not the current multiples of 7 or less.
</P>
<P>
   That has prompted some value investors to take a closer look.
Thomas Corkill, a partner at Harris Associates in Chicago, had 1.49
percent of the Harris Insight Small-Cap Opportunity fund invested
in Kaufman &AMP; Broad as of June 30. Other Harris funds hold Lennar,
Centex and D.R. Horton of Arlington, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not necessarily saying that this is one of the best
places to be, but it's cheaper when compared with a lot of other
places,'' he said. He added that the consensus may be acting
rationally in pounding housing stocks, but ``we disagree to the
point at which they're being pounded.''

INVESTNG WITH EDWARD P. OWENS VANGUARD HEALTH CARE FUND  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 12)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Earlier this year, as worries piled up about everything from an
overheating economy to possible government price controls on drugs,
the stock market took a scalpel to the health care industry. The
Standard &AMP; Poor's health care composite index fell 20.4 percent
from its peak in mid-April through early August.
</P>
<P>
   But more than a few pockets of strength remain. ``The selloff
was concentrated in big-cap stocks that had done well for many
years,'' said Edward P. Owens, who runs the $10.65 billion Vanguard
Health Care fund. ``The biotechnology and Japanese drug sectors
have been strong through the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead, he sees health care stocks tracking the general
market. ``It's pretty unlikely that the 30-plus percent gains of
the last four years will continue,'' Owens said from his office
overlooking Quincy Market in Boston, where he is senior vice
president at Wellington Management, a money management firm.
</P>
<P>
   The best values may be found in a hard-hit group _ health care
services stocks, like drugstore chains, pharmaceutical distributors
and hospitals. ``Health care services has been left far behind,''
he said, ``and probably will be the best-performing part of the
health care sector over the next three or four years.''
</P>
<P>
   The fund has managed to stay in positive territory this year,
returning 6.7 percent through Sept. 3, compared with 6.0 percent
for the average specialized health care fund, according to
Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial publisher, and 0.25 percent
for the S&AMP;P health care index.
</P>
<P>
   For the three years ended Sept. 3, the fund returned 28.7
percent, annualized, versus 16.9 percent for its peers, according
to Morningstar, and 32.5 percent for the index.
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard closed the fund to new investors in February, when it
hit $10 billion in assets, and has no plans to reopen it, a company
spokesman, John Demming, said.
</P>
<P>
   Owens takes a measured approach to health care investing. ``I'm
a very conservative, fundamentally oriented investor with a value
approach to a growth sector of the economy,'' he said. The fund
also maintains an unusually low turnover rate of 11 percent, far
below that of the average health care fund.
</P>
<P>
   Owens checks a computer program that shows relative valuation,
price movement and other characteristics of 1,600 health care
companies worldwide, but usually concentrates on corporate
developments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spend most of my time studying medical and trade journals
and analyst reports,'' he said. ``I don't have any hard `sell' or
`buy' points.''
</P>
<P>
   And Owens asks many questions of companies' management. He meets
with executives of three or four companies in his office each day,
travels to others and sees 15 to 20 companies a day at four or five
annual health care conferences. One focus is on research and
development.
</P>
<P>
   ``The drug pipeline is a leading indicator of changes in growth
rates,'' he said. ``You can see a company improving ahead of
everything else if you see a pipeline that's big relative to the
company's size.''
</P>
<P>
   He is not wedded to a particular measurement of value and looks
at factors ranging from balance-sheet strength to price-to-earnings
and price-to-cash-flow ratios.
</P>
<P>
   About 21 percent of the fund is invested overseas, the high end
of its historical range, including 9 percent in Japan, the highest
level ever. ``In the last three or four years, the Japanese FDA
tightened drug approval procedures and created a major slowdown in
drug approvals,'' Owens said, referring to the Japanese equivalent
of the United States Food and Drug Administration. ``They're coming
out of that now, and approvals will start to increase.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He bought Eisai, a Japanese drug company, in late 1998 and early
1999 at an average cost of $16 a share. ``We think the pipeline
will allow it to become a global pharmaceutical firm over the next
decade,'' he said. Eisai brought to market Aricept, the first
effective palliative for Alzheimer's, marketed with Pfizer, and has
launched a new ulcer drug, Aciphex, marketed worldwide by Johnson &AMP;
Johnson, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He expects annual earnings growth of 15 percent over the next
three years. On Friday, the stock closed at 2,585 yen, or $23.7505,
33.9 times his 2000 earnings estimate of 70 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Owens increased fivefold his position in McKesson
HBOC, the drug distributor based in San Francisco. McKesson's
purchase in January of HBO, a health care information company, was
a ``disaster,'' he said, because financial results had to be
restated as a result of accounting irregularities at HBO. That led
to a big charge as well as the ouster of some top executives and
pulled McKesson's price down to $32 a share by the end of April,
from a high of $89.75 in January.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that McKesson's distribution business is sound, and
that, despite the problems, HBO remains a leading provider of
health care information technology. ``We think the reaction to the
bad news was excessive, and over the next year or two the correct
valuation will surface,'' he said, adding that he expected the
share price to rise 30 percent to 50 percent in two years.
</P>
<P>
   He estimates an earnings growth rate of 30 percent a year over
three years. The stock is now at $34.125, 19 times his 2000
earnings estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Owens recently added to his position in Monsanto, whose Searle
division produces Celebrex, the first of a new class of arthritis
drugs. ``I think success with this drug will make them one of the
better-performing drug companies over the next two years or so,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The company's agricultural division, which does work in
genetics, is a worry for investors because of opposition to genetic
engineering of crops. ``We think the value of the stock is
supported by the pharmaceutical division alone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He estimated annual earnings growth of 25 percent over three
years. The stock closed on Friday at $38.0625, 29.3 times his 2000
earnings estimate of $1.30 a share.

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ Alarmed by continued bloodshed,
President Clinton accused the Indonesian military of ``aiding and
abetting'' the violence in East Timor and demanded it allow an
international force onto the island.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton arrived Saturday morning to join Pacific Rim leaders for
the annual Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation conference, an agenda
now dominated by the turmoil in nearby East Timor. A rogue militia
has killed hundreds and displaced thousands since an independence
vote last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is now clear that the Indonesian military is aiding and
abetting the militia violence. This is simply unacceptable,''
Clinton said in a written statement issued during a two-hour
refueling stop for Air Force One in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Indonesian government and military must reverse this
course, to do everything possible to stop the violence, and to
allow an international force to make possible the restoration of
security,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton issued the statement following a meeting at Hickam Air
Force Base with Adm. Dennis Blair, the commander of U.S. forces in
the Pacific, who held a military-to-military session 48 hours
earlier with Indonesian Gen. Wiranto.
</P>
<P>
   His words coincided with stepped up international pressure on
Indonesia on several fronts.
</P>
<P>
   Financial institutions, including the International Monetary
Fund and World Bank, froze assistance to Indonesia and called for
President B.J. Habibie to quickly return order to East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a bipartisan group of U.S. House members led by
Houston Rep. Ken Bentsen, a Democrat, began efforts to block all
World Bank and IMF assistance to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation filed by Bentsen and eight others would not only
halt any future loans, it would require existing loans to be
discontinued until the Indonesian government puts a stop to
violence in East Timor stemming from the independence referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's renewed condemnation came after militiamen stormed a
United Nations compound in Dili, the East Timor capital, after the
international staff had been withdrawn. East Timorese refugees
seeking shelter there were left to their own defenses.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan pressed Indonesia
for a quick agreement to allow peacekeepers into the territory.
Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Malaysia and France have
offered to send troops.
</P>
<P>
   Annan warned Indonesian leaders that unless they called in
foreign peacekeepers, they could be held responsible for ``what
could amount ... to crimes against humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Carlos Belo, a Nobel Peace Prize winner forced to flee
East Timor this week, described events there as ``genocide'' and
appealed for world intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Annan said the Aug. 30 U.N.-run referendum had let the people of
East Timor choose their destiny for the first time. The
predominately Roman Catholic East Timor, a former Portuguese
colony, was invaded by mostly Muslim Indonesia in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   ``The international community has a responsibility to see that
their wishes are respected and that violence is not allowed to
dictate the outcome,'' Annan said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also called Australian Prime Minister John Howard and
discussed ways to increase the pressure on Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president made clear to Prime Minister Howard that the
United States supported such an international peacekeeping force
and that we would provide support to such a force if one becomes
feasible,'' said Samuel ``Sandy'' Berger, the president's national
security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has said there are no plans to commit troops
to an international force, but Berger added that ``I don't think
anything is ruled out here.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger said the United States also is reviewing its economic
connections to Indonesia. The president on Thursday suspended any
military cooperation and many other nations followed suit.
</P>
<P>
   Wiranto, the commander of Indonesian forces and an old ally of
ousted President Suharto, told reporters that Indonesia would allow
an international force into East Timor but the time was not right.
Indonesia wants to first ratify the independence vote, which it
said would take two months.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia has declared martial law in East Timor but its
military there has done little to quell the violence. Indeed, there
are many reports that the military may be fractured and under the
sway of a rival to Gen. Wiranto. Habibie has demonstrated little
control over his armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was accompanied to New Zealand by daughter Chelsea and
mother-in-law Dorothy Rodham. First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton
remained in the United States, where she is pondering a bid for the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton intends to meet later Saturday with Chinese President
Jiang Zemin in an attempt to heal the rift between the United
States and China over a series of issues.

<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ In the mid-1970s, the social nucleus of many
of the men who were creating both the Internet and the personal
computer industry was a hole-in-the-wall Sichuan Chinese restaurant
across the street from Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   Theirs was an informal network that included people like John
McCarthy, a pioneer in artificial intelligence, and Whitfield
Diffie, an inventor of modern cryptography, who was then a Stanford
graduate student and carried custom chopsticks. Bill Gosper, a
mathematician and legendary computer hacker, ate at the restaurant
every evening for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a quarter-century since Louis Kao opened the
restaurant, Hsi-Nan, and was discovered by a ragtag collection of
computer hackers, hardware engineers and network designers. They
came because Louie, as Kao is universally known to his devoted
followers, was a master at preparing the perfect fare for hackers.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday more than 30 computer scientists, electrical
engineers, programmers and mathematicians gathered to mark the
retirement of the 59-year-old Kao and enjoy one final meal cooked
by the chef whose restaurant was for a decade the soul of Silicon
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, it was a movable feast: Hsi-Nan had four
locations before it finally closed in 1995. (Kao subsequently
opened a pizza parlor.) It was a striking contrast to the
restaurants that are now exemplars of the valley _ places like Il
Fornaio in Palo Alto or Bucks in Woodside.
</P>
<P>
   In Hsi-Nan's heyday, from 1974 to 1984, the talk there was not
of Internet megadeals but of the visions of mostly young men who
were passionate about the power of personal computing. It was a
period characterized by a fervor for computing rather than by
get-IPO-quick Internet start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Largely because of the affinity that hackers have typically had
for spicy Sichuan cuisine, Hsi-Nan was a magnet that drew the
nation's computer elite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still find myself lusting after Louie's crab with black bean
sauce,'' said Mark Mannasse, a computer researcher at a Compaq
Computer laboratory in Palo Alto.
</P>
<P>
   At the lunch Wednesday, at Kao's pizza parlor in Redwood City,
where he prepared Chinese dishes for his guests, there was some
debate about just what the connection between computer hacking and
Chinese food actually is.
</P>
<P>
   Several people believed it was simply a consequence of the fact
that Chinese restaurants are open late, matching the late-night
culinary habits of hackers _ a group obsessed with completely
understanding, exploring and controlling the computers they design,
often working deep into the night.
</P>
<P>
   Others believed that the mysteries of a Chinese restaurant menu
were akin to the complexities of a computer's instruction set,
driving hackers to explore and experiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chinese food was made for the hackers,'' said Steven Levy,
author of the 1984 book ``Hackers: Heroes of the Computer
Revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They were open late at night,'' Levy said of Chinese
restaurants, ``and they had menus that were complex yet logical, so
that the mysteries that most people never crack at a Chinese
restaurant were a reward for a hacker.''
</P>
<P>
   Kao had his own explanation. ``These people appreciate what I
do,'' he said. ``They have taste buds for gourmet food.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Mannasse said, such were the mystical powers of
Kao's meals _ dishes like ant-climb-tree, eggplant in hot garlic
sauce, orange peel chicken, pickled cucumber _ that they go a long
way toward explaining the chemistry of Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   One of Kao's dishes, made with zucchini, was so hot, Mannasse
remembered, that it was referred to as ``zukes and nukes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're eating spicy food, and you can't help but talk
loudly,'' he said. ``As a result, ideas were passed around, and
that explains the valley.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jeff Rubin, a systems programmer at Stanford's Artificial
Intelligence Laboratory, even worked for Kao as a waiter in
exchange for Chinese lessons. Which is why Mark Seiden, a veteran
programmer, remembers one day when a manager of the lab came to
lunch with a Digital Equipment salesman.
</P>
<P>
   At one point the two were arguing about a technical detail, and
the manager called a halt to the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no point in arguing,'' he said. ``We can settle this
very easily. Let's ask the waiter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you tell us about the cache on the KL 10?'' the lab
manager asked Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a 32K two-way set associative cache,'' he replied, and
then walked away, leaving the salesman's mouth hanging open.

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 224.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 10 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: TRANSIT
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday failed to pass a measure that would have
cut close to $300 million in transit funding for New York and
California by limiting how much transit money each state is
allotted. With a vote of 49-49, the measure failed to garner the 60
votes needed to bring the bill to the floor. Supporters of the
measure said it was unfair that California and New York get
significantly more transit money just because they have more
transit riders. Opponents said the measure discriminated against
the two states. A ``yes'' vote favors redistributing the transit
funds.

   2) BILL NUMBER: DRAFT
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday rejected, 187-232, a measure that would
have restored funding for the Selective Service System, which
requires all men at the age of 18 to register for a potential
draft. Supporters of restoring the funding said reserves need to be
on hand in case a war breaks out. Opponents called the system a
relic from days when wars were more likely to happen. A ``yes''
vote favors funding the draft system.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: SPACE
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday rejected, 298-121, a measure that would
have eliminated funding for the NASA space station. Supporters of
cutting the funding said the space station was too expensive and
that the money should go toward other programs. Opponents said the
space station will provide for vital research and business
opportunities. A ``yes'' vote supports eliminating the space
station.
</P>
<P>
   4) BILL NUMBER: VA-HUD
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday approved, 235-187, a $92 billion spending
bill that allots funding for housing, veterans, science and
environmental programs. While the bill includes a $1.7 billion
raise for veterans medical care, it was criticized for cutting
funding for various housing programs. Supporters said the bill
provides adequate funding while staying within the constraints of a
balanced budget. Opponents, including President Clinton, said the
bill shortchanges American citizens. A ``yes'' vote favors the
spending bill.

 &HT;    Bradley confirms opposition to school vouchers in Iowa
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWTON, Iowa _ Shifting course on the controversial subject of
school vouchers, presidential candidate Bill Bradley said Friday
that he would not support using government subsidies for private
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley acknowledged that as a senator from New Jersey he had
voted for pilot voucher programs, and he defended those votes as an
``experimental'' way to help poor, urban school districts in his
home state.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Bradley told a group in Ottumwa that he
would seek legislative changes to allow greater anti-trust
oversight of the hog and cattle industries.
</P>
<P>
   Both positions should appeal to Democratic primary voters,
particularly in Iowa. Vouchers are vigorously opposed by the
teacher's unions, a core constituency of the Democratic Party, and
hog farming is a huge issue in Iowa, the largest pork producing
state in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's comments about school vouchers came at a luncheon and
in response to a question from the wife of a member of the local
school board.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not in support of school vouchers as the answer to the
problems of public education in our country,'' Bradley told Jamie
Swaim. ``There are 6 or 7 million kids in private school. There are
47 million kids in public school. It would be preposterous to say
that the answer for the 47 million kids is to build a separate
school system, particularly since the private schools are at
roughly 85 percent capacity.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked later if, as president, he would sign legislation that
provided for school vouchers, Bradley said he would not. But he
appeared to give himself a little room. He noted that both
Milwaukee and Cleveland have voucher programs in their school
districts. He said he would not endorse voucher legislation ``until
we get the results of these experiments.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said that as a senator he had been opposed to vouchers
for the first 13 of his 18 years in the Senate. But then he grew
concerned about the parents of children in poor school districts
who repeatedly pressed him about the inferior quality of their
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``So after 13 years ... I thought well, no, why don't we try an
experiment,'' Bradley said. None of the bills Bradley voted for
ever became law. Vice President Gore also opposes vouchers, but
Gore never voted for any of the pilot programs while a senator from
Tennessee. Most Republican candidates for president support some
form of vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   On the issue of hog farming, Bradley responded to a question
about the recent merger of Virginia-based Smithfield Foods, the
nation's largest pork producer, and Murphy Family Farms in North
Carolina, the largest hog producer in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said he would transfer anti-trust oversight of such
mergers from the Department of Agriculture to the Justice
Department and put some ``teeth'' into the Packers and Stockyards
Act, which regulates the hog industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very clear to me that ... ownership concentration ... is
making one price for family farms and another price for large hog
producers,'' Bradley said. ``We need to look at that not just in
the United States but also the world so that competition, which we
all believe in, actually produces a better result for consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day at a speech to students at Grinnell College,
Bradley said he would support adding sexual orientation into the
rights covered under the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964. While
opposing same-sex marriages, Bradley said he supported domestic
partnership initiatives aimed at allowing gay and lesbian couples
to have health insurance benefits.

SUPPORTERS OF DRIVE TO RESHAPE VENEZUELA MAKE A RETREAT

<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela _ Two weeks into a political crisis here, the
assembly that was elected to draw up a new constitution is backing
away from further confrontations with rival institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Stung by criticisms here and abroad that it has neglected its
real duties and is trying to concentrate power in its own hands,
the Constitutional Assembly has concluded an agreement that calls
for limited ``coexistence'' with the opposition-controlled
Congress, which it stripped of its powers in late August.
</P>
<P>
   Similar efforts are also under way to avert new clashes with
judicial and local officials whom the panel had vowed to supplant.
</P>
<P>
   All real power in this South American nation of 23 million
people, which has the largest oil reserves outside the Middle East,
continues to reside in the hands of President Hugo Chavez and his
followers in the Assembly. But the face-saving solution reached
Thursday night permits at least the appearance of what is known
here as ``institutional normality,'' allowing the Congress to
reconvene in October and to remain in session until the new
constitution is approved in a referendum.
</P>
<P>
   The retreat from confrontation has clear tactical advantages for
the Chavez forces. Chavez, 45, a former army colonel, plans to
travel to the United Nations and the United States later in
September, and the truce reduces the likelihood that groups ranging
from Wall Street investors to human rights advocates will pester
him with questions about what they have described as disturbing
breaches in the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the moment for an aggressive discourse,'' said
William Lara, a member of the assembly and a leader of Chavez's
Fifth Republic Movement.
</P>
<P>
   The 131-member Assembly, where the president's supporters
control more than 120 seats, was elected July 25 and given six
months to draw up a new constitution, which would be the 26th in
Venezuela's turbulent history. But even before the assembly
convened, delegates began insisting that they had supreme and
unlimited powers, including the authority to ``restructure'' all
state organs.
</P>
<P>
   In early August, they declared a ``judicial emergency,'' seizing
control of a court system that had been widely criticized as
corrupt and inefficient. After the chief justice of the Supreme
Court resigned in protest, they next moved against the national and
state legislatures, declaring a ``legislative emergency,''
divesting them of their power to pass laws and ordering them not to
meet.
</P>
<P>
   But when eight judges were dismissed this week, the Assembly
took pains to say that it had not made the decision unilaterally.
Instead, the action was attributed to the Judiciary Council, which
existed long before the emergency declaration.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly leaders have also reduced the body's plenary sessions
from three to one a week. The cutback in these sessions, which have
given delegates unusual opportunities for fiery speechmaking on
live television, followed a cascade of complaints that after more
than a month of deliberations, the assembly has failed to make
public any of the constitution's text, aside from a draft of the
preamble.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, assembly leaders appear inclined to put off
declaring an ``executive emergency'' that would allow them to
dismiss the country's 23 governors and more than 300 mayors and
replace them with ``regional councils.'' The assembly seems to be
moving toward a much more limited edict to examine the officials'
performance and dismiss only those found guilty of corruption or
malfeasance.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Chavez's more radical followers argue that, having taken
control of the legislative and judicial branches, it would be
illogical for the assembly not to move against the executive
branch. But William Davila, governor of the state of Merida and
president of the Venezuelan Association of Governors, said his
group has been assured that there will be no mass dismissals.
</P>
<P>
   There has been widespread popular support for the assembly's
actions against Congress and the courts, institutions that were
largely discredited. But mayors and governors have local followings
and power bases, and have vowed to resist any impinging on their
functions.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference here this week, Chavez said that he was
satisfied with the pace of the assembly's deliberations, saying
``it took a long time to demolish this country and it will take a
long time to rebuild it.'' But he expressed little enthusiasm for
an executive emergency decree, saying that would be ``pouring it on
a bit'' and noting that a special law already gives him
extraordinary powers.

A BATTLE WITH MOSQUITOES AND PUBLIC PANIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stephen Athineos, the manager of a bike messenger
service in Manhattan, is perfectly clear on two things. The first
is that the current threat of the St. Louis encephalitis outbreak
is a total fabrication of city officials. The second is that they
ought to be doing a much better job of containing it.
</P>
<P>
   This attitude underscores the fine line that Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani must walk. Both the mayor and health officials are
challenged to appear extremely aggressive at controlling the
illness, which has claimed the lives of three people, while at the
same time quelling public hysteria.
</P>
<P>
   A day after helicopters clattered ominously above the city
spraying insecticide to kill the mosquitoes that spread the
disease, Giuliani held a press conference Friday in which he
convivially chided reporters for failing to protect their feet from
insects bites with socks. Vans with bull horns have crawled down
city streets bellowing public health warnings, but along those same
streets, city officials also set up command centers to provide
information to a nervous public with a decidedly folksier touch.
</P>
<P>
   And scores of city officials have also taken over phone banks to
take inquiries from nervous citizens, where the number of calls
since the outbreak emerged a week ago have far outnumbered the
amount ever received by the mayor's Office of Emergency Management
since its inception in 1996, sometimes clocking 800 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is absolutely difficult to strike the balance between
providing the public with all the information they need to know
while at the same time not creating undue concern or panic,'' said
Neal Cohen, commissioner of the city health department. He added
that for this reason, the encephalitis outbreak has been one of the
most difficult public health crises in his career.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a severe outbreak of E. coli, linked to a
county fair in upstate New York, has state health officials working
overtime to inform and assist a worried public. Officials believe
that heavy rain washed cow feces into an aquifer from a farm near
the fairgrounds in Washington County. From the aquifer, they
believe, it flowed into a well supplying the fair. As of Friday
evening, one child had died, 611 people were suspected of being
infected, with 85 cases confirmed and 58 people hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   State health officials said they believed the outbreak of
primary infection had peaked last week.
</P>
<P>
   But the problem in the city is more complex, in part because of
the illness itself, which is extremely hard to diagnosis. Its
symptoms are very much like those of flu and a common form of
meningitis.
</P>
<P>
   Further, it is not curable; only the symptoms can be treated.
While this is hardly a problem for mild cases, it raises the level
of fear about getting sick. Health officials say that babies and
the elderly are at greatest risk. And while the illness at first
seemed to be contained to Queens, there have now been reports of
possible cases across the city, lending the illness an appearance
of being out of control, even though the chance of contracting it
is slim. And while not a single child has died, parents do not seem
to be able to keep themselves from fretting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that it is a citywide issue that doesn't target one
community or one population makes it more frightening to the
public,'' Cohen said. ``A good part of what we are doing now is
assuring the public that the threat and risks are very minimal
given what we know about exposure.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And then there is the mayor himself, who seems to be struggling
at times to let the public know that everything is under control
with this major health scare while at the same time telling them
that the scare is perhaps not so big. At the news conference
Friday, he chided reporters for botching facts and inciting fear,
but at the same time pressed them to remind the people to douse
themselves with insect repellent, a point he underscored by giving
himself a little spray during his comments. He has insisted there
is no health threat connected to the city's spraying efforts, a
point many experts and the Environmental Protection Agency agree
with. But then Giuliani hinted that people might want to shut a
window or two.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some New Yorkers have turned their fears away from
mosquitoes and toward the chemicals being used to combat them.
``We're upset about the reality of the mosquito problem, but I
don't believe the chemical is totally harmless,'' said Eve Logan,
who lives on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Kaplan, who lives in the Park Slope area of Brooklyn,
echoed the fear. ``I give my children only organic fruits and
vegetables and now they're spraying everywhere,'' said Ms. Kaplan,
who is seven months pregnant and has twin 2-year-olds. ``I don't
trust that they know what they're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people, like Athineos, who manages Mother's Messengers,
seem to see things both ways. ``The politicians have promoted
hysteria,'' he said. But he quickly added that the city should have
been more aggressive with its insecticide spraying up front.
``Basically if you have one case, you should spray the whole
city.''

   The Prospectus, In Living Color &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time was, printers churned out prospectuses that were as
exciting to look at as, well, they were to read.
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, times change. Consider Webstakes.com, an online
sweepstakes promotion company based in New York that is circulating
a prospectus with a glossy, four-color cover in advance of its
public offering, expected in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   A flashy logo is splashed on the front of the document, which is
sent in a plastic bag. A free mouse pad, above, also emblazoned
with the Webstakes logo, is included in the package, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole world is changing as far as prospectuses are
concerned,'' said Jerry Long, a senior vice president at Global
Financial Press, the New York printer responsible for the Webstakes
document. ``There's been a new generation of creativity.''
</P>
<P>
   The movement towards slick, even gimmicky, prospectuses with
gatefolds and freebies has been gathering steam over the last year
and a half, a function of the robust volume of public stock
offerings. Such documents offer a way for a company to stand out
from myriad competing offerings, according to printing company
executives.
</P>
<P>
   Internet companies, in particular, view the prospectus as a way
to show off their creative talents, which are presumably of higher
quality than many of their profit-and-loss statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``These companies have an attitude and they want to
differentiate themselves from the average issuer of financial
paper,'' said John B. Jackson, an executive at Bowne &AMP; Co., which
included a 20-track music CD in its prospectus for MP3.com, an
online music retailer. In August, Bowne installed a 10-color press
at its Toronto plant to handle fancier prospectuses.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission, which must approve
prospectuses, has little problem with the trend. An SEC spokesman,
John Heine, said, ``Generally, as long as they've met our
disclosure requirements, that's what we're concerned about.'' &QL;

   FUNDS WATCH &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Celebrity Web Site For Gauging Fund Costs &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So how much does it really cost to own that sizzling technology
stock fund? And what will it cost you down the road?
</P>
<P>
   A new Web site, marketed by Andrew Tobias, the personal-finance
author, furnishes answers.
</P>
<P>
   The site, www.personalfund.com, is operated by Personal Fund
Inc., a San Francisco firm of which Tobias is part-owner. It
invites users to enter the name of most any fund into a cost
calculator and see how fees, transaction and distribution costs, as
well as taxes, can eat into returns, both past and future. In
projecting returns, the calculator allows users to adjust for a
range of variables, from the amount invested to tax rates to
expected annual return.
</P>
<P>
   The results are instructive. Consider this example: You tell the
computer that you've invested $10,000 in the investor class shares
of the American Century Ultra fund, and that your combined marginal
tax rate is 35 percent for ordinary income and 24 percent for
long-term capital gains. You expect an annual return of 12 percent
and you're looking at an investment period of 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Right off the bat, the calculator says that for the 12 months
ended June 30, you would have paid $484 of your $10,000 investment
in costs of one sort or another _ $122 for transaction costs, $110
for fund management and $252 in taxes. That compares with total
costs of just $42 for a $10,000 investment in the Vanguard
Tax-Managed Capital Appreciation fund, $65 in the State Farm Growth
fund, $80 in the Chestnut Street Exchange fund and $99 for the
Capital Exchange fund.
</P>
<P>
   The calculator also tells you what after-tax returns of the
funds were for the 12 months ended June 30, but its most
interesting feature is its projections of the future values of your
holdings. Assuming that costs and a 12 percent return remain
constant, the calculator figures that an investor would end up with
$87,149 after 30 years in the American Century fund, compared with
$270,961 in the Vanguard one.
</P>
<P>
   The State Farm, Chestnut Street, and Capital Exchange investors
would end up with $255,127, $244,671 and $233,704, respectively,
given the same assumptions.
</P>
<P>
   What does Tobias get out of the deal? ``The lofty purpose is I'd
like to see investors do as well as they can,'' he said. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Reversing course, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott
said Friday that he now supports holding hearings this fall on a
stalled treaty to ban nuclear testing and will try to have them
scheduled soon.
</P>
<P>
   But Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms, R-N.C.,
signaled through his aides that he would rebuff the request.
</P>
<P>
   Lott opposes the treaty and has supported Helms, who is locked
in a fight with the administration over two other treaties that
Helms wants to kill before even dealing with the nuclear pact.
</P>
<P>
   But the nuclear treaty's chief backer in the Senate, Byron
Dorgan, D-N.D., announced in the Senate on Wednesday that he would
``plant myself on the floor like a potted plant and object'' if
opponents bottled up the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Facing the threat of procedural chaos, Lott told Dorgan on the
floor Friday that he would discuss a hearing schedule next week
with Helms.
</P>
<P>
   But he also hinted that he might fail. ``I have done what I can
do at this point in terms of suggesting that hearings be in
order,'' Lott said.

9 PERCENT OF PUBLIC STATIONS SHARED DONOR LISTS, AUDITORS SAY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La.)  (jw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nearly twice as many public television and radio
stations as previously thought have swapped their donor lists with
political organizations, according to a report by auditors of the
Corporation for Public Broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the broadcasting group told a congressional panel
in July that at least 28 stations had sold or swapped their donor
lists with political organizations, most of them Democratic. The
corporation's inspector general said in a report issued late
Thursday that 53 of the nation's 591 public stations, or 9 percent,
had given their lists to political organizations. This included 29
television stations and 24 radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   List swapping is a routine practice among thousands of
organizations that seek to raise money. But the disclosure a few
months ago that public stations, which rely on some federal money
and provide news coverage for their audiences, had had such a cozy
relationship with the Democratic National Committee in particular
raised the ire of many in Congress, and not just Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has threatened to reduce federal money allocated to the
Corporation for Public Broadcasting in next year's budget. The
federal government now provides about 15 percent of public
television's $2 billion annual budget. In the next fiscal year,
which starts on Oct. 1, the corporation had sought more than $210
million, a 15 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has yet to set the new levels, but the office of Rep.
W.J. ``Billy'' Tauzin, R-La., who is chairman of the
Telecommunications Subcommittee of the House Commerce Committee and
is usually a sympathizer with public broadcasting, said he would
not recommend that much.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've lost some political capital because of the
list-swapping scandal, and they won't be in line for any kind of
double-digit increase,'' Ken Johnson, a spokesman for Tauzin, said
Friday. ``They've lost their bargaining power.''

   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov of Russia
said here on Friday that a team of Russian law enforcement
officials would arrive in Washington next week, in an effort to
prove Moscow's eagerness to cooperate with American inquiries into
money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met for two
hours at the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-Operation forum Friday night,
and Russian corruption and its effect on the international
financial system were high on the agenda, an aide to Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov called her last week offering to send the Russian law
enforcement officials, saying at the time that the idea came from
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   American law enforcement officials have said that at least $4.2
billion passed through accounts at the Bank of New York between
early 1998 and March 1999, and that as much as $10 billion may have
moved through these accounts in the last 18 months. Investigators
believe the money was tied to organized crime and corporate
embezzlement in Russia.

 &HT;    Official willing to re-examine how Branch Davidians died
 &HT;    By Tommy Witherspoon and Mark England
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Tarrant County Medical Examiner Dr. Nizam Peerwani
said Friday he would welcome the chance to re-open his
investigation into how the Branch Davidians died.
</P>
<P>
   Peerwani of Fort Worth headed the team that performed autopsies
on David Koresh and 75 followers, including 21 children, found dead
after a fire ravaged Mount Carmel on April 19, 1993. The autopsies
were done at the request of four McLennan County justices of the
peace.
</P>
<P>
   Peerwani said he thinks the pressing question is where the 23
Davidians who died from bullet wounds were when they got shot. It
may be possible to determine whether any Davidian was shot by
someone outside the compound building, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a feeling that one should go back and re-evaluate ...
The focus at the time was not whether the FBI was doing the
shooting,'' Peerwani said.
</P>
<P>
   Did the bullets go through an ``intermediary target, like a wall
or door, before striking these people?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have sufficient photographs and other materials for us to
review these issues. I have not started this, but I would certainly
do so if asked by the proper authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice of the Peace David Pareya of West said he has lingering
questions about how the 20 Davidians for whom he conducted inquests
died. For one thing, Pareya said, he had no choice but to rule the
cause of death for many Davidians as unknown because the FBI would
not supply him with the results of the ballistics tests.
</P>
<P>
   Peerwani's office did some ballistics testing, but it turned the
results over to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Pareya said he and three other McLennan County justices of the
peace tried for five months to get the FBI to supply them with the
ballistics tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that always stayed in my mind was if they were
afraid some of the ordnance or ballistics could be matched up with
their weaponry,'' said Pareya.
</P>
<P>
   The Davidians had thousands of rounds of ammunition stored at
Mount Carmel. Peerwani, though, said flatly that the rounds that
exploded in the fire, while inflicting damage on some bodies, did
not cause the death of any Davidian listed as being shot and
killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They died as a result of gunshot wounds and, in most cases,
the bullets entered and left the body,'' Peerwani said.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, he said, he remembers recovering from a body only
one bullet with rifling marks indicating it had been fired. The
bullet was a 9 mm round.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said within days of the fire that some Davidians may
have died from self-inflicted gunshot wounds. However, Dr. Marc
Krouse, who assisted Peerwani in performing the Davidian autopsies,
said one woman was definitely shot and killed by someone else. She
had a chest wound, tracking from back to front.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a well-defined wound track from a high-velocity weapon,
like an AK-47 or something like that,'' Krouse said.
</P>
<P>
   Peerwani said the authorization to review how the Davidians died
could come from several jurisdictions. Attorney General Janet Reno
this week named retired Sen. John Danforth to investigate FBI
actions at the compound.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone is waiting for the special counsel to get
started,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A Department of Justice spokesman declined Friday to
specifically address Peerwani's statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can say is the attorney general certainly wants answers
to the questions being raised,'' Myron Marlin said. ``That's why
she appointed a special counsel.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the ballistics evidence may be in the hands of the Texas
Rangers, according to Krouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Rangers took everything,'' Krouse said. ``I don't
remember for sure. We were just trying to survive. `Stay low and
keep moving' was my motto back then. It was a big, bad task, and we
were trying to get through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Trying to determine where the Davidians died would be easier if
the Tarrant County Medical Examiner's office could get back a video
it recorded at the destroyed compound pinpointing where each body
was found, Peerwani said. The video was turned over to the Justice
Department at its request. That was the last time Peerwani saw it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were told that they had misplaced the tape,'' Peerwani
said.
</P>
<P>
   His office would have to depend on photographs and diagrams
taken after the fire at Mount Carmel to figure out where the
Davidians were at the time of death, said Peerwani, who hasn't
looked at the Davidian file since testifying at the 1994 criminal
trial of 11 Davidians in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Peerwani cautioned there are limits to what he can investigate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I can say if a bullet went through an intermediary
target and things like that,'' Peerwani said. ``Beyond that, things
have to stop. Deciding who shot whom is absolutely part of a
criminal investigation, and it falls outside the purview of a
medical examiner's duties.''

   ``We have sufficient photographs and other materials for us to
review these issues. I have not started this, but I would certainly
do so if asked by the proper authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice of the Peace David Pareya of West said he has lingering
questions about how the 20 Davidians for whom he conducted inquests
died. For one thing, Pareya said, he had no choice but to rule the
cause of death for many Davidians as unknown because the FBI would
not supply him with the results of the ballistics tests.
</P>
<P>
   Peerwani's office did some ballistics testing, but it turned the
results over to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Pareya said he and three other McLennan County justices of the
peace tried for five months to get the FBI to supply them with the
ballistics tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that always stayed in my mind was if they were
afraid some of the ordnance or ballistics could be matched up with
their weaponry,'' said Pareya.
</P>
<P>
   The Davidians had thousands of rounds of ammunition stored at
Mount Carmel. Peerwani, though, said flatly that the rounds that
exploded in the fire, while inflicting damage on some bodies, did
not cause the death of any Davidian listed as being shot and
killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They died as a result of gunshot wounds and, in most cases,
the bullets entered and left the body,'' Peerwani said.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, he said, he remembers recovering from a body only
one bullet with rifling marks indicating it had been fired. The
bullet was a 9 mm round.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said within days of the fire that some Davidians may
have died from self-inflicted gunshot wounds. However, Dr. Marc
Krouse, who assisted Peerwani in performing the Davidian autopsies,
said one woman was definitely shot and killed by someone else. She
had a chest wound, tracking from back to front.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a well-defined wound track from a high-velocity weapon,
like an AK-47 or something like that,'' Krouse said.
</P>
<P>
   Peerwani said the authorization to review how the Davidians died
could come from several jurisdictions. Attorney General Janet Reno
this week named retired Sen. John Danforth to investigate FBI
actions at the compound.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone is waiting for the special counsel to get
started,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A Department of Justice spokesman declined Friday to
specifically address Peerwani's statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can say is the attorney general certainly wants answers
to the questions being raised,'' Myron Marlin said. ``That's why
she appointed a special counsel.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the ballistics evidence may be in the hands of the Texas
Rangers, according to Krouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Rangers took everything,'' Krouse said. ``I don't
remember for sure. We were just trying to survive. `Stay low and
keep moving' was my motto back then. It was a big, bad task, and we
were trying to get through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Trying to determine where the Davidians died would be easier if
the Tarrant County Medical Examiner's office could get back a video
it recorded at the destroyed compound pinpointing where each body
was found, Peerwani said. The video was turned over to the Justice
Department at its request. That was the last time Peerwani saw it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were told that they had misplaced the tape,'' Peerwani
said.
</P>
<P>
   His office would have to depend on photographs and diagrams
taken after the fire at Mount Carmel to figure out where the
Davidians were at the time of death, said Peerwani, who hasn't
looked at the Davidian file since testifying at the 1994 criminal
trial of 11 Davidians in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Peerwani cautioned there are limits to what he can investigate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I can say if a bullet went through an intermediary
target and things like that,'' Peerwani said. ``Beyond that, things
have to stop. Deciding who shot whom is absolutely part of a
criminal investigation, and it falls outside the purview of a
medical examiner's duties.''

SUPREME COURT JUSTICES GET EARLY START, ADDING SEVERAL CASES
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seeking to fill in the blank spots on a sparse
docket, the Supreme Court jumped the gun on its new term by more
than three weeks Friday by accepting a half dozen new cases,
including a significant federal-state dispute over safety
regulations for oil tankers.
</P>
<P>
   The justices' unusual action brought to 35 the number of cases
they have agreed to review during the term that begins formally on
Oct. 4. More cases are likely to be added later this month and
throughout the fall and early winter. In the term that ended in
June, the court decided 75 cases.
</P>
<P>
   None of the cases on Friday's list came close to matching the
potential importance of the cases the court had already granted, on
heavily freighted subjects like federalism, campaign spending and
federal aid to parochial schools.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the new cases exemplified the kind of bread-and-butter
disputes that the justices could easily agree, without extended
discussion. The justices, several of whom have not yet returned to
Washington from the summer recess, did not meet in person but
evidently communicated by memo or telephone, as they did earlier
this month when they intervened two hours before a scheduled
execution to add a Virginia death row inmate's appeal to their
docket.
</P>
<P>
   The urgency this time was not an imminent execution, but the
prospect of a week in December that was scheduled for arguments but
that had no cases. Had the justices waited several weeks before
granting these cases, the lawyers would not have had time to
prepare their briefs in time for the December session.
</P>
<P>
   The oil tanker case, United States vs. Locke, No. 98-1701, is
the latest round in a decades-old dispute between the federal
government and the state of Washington over whether the state can
impose safety and environmental regulations on ships entering its
ports that go beyond the requirements of federal regulations and of
international agreements to which the United States is a party.
</P>
<P>
   The current phase of this case began in 1991 when, in response
to the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska two years earlier, the
Washington Legislature passed a law intended to prevent a similar
environmental catastrophe by imposing strict safety standards on
tankers traveling through the state's waters.
</P>
<P>
   A number of the requirements exceeded those under federal
regulations. For example, the state required the presence of three
licensed deck officers at certain times, instead of the two
required under Coast Guard regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The state also required a higher level of English language
proficiency among a ship's officers and imposed requirements for
alcohol and drug testing beyond those contained in the standards of
either the federal government or of other countries whose ships
travel in Washington's waters.
</P>
<P>
   The state regulations were challenged unsuccessfully in U.S.
District Court by the International Association of Independent
Tanker Owners, a trade association known as Intertanko. It argued
that because tanker safety was governed by federal law and
international treaties, any nonconforming state requirements were
pre-empted.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government joined the case on appeal, making the
same pre-emption arguments as Intertanko with little more success
before the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco.
The appeals court ruled last year that while several state
regulations related to equipment were pre-empted, those dealing
with staffing, training and the operation of the ships were not.
</P>
<P>
   Noting in its Supreme Court appeal that a dozen countries have
filed formal diplomatic protests of the state regulations, the
government told the justices that Washington's actions have
undermined the ``principle of reciprocity'' under which countries
accept other nation's ships that are certified in compliance with
international rules.
</P>
<P>
   The government said the Ninth Circuit's decision ``also
substantially undermines the ability of the United States to speak
with one voice in international negotiations to promote tanker
safety and environmental protection.''
</P>
<P>
   These were among the other cases the Court granted Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Air Bag Lawsuits
</P>
<P>
   In another case raising a question of the pre-emption of state
law, the court agreed to decide whether automobile manufacturers
could be sued for having failed to provide air bags during the
period when federal law permitted, but did not require, the
installation of air bags or other passive restraints.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in 1986, manufacturers had the option of installing
air bags on the driver's side. The air bags became mandatory on the
driver's side for cars manufactured after Sept. 1, 1987; air bags
became mandatory on the front passenger side in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   There have been many lawsuits growing out of accidents in cars
manufactured during those years, with plaintiffs arguing that it
was negligent for manufacturers not to have exercised the option of
greater safety. The state and lower federal courts have been in
wide disarray on whether imposing liability on this basis conflicts
with the overall intent of federal regulation in the area of
automobile safety.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, Geier vs. American Honda Motor Co., No. 98-1811, a
woman driving a 1987 Honda crashed into a tree in Washington, D.C.,
while wearing a lap belt and shoulder harness. The car did not have
an air bag, and she suffered serious head injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Both the U.S. District Court and the U.S. Court of Appeals here
dismissed her lawsuit on the ground that because air bags were
simply an option for this car and others made before Sept. 1, 1987,
local tort law could not be invoked to make them, in effect,
mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   Freedom of Information
</P>
<P>
   Accepting an appeal from the federal government, the court
agreed to decide an unusual case involving the intersection of the
Freedom of Information Act and foreign policy. A lawyer
representing a British woman who had been extradited from England
to stand trial in the United States for conspiracy to murder a
federal prosecutor sought the release of a letter the British Home
Office had sent to the State Department concerning the extradition.
</P>
<P>
   When the British government objected to the release, the State
Department classified the letter as ``confidential,'' bringing it
within a provision of the Freedom of Information Act exempting
classified material from routine disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, Leslie R. Weatherhead, brought a lawsuit under the
act. The Ninth Circuit ordered the document released in a 1998
ruling that said the government had not provided adequate evidence
of the damage that disclosure would cause to national security.
</P>
<P>
   The question for the Supreme Court in the case, United States
vs. Weatherhead, No. 98-1904, is what degree of deference a court
should give to the State Department's assessment of the damage that
would result from disclosing a foreign government's document.
Because the Ninth Circuit granted a stay of its decision, the
letter has still not been released and its contents were not
described in the briefs filed with the case.

AT AOL, A NEW BRAIN FOR FORWARD THINKING
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Calif., Ill., Mass.)  (jw) 
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Marc Andreessen, who became an icon of the Internet age as a
co-founder of Netscape Communication Corp. before it was acquired
by America Online last year, is stepping down after seven months as
America Online's chief technology officer, the company said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In his place, the company hired William Raduchel, the chief
strategist of Sun Microsystems.
</P>
<P>
   The chief technology officer's job at America Online is not to
run its vast computer network, but to plan a network of the future
that will connect not only to computers but to telephones,
televisions and all manner of new gadgets.
</P>
<P>
   Raduchel's background may fill the bill better than
Andreessen's. He has been very involved in Sun's Internet strategy
and forging alliances with other big companies, including Fujitsu,
Sony and more recently America Online. Moreover, Raduchel, a
53-year-old former Harvard professor and veteran technology
executive, may be more suited to the ways of America Online, where
executives tend to be in their late 30s and 40s, than the
28-year-old Andreessen, who was a student before forming Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, when Andreessen took the job at America Online in
February, it was seen as a sign that the sprawling company in
Dulles, Va., was reaching out to former Netscape employees and to
Silicon Valley in general. As one of the inventors of the Internet
browser at 23, Andreessen was among the first of the young
entrepreneurs who were changing the world _ and getting rich _
building the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   But Andreessen said he figured out that he would rather be
investing in and working with new companies rather than attending
meetings about corporate strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``America Online's mission is to bring the Internet to everyone
and to accomplish that mission is clearly a matter of size and
scale,'' he said. ``Start-ups have a different role. They are about
breaking the rules and trying new things that might fail or might
change the world.''
</P>
<P>
   So he has arranged a part-time position with America Online that
will allow him to make personal investments in start-up companies
as well as advising America Online about investing in or acquiring
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at all the creativity in the start-up world and it's
like white water rafting,'' Andreessen said. ``You can't tell
what's going on from the shore. You have to be in the middle of the
rapids.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, Andreessen has made personal investments in
Replay, a company that makes digital video recorders, and
Accompany, an online store. But he says his new role will give him
the time to serve on more boards and work more closely with
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor that was not endearing about his new job,
Andreessen conceded, was the Virginia heat: his English bulldogs
could not take it, and he had to send them back to his home in Palo
Alto.
</P>
<P>
   Andreessen was the last America Online employee among the small
group of engineers from the University of Illinois who founded
Netscape along with Jim Clark, the founder of Silicon Graphics.
Indeed, of the top seven executives at Netscape at the time of the
acquisition in November, only one is still working for the company
full time. Barry Ariko, Netscape's chief operating officer, is the
No. 2 executive in Iplanet, the joint venture between America
Online and Sun to sell software that runs web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Raduchel was one of the top four executives at Sun and has
served over the last 10 years as its chief financial officer and
its chief information officer.
</P>
<P>
   He said that like Andreessen he had been considering investing
in or working for start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had already told Scott that I wanted to look at doing
something different after 10 years on the inside as a staff guy,''
Raduchel said, referring to Scott McNealy, Sun's chairman, who was
one of his economics students at Harvard. But then Steve Case,
America Online's chairman, heard that Raduchel was considering
leaving Sun and just two weeks ago called him to offer him
Andreessen's job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't planning to take another job like I had,'' Raduchel
said. ``But I realized I enjoy the leverage that big companies give
me. You can paint on a three-by-five card in your house or you can
paint on a billboard in Times Square. And that's what I'd rather
do.''

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 224.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 10 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: TRANSIT
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday failed to pass a measure that would have
cut close to $300 million in transit funding for New York and
California by limiting how much transit money each state is
allotted. With a vote of 49-49, the measure failed to garner the 60
votes needed to bring the bill to the floor. Supporters of the
measure said it was unfair that California and New York get
significantly more transit money just because they have more
transit riders. Opponents said the measure discriminated against
the two states. A ``yes'' vote favors redistributing the transit
funds.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   HOUSE VOTES:

<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: DRAFT
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday rejected, 187-232, a measure that would
have restored funding for the Selective Service System, which
requires all men at the age of 18 to register for a potential
draft. Supporters of restoring the funding said reserves need to be
on hand in case a war breaks out. Opponents called the system a
relic from days when wars were more likely to happen. A ``yes''
vote favors funding the draft system.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: SPACE
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday rejected, 298-121, a measure that would
have eliminated funding for the NASA space station. Supporters of
cutting the funding said the space station was too expensive and
that the money should go toward other programs. Opponents said the
space station will provide for vital research and business
opportunities. A ``yes'' vote supports eliminating the space
station.
</P>
<P>
   4) BILL NUMBER: VA-HUD
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday approved, 235-187, a $92 billion spending
bill that allots funding for housing, veterans, science and
environmental programs. While the bill includes a $1.7 billion
raise for veterans medical care, it was criticized for cutting
funding for various housing programs. Supporters said the bill
provides adequate funding while staying within the constraints of a
balanced budget. Opponents, including President Clinton, said the
bill shortchanges American citizens. A ``yes'' vote favors the
spending bill.

<P>
   SAN MANUEL, Ariz. _ Thousands of feet below the scrub and cactus
near this copper town is an unusual silence. The din of pneumatic
hammers, conveyer belts and blasting that was music to the ears for
many miners here in the Sonoran Desert has mostly subsided.
</P>
<P>
   The San Manuel mine, one of the largest underground copper mines
in the nation, has been closed. So too has the nearby smelter that
in better times sent wisps of smoke from giant chimneys visible for
miles along the San Pedro River valley.
</P>
<P>
   A decline in copper prices has led to significant cutbacks in
the industry around the world. It has hit particularly hard in the
United States, where many of the mines are more played out and more
costly to operate than are those abroad. Over the last few months,
a string of major copper producers has announced layoffs,
reductions and closures.
</P>
<P>
   The sagging market has also prompted a wave of merger proposals
that could significantly transform the industry. A plan announced
in August by Phelps Dodge Corp. of Phoenix to consolidate with two
other companies _ Asarco Inc., based in New York, and Cyprus Amax
Minerals Co., based in Englewood, Colo. _ would create the largest
copper producer in the world. Similar slumps in other commodities,
including aluminum and paper, are forcing producers in a variety of
basic industries in join together to eliminate over-capacity in the
face of the decline in prices. But none has been hit harder than
copper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Copper has supported families for generations here in the
Southwest,'' said Dennis Duffy, a laid-off miner in San Manuel who
is training for a new career in installing computer networks and,
to help cope financially, has canceled satellite television service
at his home. ``It's sad. I hate to see jobs like mine dry up.''
</P>
<P>
   The slump began in 1997 with the financial panic and economic
downturn in Asia, a major market for copper and copper intensive
products like electrical wires, automobiles and pipes. A series of
new mine openings in South America flooded the market with copper
and depressed prices even further.
</P>
<P>
   In two years, the price of copper has tumbled nearly 50 percent
from $1.20 a pound, hitting bottom in May at 61 cents a pound, the
lowest in 12 years. The price has since increased to an average of
80 cents a pound, but that is not enough to make copper producers
in the United States reverse their retrenchments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Copper had a fairly significant run through most of the
1990s,'' said Chuck Shipley, president of the Arizona Mining
Association. ``But it really dropped over the edge in the last six
months or so.''
</P>
<P>
   The town most affected by the decline in copper prices is San
Manuel, a company town of 4,000 carved out of thorny wilderness,
about 30 miles northeast of Tucson. With nearly every job and
business here tied in some way to mining, its future is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Broken Hill Proprietary Co., the worldwide mining
concern based in Melbourne, Australia, announced that it would
close the mine and smelter in San Manuel indefinitely, putting
nearly 2,200 people out of work. An additional 400 employees were
laid off elsewhere in Arizona and Nevada, representing the
company's nearly total withdrawal from the American copper
industry.
</P>
<P>
   While there are plenty of jobs elsewhere, many ex-miners are
reluctant to pull up stakes. As a result, many have had to take
jobs around here that pay far less than the $40,000 a year or more
many made in the copper industry. Among them are Joseph Coubb, a
miner for 12 years at San Manuel, who spoke recently while taking a
break from truck-driving lessons in a dirt lot near a high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least I'll have a job,'' said Coubb, though he complained
that trucking, unlike mining, would take him away from his family
for days at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Broken Hill spokesman Jay Rhodes said the company was forced to
stop most production in the United States because it was
unprofitable at such low prices. Closing mines and laying off
workers, while unfortunate, he said, was hardly unusual in the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Copper is a cyclical business,'' Rhodes said. ``It's been one
where when the price increases, the players holding low-grade
deposits open them for production. When the cycle is down, they
have to put them on hold.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other producers with mines in Arizona, where much of the
copper in the United States is found, have also announced
reductions in their work forces. Asarco laid off 150 miners near
Green Valley, south of Tucson, and Phelps Dodge dismissed 1,650
employees at mines and factories worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The problems in the industry come as copper use is growing,
though not enough recently to offset new production. World copper
consumption has increased in 11 of the last 13 years, according to
the International Copper Study Group, with the proliferation of
cars, electrical appliances, computers, telephone lines and new
homes.
</P>
<P>
   Low copper prices have resulted in losses for producers like
Asarco and Phelps Dodge the last few quarters. But most analysts
say that such losses are not especially significant as long as
prices do not decline further over an extended period.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, by reducing production, some companies say they have put
a stop to the losses. Thomas Foster, vice president and treasurer
of Phelps Dodge, said his company was ``breaking even or doing a
little better'' now that it had trimmed money-losing production.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Over the last decade, many copper producers have tried to
increase efficiency by implementing new, cheaper mining and
smelting techniques that require fewer workers. They have also
tried to cut costs with mergers.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Asarco and Cyprus Amax announced that they intended to
join forces. No money would have been exchanged in the merger. But
then, on Aug. 20, Phelps Dodge offered to buy Asarco and Cyprus
Amax for $2.56 billion. Federal securities regulators recently
approved Phelps Dodge's plan to issue stock in the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   If that deal were approved by Asarco and Cyprus Amax
shareholders, Phelps Dodge would replace Codelco, the
government-owned mining company of Chile, as the world's largest
copper producer.
</P>
<P>
   (On Sept. 9, though, Asarco and Cyprus Amax rejected the Phelps
offer as ``inadequate and not in the best interest of their
shareholders.'' They urged shareholders instead to approve the
merger of their two companies at a meeting scheduled for Sept. 30.
In the meantime, Phelps continues to lobby shareholders in favor of
its plan.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The stronger players see the market when it is down as a time
to buy,'' said John Dobra, professor of economics and director of
the Natural Resource Industry Institute at the University of Nevada
at Reno, ``The weaker companies run for cover.''
</P>
<P>
   Though many North American mine operators have suffered in
recent months, those overseas have remained relatively prosperous.
Mines in Chile, Argentina, Peru and Indonesia, where much of the
growth in the industry is taking place, have the advantage of
higher quality ore, less stringent environmental regulations and
lower labor costs.
</P>
<P>
   For example, it can cost nearly 65 cents to produce a pound of
copper in the United States, compared with 50 cents a pound in
South America.
</P>
<P>
   To stay competitive, many producers are increasingly opening
their own mines overseas or forming partnerships with local
companies that are already there.
</P>
<P>
   But Dobra said the industry would almost certainly maintain a
significant presence in the United States, at least for the next
few decades. The cost of quickly transferring production overseas
would be too exorbitant, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Opening a mine costs hundreds of millions of dollars, no matter
where it is. Closing an existing mine in the United States costs
millions more and carries the potential for additional costs to
cover liabilities for environmental contamination.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is always the hope that the price of copper will rise
and these mines will be profitable again,'' Dobra said.
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Billick, an analyst in San Francisco who follows the metals
industry for the investment firm Warburg Dillon Read, predicted
that the price of copper would increase modestly within the next
year. With improvements in the Asian economies and the round of new
mine openings in South America nearly over, the industry has
survived the worst, he said. ``But copper,'' he added emphatically,
``is going nowhere near the bull market levels.''

   Wingate Inns InTernational wanted to hold its first chain-wide
conference in a resort big enough to accommodate 305 people for
four days, yet small enough to convey a sense of intimacy during
meals and receptions. Because the working sessions would deal with
financing, risk management and similarly unexciting topics, Wingate
also wanted a range of recreational options where guests could
unwind.
</P>
<P>
   And so it was that the owners and general managers of the 65
Wingate properties _ mid-priced hotels aimed at business travelers
_ spent four days last month at the Chateau Elan Winery and Resort
in Braselton, Ga., 30 minutes from Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the skull sessions, there were tournaments on
both of the resort's golf courses, plus opportunities to play
tennis, jog, indulge at the spa or hike the trails through the
resort's 3,100 acres.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most successful meetings,'' said John Paul Nichols, chief
executive of Wingate, a three-year-old chain and a unit of the
Cendant Corp., ``are interspersed with free time.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Seifert-Brenna, general manager of a Wingate Inn that
is scheduled to open this December in Fargo, N.D., agrees. ``During
the free time,'' she said of the conference, ``I had a lot of
one-on-one talks with corporate executives and other general
managers that I wouldn't have had time to talk with otherwise.''
She also had time to hike the trail and enter a golf tournament
that, considering her score, she would just as soon forget.
</P>
<P>
   With the American economy in its ninth consecutive year of
growth, it should be no surprise that there are more corporate
meetings, conferences, retreats and seminars than ever _ 805,000 in
the last fiscal year, compared with 580,000 two years earlier,
according to Ed Griffin, chief executive of Meeting Planners
International, a 9,000-member organization in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Economic growth, he said, means that companies are holding more
training sessions and sales meetings and offering more incentive
trips.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Moch, senior manager of corporate events for
Novo-Nordisk Phamaceuticals Inc., a Danish company with North
American headquarters in Princeton, N.J., said its sessions ``have
probably increased 50 percent in the last two years.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the spurt, Ms. Moch explained by telephone from
the Peabody Orlando hotel in Florida, where she recently was
attending yet another meeting, is that ``we found meetings more
effective for introducing and explaining new products than some of
the trade shows we regularly attended.''
</P>
<P>
   Retreats come in all shapes, sizes and price ranges, and they
aim to gather everyone from top executives based in distant lands
to employees who work together yet barely know one another.
</P>
<P>
   Next spring, for example, 30 or so top editors of Southern
Living and five other magazines owned by Time Warner are scheduled
to get together, possibly at the Sundance ski and summer resort
near Park City, Utah, to discuss common problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never done this with all the magazines at the same
time,'' said Michael Carlton, editorial director of the six
magazines, which also include Southern Accents and Coastal Living,
``but we feel this will be a good opportunity to get to know one
another better.'' Even though a number of the editors work in the
same building in Birmingham, Ala., he added, ``we don't seem to
have the time or take the time for that.''
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the best-known corporate retreat sites have been
plush resorts with manicured golf courses and well-known chefs.
They still are. But even in these prosperous times, many
budget-conscious corporations schedule their retreats during a
resort's off season, when rates fall as much as 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Golf and tennis are still the main recreational choices. At the
luxury Mauna Lani Hotel and Bungalows on the island of Hawaii,
breakfast often begins at 7 a.m. so executives can get down to
business early and be on the golf course soon after lunch.
</P>
<P>
   But with the roaring '90s minting so many young executives from
Silicon Valley to Wall Street, more active pursuits _ jogging,
hiking, horseback riding, volleyball and even hot-air ballooning
and paragliding _ are making inroads.
</P>
<P>
   Younger executives have changed the corporate retreat industry
in other ways, too. ``It used to be that Mobil would send 100
people to London or Paris for a week or more,'' said Jack Sammis,
president of International Meeting Network, a conference management
company in Arlington, Va. But the younger set, he said, ``doesn't
want to be away from their families that long.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Generation X hasn't exactly taken vows of poverty. When
the top people at Imaginary Forces _ a Hollywood design firm where
the median age of employees is 26 _ went on retreat early this
year, they headed not for the hills or countryside but for the
sidewalks of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a creative business,'' ``so it's important for us to
spend time together,'' said Peter Frankfurt, a managing partner.
</P>
<P>
   By day, the team took in the Jackson Pollock show at the Museum
of Modern Art. At bedtime, they repaired to The Mark, the small
luxury hotel on the upper East Side, where single rooms range from
$395 to $435 a night, and suites $600 to $2,500.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The hotel isn't trendy, but we like it because it's serene and
very civilized,'' said Frankfurt, 40, sounding not unlike corporate
moguls half again his age.
</P>
<P>
   Most retreats go unnoticed, except by those in attendance. But
over the years, unwanted publicity has spurred enough stockholder
anger that many companies are loath to talk about their meeting
plans.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a Fortune 500 food company that has chartered a
ship for an employee cruise in Europe next year refused to discuss
it for this article. ``Some stockholders will be sure to say the
money to pay for the cruise came out of their dividends,'' its
president explained, on the condition that neither he nor the
company was named, ``and some customers will say it came out of
their pockets in the form of higher prices for our products.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, former employees of Commercial Financial
Services Inc. of Tulsa, Okla., must be wondering if similar
generosity on the part of their company was worth the cost.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1986, CFS, as it was known, was in the business of
collecting credit-card debt, and it quickly became one of the
fastest-growing companies in America, with a payroll reaching
almost 4,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
   It was also exceedingly generous. In October 1997, the
co-founder and chief executive, William R. Bartmann, played host _
at company expense _ to 6,000 employees, spouses and friends at a
retreat in Las Vegas. At one point, he stood in a boxing ring,
dressed as Julius Caesar, to lead the crowd in cheers for the
company and one another.
</P>
<P>
   Seven months earlier, the company flew almost 2,300 employees
and guests to Miami for a three-night cruise aboard Royal
Caribbean's Sovereign of the Seas. The event included a performance
by Bill Cosby.
</P>
<P>
   But now the party's over. Three months ago, CFS went out of
business, after filing for bankruptcy last December amid
accusations that it had exaggerated its success in collecting bad
debts.
</P>
<P>
   Often, the costliest outings are held for clients, not workers.
Allen &AMP; Co., the investment bank, stages lavish annual
get-togethers in Sun Valley, Idaho, for media movers and shakers;
the events have helped sustain its prominence in the information
industries.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the Fireman's Fund Insurance Co., a $4 billion concern
with headquarters in Novato, Calif., sponsors deluxe retreats that
its officials say pay off in increased revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do maybe three or four of them a year _ although we call
them `corporate advances' instead of `retreats,' because we're
always looking forward,'' said David Kliman, the company's vice
president for corporate communications.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-July, five top Fireman's Fund officials, including the
chief executive, Joe Stinnette, met with 11 chief executives of
regional insurance agencies and their guests for a three-day
retreat _ whoops, advance _ at The Inn at Spanish Bay in Pebble
Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The gathering included morning discussions about business, and
the choice of golf, horseback riding or ocean kayaking in the
afternoon. A highlight was a catered dinner in the living room of
an elegant home that Fireman's Fund rented for the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``These meetings do not come cheap, and we would never do them
for our employees,'' Kliman said. ``But these are people who have
signed contracts with us worth millions of dollars. So what do you
do to create something extraordinary? We look at it in terms of
return on investment.''
</P>
<P>
   Judy Siguaw, an associate professor of marketing at Cornell
University's School of Hotel Administration, said the returns on
such retreats are hard to measure. ``I don't think anybody really
knows how cost-effective they are,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But meetings outside the work environment can be good for
motivating employees and for generating ideas and solutions, Ms.
Siguaw said. ``Sometimes when you step away from a problem and
you're in an informal setting, a solution will come to you
unexpectedly,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Many corporate meetings, even small ones, are still held in big
luxury resorts because of the amenities, the food and the aura of
success that permeates such graceful redoubts as the Broadmoor, in
Colorado Springs; the Breakers in Palm Beach, Fla., and the
Greenbrier in White Sulphur Springs, W.Va.
</P>
<P>
   Last month alone, two publishers, Prentice Hall and Houghton
Mifflin, were at the Breakers; Paine Webber was there a few weeks
earlier. Nike held a week-long meeting in August at the Mauna Lani,
while various units of Coca-Cola, Samsung, Toyota and Goodyear Tire
and Rubber have also met there this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people might not go for that any more, where
everything's taken care of for you,'' said Reva Revis, who spent
four days last month at the Broadmoor with senior officers and
guests of her employer, Interface Inc., a commercial carpet
manufacturer in Atlanta. ``But when we had six hours' free time on
Saturday afternoon, instead of our corporate planners having to
scramble around to find what there was to do, it was all there at
the Broadmoor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All,'' in this case, included golfing, tennis, a spa, 28
boutiques and other shops, fly fishing, horseback riding, mountain
biking and hot-air ballooning. Ms. Revis spent much of her free
time working out in the fitness center, followed by aromatherapy
massages in the spa.
</P>
<P>
   While companies can save on room rates by scheduling retreats in
the off season, the cost of meals is rarely discounted; a dinner at
a luxury resort can cost as much as $85 a person, not including
wine or liquor.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Having held 180 meetings last year, Brown-Forman Corp. watches
that part of its corporate ledger carefully. ``Every meeting is
driven by our budget,'' said Dennis Boyd, the manager of meeting
planning and media services at the company, the Louisville,
Ky.-based distributor of Jack Daniels, Southern Comfort, Korbel
champagnes and Bolla wines. ``We try to do what we can for the
least amount.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Brown-Forman meetings are held at full-service hotels _
including properties owned by good customers _ but some sessions
are at luxury resorts. ``When we go there, we're not being
extravagant,'' Boyd said. ``It's a cost of doing business.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Brown-Forman is hardly averse to saving money. It
schedules meetings on Sundays, when possible, to take advantage of
bargain air fares that require a Saturday-night stay. ``The savings
from that are incredible,'' Boyd said.
</P>
<P>
   Such a perspective is a far cry from the 1980s, according to
David Burke, the vice president of sales and marketing at the
Breakers. Back then, when he was regional director of sales for
Hyatt resorts in Hawaii, ``there was a lot of frivolous spending,''
he said. ``I could name 20 corporations that didn't care what the
budget was. They just wanted to have a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   While some corporations shun Las Vegas, especially for meetings
intended as working sessions, the city's reputation for gambling
and glitz is hardly a deterrent. Last year, Domino's Pizza Inc.
held its annual convention, for 3,000 employees and franchisees
from 63 countries at the 5,000-room MGM Grand hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``For people within the U.S., it's inexpensive to get to,'' said
Tim McIntyre, a Domino's spokesman, ``and our international
travelers are intrigued by Las Vegas.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been many changes in corporate meetings in recent
years. While men still outnumber women, as in the higher corporate
echelons generally, the ratio is slowly shrinking. And as the
average age of the participants drops, the food tends toward
lighter and healthier fare, with chicken, fish and vegetarian meals
steadily squeezing prime rib and steak off the menus.
</P>
<P>
   Many corporate meetings include team-building projects and
physical challenges like ropes courses.
</P>
<P>
   Hal Rosenbluth, the chairman of Rosenbluth International, a
travel management company based in Philadelphia, built Rivery
Ranch, the company's retreat in Linton, N.D., to accommodate a
range of team-building activities.
</P>
<P>
   There are scavenger hunts, trail rides in a covered wagon and
the company rodeo, at which employees ride horses while trying to
balance eggs on spoons. When Rosenbluth meetings are not being held
there, the Rivery is rented to Rosenbluth clients like Ikea and
Merck.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scavenger hunts and rodeo allow individuals to break down
barriers and traditional roles in a totally new environment that
encourages competition, teamwork and fast thinking,'' said Shelley
Kwatny, Rosenbluth's director of corporate events.
</P>
<P>
   Teamwork was modeled at the Domino's meeting in Las Vegas by Jon
Wee and Owen Morse, entertainers whose act, ``The Passing Zone,''
involves juggling chain saws on stage.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Wee said, the Los Angeles-based comedy team
has also performed in Boston for American Express, in Austin,
Texas, for State Farm, in Los Angeles for Northrop Grumman, in Las
Vegas for Texas Instruments and in Palm Springs, Calif., for
Farmers Insurance. He has a ready explanation for corporate
America's fascination with this controlled mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could say our performance is about team-building, because
juggling chain saws requires trust and cooperation,'' Wee said.
``But when you're throwing chain saws, `downsizing' isn't just
about losing your job; it could mean losing your arm.''

2 DETAINED IN MOSCOW BLAST AS DEATH TOLL HITS 90
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ As the death toll in a huge apartment-house explosion
reached 90, Moscow officials said late Friday night that they had
detained two men who worked in a ground-floor office of the
building for questioning in connection with the blast.
</P>
<P>
   The officials' cryptic announcement, reported by the Interfax
news service, offered no details. But it appeared to cast doubt on
earlier assertions by Moscow's mayor, Yuri Luzhkov, that the blast
around midnight Wednesday was a terrorist response to Russian
military action against Islamic rebels in Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators consistently said the blast could well be
a terrorist act. But they would not rule out an industrial accident
or some other cause, like a business dispute, that might have led
to a bombing.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Interfax report, the police said only that the
two men may ``have a connection to a commercial structure whose
space is located on the first floor of the exploded house.'' They
will be held for questioning at least until Monday as part of a
criminal inquiry into the blast, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow news outlets reported earlier that there was a paint and
lacquer business on the first floor of the nine-story apartment
house. Other reports asserted that explosives had been stored in a
first-floor office. Whether the two men worked at either business
was not known Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The blast demolished some 60 apartments in the center of the
block-long apartment building, one of thousands of shabby, fraying
precast concrete structures thrown up around downtown Moscow during
the rule of Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev. The blast left a gaping
nine-story hole between the remaining two wings of the structure,
with nothing but rubble between them.
</P>
<P>
   Rescuers said they did not expect to find more bodies beyond the
90 recovered to date. More than 1,200 residents were evacuated and
more than 150 others were rushed to hospitals after the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   The building itself _ a nondescript apartment house in an
industrial neighborhood along the Moscow River _ seemed from the
start an unlikely terrorist target. And although an anonymous
caller to Interfax said the explosion was an act of revenge for
Russian aerial bombings of Dagestan and neighboring Chechnya, a
convincing claim of responsibility so far has not been made,
officials said.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When it began, only a small constituency cared
about the freedom of 16 inmates who were part of an armed, violent
struggle for Puerto Rican independence.
</P>
<P>
   But after a series of miscalculations by the White House, the
debate over what should happen to the 16 prisoners _ 11 of whom
were released Friday _ created a massive political explosion.
Indeed, the aftershocks are still coursing through New York,
Washington, and San Juan:
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who offered clemency to the 16, is being
derided in Congress and by law enforcement officials for being soft
on terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Hillary, has so angered Puerto Rican leaders over her
position against clemency that she risks losing a critical base of
support in her bid for the US Senate, while looking like a panderer
to other voters.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the island itself has come under renewed debate, as
longtime resentment over the commonwealth's status has surfaced
with a fury among Puerto Rican leaders there and in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The episode shakes many assumptions about Hillary Rodham Clinton
and her political ambitions and highlights the troubles she is
encountering as she tries to perform roles as first lady and
potential Senate contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a bumpy transition from celebrity Clinton to
candidate Clinton,'' said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist
Institute for Public Opinion in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hard sell to say, `He did that, and I wasn't aware of
it,' '' because of the Hillary Clinton's heralded role in White
House policy-making, Miringoff said.
</P>
<P>
   When Hillary Clinton called to make amends, ``I told her I
thought this was really bad timing,'' said Bronx Borough President
Fernando Ferrer, a leading New York Democrat. ``There will still be
fallout from this. She's got a long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has insisted that politics played no role in his offer
of clemency _ which was unusual in that the convicts themselves
never requested it. The campaign for clemency was made by the
prisoners' supporters, said White House spokesman Barry Toiv.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also said he did not discuss the matter with his wife,
who might have benefited politically from the clemency offer among
those in the Puerto Rican community who support the inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton, who publicly disavowed the president's policy
after hearing the rising chorus of criticism by law enforcement
officials and others, is bruised politically as she embarks on what
could be a tough fight for the Senate seat. Together, the Clintons
have managed to anger all sides in the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The White House ``definitely miscalculated'' when it decided to
agree to the demands of some prominent Puerto Rican political
leaders and granted clemency to the 16, said Carlos A.
Romero-Barcelo, Puerto Rico's Democratic, non-voting delegate to
the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Romero-Barcelo was the only Latino House member to denounce the
prisoners, who are members of the Armed Forces of Liberation.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration was ``hoodwinked'' by the convicts'
supporters and miscalculated the impact the decision would have,
Romero-Barcelo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her timing couldn't have been worse,'' said Ferrer, of Hillary
Clinton. ``It was just an example of wading into a very muddy area
of politics.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute over the nationalist prisoners _ excoriated as
terrorists by some and defended as freedom fighters by others _ has
taken on the hyper-inflated political quality of so many other
racially charged criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of what the members of the Armed Forces of Liberation
actually did and how long they should be punished has evolved into
a wider and more emotional controversy, one that taps the great
resentment many Puerto Ricans perceive as the second-tier status of
the island and its inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of the United States as my father, and of Puerto Rico
as my mother,'' said Representative Jose Serrano, a Democrat from
the Bronx, and the longest-serving Puerto Rican official in the
United States. ``Well, my father has been abusing my mother for a
long time. It's time to bring her into the family, or let her go.''
</P>
<P>
   The fight over clemency ``is not about these people,'' Serrano
said. ``It's about the status of Puerto Rico.''
</P>
<P>
   Even those who call for the release of the inmates don't try to
justify the behavior of the organization, which has claimed
responsibility for numerous bombings, according to prosecution
documents. The Armed Forces of Liberation also has been blamed for
armed robberies _ including a notorious Wells Fargo robbery in
Connecticut _ and murders.
</P>
<P>
   The prisoners, however, were convicted of seditious conspiracy,
and the criminal charges against them did not specifically link any
of the 16 to murders. Briefs filed by US Attorney Anton R. Valukas
did connect some of the defendants to a grand plan to help another
Armed Forces of Liberation member escape from Leavenworth federal
penitentiary.
</P>
<P>
   Those arguing for the prisoners' release argue that the
sentences _ ranging from 35 to 90 years in jail _ are unduly harsh.
</P>
<P>
   But law enforcement officials and other critics of the Armed
Forces of Liberation say that the charge of seditious conspiracy
was the best, and perhaps only, way to convict the 16 in federal
court _ much as organized crime figures might be prosecuted for
mail fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, prosecutors did not have available to them the
federal antiterrorism act, which was passed in 1990 _ seven years
after the Armed Forces of Liberation members in question were
convicted, Romero-Barcelo noted.
</P>
<P>
   Even Amnesty International, the leading organization monitoring
political prisoners, refuses to give the 16 convicts the status of
``prisoners of conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To be a prisoner of conscience, you cannot commit violence,
and you cannot advocate violence,'' said Amnesty International
spokesman Sean Crowley. ``This is a terrorist organization. These
people don't qualify.''

 (ATTN: Pa., N.Y., Israel)  (jw) 
 By RAYMOND BONNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW - For several years, Semyon Mogilevich has been hounded
by American and European law enforcement agencies, which have
described him as a major leader of Russian organized crime, in
control of a criminal network that reaches from Moscow to
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Now, American and British investigators say they believe that he
is linked to possible money laundering at the Bank of New York.
They suspect that he controlled Benex, the company with accounts at
the bank through which billions of dollars were channeled. Benex
also surfaced in an earlier federal money laundering investigation
of one of Mogilevich's American companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never heard of it, never dealt with it,'' Mogilevich
said in an interview this week, his first with American
journalists. ``And I made the right decision. If I had dealt with
Benex, I would need a plastic surgeon and a place in Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   After news of the bank investigation broke, he left Israel
quickly and has become a man on the run. Appearing weary and
dejected, Mogilevich, 53, says he now feels safe only in Israel,
where he has been a citizen since 1991, and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   He steadfastly refused to allow his picture to be taken. A jowly
man, weighing nearly 300 pounds, bald on top, and with a faint
mustache, he was wearing a dark pin-striped suit, white shirt
(which needed pressing), tie and braces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will tell you everything, the size of my underwear in 1972,
what I had for breakfast, how much time it takes for my
love-making,'' he said, pulling out another True cigarette. But
first, he said, he wanted to answer some of the nefarious things
that have been said about him.
</P>
<P>
   He was handed a fountain pen by his youthful-looking lawyer and
ceremoniously initialed a two-page statement he was sending to the
Russian secret service.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a leader or an active participant of any criminal
group,'' it said. ``At any rate, neither me nor any of my
acquaintances have been convicted,'' under Russian laws against
organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   A prime target of surveillance by the FBI and the CIA for the
last five years, Mogilevich has been accused in government reports
of everything from illicit arms trading and prostitution to money
laundering, drug trafficking, torture and murder.
</P>
<P>
   He has been widely described as a leader of ``Russian''
organized crime. But that is not precise. He was born in Ukraine,
when it was part of the Soviet Union, and the base of his criminal
empire since 1991 has been Budapest, not Russia, according to
American and British law enforcement reports.
</P>
<P>
   In fact one view in Russia is that he is not the kingpin that
Western law enforcement authorities believe him to be. ``Mogilevich
is nobody for Russia,'' wrote Yulia Latynina, a commentator for the
newspaper Izvestia. Ms. Latynina then listed several notorious
figures linked to the Russian underworld and declared that to
equate ``a pimp from Budapest,'' as she characterized Mogilevich,
with them was ``to be ignorant of the financial-political map in
Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   A confidential 1995 FBI report said Mogilevich's criminal
organization was connected to the so-called Solntsevskaya
organization, which is headed by Sergei Mikhailov, an alleged
leader in Russian organized crime whose operations were based in
the Moscow neighborhood that gave the organization its name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their operations and contacts overlap in some instances, as
evidence by joint investments, and silent partnerships in firms
engaged in OC activity,'' the report says. It adds, ``These ties
are not clear, but they exist nevertheless.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior American law enforcement official said this week that
Mogilevich was ``still definitely associated'' with Mikhailov.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Mogilevich said that he had met Mikhailov in a
gymnasium in 1982, shortly after Mogilevich moved from Kiev to
Moscow, and that they lived in the same apartment building.
</P>
<P>
   But Mogilevich said that the two men were only friends, and that
neither had engaged in criminal activity. Mikhailov was acquitted
by a Swiss court this year on charges of money laundering and
racketeering, in part, American officials said, because of a lack
of cooperation from Russian authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Mogilevich's explanation for why the FBI said four years ago
that he was a leading international criminal was unusual. ``I am
person everyone knew _ 110 kilos of weight, very handsome, very
friendly,'' he said. Such prominence then prompted unsavory
Russians to give him up to American authorities in the hope that
they could gain entry into the United States, he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Now, American authorities are investigating whether there is a
connection between Mogilevich and Benex, and, if so, what it is.
They want to know about his relationship to Peter Berlin, the man
whose accounts at the Bank of New York are under scrutiny, and to
Berlin's wife, Lucy Edwards, who until recently was a bank vice
president in the Eastern European division.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Edwards, who was dismissed by the Bank of New York last
month for allegedly failing to cooperate in the investigation, has
denied doing anything illegal, as has Berlin, through a lawyer. The
bank said it was cooperating with the federal investigation. No one
has been formally charged with any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators believe that Benex and several related accounts
moved between $4 billion and $10 billion through the bank beginning
in early 1998. They believe that some of the money may have been
capital fleeing Russia during the financial crisis last year, and
that some was embezzled by Russian politicians and business
executives. But they also believe that a substantial amount of the
money is from Mogilevich's criminal activities.
</P>
<P>
   Benex has been linked to an earlier investigation of
Mogilevich's activities in the United States, involving YBM Magnex,
a suburban Philadelphia company that made industrial magnets at a
factory owned by Mogilevich in Hungary.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In an audit of YBM last year, a Philadelphia accounting firm,
Miller Coffey Tate, found numerous transactions which it said had
the ``indicia'' of money laundering, and a long list of fictitious
customers. One was Benex International Forests. It is not clear
whether it is associated with the Benex accounts at the Bank of New
York.
</P>
<P>
   In June, YBM pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court in
Philadelphia to securities fraud, and the Justice Department is
still looking at Mogilevich's role.
</P>
<P>
   Mogilevich acknowledged that he was a founder of YBM in the
early 1990s, but said that he now had only a tiny shareholding, and
at any rate the company had done nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   His first brushes with the law were in Ukraine. When he was 27
and a university graduate, he was convicted of unlawful currency
dealing. All he had done, he said, was buy a small gold coin for
his girlfriend. But that landed him in jail for 18 months, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years later, he was charged with unlawful currency
dealing. That time, he said, he was just trying to help a friend
who wanted to emigrate to get $2,500. He was sentenced to four
years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Mogilevich moved to Budapest, because, he said, he had
fallen in love with a woman there during a one-week vacation. They
married and had a son.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing he does not control there, from prostitution
up _ extortion, drugs, everything,'' a senior American law
enforcement official asserted this week.
</P>
<P>
   According to British accounts, Mogilevich has also caused
problems in the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mogilevich is organizing all the black markets from the former
Soviet republics through the Czech Republic,'' a British
intelligence report said in December 1994. ``This includes deals
involving weapons, including heavy-caliber weapons, drugs and
precious stones.''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Mogilevich was accused by the CIA and the
FBI of offering a $100,000 contract for someone to kill an American
journalist, Robert Friedman, after Friedman wrote an article in The
Village Voice about Mogilevich's purported criminal empire. The CIA
said it had picked up the threat on a telephone intercept.
</P>
<P>
   Mogilevich scoffed at the allegations, adding, ``The Interior
Ministry of Hungary would refute this information categorically.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, British authorities investigated Mogilevich on
suspicions that he had laundered $80 million through a British
bank. Mogilevich insisted that the money had come from legitimate
trading.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, in 1991 he bought a cargo container filled
with cheap clothes and toys from China. In Russia the people were
desperate for consumer goods, and he sold the container for a
$100,000 profit.
</P>
<P>
   When he needed a bank account in the West, he said, he was not
sure how to go about it. So he paid a lawyer $500,000 a year. The
lawyer's wife was also the mother of a son by Mogilevich.
</P>
<P>
   Britain disbarred the lawyer and shut down all of Mogilevich's
operations there. They did not prosecute him, however, ``because
they were unable to secure the cooperation of Russian law
enforcement agencies,'' the U.S. Customs Service said in a 1997
report.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he does now for a living, Mogilevich said he was
going to take advantage of having become notorious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the most popular man in the world,'' he said. ``I want to
offer a big deal to Procter &AMP; Gamble. I want to make detergent
soap. The name will be `Mogilevich.' Mogilevich guarantees that
this washes everything, from underwear to money.''

INDONESIA ASSISTING MILITIAS, U.S. SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By PHILIP SHENON With DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton accused the Indonesian military
Friday of direct involvement in the savagery that has swept across
East Timor and said an international peacekeeping force must be
allowed to restore order.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is now clear that the Indonesian military is aiding and
abetting the militia violence,'' he said in a statement released
during a stop in Hawaii has he traveled to an Asia-Pacific economic
meeting in New Zealand. ``This is simply unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who earlier had held out the possibility that the
Indonesian military might end the violence, said Friday that
international peacekeepers were now essential.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Indonesian government and military must reverse this
course _ to do everything possible to stop the violence _ and allow
an international force to make possible the restoration of
security,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Pentagon's earlier insistence that there were no
plans to send American ground troops to join an Australian-led
peacekeeping force in East Timor, the president's national security
adviser, Sandy Berger, said Friday, ``I don't think anything is
ruled out here.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger indicated that Clinton had been consulting congressional
leaders from Air Force One about how deeply the United States might
get involved. One official said contingency plans would require
moving ``thousands of American personnel, though not necessarily
onto East Timor.'' The troops, aircraft and ships would be chiefly
drawn from Marine bases on Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
   Berger also appeared to acknowledge what other senior
administration officials have said privately: that Indonesia's
military has muscled aside President B.J. Habibie, who seems to
have no ability to control developments in East Timor. While
Clinton has exchanged messages with Habibie in recent months,
Berger said, ``I think we have focused on where we believe the
decisions are being made, which is the Indonesian military.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Wiranto, Indonesia's senior military commander and
defense minister, ``has ultimate responsibility for asserting
control over'' the situation in East Timor although ``there may be
divisions within the military.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger said the administration had begun a reviewing other
sanctions that could be taken against Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, the president announced that he had ordered
the Pentagon to end its few formal contacts with the Indonesian
military and that he would consider new economic sanctions against
Indonesia if ``this madness'' in East Timor was not ended.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the American response grew more heated Friday, the
administration appeared to be running out of options to bring
pressure on the Indonesian military to quell the violence or to
permit the deployment of an international peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   The most potent weapon available to the United States is its
veto power over economic assistance to Indonesia from the
International Monetary Fund, which has propped up the Indonesian
economy with billions of dollars in emergency aid.
</P>
<P>
   But no new IMF assistance for Indonesia is in the pipeline, and
$2.5 billion already committed to Indonesia by the fund was frozen
even before the crisis in East Timor, as a result of charges that
the Indonesian government had misused an earlier package of aid
money.
</P>
<P>
   A few officials in the administration, speaking on condition of
anonymity, have questioned whether economic sanctions against
Indonesia would be wise, especially because they might lead to
widescale rioting across Indonesia or a nationalistic backlash.
</P>
<P>
   During a two-hour stopover in Hawaii, Clinton met with Adm.
Dennis Blair, the commander of American forces in the Pacific, who
hurried home to Hawaii after meeting with Wiranto in Indonesia. He
also spoke by phone with Australian Prime Minister John Howard, who
is working to organize a peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   East Timor, a former Portuguese colony that was invaded by
Indonesian troops in 1975, is physically closer to Australia than
it is to most of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president made clear to Prime Minister Howard that the
United States supported such an international peacekeeping force
and that we would provide support to such a force if one becomes
feasible,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether American support would go beyond logisitical
assistance, he said the Australians ``are most interested in those
things that we have a special capability in _ in terms of logistics
and communications and intelligence.'' But he added that ``we've
not made any decisions beyond that or ruled anything out.''

<P>
   Herbert J. Alexander, an internationally known mathematician who
had solved several complex problems that had baffled mathematicians
for years, died on Aug. 27 in Evanston, Ill. He was 58.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was lymphoma, said his wife, Susan Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander, who lived in Wilmette, Ill., was a professor at the
University of Illinois at Chicago. He joined the university in 1975
and remained on staff until this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made important contributions to the study of analytic
functions of several complex variables, which is a branch of
mathematics developed in this century that has important
connections to algebraic geometry, partial differential equations
and other mathematics,'' said John Wermer, a retired professor of
mathematics at Brown University.
</P>
<P>
   Among the problems Alexander had solved was finding the
polynomial hull of rectifiable curves in the space of several
complex variables.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander was born on Dec. 24, 1940, in Cleveland. He graduated
from Harvard University and earned his doctorate in 1968 at the
University of California at Berkeley. He taught at the University
of Michigan, the University of California at Los Angeles and the
University of California at San Diego before joining the University
of Illinois at Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his wife, Alexander is survived by two daughters,
Meredith Alexander of San Francisco and Leslie Alexander of
Wilmette; and a brother, Joseph Alexander of Manila, the
Philippines.

PENTAGON OPPOSED TO SEVERING TIES TO INDONESIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Top Pentagon officials, hoping to preserve their
close relationship with the Indonesian military, have strenuously
argued within the Clinton administration not to break ties with
Indonesia over the mass killing and forced exodus of people in East
Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Department officials stiffly resisted the decision
announced Thursday to suspend a $500,000-a-year US military
training program for Indonesian officers, said two Clinton
administration officials speaking on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   A slightly more significant step of halting weapons sales and
other commercial ties came under review Friday, National Security
Adviser Samuel R. ``Sandy'' Berger said aboard Air Force One. About
$16 million in US arms sales is pending.
</P>
<P>
   But the US administration has not committed any ground troops to
a possible Australian-led peacekeeping force, although Berger said
Friday, ``I don't think anything is ruled out here.''
</P>
<P>
   One administration official with access to classified
intelligence information said the paramilitary forces in the East
Timor capital of Dili appeared to have ``finished looting and
burning and now were backing off. They've already done the damage,
and it could be that the only job for a peacekeeping force would be
to push them out completely and let the residents come back. But
they'll be coming back to a devastated area.''
</P>
<P>
   As growing evidence suggests that soldiers and police officers
continued to aid the paramilitaries, Congress and human rights
groups have increasingly called for the Clinton administration to
take stronger steps.
</P>
<P>
   Paramilitaries unleashed their campaign of terror last week
after the announcement that East Timor's populace had voted
overwhelmingly for independence from Indonesia, which seized the
Connecticut-sized region in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   During the spree of killing and burning, top US military
officers have talked daily with General Wiranto, Indonesia's armed
forces chief.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said Friday that Admiral Dennis Blair, commander of the
US Pacific Command, briefed Clinton during a stopover in Hawaii
about the situation, including results from Blair's recent meeting
with Wiranto in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   ``General Wiranto had given him assurances that there would be a
serious effort by the Indonesian military to reassert control,''
Berger said. ``However, we have not seen any evidence of that
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration official said US intelligence analysts
increasingly believe that neither Indonesian President B.J. Habibie
nor Wiranto can control the military in East Timor. The estimated
25,000 Indonesian troops in the region are apparently loyal to a
rogue faction in the military, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The US-Indonesian military connection has deep roots, including
$1 billion in US military sales to Indonesia since 1975 and the
training of thousands of Indonesian soldiers in close quarters
battle, special reconnaissance, light infantry tactics, military
operations in urban terrain and other skills.
</P>
<P>
   Even as members of Indonesia's military engaged in rampant human
rights abuses in the past, and even when Congress cut a military
training program for Indonesia's officers several years ago, the
Pentagon has always battled to keep the relationship intact.
Indonesian soldiers killed hundreds of people in East Timor earlier
this decade and killed and raped ethnic Chinese in Jakarta last
year.
</P>
<P>
   One argument is that jungle-warfare training is beneficial to US
troops. In addition, the Pentagon has long argued that such
training will improve the Indonesian military's human rights
record.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin D. Kramer, assistant secretary of defense for
international security issues, told a House panel in July 1998:
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not assume that individual US policies or actions taken
toward the Indonesian military will by themselves produce
fundamental changes in the military's behavior. But we do believe
that over time, we can influence human rights improvements through
dialogue, through access, and through training.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon was not alone then in arguing for continuing the
relationship. At that same hearing, John Shattuck, the
then-assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and
labor, said:
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally believe, as our government's highest human rights
officer, that now is a critical time for us to continue engagement
with the military, to make sure that we know who are the bad
actors.''
</P>
<P>
   US Representative Christopher H. Smith, a New Jersey Republican
and chairman of the House human rights panel, questioned Kramer and
Shattuck about the wisdom of continuing such exercises when it had
been revealed that the US had trained members of the notorious
special units called Kopassus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were training thugs,'' Smith said then.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said Friday he was particularly upset to learn that the US
military did not investigate where the Indonesian soldiers came
from or what they did after the training. ``While we would like to
see an evolution toward respect for human rights and democracy, you
need to have accountability. We had no sense of who we were
training,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kramer could not be reached Friday. Shattuck, now US ambassador
to Czechoslovakia, also could not be reached, but a State
Department official said the belief at the time of the hearing was
that it was better to stay engaged with Indonesia, which appeared
to be anemerging democracy, than to cut off ties.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, said the official, ``There is a strong human rights
component on all our military training programs. We work closely
with the Pentagon to ensure that it happens.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Pentagon's fight over the past week to keep ties intact
has angered many inside and outside the administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``They keep saying it benefits them to keep interacting,'' said
one official who once worked at the Pentagon. ``It's not true. The
benefits haven't happened. You have to have a country committed to
reform for it to work. If a country is still an authoritarian
regime, we can easily run into trouble with training their
military.''
</P>
<P>
   William D. Hartung, a senior fellow at the World Policy
Institute at the New School in New York City, has studied
US-Indonesian military ties dating to 1975. His research shows US
companies have delivered to Indonesia 229 aircraft, 264 missiles,
nine combat ships, 402 armored combat vehicles and massive
quanitities of small arms, including 15,000 Colt Industries M-16
rifles.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a long history of the United States looking favorably
on helping their military,'' Hartung said. ``We have never pushed
vigorously on human rights and democracy in Indonesia. It stands in
stark contrast to our approach on Kosovo, where we put the moral
issue up front.''
</P>
<P>
   US Representative James P. McGovern of Worcester, who visited
East Timor for two days just before the vote on independence, said
Friday the Clinton administration should do much more to try to end
the violence.
</P>
<P>
   While in East Timor, he met General Zacky Anwar, who was in
charge of some Indonesian troops. ``His English was better than
mine,'' McGovern said. ``He trained at Fort Bragg. He said he loved
the United States. I think we have more of a moral responsibility
in Indonesia if for no other reason than because we trained so many
of the soldiers.''

JAPAN SELLS YEN FOR DOLLARS TO SLOW YEN RALLY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Japanese government sold yen for dollars in the foreign
exchange market Friday in an effort to slow the rise in the value
of the yen, which had jumped 2.8 percent on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The intervention stopped the yen rally for the moment. Late in
the day, the yen was valued at 108.81 to the dollar, off from
107.78 Thursday. But analysts expect the yen's rise to resume
because the economic outlook for Japan has improved.
</P>
<P>
   Statements from Japanese officials indicated that the government
was not trying to reverse the yen's course with the latest
intervention, although reversing course was indeed the goal of a
series of six interventions in June and July.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the officials indicated that they just wanted to slow
the yen's rise because a move that was too rapid could be
destabilizing in an economy that is still fragile, even if it is
finally turning around. A much stronger yen would make Japanese
exports harder to sell abroad and could dampen this key sector of
the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intervention today was an operation meant to smooth the
move in the yen instead of changing direction,'' said James
McCormick, currency strategist at J.P. Morgan Securities. Japanese
officials, he added, ``are happy enough to stand by and let the
fundamentals drive the yen as long as it is orderly.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the dollar continued to fall against the yen, it rallied
sharply against the euro, with analysts continuing to contend that
the weakness of the dollar against the yen does not signal a
broader problem for the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers reiterated
the Clinton administration's support of a strong dollar. According
to a Reuters report, Summers said Friday, ``Our policy and approach
is unchanged _ a strong dollar is very much in the interests of the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter how much it favors a strong dollar, the administration
will probably remain on the sidelines. Any effort to change the
dollar's course against the yen would require concerted
intervention by the United States, Japan and their other industrial
allies. But the administration has been reluctant to use such
concerted intervention unless the dollar was extremely strong or
weak. If the Japanese economy is recovering, intervention is
unlikely to alter significantly the sudden flow of new investors
into Japan that is powering the yen rally.
</P>
<P>
   The surge of the yen on Thursday followed a Japanese government
report that the economy had grown at an annual rate of 0.09 percent
in the quarter ended in June. That performance was much better than
the small decline that had been expected. Taken with a surprising
8.1 percent rate of growth in the previous quarter, the data helped
bolster the belief that the Japanese economy is beginning to
recover from its longest recession since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of a Japanese recovery has been luring foreign
investors into the Japanese stock market for months. As they
return, they have to sell dollars and other foreign currencies to
buy yen, pushing up the currency's value. They use the yen to buy
stocks, which are surging. The Nikkei index of 225 stocks is up 28
percent this year in local terms.
</P>
<P>
   Many economists had thought that the rapid economic growth in
Japan in the early months of this year had been overstated. But the
small rise in the second quarter will make the recovery seem much
more real for many investors. ``Now it is clear that the economy at
least held onto those gains in the second quarter and that
industrial output is moving strongly higher into the third
quarter,'' Karen Parker, the director of currency research as the
Chase Manhattan Bank, said in an assessment for clients Friday.
</P>
<P>
   That improvement in the economic outlook will make getting back
into the stock market more attractive, providing another boost for
the yen.
</P>
<P>
   But some economists still think that the Japanese economy could
stumble again, especially when the government cuts back on the
fiscal spending it approved to jump start the economy. ``There are
clear downside risks for the economy because the fiscal spending
will have to fade,'' said McCormick of J.P. Morgan. But the
economic momentum should continue through the quarter ending in
September, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The euro fell against the dollar Friday after the Department of
Labor reported that American producer prices, excluding food and
energy, declined by 0.1 percent in August. Some investors took this
sign of restrained inflation as another indicator that the Federal
Reserve might not raise short-term interest rates again this year.
That would give American markets a bit of an edge over those in
Europe. The euro was at $1.0364 in late trading, down from $1.0544
on Thursday.

 &HT;    Schrader favorite to drive No. 36
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. _ Ken Schrader is widely considered to be the
front-runner as Ernie Irvan's replacement in the No. 36 car for
next season.
</P>
<P>
   Schrader declined to discuss his plans Friday at Richmond
International Raceway, saying, ``I can't talk about everything that
is going on right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The No. 36 vacancy occurred when Irvan retired from Winston Cup
racing at Darlington last week. Jerry Nadeau has been an interim
driver for MB2 Motorsports the past two races but has signed a
contract to join Hendrick Motorsports next season.
</P>
<P>
   Wally Dallenbach, whose one-year contract with Hendrick expires
in November, also has been mentioned as a permanent replacement for
Irvan. Dallenbach also is a candidate to drive for Cal Wells' new
Winston Cup team next year.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR's ``silly season'' is wearing on Dallenbach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got pretty thick skin,'' Dallenbach said. ``As long as I can
wake up in the morning and be able to look at myself in the mirror,
I don't have a problem. What all these other guys do. . .what comes
around, goes around.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can be is my own person and be honest, because I figure
enough people in the garage area will do anything _ they'd snuff
their mother out for a ride or a sponsor. But I figure if the good
Lord wants me somewhere, He is going to put me there.''
</P>
<P>
   Richmond race
</P>
<P>
   Chevrolet will replace Exide as the sponsor for the fall race at
Richmond through the 2002 season. The Chevrolet Monte Carlo 400
race logo was unveiled Friday. Also, Pontiac has extended its
sponsorship of Richmond's spring race by three years.
</P>
<P>
   Busch notes
</P>
<P>
   Jeff and Ward Burton mixed it up in Busch practice Friday
morning, with Ward crashing into the wall between the first and
second turns. Ward's car was heavily damaged, and the team had to
pull out the backup car, which meant Ward started in the back of
the field for Friday's race. Jeff hurried over to Ward's
transporter after the incident for a meeting with his brother.. . .
</P>
<P>
   Mike McLaughlin has signed to drive for Innovative Motorsports
for the 2000 season and is bringing sponsor Gould Pumps with him.
McLaughlin, 43, replaces Andy Santerre, who resigned earlier this
week because of personal reasons. Innovative Motorsports plans to
have a second Busch team for next year, but a driver has not been
selected. ``The only way we won't run a two-car team is if we can't
find a driver Mike is comfortable with,'' team owner George
diBidart said. ``We got about 20 to 30 people interested in driving
that car.'' McLaughlin, winner of five Busch races this year, is
ending a 15-year relationship with Cicci-Welliver Racing at
season's end. . . .Ricky Rudd was diagnosed with food poisoning on
Friday and did not participate in practice or qualifying.

 &HT;    Hamilton rarin' to go vs. 'Noles
 &HT;    By J.C. Clemons
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ By now, just about everyone in the free
world has heard of Joe Hamilton's woeful tale. Of how Georgia
Tech's splendid quarterback is 0-3 against Florida State. Not only
in being on the wrong end of the score, but being able to stay on
the field.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton could right a lot of wrongs with a win tonight when the
No. 10 Yellow Jackets take on top-rated Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would mean a lot,'' Hamilton said. ``It would mean that you
would have beaten all the teams that beat you in your career. It's
definitely something I thought about all summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I can't try to do everything by myself.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not a far reach to say Hamilton has done just about
everything for Georgia Tech, however. The senior has turned a
floundering program, stamped his name in the record book and given
the school its best shot of bringing the Heisman Trophy home to a
place at which John Heisman coached.
</P>
<P>
   But Hamilton has not only not beaten FSU, he's left each of
Tech's three games against the Seminoles with injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't worry about those things,'' Hamilton says. ``They are
going to hit you hard. We're going to hit them hard. It's going to
be a dogfight.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor will Hamilton concern himself with putting on a dazzling
display for the ABC cameras in an effort to influence the Heisman
Trophy race.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always want to play your best,'' he says. ``I don't want
to go out and play my best because of the Heisman. I just want to
be successful, and that will take care of itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the best campaign statement Hamilton could deliver
would be a win over the team favored to win the national title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've made it very clear to Joe,'' Tech coach George O'Leary
said. ``The team is the factor. If we're doing well, Joe's doing
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Hamilton performed admirably against FSU, the
Jackets within 10-7 late in the fourth quarter. But Hamilton was
hit after completing a pass, suffered a hip pointer and never
returned.
</P>
<P>
   From there, the Seminoles bullied their way to a 34-7 win.
</P>
<P>
   FSU coach Bobby Bowden acknowledged that superior depth always
factors into FSU's game plans, and it will again today.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can keep them from making big plays,'' Bowden said,
``maybe we can wear them down in the fourth quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't seen Joe play,'' offensive tackle Jon Carman
said. ``He wants to show what he can do. I want to help him get
that opportunity this year. We want to keep him in the entire game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never want your quarterback to be hit and get hurt.

 &HT;    Ohio State tries to `get clicking' without starters
 &HT;    By Susan Vinella
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ All week, UCLA coach Bob Toledo has fielded
questions about the two-game suspension 11 of his players _ seven
of them starters _ are serving for illegally obtaining handicap
parking passes.
</P>
<P>
   How has it affected the Bruins? Has team continuity and spirit
been broken? Can the substitutes handle a nationally ranked
opponent such as 13th-ranked Ohio State?
</P>
<P>
   Toledo and OSU will find out today when the 14th-ranked Bruins
(1-0) face the Buckeyes (0-1) in a rare night game at Ohio Stadium.
Though Toledo is upbeat about his team's chances, he doesn't
sugarcoat the fact that the Bruins are significantly weakened by
the player losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a reason why these guys are second string,'' Toledo
said, referring to the fill-ins.
</P>
<P>
   OSU players say they aren't dwelling on UCLA's depleted roster.
They've got problems of their own to focus on if they want to avoid
an 0-2 start. The last time Ohio State lost its first two games was
1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've just got to get clicking,'' OSU receiver and California
native Ken-Yon Rambo said of the offense.
</P>
<P>
   Getting Rambo, a highly recruited speedster, more involved would
help. The junior caught one pass for one yard in OSU's 23-12 loss
to Miami (Fla.) in its season opener. He had just two passes thrown
his way. ``It was kind of frustrating,'' Rambo said.
</P>
<P>
   Not that fellow receiver Reggie Germany was lighting it up on
the other side. Germany, a junior, caught four passes for 56 yards.
He did not score a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The blame for the ineffective passing game can be spread around
to the offensive line, which gave quarterback Austin Moherman
little time to throw; Moherman, who was a bit jittery in his first
collegiate start; and a lackluster running game.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps OSU can jump-start its running game today against UCLA's
young, inexperienced linebackers, all of whom are second-stringers
dressed up as starters. But the Bucks might have to do it without
backup tailback Jonathan Wells, who sprained his ankle against
Miami. Cooper said Wells is doubtful for the game. Junior Derek
Combs is his replacement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect them to run the football,'' Toledo said. ``Hopefully
we can stop them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins had trouble stopping opponents on the ground and in
the air last year, allowing an average of 432.5 yards and 27.5
points per game. They finished ranked 99th among 112 Division I-A
teams in total defense.
</P>
<P>
   The unit's most disastrous performance came in its final
regular-season game against Miami (Fla.), where it gave up 689
yards and a last-minute touchdown that resulted in a 49-45
Hurricanes victory. The loss cost the previously unbeaten Bruins an
invitation to the national championship game.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Toledo hired a new defensive coordinator, who
promptly scrapped the 3-4 defense and installed a 4-3. ``I think
that has helped us,'' Toledo said. ``We're a little more physical
up front.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the Bucks and Bruins will play two quarterbacks today, with
inexperienced junior Drew Bennett (starter) and red-shirt freshman
Cory Paus sharing time for UCLA and sophomores Austin Moherman
(starter) and Steve Bellisari splitting minutes for OSU.
</P>
<P>
   In his first start in UCLA's 38-7 victory over Boise State last
Saturday, Bennett completed 8-of-16 with one touchdown and one
interception. Paus, who sparked a first-half scoring drive off the
bench, was 12-of-18 with a touchdown and two interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   OSU outside linebacker Courtland Bullard returns after a
one-game suspension and will start.

 &HT;    Holtz's presence already helps S.C.
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ It is rare when Georgia's players are asked more
about the opposing team's head coach than they are, say, the
opposing team's tailback. But that was the case this past week as
the Bulldogs prepared for today's Southeastern Conference opener
against South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The Gamecocks will be led into Sanford Stadium for the first
time by coach Lou Holtz. South Carolina lured the 62-year-old out
of retirement in December to jump-start its struggling football
program. A 28-year veteran as a college head coach, Holtz is best
known for his 11-year tenure at Notre Dame, where he was 100-30-2
and won a national championship in 1988. But he's also held
coaching jobs at William &AMP; Mary, N.C. State, Arkansas and
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to hear he's rejuvenating that program,'' Georgia
quarterback Quincy Carter said. ``Growing up, I remember seeing
(Holtz) on TV on the Notre Dame sideline. It's going to be strange
seeing him across the field Saturday. I'm sure he'll have South
Carolina ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Holtz has the fourth most victories of any active coach _ 217 _
but he has his hands full with the Gamecocks, who have lost 11
games in a row, including a 10-0 setback at N.C. State last
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is South Carolina short of SEC-caliber talent, their
lack of depth has been exacerbated by injuries. Arturo Freeman, an
All-America candidate at free safety, and Kevin Rivers, a starter
on the offensive line, are among the Gamecocks unavailable for
today's game. Even offensive coordinator Skip Holtz, the coach's
son, spent three days in a hospital this week (for severe abdominal
pain).
</P>
<P>
   It's Georgia's depth and his team's lack of it that has Holtz
concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking at the tape of last year's game, and Georgia had
a middle linebacker, No. 44 (Adrian Hollingshed), that just made
plays all over the field,'' said Holtz, who's 0-2 in his career
against the Bulldogs. ``I said, `Who's No. 44?' Then I look and see
he's No. 3 on their depth chart. Their starting cornerback last
year is No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``Georgia is a very talented team. I think you're looking at the
same type of team that you will be when you're playing Tennessee
and Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's Holtz's skill as a motivator that has South Carolina
charged and its opponents worried. The gregarious coach is as
well-known for his sharp wit and self-deprecating humor as he is as
a football mastermind.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always been good at that, taking over a program that has
struggled a little and giving it some direction,'' Georgia coach
Jim Donnan said. ``And I'm sure he'll get it done at South
Carolina. It's like any place. You've got to get in there and
recruit.''
</P>
<P>
   Holtz's presence in Columbia nearly landed him Kevin Breedlove,
South Carolina's top lineman last year who eventually signed with
Georgia. And it did land him the players of the year in three
states _ Connecticut, Ohio and South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Lou Holtz came (to South Carolina) you had to consider
them, because he's Lou Holtz,'' said Breedlove, a backup guard for
the Bulldogs.
</P>
<P>
   Holtz never got a chance to recruit Richard Seymour, another
South Carolina native who chose the Bulldogs. Seymour is a junior
defensive tackle and an All-America candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard them say he's a great motivator,'' Seymour said.
``Well, Jim Donnan is a great motivator, too. It's really the same
guys that were on the field for them last year. Coach Holtz can't
go out there and play for them.

 &HT;    Sherman finds new life with Vikes
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Ray Sherman has gone from a jalopy to a sports
car.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman, the Pittsburgh Steelers' offensive coordinator last
season, was criticized when his unit fell from sixth in the NFL in
1997 to 25th.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he's running the Minnesota Vikings' offense, which scored a
league-record 556 points last season and returns virtually intact
going into Sunday's opener against the Falcons in the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray has been here,'' Minnesota coach Dennis Green said about
Sherman, who was the Vikings' quarterbacks coach 1995-97. ``He's an
outstanding football coach. I've known Ray a long time, and I think
he's a very good coordinator. He has a thorough knowledge of our
system, and he knows how to handle our players.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherman resigned in Pittsburgh on Dec. 31 and was hired as
Minnesota's quarterbacks coach when Brian Billick, the Vikings'
offensive coordinator, left to become head coach of the Baltimore
Ravens. Green promoted assistant Chip Myers to offensive
coordinator, but Myers died of a heart attack on Feb. 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have easily hired Ray as coordinator,'' Green said,
``but we always promote from within.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherman's job in Minnesota is simple: Don't mess up a good
thing.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings return all 11 starters on offense, including All-Pro
quarterback Randall Cunningham, receivers Cris Carter and Randy
Moss and one of the league's best offensive lines. Last season,
Minnesota set team records in yards (6,264) and touchdown passes
(41).
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to make any wholesale changes,'' Sherman said.
``We're going to tweak a few things here and there, but basically
we're just going to run the offense that's been here, even when I
was here in 1995. It's the same system.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherman is hoping his time in Minnesota is more enjoyable than
his one-year tenure in Pittsburgh. When Steelers coach Bill Cowher
hired Sherman to replace current Dallas Cowboys coach Chan Gailey
last year, it seemed like a perfect marriage.
</P>
<P>
   One of only 10 African-American coordinators in the NFL last
season, Sherman seemed like a comfortable coach for Steelers
quarterback Kordell Stewart, one of the league's six black
signal-callers in 1998. Stewart had blossomed the previous season
in his first year as a starter, leading Pittsburgh to within one
game of the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   But Sherman quickly learned that he was in the wrong place at
the wrong time.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after Gailey was introduced in Dallas, wide receiver
Yancey Thigpen, who led Pittsburgh in receiving in 1995 and 1997,
signed with Tennessee as a free agent. Offensive tackle John
Jackson left for San Diego, and fullback Tim Lester spent much of
the season on injured reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, Cowher told Sherman to learn Gailey's system, which
Sherman never fully grasped. The Pittsburgh offense scored just two
touchdowns in the final five games, all losses, and the Steelers
missed the playoffs for the first time since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd never been through that, to that extent,'' said Sherman,
who spent one season as an assistant with the Falcons and two at
the University of Georgia. ``I can understand the feeling of the
fans, because they'd always had success there. . . . It ended up
being the new guy's fault. And the quarterback was saying, `Well,
I'm not comfortable.' And I'm saying, `Why can't you be
comfortable? It's the same system you've been in. Same plays, same
terminology. Maybe it's not being called at a time you want a play
to be called. Maybe you're not having the success you're used to
having. Sometimes you've got to take responsibility for yourself.'
''
</P>
<P>
   At season's end, Sherman was the scapegoat, and he resigned
before he was fired. Stewart was rewarded with a large contract
extension.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you don't go to the playoffs, somebody's always got to be
something,'' Green said. ``That's just the way it is.

 &HT;    Murphy gains opportunity as on-ice mentor
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ When a player is part of 11 NHL seasons, five
teams and two expansion drafts and after once changing employers
twice in four days, he can view it as rejection or as opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Gord Murphy chooses the latter. Murphy was neither surprised nor
devastated after the Florida Panthers left him unprotected in the
Thrashers' expansion draft and then sent him to Atlanta in a trade
after he went unselected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is I had a poor season last year and I was on the
injured list for the last 2 1/2 months,'' the 32-year-old
defenseman said. ``With what transpired, I was kind of hoping
something would happen over the summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy is in his second training camp with an expansion team. He
was taken by Florida off Dallas' unprotected list in 1993, only
four days after the Stars acquired him in a trade with Boston. He
originally was drafted by Philadelphia and played 3 1/2 years for
the Flyers and then 1 1/2 for the Bruins. The Panthers wanted
Murphy for the same reason Thrashers general manager Don Waddell
did _ a smooth-skating defenseman and a tutor for the team's
younger players.
</P>
<P>
   But by June, it was clear the Panthers, in the midst of a youth
movement, wanted to move Murphy and his $3.7 million salary. He
missed the last 25 games of the season with a neck injury that
first was diagnosed as muscle spasms and turned out to be ``slight
nerve trauma'' causing pain and numbness down his left arm.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy and Phoenix's Rick Tocchet, former teammates in
Philadelphia, were both falling to the ice, and Tocchet tumbled
over Murphy and pushed Murphy's head down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a whiplash injury,'' Murphy said. ``After a couple
of weeks, I started getting this tingly sensation down my left arm.
That makes it hard when you're a left-handed shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team physician in Florida told me I have the neck of a
40-something-year-old and I'll definitely have arthritis later in
life. I was like, `Whoa.'''
</P>
<P>
   But Murphy says he feels fine now. In the weeks before training
camp, he underwent extensive deep massage and a weight program to
strengthen his shoulder and neck.
</P>
<P>
   The Thrashers decided that he was fit enough to acquire in a
trade the day of the expansion draft. They sent goalie Trevor Kidd,
who had been taken from Carolina, to Florida for Murphy, center
Herbert Vasiljevs, defenseman Daniel Tjarnqvist and a sixth-round
pick.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, who was an assistant captain of the Panthers, said he is
looking forward to working with younger players this year and has
been impressed by Yannick Tremblay and Brett Clark. ``I haven't
spent a lot of time watching the other guys yet, though,'' he said.
``When I'm on the bench, my head is down, and I'm sucking wind.''
</P>
<P>
   As for expansion comparisons, Murphy said, ``I don't want to put
any extra pressure on us. But this team on paper is a lot stronger
than the one we started with in Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers finished nearly .500 (33-34-17) in the first year
and reached the Stanley Cup finals in their third. At the end of
last season, Murphy was one of five remaining original Panthers.

 &HT;    Kafelnikov pursues title and top ranking
 &HT;    By Todd Holcomb
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The No. 1 ranking on the ATP Tour is at stake today
when second-ranked Andre Agassi, the French Open champion, plays
third-ranked Yevgeny Kafelnikov, the Australian champ, in the men's
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can honestly say that neither one of us will be thinking
about that,'' Agassi said. ``I'll give him the No. 1 ranking if he
gives me Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi's presumption wasn't entirely accurate. Kafelnikov is on
a mission to validate his six-week reign at No. 1 earlier in the
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andre wants to win the Slam in front of his home crowd; I'd
like to do it for different reasons,'' Kafelnikov said. ``I just
want to do it because I want to be No. 1 in the world at the end of
the year. Simple as that.''
</P>
<P>
   Another thing Agassi and Kafelnikov disagree about is their
forecast for Sunday's final. Kafelnikov sticks to his prediction of
last week that only he, Agassi or Richard Krajicek can win the
title. Because Kafelnikov beat Krajicek in a fifth-set tiebreaker
in the quarterfinals, it follows that the real final is today.
Consider the Cedric Pioline-Todd Martin semifinal an exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have to play on Sunday, it's very dangerous to think
like that,'' Agassi said.
</P>
<P>
   Kafelnikov leads the career series 4-3, but Agassi has won three
of the five on hardcourts. They've split two matches in the past
six weeks, each dominating the other.
</P>
<P>
   In the semifinals of the Canadian Open, Kafelnikov overpowered
Agassi in a 6-1, 6-4, losing just seven points in his eight service
games. Two weeks later, Agassi won 7-6, 6-1 in the final of
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi, 33-4 since the start of the French, believes the two are
similar players, baseliners who can hit with power up the line or
cross court.
</P>
<P>
   Martin's not pretty one
</P>
<P>
   While conceding that the Agassi-Kafelnikov winner will be the
favorite to win the U.S. Open, Martin doesn't doubt he can win his
first major here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even have to play really well in order to do it,''
Martin said. ``It's a lot more mental than it is physical. If I can
do that, then the fact that Andre, Yevgeny and Cedric all look
prettier than me on the court won't keep me from doing well.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin says he's over the flu bug that has left him dehydrated
and in need of constant attention from trainers through his
victories against Greg Rusedski and Slava Dosedel.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien, Lareau win
</P>
<P>
   Alex O'Brien and Sebastien Lareau won their first Grand Slam
men's doubles title as a team or individually in a 7-6, 6-4 victory
over Mahesh Bhupathi and Leander Paes, the French Open and
Wimbledon champions. Bhupathi and Paes made all four major finals
this year.

MOVE TO LOWER COST OF ELDER INSURANCE CRITICIZED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Hoping to encourage more Massachusetts elders to buy
long-term care insurance, the Cellucci administration will allow
insurers to sell cheaper, lower-benefit policies.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the administration has opened the door to a
bewildering new market in long-term care policies that won't cover
what elders really need and want when they become disabled.
</P>
<P>
   New state regulations, effective Jan. 1, will drop the current,
decade-old requirement that such insurance policies cover home care
as well as nursing home costs. Nursing home-only policies are
expected to cost about 17 percent less.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules also drop the current requirement that long-term
care benefits kick in after 100 days of nursing home care.
Beginning next year, insurers can sell policies that don't start
paying until beneficiaries have been institutionalized for a year _
a $61,000 out-of-pocket expenditure at current rates.
</P>
<P>
   By one reckoning, the one-year deductible will save 15 percent
over the cost of a policy with a 100-day exclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to make these products affordable and flexible,''
said state Insurance Commissioner Linda L. Ruthardt. ``Some people
who might not have bought before will now buy them because they're
more flexible.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Ruthardt's department, about 50,000 Massachusetts
residents are thought to have long-term care policies, a small
fraction of the target market. A 60-year-old Massachusetts resident
currently pays about $1,300 a year for a long-term care policy with
good benefits, according to one broker.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Anthony, a health care consultant who was chief of
consumer protection under former Attorney General Scott
Harshbarger, agreed with Ruthardt. ``The theory that you should
mandate home health is fine, but the cost of these things is so
prohibitive that people don't buy them,'' Anthony said. ``These
policies aren't selling now because they're not affordable.''
</P>
<P>
   Others differed sharply, charging that consumers will be more
vulnerable to unscrupulous salesmen who sell them costly policies
that won't be worth much.
</P>
<P>
   ``These regulations encourage junk policies,'' charged Al Norman
of Mass Home Care, which represents nonprofit agencies that offer
alternatives to nursing home care. ``This will create more premiums
for insurance companies, but very little value for the consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   Katy Cushman, a former state insurance regulator who now sells
long-term care insurance, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Loosening up these rules will not answer the question: What do
people do when they become disabled and have huge bills to pay?''
said Cushman, who wrote the state's current long-term care
regulations in 1988. ``I understand they want to loosen up, but I
think they need to protect the consumer. And they haven't done
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruthardt said the regulations protect consumers by requiring
more disclosure by long-term care brokers. ``This simplifies
disclosure and helps people understand what they're buying,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, insurance agents must disclose whether a policy
qualifies for federal income tax deductions and shields
policyholders against state liens on their homes if they later
exhaust insurance coverage and qualify for state Medicaid nursing
home payments.
</P>
<P>
   The regulations also require brokers to disclose if they are
paid commissions on the sale of long-term care insurance, and the
state will require that insurers train agents to sell this
complicated coverage.
</P>
<P>
   However, critics said consumers will have to be alert if they
are to avoid buying a policy that does not protect them against
property liens. Under current rules, to escape state property
seizure a consumer seeking Medicaid assistance must have bought and
exhausted coverage that pays at least $125 a day in nursing home
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The new state regulations have no minimum daily benefit for
nursing home coverage, and many policies are expected to provide
less than the $125 daily minimum in order to keep premiums low.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some wealthy guy who has an attorney will figure out what's
good and bad, but your typical Joe isn't going to get it,'' Cushman
said. ``That's what I'm worried about.''
</P>
<P>
   Cushman also pointed out that the new regulations do not require
agents to tell consumers how much commission they make from selling
a particular plan. ``Some agents will sell one policy because they
will make a higher commission, which is not in the best interest of
the consumer,'' she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Pledging a new era of cooperation, Energy Secretary
Bill Richardson and governors from four states with nuclear weapons
plants Friday signed an agreement that would expedite cleanup of
much of the nation's nuclear waste.
</P>
<P>
   In signing ``a statement of principles,'' Richardson and the
governors _ Bill Owens of Colorado, Jim Hodges of South Carolina,
Don Sundquist of Tennessee and Gary Locke of Washington _ vowed to
work together to clean up ``sites that helped us win the Cold
War,'' as Richardson said at a news conference here.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement would move on several fronts to complete a job
that involves transporting radioactive waste across state lines,
which has traditionally been a politically sensitive problem.
</P>
<P>
   By drawing governors from both parties into an agreement _ Owens
and Sundquist are Republicans; Locke and Hodges are Democrats _ the
Energy Department has recruited allies to lobby Congress for the
money needed for the cleanup. Those efforts are expected to extend
into the next century and cost $147 billion, almost double the
amount of the Federal Superfund program. Cleanup efforts now take
about a third of the Energy Department budget.
</P>
<P>
   The department is asking Congress for almost $6 billion for the
fiscal year that begins next month. This year's appropriation was
$5.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said he had invited other states with major nuclear
weapons plants to join the agreement, including Idaho, Nevada, New
Mexico and Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   He said the agreement was less about lobbying Congress than
about forging a relationship that eliminated the mistrust and
skepticism of the past, when the department worked with states
individually.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money is not it,'' Richardson said. ``I know we, as the
federal government and the Department of Energy, can work better
with each state. We haven't done that well. What this means is if
the department signs a commitment, we will abide by it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the governors did not miss the point about money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is in the self-interest of each state to talk to members of
their Congress,'' Locke said. ``These things cannot be accomplished
unless the dollars are there.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement sets target dates for cleaning up and closing
nuclear weapons plants. In the past, Richardson conceded, with the
governors nodding in agreement, tasks and deadlines were moving
targets.
</P>
<P>
   The pact requires the states and the federal government to
cooperate in completing the cleanup as quickly as possible, in
protecting the ground water in the process and in seeking enough
money from Congress to cover the costs.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department has also agreed to comply with specific
goals for each state that signed the document.
</P>
<P>
   The goals included closing the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant
west of Denver by 2006, developing a new use for a former nuclear
plant on the Savannah River in South Carolina, determining the
levels of radioactive and toxic waste that should be burned at the
Oak Ridge incinerator in Tennessee and continuing efforts to clean
up the Columbia River in Washington, where Locke said thousands of
gallons of radioactive waste were leaking from tanks built to last
only through the 1960s.

<TEXT>
<P>
   A few short years ago, many working Americans worried about the
seemingly constant downsizings by major corporations, and there was
much hand-wringing about whether anyone could expect to join a
company fresh from school and work there long enough to retire with
a gold watch.
</P>
<P>
   In board rooms, the worry was the opposite: that decades of
steady gains by unions on job security and work-rule issues in the
prosperous 1950s and '60s had made the labor force in many American
factories too expensive and inflexible to compete in the global
economy, especially during recessions.
</P>
<P>
   The long economic expansion of the 1990s has created so many new
jobs that downsizing has lost its capacity to terrify most workers,
and young people joining the work force often tell survey takers
that they don't expect to stay at one company for a decade, never
mind a career.
</P>
<P>
   Against this backdrop, the General Motors Corp., one of those
perhaps most buffeted by the global economic forces said to drive
all the downsizing, dropped an anachronistic bombshell last week:
an offer of lifetime employment to unionized workers with at least
10 years' seniority, as part of the company's efforts to reach a
new labor agreement with the United Automobile Workers union. The
offer comes as a wave of GM workers hired in the 1960s and '70s
nears retirement.
</P>
<P>
   What could GM have in mind with an offer that seems to fly in
the face of sweeping, decades-long trends? Harley S. Shaiken, a
professor specializing in labor and global economic issues at the
University of California at Berkeley, delved into the issues it
raises. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)With companies in the auto industry and elsewhere
pushing steadily toward outsourcing and seeking greater flexibility
to compete globally, and even the Japanese beginning to abandon
lifetime job tenure, how is GM's offer of lifetime employment
guarantees possible?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. In a way, this is lifetime job security that probably
envisions downsizing _ that's the paradox. The paradox is they're
willing to guarantee increased job security but they're asking for
increased flexibility, which may result in outsourcing. In the
context of the GM offer, the devil really is in the details. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)What does a promise of lifetime employment really
mean when auto industry labor contracts typically last only three
years?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Usually when a company says ``lifetime job security,'' they
mean two things. First, they are willing to put aside a pool of
money to guarantee jobs. Second, they are often asking for a
considerable amount in return.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever is negotiated now can be renegotiated in three years.
The guarantee is only as good as the goodwill involved. Previous
attempts at lifetime job security in this and other industries have
generally fallen short of people's life spans. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Can GM afford to make this offer precisely because
so many of its workers are eligible to retire within a few
years?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The cost is high up front, but it could be one of the better
investments that GM makes. The job security provisions really are a
down payment on a more motivated work force, a better relationship
with the UAW _ and ultimately a more competitive GM. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Will Ford and DaimlerChrysler be forced to follow
GM's lead?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. There's nothing in what we've seen so far in the job security
provisions that is going to cause a major roadblock, certainly at
DaimlerChrysler, and likely not at Ford either. In fact, a
settlement could come first at DaimlerChrysler, and then Ford will
have a pretty powerful precedent to follow.
</P>
<P>
   There is little question now in the entire post-World War II era
that the auto union has led the way in a lot of innovations in
labor. What happens here will be closely watched in virtually every
other manufacturing industry. As workers retire, you could have
lifetime job security and a smaller work force. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Does this kind of offer appeal more to rank-and-file
auto workers than it does to their union?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't think so, and that goes to an unusual quality of the
UAW and this industry. A UAW worker in Flint says, ``Is my niece
going to be able to get a job in this plant? Is my son-in-law?''
The concern for creating new jobs isn't just felt at the leadership
level.

FIRST LADY ADMITS STUMBLING POLITICALLY ON CLEMENCY ISSUE
</HEADLINE>
   (ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients.

603-1036.)

 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Buffeted by criticism from some of her own supporters, Hillary
Rodham Clinton acknowledged Friday that she had mishandled her
effort to distance herself from President Clinton's offer of
clemency to members of a Puerto Rican terrorist group.
</P>
<P>
   She said she should have consulted Hispanic leaders in New York
before suddenly calling on the White House to withdraw the clemency
offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to admit that the consultation was not what it should
have been,'' Mrs. Clinton, who is likely to run for the U.S. Senate
next year, said Friday during a conference of Hispanic, Asian and
black women in Manhattan. ``And that will never happen again.'''
</P>
<P>
   Her acknowledgment of error was narrowly drawn, suggesting she
believed that the mistake was not her position on the issue itself,
but rather how she handled the political preparation that often
precedes such an announcement. Even so, it is unusual for a
candidate to admit such a misstep, and her comments came as she
faced a third straight day of questions about an issue that has
emerged as the first major challenge to her probable candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Her trouble served as a reminder, several Democrats said, that
whatever strengths Mrs. Clinton brings to next year's Senate race,
she is a novice candidate. A more experienced candidate, several
said, would have made certain to forewarn supporters who might have
been angered by the decision, in hope of at least blunting their
criticism.
</P>
<P>
   So far, at least, Mrs. Clinton's handling of the issue seems to
have satisfied no one. Her opposition to the clemency has been
denounced by Puerto Rican leaders, who described her gesture as a
betrayal. And opponents of Clinton's clemency offer, who had
orchestrated a rising chorus that apparently convinced Mrs. Clinton
that she had to act, have dismissed her statement as an insincere
maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton offered last month to commute the sentences of 16
members of the Puerto Rican independence group known as FALN,
provided that the prisoners renounced violence. Eleven of them
accepted the conditions and were released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The FALN has been linked to about 130 bombings in the '70s and
'80s, which resulted in six deaths and scores of injuries. None of
the prisoners offered commutation were charged in any crimes that
led to injury or death.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At first, Mrs. Clinton, who has said she knew little about the
case until after her husband made his announcement, said she
supported the prisoners' release provided that they met the
condition of renouncing violence. A week ago, with criticism of
Clinton and the first lady rising among Republicans and Democrats,
Mrs. Clinton issued a statement saying that the prisoners had been
given ample time to respond and calling on the White House to
rescind the offer.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, though, the White House had sent a letter to a
lawyer for the prisoners the night before Mrs. Clinton made her
statement, setting a one-week deadline, which ended Friday, for
accepting the terms and renouncing violence. The prisoners who were
freed Friday accepted.
</P>
<P>
   If Mrs. Clinton was hoping to mend relations with some New York
Hispanic leaders with her expression of regret Friday, she did not
appear to have done so. Rep. Jose Serrano, a Democrat who
represents the Bronx and the senior Puerto Rican member of
Congress, said he had not talked to Mrs. Clinton since before she
announced her position and that he first learned about her latest
statement from a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Serrano, who last week said he was no longer encouraging Mrs.
Clinton to enter the race for Senate, said he was not moved. ``It
was not just an issue of consultation,'' he said. ``I did not want
her to come out and rescind the order.''
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, Serrano said he was watching on television as the
first of the Puerto Rican prisoners who had met Clinton's demand
walked out of prison. ``What did she really say?'' he said. ``She
didn't say, `I'm glad they are going home.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton spoke at the third annual World of Women Leaders
Conference in New York, appearing before a collection of
organizations representing Hispanic, black and Asian women. She
received an enthusiastic reception, addressing a number of issues
of concern to women that are likely to be central in the campaign
ahead. But afterward, state Sen. Olga Mendez, a Democrat from the
Bronx who is Puerto Rican, said she remained distressed. ``It was a
horrible blunder,'' she said. ``She is an intelligent woman. She
has to learn the rules. We are very hurt. We Puerto Ricans are very
hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Ms. Mendez, who supported Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
when he ran for re-election in 1997, said she was still undecided
on whom she might support in a contest between Mrs. Clinton and
Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   And the Rev. Al Sharpton aligned himself with Serrano, and said
Mrs. Clinton's public statement was insufficient. ``She needs to
call Joe Serrano,'' he said. ``And she needs to say to Joe Serrano
what she said today: that she would never do that again. She needs
to make repairs with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton said that Mrs. Clinton's handling of the issue
suggested that she and her campaign advisers were not prepared to
deal with the complicated world of ethnic politics in New York.

   PRODUCER PRICES JUMP, BUT CORE RATE SLIPS
</P>
<P>
   Producer prices, a gauge of wholesale price inflation, jumped
0.5 percent in August, the Labor Department reported. But the
increase, the largest since last December, was largely confined to
energy and food.
</P>
<P>
   The core rate of wholesale price inflation fell a slight 0.1
percent, after holding steady in July. Despite the huge jump in
crude oil prices since the spring, producer prices other than for
food and energy are just 1.3 percent higher than they were a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   NASDAQ INDEX SURGES TO RECORD
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index soared 35.04 points to 2,887.06, a
record, as investors snapped up shares of Internet companies and
software makers, but industrial stocks slid. The Dow Jones
industrial average lost 50.97 points to close at 11,028.43, while
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Stock Index edged up 4.00 points to
1,351.66.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury bond prices rose, reflecting hope for tame inflation,
sparked by the producer price report and the dollar's rise against
the yen. The yield on the benchmark 30-year bond fell to a two-week
low of 6.04 percent.
</P>
<P>
   BRITISH MERGER MAY BE BLOCKED
</P>
<P>
   The European Commission seemed to be preparing to block the
proposed $1.4 billion takeover of First Choice Holidays PLC by
Airtours PLC. The deal would create Britain's biggest single tour
operator and narrow competition in a market that has been seeing
price wars and falling sales.
</P>
<P>
   NEC SHARES JUMP 12 PERCENT ON REPORT
</P>
<P>
   Shares of NEC Corp. jumped 12 percent after a report in Japan's
leading business daily, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, suggested that
the technology and telecommunications giant planned a sweeping
overhaul that would consolidate business units, give division heads
greater authority and shed money-losing businesses. The steps are
in line with plans announced by Koji Mishigaki when he was named
president of the company in February.
</P>
<P>
   UAW DEMAND TO DAIMLERCHRYSLER
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Yokich, president of the United Automobile Workers, is
said to be demanding that DaimlerChrysler AG make it easier for the
union to organize its workers, including those at a nonunion
Mercedes plant in Alabama, if it is to lead industry contract
talks.
</P>
<P>
   2 UTILITIES CRITICIZE REGULATORS
</P>
<P>
   The top executives of two utilities, American Electric Power and
Central and South West, strongly criticized federal regulators for
delaying the completion of their planned $4.9 billion combination,
which was proposed nearly two years ago. American Electric's stock
price has sagged in the meantime.
</P>
<P>
   MGM PLANS $750 MILLION STOCK SALE
</P>
<P>
   Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc., owner of one of the world's largest
film libraries, said it would sell $750 million of new common
shares and reduce some of its debt. Tracinda, the investment
company owned by Kirk Kerkorian, the billionaire, holds about 89
percent of MGM's shares and may buy more.
</P>
<P>
   KOREA TO SELL NUCLEAR GENERATORS
</P>
<P>
   The state-run Korea Heavy Industries and Construction Co., or
Hanjung, said it would sell $50 million worth of nuclear power
plant generators to United States-based ABB-Combustion Engineering
Nuclear Power, a unit of ABB Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   COURT ACCEPTS OIL TANKER DISPUTE
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court accepted a half dozen new cases, including a
significant dispute over safety regulations for oil tankers,
pitting the state of Washington against the federal government. In
another case raising a question of the pre-emption of state law,
the court agreed to decide whether automobile manufacturers could
be sued for having failed to provide air bags when federal law
permitted but did not require them.

 &HT;    Good finish crucial for Jarrett
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. _ Dale Jarrett, who won his first race of the
season at Richmond International Raceway in May, desperately needs
another strong performance at the .75-mile short track tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett, who will start 13th for the Exide 400 beginning at 7:30
p.m., has had his seemingly invincible lead in the Winston Cup
points standings chopped in half after disappointing performances
in the past two races.
</P>
<P>
   For the struggling No. 88 Ford team, simply earning a spot after
Friday's first round of qualifying _ which Jarrett failed to do at
Darlington last Sunday _ was a notable accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I made it through qualifying (and) that's the first
step,'' Jarrett said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was important, to get through this. We've had good race
cars in the last two races, and I just have to do a better job at
my job. Hopefully we can do that (tonight).''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett entered Bristol with a season-high lead of 314 points
before his troubles began. He was involved in two crashes at the
Goody's 500 and finished 37th. Jarrett was 16th at the
rain-shortened race at Darlington.
</P>
<P>
   Despite having the points lead cut to 168 points the past two
weeks by Mark Martin, Jarrett said he feels no additional pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, (the pressure) is not that bad,'' Jarrett said. ``If we
had gone into Darlington with a 140-point lead, beat Mark and
gained 28 points, you all would be talking about how big a lead it
was. We've still got a nice lead, we just have to do our job.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin will start 20th. Mike Skinner is the pole sitter and will
be joined on the front row by rookie Tony Stewart. Rusty Wallace,
who has a history of success at Richmond, will start third.
</P>
<P>
   ``Track position is very important here,'' said Skinner, who
captured his second pole of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get somewhere in the top 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to lead the first lap if at all possible, get five
bonus points, and then fall back in the pack and hang around all
day. And then race the hell out of them at the end of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace seems to always be a contender at Richmond. He has
finished seventh or better, including six victories, in 20 of the
past 21 Richmond races.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Tonight's race) has the potential to grab even more headlines
than the Bristol race,'' said Wallace, referring to the last-lap
incident between Dale Earnhardt and Terry Labonte.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another Saturday night race on a short track, so I'd say
you could expect the unexpected to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Dick Trickle was a substitute driver for the No. 10 car and
failed to earn a spot in the first round of qualifying.

WATSON IS STILL A LEADER IN DEBUT ON SENIOR TOUR 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL ARKUSH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Everyone assumed that Tom Watson, making his
anticipated debut on the Senior PGA Tour at the Comfort Classic,
would seize the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   He did. He also did what many might not have assumed. He seized
the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Watson, who turned 50 last Saturday, shot a six-under-par 66
Friday at Brickyard Crossing to tie four others at the top of the
leader board.
</P>
<P>
   Although he had been a little apprehensive Friday after a poor
morning session on the practice range, Watson made some quick
adjustments in his swing to put together the type of well-balanced
performance that should establish him as a star all over again in
the second act of his golfing career. He putted extremely well and
regularly drove the ball past Dave Stockton and Hubert Green, his
playing partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like coming out here and feeling kind of like Tiger Woods,''
said Watson, whose opening round featured only one bogey and was
highlighted by four successive birdies heading into the turn. ``I
was anxious, afraid I wasn't going to do well. But it turned out to
be a pretty good round.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to Watson's impressive afternoon was his drive at the
par-4 eighth, which narrowly missed the water. Taking immediate
advantage of his most fortunate escape, he hit a 6-iron approach
within 12 feet and then converted the putt for his third
consecutive birdie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking at bogey or double bogey on that hole with the
ball in the air, and I come out with a 3,'' Watson said. ``I don't
think there was much tension left in my body after that.''
</P>
<P>
   There were, however, a few more birdies left. He made a 20-foot
putt at No. 9, a 3-footer at 14 and a 10-footer at 18 to tie Gary
McCord, Bob Eastwood, Jim Dent and Bobby Stroble.
</P>
<P>
   Watson, who got married last week, is probably aware of his
importance to the senior tour. Not since 1990, when Jack Nicklaus
turned 50, has a player of such distinction (eight major
championships, 34 PGA Tour victories) joined the senior ranks.
</P>
<P>
   That is a big deal for a circuit that, despite some outstanding
performances in recent seasons _ especially by Hale Irwin, the
two-time defending player of the year _ has fallen in television
ratings. Watson, especially if he can challenge Irwin for tour
supremacy, may be able to change that.
</P>
<P>
   First things first, though. He has already proved he is a factor
after only one day.
</P>
<P>
   As much as his peers hope his presence will give the tour a
boost, however, they are not ready to concede anything, especially
on a vulnerable course likely to yield a lot of birdies over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Watson may very likely need two more 66's to contend for the
title Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't let him win this one,'' McCord said, half-jokingly.
``He can win the next 10 or 11 if he wants to, but not this one.'' &QL;

KINGS GAMBLE ON NEW FACES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a season when there was little reason to be anything but
pessimistic, optimism has been the prevailing emotion for the Kings
through the first six days of training camp.
</P>
<P>
   With coach Andy Murray and general manager Dave Taylor looking
on, scrimmages have been intense, the Kings' skill level and depth
both appear to be improved, and there is a sense the team is better
organized than it was a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no games have been played yet, and none that matter
will be played for another three weeks, until the Kings begin the
regular season Oct. 2 in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   But at 7:30 tonight at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas,
Murray and Taylor will get the first glimpse of their team against
an actual opponent, albeit a Phoenix Coyotes team stocked mainly
with prospects.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings, on the other hand, are scheduled to use No.1 goalie
Stephane Fiset and to play a lineup that includes captain Rob
Blake, left wing Luc Robitaille and right wing Ziggy Palffy, who
will be making his first appearance in his new uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Asked the significance of tonight's exhibition opener, Murray
said: ``We're in the process of evaluating. That what exhibition
games are all about. And I think it's a lot easier evaluating
players in a winning atmosphere than in a losing atmosphere. We're
evaluating them in the individual aspect and as a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said: ``I'm very happy with the camp. The tempo and work
ethic have been excellent. There are a lot of new players who have
showed very well. We'll be interested to see the preseason games.''
</P>
<P>
   One player who won't be in uniform tonight is rookie center
Jason Blake, who strained his right knee in Thursday's scrimmage.
X-rays were negative, and Blake said Friday he expects to be in
uniform Tuesday, when the Kings play the Colorado Avalanche at the
Forum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty upset,'' Blake said of the injury. ``But it's
better to have it now than when the season starts.''
</P>
<P>
   Unkindest cuts: The Kings made their first roster trims,
returning goaltenders Alexey Volkov and Cory Campbell, defenseman
Joe Rullier and right wing Brian McGrattan to their junior teams.
Additionally, the Kings released left wings Jimmy Roy and Dmitri
Leonov, and defenseman Reid Simonton. Taylor said more cuts
probably will be made next week.
</P>
<P>
   No progress: Taylor reported no progress in contract
negotiations with All-Star defenseman Mattias Norstrom and in
efforts to secure a work visa for rookie Finnish defenseman Jere
Karalahti. A past arrest in Finland for heroin possession is
complicating efforts to get Karalahti his visa.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he was to be rejected, we won't throw up our arms and
stop,'' Taylor said. ``We would proceed accordingly. There's no
reason in our minds he won't be issued a visa. The paperwork, which
was filed a week ago, is working its way through channels.''

 &HT;    Younger Williams to meet Hingis in final
 &HT;    By Todd Holcomb
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Richard Williams was still right.
</P>
<P>
   The father of Venus and Serena Williams did predict that his
daughters would play today in the women's singles final of the U.S.
Open. He was wrong about that. But he also said a few years ago
that Serena would be better than Venus some day.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, that day had come for the little sister.
</P>
<P>
   Serena Williams, aided by 12 aces, defeated defending champion
Lindsay Davenport 6-4, 1-6, 6-4 in the first semifinal, then went
back to watch from the Williams family box as Venus was up a
service break twice in the third against the world No. 1 Martina
Hingis.
</P>
<P>
   But Venus' serve was as feeble as Serena's was strong, and the
big sister was beaten 6-1, 4-6, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   Serena needed more than their immense talent to remaining
standing in what was likely the most illustrious women's final four
in U.S. Open history.
</P>
<P>
   Serena's test under fire came in the game following the only
service break of the third set. Leading 4-3, Serena went up 40-15
with an ace. Davenport then hit a return winner, and Serena
double-faulted for the first of eight deuces.
</P>
<P>
   Serena would weather five break points against the game's most
devastating service-returner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every break point I had, she just hit a huge, huge first
serve,'' Davenport said. ``She has a great serve, one of the better
serves in women's tennis, if not the best serve.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams was the better player early, drawing seven break points
in the first set against one for Davenport. Williams hit at least
one ace in seven straight games through the second set and once hit
three straight aces in the third.
</P>
<P>
   But Davenport turned the match with giant returns when Williams
wasn't getting enough first serves in. In the second set, Williams
won only seven points serving, three from aces.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing you can do when Lindsay is playing like
that,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   After winning the 22-point eighth game, Serena had one more
test, serving out the match to ensure her first Grand Slam final.
She hit an ace and two service winners to close it out.
</P>
<P>
   Williams now has four straight three-set wins over a former
Grand Slam champion in Conchita Martinez, Monica Seles and now
Davenport. Serena's ability to win big matches has been called into
question following meltdowns against Hingis at the Lipton and
against Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario at the French Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've really developed mentally a lot,'' Williams said.
``I'm more composed. I just stayed determined and focused. I'm able
to pull it through.''
</P>
<P>
   Serena is 17, the same age as Venus when Venus made her first
major final here two years ago, though Venus technically was eight
months younger. No player as low as the seventh seed has won the
women's title in the open era. The only player outside the top five
was Virginia Wade, No. 6 in the first one, 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Williams also could become the first African-American to win the
U.S. Open since Arthur Ashe in 1968 and the first black woman since
Althea Gibson in 1957 and '58.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis won a match of brilliant baseline rallies but notably
poor serving.
</P>
<P>
   Venus made 60 unforced errors but might've overcome that had she
not double-faulted 11 times and won just 9 of 36 points on second
serves. She could hold leads of 3-2 and 2-1 while serving in the
third and was weak at the end, calling a trainer to help her with
cramps just before Hingis served it out.

NEW ECONOMIC DATA ON PRICE OF RAW MATERIALS   STIR INFLATION
FEARS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SYLVIA NASAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the 1970s, a sudden jump in the price of energy or some other
important commodity inevitably signaled a nasty chain reaction that
would send inflationary ripples through the whole economy.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the prices of oil and other raw materials are
climbing once again. But, so far, there are few signs of a ripple
effect.
</P>
<P>
   In August, producer prices, a gauge of wholesale price
inflation, jumped five-tenths of a percent, the Labor Department
reported Friday. It was the biggest monthly increase since last
December. But the increase turned out to be largely confined to
energy and food.
</P>
<P>
   The core rate of wholesale price inflation actually fell
slightly, by 0.1 percent, after staying put in July. Despite the
jump in crude oil prices since the spring, producer prices other
than for food and energy are just 1.3 percent higher than they were
a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no signs of inflation in the U.S. economy,'' said
Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch. ``Despite rapid
growth and tight labor markets, there's no evidence of pricing
pressure outside of oil.''
</P>
<P>
   The data doesn't necessarily mean the Federal Reserve will
refrain from raising interest rates before the year is over,
possibly at its next meeting Oct. 5. But normally hypersensitive
bond investors _ on the lookout for anything that might give the
Fed a reason to raise rates _ apparently interpreted the producer
price data as a sign of benign inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds rallied, sending the yield on 30-year Treasuries to 6.04
percent from 6.09 percent. Stocks were mixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``On balance, this is a constructive piece of news from the
Fed's perspective,'' said Richard Rippe, chief economist at
Prudential Securities. ``The Fed prefers not to see energy prices
go up, but other prices, on which monetary policy has more direct
impact, are still moderate.''
</P>
<P>
   Wholesale inflation has been running faster in the first eight
months of this year compared with the same period last year, 2.3
percent versus zero. But the Labor Department attributed the entire
increase to energy products. By contrast, the Labor Department
noted in its release, the index for finished goods other than food
and energy declined at a 0.4 percent rate over the past eight
months after advancing 2.5 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Although most economists agree that the best news on inflation
is probably past, there was a reassuring absence of signs that
pressures were building along the pipeline that connects the prices
of raw materials with those of finished goods. Prices of so-called
intermediate goods outside of food and energy _ everything from
copper wire to paper and plywood _ rose two-tenths of a percent in
August, about half the rate of the previous two months.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the fact that Asia is emerging from its recession,
Europe is beginning to grow faster, and Latin America isn't sinking
as much as everyone feared after Brazil's currency tanked, means
that the demand for many raw materials will increase, raising
prices.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of passing on higher prices, many manufacturers seem
to be accepting smaller profit margins or, more frequently, finding
ways to trim costs elsewhere in their operations by boosting
productivity.
</P>
<P>
   They may not have much choice. The world is still awash in
excess capacity, not just overseas but also in the United States,
where the fraction of unused industrial capacity remains well above
the historical norm. Optimists think they detect a long-term shift
in corporate mind-sets. ``There's more competitive pressure on
pricing than before,'' said Rippe. ``But there's also a different
mentality out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Few analysts expect energy prices to keep soaring as they have
in the past four months, but energy prices are likely to stay firm
thanks to growing demand, low inventories and the chance that the
coming winter won't be as balmy as the last few.
</P>
<P>
   Faster growth abroad and a nascent rebound in manufacturing in
the United States are also having an effect on the prices of
industrial commodities _ iron and steel scrap, raw cotton and the
like _ which jumped nearly 2 percent in August after a 2.3 percent
increase in July.
</P>
<P>
   Food prices tell a slightly different tale. Prices bounced up
0.4 percent in August, a sizable increase. But that followed a
nearly 1 percent drop in July. In other words, unlike energy and
raw materials prices, there's no reason to think food prices are on
a rising trend. Among things that got a lot pricier in August were
pork, dairy products and soda. Beef, veal, chicken and vegetables
fell less in August than in July. Some things got cheaper, among
them fish and coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, prices of many manufactured goods are still flat or
falling. Although aircraft, office furniture and construction
equipment got costlier, overall capital goods prices didn't budge
in August as everything from trucks to X-ray equipment got cheaper.
The prices of consumer goods other than energy products dipped
slightly. Among the things that became more of a bargain in August
were liquor, clothes, laundry soap and, of all things, mobile
homes.
</P>
<P>
   Stable wholesale prices won't necessarily stay the Fed's hand
this fall, however. Apart from the fact that producer prices
exclude imports and, more important, services, Chairman Alan
Greenspan has reminded anyone who cared to listen, the Fed has yet
to reverse all of its 75-point rate cut of last fall when Asian
economies were falling apart.

 &HT;    Florida on alert for Hurricane Floyd
 &HT;    By Jenny Staletovich
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A massive storm named Floyd became the
fourth hurricane of the season Friday and forecasters fear it will
become a monster.
</P>
<P>
   While it's too early to tell whether it will strike South
Florida, the storm took an eerie path Friday, landing in the same
position as Hurricane Andrew in 1992, said National Weather Service
meteorologist Jim Lushine.
</P>
<P>
   But while Andrew moved faster on its Atlantic trek, Floyd is
progressing more slowly and gathering strength from warm tropical
waters, strength that forecasters say will ultimately make it a
Category 3 storm with winds up to 130 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd should reach the central Bahama Islands Monday afternoon
with winds of up to about 110 mph, forecasters said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, they issued a tropical storm watch for the northern
Leeward Islands as strong winds from the storm's outer bands
stretched about 175 miles.
</P>
<P>
   As of late Friday, Floyd was located about 415 miles east,
northeast of Puerto Rico with sustained winds of 80 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``People need to know there's a real threat out there and the
Southeast is not off the hook,'' said Max Mayfield, deputy director
of the National Hurricane Center. ``It will likely turn north
eventually, but what we can't say is whether that will happen off
the coast or inland.''
</P>
<P>
   Floyd formed earlier this week off Africa's Cape Verdi Islands
as a typical September tropical wave. The National Hurricane Center
issued its first advisory Tuesday. When the center's plane visited
the storm early Friday, it discovered Floyd had grown to hurricane
strength.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane hunters plan to return to the storm today and the next
three days to gather information to be fed into the center's
computer models that predict the storm's course, Mayfield said.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters are particularly troubled by a weather trough over
the southeastern United States that helped steer Hurricane Dennis
offshore earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, it's not going to remain there by the time
Floyd gets up to the southeastern coast,'' Mayfield said. ``It will
gradually lift to the northeast and what we're concerned about is
that a ridge of high pressure will build north of the hurricane. If
that does happen, it will allow a more west, northwest motion.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, forecasters say another trough should move over the
central United States during the next four days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depending on how far east it gets will determine in part what
happens to Floyd,'' Mayfield said.
</P>
<P>
   During the day Friday, Floyd became better organized and even
produced an eye briefly in the afternoon, forecasters said. Because
of its size, Lushine compared the storm to Hurricane Hugo, the 1989
storm that blasted Charleston, S.C., and caused $6 billion in
damages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hugo had winds that extended out 200 miles and hurricane winds
out 100 miles whereas (1992's Hurricane Andrew) had hurricane winds
half that size,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andrew was really a symmetrical storm in terms of
thunderstorms around it, that were all equal distance from the
center. This storm and Hugo are asymmetric, which has implications
in terms of its outer effects. Tornadoes are more likely because
there are more outer bands to have tornadoes in and because it's
much bigger, it's much wetter.''
</P>
<P>
   For most of the weekend, Palm Beach County and the Treasure
Coast will have warm calm weather, with highs in the upper 80s and
90s and lows in the 70s. There is a 40 percent chance of afternoon
showers.

THE MANY MEDIA VOICES OF A FEW MERGED MASTERS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 12) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Texas, Colo., Ill.)   (Eds: This is an added story)  
 (af)  
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If the media and telecommunications giants have
their way, decades' worth of federal rules designed to guard the
marketplace of ideas may soon fall, all in the name of the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few days, top executives from four of the
information industries' largest corporations _ Viacom, CBS, AT&AMP;T
and Mediaone Group _ have asked the government to give them a break
from tight restrictions intended to prevent cable and broadcast
television from falling into too few hands.
</P>
<P>
   The theory behind the rules is that, in allocating a limited
spectrum of communications frequencies, the government must insure
that there are enough different voices, opinions and news gatherers
to keep its citizens informed.
</P>
<P>
   Never before has a corporate merger threatened to exceed the
current limits on concentration of media ownership. But two of this
year's biggest deals _ Viacom's acquisition of CBS, announced
Tuesday, and AT&AMP;T's pending purchase of Mediaone _ cannot be
completed without either changes in the rules or significant
divestitures.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to avoid selling assets that could be combined
profitably, top executives of the companies told the Federal
Communications Commission last week that the concentration rules
are now archaic _ obsolete in an Internet world that unshackles
producers of programming from old economic restraints and assures
diverse voices and original content.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that that rule is no longer relevant in a
broadband Internet world,'' Mel Karmazin, chairman and chief
executive of CBS, said of the regulation that would force Viacom
and CBS to sell some stations to stay within caps limiting a
company to stations serving 35 percent of the nation's homes.
</P>
<P>
   A remarkably similar position was articulated to challenge
similar rules governing cable TV systems. To replace regulations
left unenforced after an adverse court decision seven years ago,
the FCC had been prepared to issue new rules this week, but
postponed them for at least a month after fierce lobbying from
AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very significantly, the market has changed,'' said James
Cicconi, general counsel and head of government relations for AT&AMP;T,
which with the Mediaone acquisition will become the nation's
largest cable company. ``The government should now take a look at
whether the original rationale of the rule is still valid _ namely,
the ability to bottleneck programming.''
</P>
<P>
   What's the answer? Has the Internet indeed promoted new and
original voices to the point that traditional concerns about
diversity of content can be abandoned? Or _ despite the easy,
low-cost access it provides to a cybermarketplace of ideas _ is the
Internet quickly coming to be dominated by a handful of big
corporations, just like television, radio, the movies and
newspapers before it?
</P>
<P>
   Some critics are concerned that the arguments put forward in
favor of media mergers confuse content with delivery _ that while
there may be many new channels being created to deliver
information, there is remarkably little original information being
gathered or produced.
</P>
<P>
   At bottom, these analysts say, media companies are making claims
for a diversity that simply doesn't exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same big players are every bit as keen on swallowing the
Internet as they have the traditional media,'' said Mark Crispin
Miller, director of the Project on Media Ownership and a professor
of media studies at New York University. ``The consensus is that
the Internet is getting less diverse and more homogenized as it
becomes more commercial.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, trends in the older media are hardly reassuring for
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The declining number of American newspapers is an old story.
Where a half century ago there were some 2,200 daily newspapers,
there are now about 1,500; more importantly, most cities have only
one.
</P>
<P>
   Radio has fallen on even harder times. While it used to be that
many stations in even mid-sized cities had their own reporters,
that has become the rare exception. Instead, most stations rely on
the same handful of national and local news services.
</P>
<P>
   Metro Networks, a Houston-based company that supplies traffic,
weather, and sports reports to about 1,700 radio stations, has
lately become a huge new presence in radio news, often supplying
coverage to many stations in one market, sometimes with the same
reporters appearing on several stations under different names to
give the appearance of competing, exclusive reports. In New York,
for example, Metro works for 41 stations.
</P>
<P>
   While the number of television stations has grown sharply, from
96 in 1950 to 1,216 this year, studies show consistently that they
give local news short shrift. ``There is actually more local news
than there used to be,'' said Janine Jaquet, research director for
the Media Ownership Project. ``The flip side is that a lot of this
stuff is coming from fewer sources.''
</P>
<P>
   Many stations rely heavily on wire-service offerings, syndicated
features and the kind of crime and violence stories that they _ and
their competitors _ can cover easily by listening to a police
scanner, and neglect other topics.
</P>
<P>
   ``A principal accused of child abuse makes the news; general
problems in education don't,'' said Paul Klite, executive director
of the Rocky Mountain Media Watch, a Colorado organization that
studies news content around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The television industry points to cable as evidence that new
media give rise to new sources of information. C-Span brings live
congressional proceedings into cable subscribers' living rooms, and
three 24-hour news and information channels _ CNN, MSNBC and Fox
News _ vie for viewers' attention. Moreover, cable systems in a
growing number of cities and regions are now offering 24-hour local
news channels that some analysts say are bringing original
reporting to their areas.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some of cable's early promises of diversity have gone
largely unfilled. In exchange for their local monopolies, for
example, many cable companies vowed to serve the public interest by
devoting channels to such civic-minded topics as local government,
education and the arts. But in many cities, critics say, public
access programming is mediocre at best.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The public access channels on cable are virtually entirely
unused,'' said Lawrence Grossman, the former president of both NBC
News and PBS, at a Fordham Law School symposium earlier this year
on the impact of large media mergers. ``The last I saw, 18 percent
of public access education and government channels were being used.
And when they are used, they are virtually unwatchable.''
</P>
<P>
   Some viewers prefer a camera's unmediated broadcast of a city
council meeting to a reporter's filtered account. But analysts say
neither public access programming nor cable TV's heated chat-show
debates substitute for original investigative reporting, or even
the pedestrian but thorough coverage of public affairs once
provided by local and national broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you've got is a huge diminution of the number of voices
providing information that is necessary for an informed
citizenship, and the Internet doesn't change that,'' said Andrew
Jay Schwartzman, president of the Media Access Project, a
Washington group that promotes diversity on the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly reduces the barriers to organizing and to
discourse. That's important for democracy,'' he said. ``But it's no
replacement for journalism and news gathering.''
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the Internet was supposed to break the mold of
the older technologies by offering a vast new array of voices and
opinions. And indeed, a rich cast of original content of varying
degrees of usefulness now flows from the Internet, from The Onion
and Salon to Matt Drudge.
</P>
<P>
   But while experts are divided over what the Internet may look
like in the future, many agree that the most popular Web sites _
all controlled by commercial interests _ are already beginning to
look alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion that technology will create competition and new
voices, and so we don't have to worry about these companies getting
bigger, is false,'' said Robert W. McChesney, a professor of
communications at the University of Illinois and author of a new
book, ``Rich Media, Poor Democracy'' (University of Illinois Press,
1999).
</P>
<P>
   McChesney maintains that powerful economic forces will
inevitably lead to the domination of information on the Internet by
today's media giants.
</P>
<P>
   First, he said, because they have the newsrooms and production
studios, the big media companies already control the means of
producing the Internet's content. Even wealthy companies like
Microsoft, he noted, have found it difficult to compete.
</P>
<P>
   Second, McChesney said, established media companies already have
both brand names that will attract viewers and relationships with
advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Third, it is the established companies, he said, not the
start-ups, that have the wherewithal to invest in the Internet for
the long term, swallowing heavy losses for a few years in the hope
of gaining longer-term profits.
</P>
<P>
   And in any event, his research shows, about half of the venture
capital provided to Internet start-ups is coming from established
media companies. So they are likely, he said, to have a big
interest in many of the new Internet companies that survive.
</P>
<P>
   Other experts, of course, are more optimistic, seeing the
Internet as a powerful forum for diverse and informative voices.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew L. Shapiro, a senior adviser at the Markle Foundation,
has recently written a book titled ``The Control Revolution: How
the Internet is Putting Individuals in Charge and Changing the
World We Know'' (Century Foundation/Public Affairs, 1999).
</P>
<P>
   He points to what happened in December 1996 when Slobodan
Milosevic, the Yugoslav leader, shut down an independent Belgrade
radio station, Radio B92, which had regularly aired news of
protests against his regime. The station rerouted its programming
to the Internet, where it was available to computer users in Serbia
and around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was an outstanding example of how human rights advocates
can use the Internet in ways they could never use television or
newspapers to get around a thug like Milosevic,'' Shapiro said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly true that a lot of things that happened with
cable, television, and radio _ that have led to the dumbing down of
content _ are now happening on the portal sites,'' he continued.
``But I'm still optimistic. A lot of it will take steering people
to the appropriate content: away from the commercial portals to the
more diverse sites.''
</P>
<P>
   While there will almost certainly be congressional hearings on
the Viacom-CBS merger, there has been far less hand wringing among
lawmakers about the recent information industry deals than there
used to be even just a decade ago, when the trend of mega-media
mergers began to take off.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., who was the only senator to openly
criticize the Viacom-CBS deal for its possible effects on public
discourse, said that the politicians' silence was a clear
reflection of both Washington and media economics. There is no
lobby these days for media populism.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the mix of money and politics, it's all on
one side,'' Wellstone said. ``The political dialogue and political
imagination is set within a narrow parameter.''

SPORTS COLUMN: WORRIES ARE THE COST OF WINNING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With two days remaining before the start of a new season, New
York Jets players moved loosely through the locker room. They
stuffed their oversized duffel bags with all the material for an
overnight hotel stay Saturday night in preparation for their home
opener at Giants Stadium on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Keyshawn Johnson, the fourth-year wide receiver, stood in front
of his dressing stall and examined two pairs of turf gloves _ one
green, one white. ``Which one should I wear?'' he asked, speaking
to no one in particular. Someone said he should go mismatch _ wear
one of each. Johnson frowned.
</P>
<P>
   Flamboyant in his youth, Johnson, now 27, is past the stage
where he has to draw attention to himself. There is a big enough
target on his back, and on the Jets' backs this season, without his
inviting even more undue attention. ``I think I'll wear green,'' he
said Friday, and stuffed the gloves in his bag.
</P>
<P>
   This was a scene from a confident team at ease. But a poignant
portrait of the Jets had emerged Thursday when Johnson, Bobby
Hamilton, Marvin Jones, Aaron Glenn and Ray Mickens joked about the
Disaster of '96, when the Jets finished 1-15.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were bringing back some bad memories, but it was funny,''
Johnson said Friday. ``It was a treat, though, to be able to laugh
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   They talked about the time the Jets were 0-7 and then defeated
Arizona, with a home game against New England up next. Johnson and
Mickens remembered how jubilant the Jets' locker room was after
they beat Arizona to guarantee at least one victory. ``You thought
we had won the Super Bowl or something,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the meeting before the New England game,'' he added, ``one
of the coaches was like, `OK, we're 1-7, this is it: We're going to
turn the corner. We can still win eight games and go to the
playoffs. We're on a roll now.'''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson remembered looking around the room and seeing faces with
blank expressions. ``I was thinking, `This dude is crazy,''' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' progression since 1996 has been stunning _ up to this
point. Under Bill Parcells the team has peeled off layer after
layer of doubt and replaced it with layers of flair and brash
confidence. In Parcells' first season, the Jets finished 9-7 and
came within a game of the playoffs. Last year, the Jets won their
division and played Denver for the conference championship.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between last year's voyage and the one coming up
is a markedly higher level of expectation. The last two seasons,
the Jets shoved out of port for unexplored waters. They discovered
how to win. This season, for the first time in decades, fan
expectations for a Jets team are not only high but also realistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a team aspect, that can be a burden,'' Johnson said.
``From an individual standpoint, I always had high expectations for
myself. There's nothing wrong with having high expectations, as
long as you go out there and fulfill them.''
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, brings us to the head coach. Parcells frets and
Parcells worries. Sunday's opener marks the first time in six years
and only the 10th time in the team's 40-year history that the Jets
have opened at home. ``I feel good about opening at home,''
Parcells said Friday. ``I really do. I mean, 10 years out of 40?
That's 30 on the road, 10 at home opening day? Give me a break.''
</P>
<P>
   He has coached for 35 years, endured three decades' worth of
opening-day jitters. Still he gets nervous. ``Probably more so than
I used to,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With the sale of the team looming and with speculation that this
may be his last season in coaching, Parcells may actually feel a
greater weight than his team. He could become the first coach to
take three different teams to a Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Worry is on his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the time of year when there's a lot of apprehension
about what's going to happen,'' Parcells said. ``I was reading a
book on worry last night. It said there are only two things you
should worry about: the things you can't control and the things you
can.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Parcells' news conference, Wayne Chrebet, the Jets
wide receiver, hobbled through the locker room. This was his first
appearance since breaking his foot Sept. 3. The injury was a fluke
_ he was never touched on the play.
</P>
<P>
   For all the predictions of a stellar season, Chrebet's presence
was a reminder of how fragile fortunes can be. Perhaps Parcells
should have his book on worry distributed to the team. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ No one is a bigger humanitarian _ figuratively and
literally _ in the NBA than Dikembe Mutombo of the Hawks. And with
no labor strife to monitor this summer, the All-Star center was
able to use his offseason to engage in one of his passions: aiding
those in his homeland of Congo, the former Zaire. Tonight is the
culmination of his work: the Dikembe Mutombo Foundation's second
annual ``Building A Dream Dinner,'' featuring keynote speaker
Archbishop Desmond Tutu at the Buckhead Grand Hyatt Hotel. Proceeds
from the event go toward the foundation's ultimate ambition,
construction of a 300-bed general hospital in Congo. For tickets,

 TRICKS OF THE TRADE _ NET PORN PURVEYORS FORM INDUSTRY GROUP
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By DAVID LAZARUS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
SAN FRANCISCO -- David Clifford, a Petaluma, Calif., photographer,
became yet another in a long line of Internet porn providers at the
beginning of the year. He imagined it would be a pretty easy way to
make money.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's thinking about converting his site, Satin Girls, into
an online retail outlet for satin sheets and lingerie.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just so much competition,'' Clifford said. ``I don't
know whether it's worth it to keep trying.''
</P>
<P>
   If he does, at least he'll have some help. The increasing
difficulty of cutting it in the adult-entertainment business has
led to formation of a nonprofit industry group, Bay Area Adult
Sites, intended to help local entrepreneurs get a leg up, so to
speak, in one of the Internet's most crowded marketplaces.
</P>
<P>
   Two dozen homegrown adult sites have joined the group since its
creation in March. Members, ranging from the operators of Satin
Girls and Naked College to the people behind Asian Cherry Network,
meet every month or so to discuss industry trends and share
experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose is to get local people together, offline, to
network and make connections,'' said Caity McPherson, co-founder of
BAAS and operator of a site called Juicy Mango. ``We're giving
people the information and the tools to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   BAAS also aims to conduct outreach activities to help legitimize
the adult-entertainment industry, she said, and hopes to provide
assistance in helping local firms go public _ a feat that no online
porn provider has yet accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   The group also is organizing seminars to raise awareness about
related issues. The first such gathering was held last month at San
Francisco's Velvet Lounge, with a panel of adult-entertainment
experts discussing the opportunities and challenges posed by the
Internet, as well as what McPherson termed ``the tricks of the
trade.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Link exchange is so important,'' porn star Mimi Miyagi told
the packed crowd (after sharing certain other insights with patrons
of the Crazy Horse ``gentleman's club'' on Market Street in San
Francisco). ``You think you're sending away business, but what
you're actually doing is helping a visitor find something they want
and you don't have.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Hardie, an analyst with Forrester Research who is one of
the few to follow the Net's adult industry, estimates that the
market for online porn is now worth about $1 billion &UR;  &LR; in yearly
sales.
</P>
<P>
   While much of that market is dominated by a handful of
heavyweight players earning as much as $150 million annually,
Hardie estimates that at least 40,000 smaller sites still manage to
earn anywhere from a few thousand to a few million dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of folks making a ton of money,'' he said. ``But
you really can't survive if you're not part of a network.''
</P>
<P>
   That's where Bay Area Adult Sites comes in. The group aims to
fulfill networking needs by helping members share paying customers
_ the lifeblood of the online porn business. Merchandise sales
remain relatively small, accounting for about 3 percent of the
industry's profit. Subscription fees for premium services ranging
from image archives to video feeds are everything.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, a free site will be created offering R-rated images
or a few glimpses of a particular model. Once a customer's interest
has been piqued, he (or, to a considerably lesser extent, she) will
be steered toward a related site charging $5 to $20 a month for
access.
</P>
<P>
   Porn star Danni Ashe helped pioneer this business model after
embracing the Internet five years ago. Today, Danni's Hard Drive is
one of the most profitable adult sites on the Web, averaging 7
million hits a day and boasting more than 27,000 paying
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Ashe, whose business is based in Los Angeles but who keeps her
Internet servers in San Jose, is projecting revenues this year of
$5.5 million. Not bad for a 31-year-old former stripper.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of opportunity out there,'' she said. ``It's
just not as easy as it once was. Now that people are getting better
Internet connections, it's incumbent on site operators to provide
better content.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashe foresees an industry shakeout as demand grows for
high-speed video services. But others, including Forrester's
Hardie, insist that demand will remain strong for the
cheap-to-produce ``amateur'' content that is a staple of most
mom-and-pop porn sites.
</P>
<P>
   Such uncertainty poses an additional challenge for adult-site
entrepreneurs, who may have a hard time keeping up with industry
trends.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel like they're lost and alone in this market,'' said
BAAS' McPherson, who worked her way through San Francisco State
University by dancing at the Lusty Lady club on Kearny Street.
``Having a professional organization helps provide guidance and
support.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, McPherson is bringing some of her unique expertise
to a new site called Rouze, where she serves as ``director of
talent.'' In other words, she deals with the models.
</P>
<P>
   Rouze, which debuted this week, is the brainchild of Allen
Blankenship, a former vice president at San Francisco's Montgomery
Securities, and his wife Lauren, who received an MBA from Yale
University. It mixes weekly pictorials of nude women with more
mainstream editorial fare.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the highest end of the adult-entertainment industry,''
Allen said. ``We're like Maxim magazine. We're a men's lifestyle
destination that just happens to include pictorials of gorgeous
women.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sort of like Playboy in the '70s,'' Lauren added.
</P>
<P>
   Rouze better watch its back. Both Maxim and Playboy are now
preparing to unveil ``men's lifestyle'' portals capitalizing on the
exact same sex-and-stuff formula.
</P>
<P>
   These sites _ expensive to produce, even more costly to maintain
_ seek to extend their reach well beyond the traditional market for
adult content. Does this imply more difficult sailing ahead for
smaller niche players unable to mount such formidable operations?
</P>
<P>
   Not as far as Micah Jericho is concerned. His Passion
Productions in Pacifica, Calif., a BAAS member, is one of the most
successful online porn businesses in the Bay Area, and Jericho sees
no need to mess with tried-and-true approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our biggest trouble is managing the growth,'' he said. ``This
is a good, solid business. It's customer service, follow-ups _ all
the things that make a business successful. We could be selling ice
cream cones.''
</P>
<P>
   He's not selling ice cream, though. Instead, Jericho's sites
include Naughty Cards, Fetish Society and Adult Toy Chest. He's
expecting to gross about $1 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   And this raises a crucial point. For the thousands of
entrepreneurs who aren't just profiting but are profiting wildly
from online porn, there's a growing sense of frustration that, to
date, not a single one has managed to cash in on the mania for
Internet stocks and go public.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's simple,'' said BAAS' McPherson, ``No one wants to invest
in a company that has anything to do with porn.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a bit of an overstatement. Playboy, after all, is
publicly traded, as are other companies that publish or broadcast
adult materials. But so far no ``pure'' Internet porn company has
found its way to the market.
</P>
<P>
   Seth Warshavsky aims to change that. His Internet Entertainment
Group in Seattle, which operates its own adult Web sites and
provides content to numerous others, has finally lined up a willing
underwriter and is looking to go public within the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We plan to raise capital and expand distribution,'' a hectic
Warshavsky said by cell phone while driving to the airport for a
business meeting. ``I think our IPO will be very successful.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his company saw revenues of about $50 million last year
and has been profitable since 1997. No less important, Warshavsky
stressed, ``We have as strong a brand as Penthouse, Playboy or
Hustler in new media.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said it was no easy feat finding a financial
institution willing to join hands with an online porn merchant. ``A
lot of the Grade-A underwriters wanted to do the deal,'' Warshavsky
said, ``but stayed away because they were afraid of offending other
clients.''
</P>
<P>
   The underwriter that agreed to the deal, National Securities
Corp. in Seattle, still seems to be coming to terms with its new
client.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could position I.E.G. as an Internet business, a media
business or an adult-entertainment business,'' said Craig Gould,
the brokerage's vice president of corporate finance. ``Wall Street
will be looking at the fundamentals.''
</P>
<P>
   No date or price has been set for the IPO. But if Internet
Entertainment Group succeeds in its share offering, other
adult-industry firms can be expected to follow suit. For many,
though, the harsh spotlight of being publicly listed holds no
attraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The companies that go public will definitely have to tone
things down if they want to get investors,'' said Jane Duvall, who
runs an online guide to adult sites called JanesGuide.
</P>
<P>
   And Danni Ashe, who arguably has built up both the brand and the
business for a successful Internet IPO, said that while she's
exploring ``options for raising money,'' she has no intention to
take her company public.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm too much of a control freak for that,'' she said.

SOSA IN RARE FORM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (set ital) Today's homer-wacky, Dodgers-daffy and
quarterback-slappy edition of The Sporting Muse: (set ital)
</P>
<P>
   In the process of following Sammy Sosa's home run progress this
season, you've undoubtedly read or heard that no player has ever
hit more home runs than his team had victories. Through Thursday,
Sosa had 59 homer and the Cubs 56 wins.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that stat has a small asterisk. For a full season,
there's never been a player with more home runs than his team had
wins. But in 1997, Mark McGwire hit 24 home runs for the Cardinals
after being traded July 31 from Oakland, and the Cardinals won only
22 games the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   For the full 1997 season, McGwire hit 58 home runs and his teams
won only 64 games. He hit 34 for the A's, who had 42 wins at the
time of the trade, and 24 for the Cardinals, who won only 22. That
stands third on the all-time list for smallest margin between home
runs and wins.
</P>
<P>
   In 1935, Wally Berger hit 34 home runs for the Boston Braves, a
team that set a standard for losing with a 38-115 record, and in
1952, slugger Ralph Kiner hit 37 home runs for the 42 win Pirates.
Only two other players posted margins in single digits -- Cy
Williams hit 41 home runs for the 50-win 1923 Philadelphia
Phillies, and Ken Griffey had 40 home runs while the Mariners won
49 games in the 1994 strike seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Kiner set a standard for home runs for bad teams. He led the
National League in homers seven straight years (1946-52) and hit
294 during that span. But the Pirates had losing seasons every year
but one. In four of those seven years (1947, 1949-50 and 1951),
Kiner hit 189 homes and the Pirates won only 232 games.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire seems to be gaining on Kiner. Since 1996 and through
Thursday's games, McGwire has hit 234 home runs, and his teams have
won only 284 games in that span. ...
</P>
<P>
   The chances of either McGwire or Sosa setting a new home run
record are enhanced by their schedules. The Cubs and Cards meet for
three games in Chicago Sept. 20-22 and finish the season with a
three-game series in St. Louis Oct. 1-3.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams have only a handful of games left against playoff
contenders. So if pitchers take the same attitude as last season
and challenge the two with their best fastballs, we could see 70
fall.
</P>
<P>
   It will be doubly interesting to see how Cardinals pitchers
handle Sosa that last weekend if he's on the doorstep of 71 in
Mac's house. ...
</P>
<P>
   The impression left by the Mets' Mike Piazza, Roger Cedeno and
Orel Hershiser against the Dodgers Thursday was the baseball
equivalent of a tattoo. It represents all the Dodgers have lost and
become, and requires no further elaboration.
</P>
<P>
   But those still keeping score, the Dodgers were 44 games over
.500 between 1993, Piazza's rookie season, and the Dodgers May 15,
1998, deal that sent Piazza to Florida for a week before moving on
to New York. Since then, through Thursday, they are four games
under .500.
</P>
<P>
   And the Mets are 44 games over .500 since acquiring Piazza. This
is ample proof that the most important aspect of team chemistry and
leadership is winning. When a team wins, chemistry isn't an issue.
...
</P>
<P>
   Here's a clear-cut statement on the facts of quarterback life in
the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven teams will start the season with a quarterback who is
under .500 in his career: Arizona (Jake Plummer, 12-13), Atlanta
(Chris Chandler, 48-50), Baltimore (Scott Mitchell, 30-34),
Carolina (Steve Beuerlein, 30-35), Cincinnati (Jeff Blake, 22-32),
Indianapolis (Peyton Manning, 3-13), New Orleans (Billy Joe Hobert,
3-7), New York Giants (Kent Graham, 10-14), New York Jets (Vinny
Testaverde, 60-84), San Diego (Jim Harbaugh 60-63) and Tampa Bay
(Trent Dilfer, 31-35).
</P>
<P>
   Four others will start QBs with modest winning records:
Cleveland (Ty Detmer, 10-9), Oakland (Rich Gannon, 31-27),
Pittsburgh (Kordell Stewart, 18-14), Tennessee (Steve McNair,
20-18). And six others will start quarterbacks with less than ten
NFL starts: Chicago (Shane Matthews), Denver (Brian Griese),
Detroit (Charlie Batch), Philadelphia (Doug Pederson), St. Louis
(Kurt Warner) and Seattle (Jon Kitna).
</P>
<P>
   That's 21 of 31 teams. Wager accordingly. ...
</P>
<P>
   The chances of the Big West becoming an all-California
conference may get a boost from other conference shakeups.
</P>
<P>
   TCU and SMU of the Western Athletic Conference are interested in
joining Conference USA, Fresno State is trying to talk the Mountain
West Conference (the eight teams that broke off from the WAC) into
expanding to nine, and disenfranchised Tulsa officials are also
considering their options.
</P>
<P>
   That has led WAC officials to consider taking applications from
nine different schools, including all of the Big West schools that
play football -- Boise State, Idaho, Utah State, New Mexico State
and North Texas. New Mexico State and North Texas are also pursuing
membership in the Sun Belt Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The WAC is committed to adding Nevada (Reno) next season and
staying a nine-team league. But one plan on the table, should there
be defections, would expand the conference to 12 teams, go to two
six-team divisions, and create a conference championship football
game.
</P>
<P>
   TCU, SMU, Fresno State, Tulsa, Rice, San Jose State, UTEP and
Hawaii make up the WAC. The conference has also heard from three
independents in Louisiana about admission. ...
</P>
<P>
   The Big West Californians have also talked to the NCAA about
terms of splitting away and creating their own conference should no
one leaves the Big West.
</P>
<P>
   The primary point is how long a new league would have to wait
before being considered for an automatic berth in the NCAA
basketball tournament. If they could get an assurance of only one
year on the outside, they might be willing to consider that
alternative. ...
</P>
<P>
   Raider fans are alerted to a new book out this fall on Hall of
Fame center Jim Otto. ``The Pain of Glory'' showcases Otto's
football career, where he never missed a game, against the backdrop
of 38 surgeries and multiple hip and shoulder replacement
surgeries. Otto and Oakland Tribune sportswriter Dave Newhouse
collaborated. ...
</P>
<P>
   If I ever won Ben Stein's money, I would buy Ben Stein a new
pair of shoes. ...

MAYTAG SHARES TUMBLE 26 PERCENT ON CONCERNS OVER EARNINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa)   (bl)  
 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ For the last three years, Maytag Corp. has been a Wall
Street darling.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of its new line of expensive washing machines, ovens and
vacuum cleaners were booming, new features were a hit with
gadget-loving customers, and Maytag's stock price was rocketing,
enough to win its new chairman and chief executive, Lloyd Ward, a
spot on the cover of Business Week.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday, Maytag felt the ferocity of investor anger. Its
shares tumbled more than 26 percent after the company warned that
third-quarter earnings would come in well below earlier
projections, because of weaker-than-expected sales of its
lower-priced appliances.
</P>
<P>
   Maytag's shares lost $14.8125 to close at $41.75 in heavy
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The sharp selloff was part of a weeklong decline that left the
shares down 35.3 percent on growing concern that Maytag executives
may have been masking a slowdown or exaggerating growth prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Despite assurances made to Wall Street analysts earlier in the
week that the company's earnings were right on track, some analysts
said that rumors of more difficult times had pushed the stock price
down ahead of Friday's announcement. The volume was so unusually
high Thursday that the New York Stock Exchange asked the company
for an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   The company did not respond to that request. But early Friday,
before the market opened, Maytag officials released a statement
that said that rather than strong growth in the third quarter,
earnings would be flat from a year ago, at about 84 cents a share,
down from analyst projections of 99 cents a share, according to
First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen share erosion at the low end of the market,'' said
Thomas Schwartz, a spokesman at Maytag, which is based in Newton,
Iowa. ``We still have strength at the premium end, but that
strength wasn't enough to make up for the value end.''
</P>
<P>
   The company said that its strong growth and healthy gains in
market share in recent years were driven by a revamped operation
that emphasized innovative, high-end products, such as the Blodgett
Commercial oven and the Neptune washing machine _ products that
bolstered profits and sent a stock that was trading at $20 a share
in 1994 up to nearly $75 last May.
</P>
<P>
   The company's discount line of products, however, has not been
rebuilt and those products are now rapidly losing market share to
lines produced by Whirlpool, the nation's biggest maker of home
appliances, and GE Appliances, the No. 2 competitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been focusing on the high end,'' said Efraim Levy, an
analyst at Standard &AMP; Poor's Equity Group. ``But while some of
their strategy is right, it's a multifront battle, and they are
missing out on the back end. They should have known about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts are also questioning the company's
financial wisdom. Just days after giving analysts the thumb's up,
the company announced that inventory adjustments would result in
``higher operating costs and inefficiencies'' and that sales,
general and administration costs would be considerably higher than
a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``They overstated the number of units that would be sold in the
year, and earlier they had understated their overhead costs,'' said
Nicholas Heymann, an analyst at Prudential Securities. ``Their
estimates were way off.''
</P>
<P>
   The slowdown comes at a time when Whirlpool has been cutting the
cost of its low-end products and GE has contemplated selling home
appliances directly to customers over the Internet. Analysts also
said a new high-end Maytag product, the Gemini oven, got off to a
disappointing start this year.
</P>
<P>
   Other problems are also creeping up. ``It's not just the
question of the products, it's distribution and other things,''
said Richard Babyak, an editor at the Appliance Manufacturer, a
trade publication based in Cleveland. ``GE has done a lot to
solidify its move into the home builder market. And builders like
to put in low-end stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The news comes at a particularly inopportune time for Ward, who
took over as chairman and chief executive at Maytag just a month
ago, after the former Pepsico executive helped lead the turnaround
as president.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Ward _ who was just the second African-American
to head a large American company when he was appointed _ said
Friday that the company was ``taking steps to strengthen operation
in our core business through productivity, quality improvement and
cost reduction.''
</P>
<P>
   The company, however, said that it also expected earnings to be
flat in the fourth quarter of the year, even as the home appliance
market grows strongly in a robust economy, industry experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, not long after Maytag's warning, Whirlpool put out its
own statement assuring investors that its earnings would come in
line with expectations: growth of 30 percent in the third quarter
and 27 percent in the full year.
</P>
<P>
   To that, Maytag officials say they are going to bring the same
innovation that helped their top line products to the lower-end
line. When asked when that would be, though, Schwartz at Maytag
said, ``I can't predict when a new product will be out, but that's
what we're talking about.''

HUNTER HONORED AT YANKEE STADIUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Clubhouse attendants moved from locker to locker
Friday afternoon, hanging a restyled Yankee jersey in each.
Underneath the No. 5 logo that had been added to the left sleeve
after the death of Joe DiMaggio in spring training, black bands had
been added in memory of Jim ``Catfish'' Hunter, who died Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankee players stood on the top step of their dugout Friday
night, hats off, as public-address announcer Bob Sheppard asked for
a few moments of silence in memory of the Hall of Fame pitcher,
before a game with the Boston Red Sox. But the fans at Yankee
Stadium mostly cheered: they stood and clapped during a video
tribute to Hunter, and they roared again after Sheppard made a few
comments about him.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees manager Joe Torre said he heard the news about Hunter
while watching television Friday. ``I was shocked,'' Torre said.
``We knew this was going to happen eventually, but we didn't expect
it this soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre recalled how Hunter attended the Yankees' training camp in
the spring to visit with many of his old friends who work with the
team, from Ron Guidry and Mickey Rivers, to Chris Chambliss and
Willie Randolph. Hunter spoke openly about his condition, Torre
said, explaining how he couldn't use his arms.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter mostly chatted with pitchers in spring training, Paul
O'Neill remembered. Roger Clemens walked up to Hunter in spring
training to shake his hand and thanked him, for as Clemens
remembered, Hunter had been the first superstar to become a free
agent and sign for big money, paving the way for the generations of
players to follow.  &QL;

RELIGION: EAST TIMOR VIOLENCE TOUCHES A NOTED PRELATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before the violence in East Timor became a source of
international concern a few days ago, many Americans gave little
thought to the place, home to about 800,000 people on half of a
large island at the Indian Ocean's eastern edge.
</P>
<P>
   But those aware of East Timor's recent, sad history knew that
its people had experienced trauma that would rank with the
destruction visited on the populations of Bosnia and Kosovo. A
former Portuguese colony, East Timor was invaded in 1975 by
Indonesia, which has sovereignty over the island's other half.
Since then, at least 200,000 people have died in a famine and in
fighting between the Indonesian military and pro-independence
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   During the same period, one of East Timor's Roman Catholic
prelates, Bishop Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo, has emerged as a
spokesman for peace and the dignity of its people, sharing the 1996
Nobel Peace Prize with Jose Ramos-Horta, the chief spokesman for
the province's resistance movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very calm man, but he's also very decisive,'' said
Thomas Quigley, an American who spent last weekend with him, just
days before the bishop fled the violence for Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Quigley, who has met Belo several times, is a policy adviser on
Asian affairs at the U.S. Catholic Conference, an organization
affiliated with the National Conference of Catholic Bishops. He
arrived in East Timor to visit the bishop last Saturday, the day
the United Nations announced the results of a referendum in which
the East Timorese, after 24 years of occupation, voted
overwhelmingly against a proposal to remain linked with Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   After arriving at the airport, Quigley said, he caught a ride
into East Timor's main city, Dili, in a pickup truck with three
South Korean television journalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came into the city and saw nobody, nobody, except police
patrols,'' he said, adding that the houses seemed empty, the stores
shuttered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then,'' he said, ``we got to the bishop's compound and found
out where all the people were.'' They had all packed inside the
compound seeking safety, apparently fearing militias armed by the
Indonesian military.
</P>
<P>
   After the referendum's results were announced, Quigley said,
Belo encouraged supporters of independence to be restrained in
their elation, and to think in terms of people working together
rather than of winners and losers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was exercising the role he has played all along, the
mediator, the peacemaker,'' Quigley said. ``He never came out for
independence directly. His position all along was that the people
had to decide.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day Quigley attended a Mass that Belo celebrated for at
least 1,500 people who had gathered on the church's property. The
bishop also met with journalists, answering some questions,
declining others. ``He can be abrupt,'' Quigley said. ``If he has
to say, `I don't know,' he says that right away. He has a winning
personality, but he's tough, very tough.''
</P>
<P>
   A considerably more extensive portrait of Belo can be found in a
recently published biography, ``From the Place of the Dead'' (St.
Martin's), by Arnold S. Kohen. (Its brief introduction, by the way,
was written by the Dalai Lama, another winner of the Nobel Peace
Prize, who serves a similar role as a spokesman for his people.)
</P>
<P>
   Kohen's book, which Quigley praised, also describes the recent
history of East Timor. Since the Indonesian invasion, the status of
the Catholic Church there has risen, as a result of its important
role in the lives of the Timorese.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a place where simply walking on the street could be
deadly,'' Kohen writes, ``it was the only public arena not
controlled by the Indonesian invaders, the only local institution
that provided a measure of protection to local people.''
</P>
<P>
   When the anti-independence militias began attacks in Dili on
Monday, they burned Belo's residence. This week the Vatican said
churches and Catholic officials were being made targets of violence
by the militias. Priests and nuns have reportedly been killed, and
another prelate, Bishop Basilio do Nascimento, has fled from the
city of Baucau into the countryside.
</P>
<P>
   Quigley said that Belo, having fled to Australia, had now left
there for Europe and would visit the Vatican, but that Kohen had
spoken to him and found him resolute, saying the task ahead for
Timorese like himself would be to return and help rebuild East
Timor.

LOS ALAMOS PUNISHES 3 FOR ROLE IN SPY INQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Los Alamos National Laboratory said Friday that
it had taken disciplinary action against a former director of the
laboratory and two other current or former officials for their
roles in the government's investigation of evidence of China's
theft of U.S. nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   The action by the laboratory and the University of California,
which manages the New Mexico laboratory for the Energy Department,
came in response to recommendations by Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson that the three be disciplined for mishandling the
espionage investigation at the laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   UC president Richard Atkinson and Los Alamos director John
Browne acted after receiving the findings of a panel of outside
experts created to review the matter, according to a written
statement the institutions issued late Friday. In each case,
Atkinson and Browne administered more severe discipline than
proposed by the panel, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The statement did not identify the three people disciplined, but
government officials said Friday that they wee Sig Hecker, director
of Los Alamos in 1986-97, who still works there as a scientist;
Terry Craig, until recently a counterintelligence team leader at
the laboratory, and Robert Vrooman, former chief of
counterintelligence. Craig is still employed at the laboratory;
Vrooman has retired but works as a contractor.
</P>
<P>
   Hecker will receive a letter from Atikinson ``regarding his
responsibilities at Los Alamos during the security investigation,''
the statement said. Craig will receive a formal letter of
reprimand, restricted job assignment for at least five years, a
freeze in salary and probationary-type measures. Vrooman will be
precluded from providing consulting services to the laboratory for
at least five years.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Richardson recommended that disciplinary action be
taken after he received a report from the Energy Department's
inspector general that reviewed the way Los Alamos and the
department handled the espionage case.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the department said Richardson would have
preferred tougher discipline, but still ``believes the efforts
undertaken by the University of California and Los Alamos have been
thorough.''

FBI DIDN'T TELL CONGRESS OF TEAR GAS USE AT WACO
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The FBI sent Congress a laboratory report in 1995
about the agency's assault on the Branch Davidian compound without
a page that referred to the use of flammable tear gas canisters,
according to a Justice Department memorandum.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure that such devices were used in the 1993 assault
has sparked a crisis for officials at both agencies, which have
claimed the government did nothing that could have started a fire
at the compound. Investigators later found the bodies of 80 people.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department recently sent Congress a complete copy of
the report, which shows that officials at the bureau's Washington
headquarters knew in December 1993 that combustible devices were
used.
</P>
<P>
   The report seemed to cast doubt on the assertions of some
law-enforcement authorities that officials in Washington were
unaware, until recently, that FBI agents fired combustible tear gas
canisters on the day of the assault. FBI officials would not
comment on the report.
</P>
<P>
   But law-enforcement officials said the agency gave a complete
copy of the report to the Justice Department in 1995, suggesting
that the department was responsible missing page.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few days, a complete report was sent to the House
Government Reform and Oversight Committee, which has sought
information about the use of flammable tear gas rounds in its
re-examination of the government's actions in Waco.
</P>
<P>
   The lab report itemized evidence collected in Waco after the
assault on April 19, 1993, but does not clearly show that the tear
gas rounds were combustible. It refers to them by military
designations, listing ``a fired U.S. military 40mm shell casing
which originally contained a CS tear gas round,'' and ``expended
40mm tear gas projectiles.''
</P>
<P>
   Attached to the lab report is a second, more recent Justice
Department memorandum, dated Sept. 2, 1999. That memorandum,
written by James Touhey Jr. a Justice Department lawyer, said the
department had sent a version of the report to Congress in 1995
when the same House panel was holding hearings.
</P>
<P>
   But the earlier version did not include page 49, which contained
the only references to combustible tear gas rounds, the memorandum
said.
</P>
<P>
   Myron Marlin, a spokesman for the Justice Department, said the
circumstances surrounding the missing page would be matter for John
Danforth, the former senator and now the special counsel
investigating whether the government misled anyone about the events
at Waco.
</P>
<P>
   Marlin said the complete lab report had been turned over lawyers
for families of Branch Davidian members who are suing the
government in Texas in a wrongful death lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth said Friday that he was committed to making a full
public report on what occurred, even if that interfered with
efforts to find out whether any federal agents or government
officials broke the law.

EDITORIAL: A BLUEPRINT FOR ULSTER'S POLICE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, September
11:
</P>
<P>
   Northern Ireland's police force, the Royal Ulster Constabulary,
has long been one of the region's most controversial institutions.
It is viewed by many _ perhaps most _ Catholics as a Protestant
Unionist force, and by many Protestants as a proud bulwark against
Irish Republican Army terrorism. Last year's Good Friday peace
agreement set up a commission to propose reforms. On Thursday that
commission, headed by former Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten,
delivered its report.
</P>
<P>
   The report arrives at a critical moment in the peace process,
which has been stalled by a battle over whether the IRA should
relinquish its weapons before its political wing, Sinn Fein, joins
the proposed Northern Ireland cabinet. This argument has poisoned
the atmosphere and emboldened opponents of peace on both sides, who
are pressing moderates to reject the Patten report. But it is a
blueprint for sensible and necessary reforms that deserves prompt
adoption.
</P>
<P>
   Its central message is that the police must be de-politicized.
The force, which now answers to London, would report to a 19-member
board, to include members of the major local political parties that
endorsed the peace agreement. That board would appoint the police
leadership and hold the police accountable for their behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The commission also recommends changing the institution's name
to the more neutral Northern Ireland Police Service, and removing
all politically inflammatory symbols. It would make special efforts
to recruit Catholics, with the goal of being 30 percent Catholic in
10 years. Catholics make up 43 percent of Northern Ireland's
population, but only 8 percent of the police force _ because the
force has often been abusive of Catholics, and because the IRA has
targeted Catholic police. The new force would also change its
training and approach, emphasizing human rights and community
policing.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendations stop short of some needed reforms. The
report would not ban the use of potentially deadly plastic bullets
for crowd control. Nor would it abolish Britain's repressive
emergency legislation used to prosecute terror suspects, or purge
the police of officers accused of brutality.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these flaws, Britain should quickly pass the laws
necessary to carry out the report. It has been praised by Dublin
and London and, surprisingly, by the RUC's chief constable. So far
Sinn Fein is reserving judgment, but should find much to like. Then
the IRA should agree to give up some weapons, a largely symbolic
gesture that would nevertheless reinvigorate the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   David Trimble, chief of the Ulster Unionists, has condemned the
report and especially its proposal for a new name. This hard-line
tack may be largely designed to placate the extremists in his
party. But when it signed on to the peace agreement, Trimble's
party recognized that Northern Ireland could not become a modern
society without a modern police force. He should muster the courage
to endorse a plan for doing just that.  &QL;

 CITIES, MERCHANTS SCRAMBLE TO FIGHT SUPERSTORE-BAN BILL
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By CAROL EMERT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
SAN FRANCISCO -- Local governments and discount superstores were
scrambling to regroup Friday after the state Legislature passed a
surprise bill that would prohibit many new Costcos, Kmarts and
Wal-Marts from being built in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will do anything and everything we can to try to persuade
the governor to veto this bill,'' said Dan Carrigg, a lobbyist with
the League of California Cities.
</P>
<P>
   AB84, backed by some of the Legislature's most powerful
Democrats, was put up for a vote just hours after it was printed,
giving opponents inadequate time to fight, said Carrigg. ``There
are still people out there who have no idea this bill exists, let
alone that it already went to the governor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would prevent city and county governments from
approving permits for stores 100,000 square feet or bigger that
devote at least 15,000 square feet to sales of ``nontaxable
merchandise'' such as food and drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Passed by the state Senate on Thursday and the Assembly on
Friday, the legislation has the support of labor unions and
supermarkets but is opposed by cities and mass merchants such as
Wal-Mart, Kmart and Costco.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional supermarkets are losing market share to ``big-box''
stores that combine groceries and general merchandise under one
roof. That's a threat to labor because the unions have organized
most supermarket chains but never managed to organize a big-box
store.
</P>
<P>
   Local governments oppose the bill because it would usurp their
right to choose which businesses they want in their communities,
said Carrigg.
</P>
<P>
   But the bill's opponents face formidable hurdles. Together,
California supermarkets and labor unions donated hundreds of
thousands of dollars to Davis' governor's race.
</P>
<P>
   Davis also has personal ties to the supermarket industry; his
wife, Sharon Davis, worked until last year for the Ralphs/Food 4
Less Foundation. The governor's spokesman, Michael Bustamante,
said, ``one has absolutely nothing to do with the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis has not made any decisions about AB84, Bustamante said.
Like most in Sacramento, Calif., he was taken by surprise when it
surfaced late this week and passed in the Legislature's
end-of-session rush. The bill was not sent through committee and
had not had any previous public disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just heard about it at 10 o'clock (Thursday) night,'' said
Bustamante. ``I think everyone is just beginning to hear about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill was spearheaded by the United Food and Commercial
Workers Union in cooperation with Safeway and other supermarket
chains, which began planning their legislative strategy several
weeks ago, said sources in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   The UFCW's John Perez said big-box stores are bad for
communities. ``They use food as a loss leader to put
traditional-format grocery stores out of business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's backers in the California Legislature, including
Senate President Pro Tem John Burton and Assembly Speaker Antonio
Villaraigosa, made similar arguments. Safeway did not respond to a
request for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Davis will get the bill early next week and will have 30 days to
either sign or veto it.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would impose a broader ban on superstores than
initially believed. While it apparently was designed to curtail
grocery-general merchandise combo stores, such as Wal-Mart
Supercenters, Costcos and Super Kmarts, it could also apply to many
regular-sized Kmart and Wal-Mart stores, said spokespersons for
Wal-Mart and Kmart.
</P>
<P>
   The smaller format stores generally contain pharmacies and
several aisles of packaged food that together can exceed the bill's
allowable ceiling for nontaxable items.
</P>
<P>
   The bill apparently would nix construction permits for both new
stores and store expansions that exceed its square-footage
mandates.
</P>
<P>
   One point for Davis to consider is whether the bill is likely to
pass legal muster.
</P>
<P>
   The commerce clause of the U.S. Constitution prevents states
from putting an ``undue burden'' on interstate commerce, unless the
states can prove that there is a significant benefit in doing so,
said Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional law professor at the
University of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   If Gov. Davis signs the bill, and it is challenged in court, the
state will have a hard time proving a significant benefit because
it does not apply to all superstores, just a certain group of them,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only purpose of this bill seems to be helping some
companies at the expense of others. ... This seems to me to be
classic special-interest legislation,'' Chemerinsky said.
</P>
<P>
   But Perez countered that the state is following in the footsteps
of many municipalities. ``The reality is that cities across the
state have taken similar actions (to limit superstores) because
they think it is in the best interest of their long-term economic
development.''
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart operates 110 Wal-Mart stores and 24 Sam's Clubs in
California. It has not yet opened any of its Wal-Mart Supercenters
here. Those stores include a full-sized supermarket and can range
up to 200,000 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   Kmart operates 174 stores in California including eight Super
Kmarts, which contain full-sized grocery stores. Costco operates 88
stores here, and Target is experimenting with large-format stores
but has not yet opened any in California.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The sequel sister, 17-year-old Serena Williams,
punched her fist in the air Friday and announced that she was ready
to take on any and all comers for this 1999 U.S. Open title.
</P>
<P>
   After knocking out defending champion Lindsay Davenport in a
power-packed semifinal where might made right, Williams had ample
reason to feel invincible. With a curious blend of professional
pugilism and teen-age effervescence, the seventh-seeded Williams,
whom her older sister, Venus, calls ``the one with the muscles,''
reached her first career Grand Slam final at her second U.S. Open
by dethroning the second-seeded Davenport, 6-4, 1-6, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   But the much-anticipated, and potentially historic, Williams
family finale did not transpire. In the other semifinal, where the
coast-to-coast footwork and devilish trick shots made for riveting
watching as the evening chill closed in, top-seeded Martina Hingis,
intent on restoring her reputation after breakdowns at the French
Open and Wimbledon, reached her third straight U.S. Open final with
a 6-1, 4-6, 6-3 defeat of the more established Williams sister, the
third-seeded Venus Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis, thrilled by the outcome of Friday's 2-hour-1-minute
workout, raised her eyebrows at the prospect of having to face yet
another Williams sister after a night's sleep: ``Another one? I was
so far never able at the same tournament to beat both of them. But
I just didn't want that finals to happen: Williams-Willliams.''
</P>
<P>
   Serena Williams, 2-3 against Hingis and without a victory in
three attempts against her sibling, claimed the identity of her
final-round opponent would be immaterial once she got on court
again. ``I'm not through yet, the tournament isn't over yet, I have
one more round to win,'' Williams said after fulfilling the destiny
her father/coach, Richard, predicted for her at this Open.
</P>
<P>
   Right from the opening day of the tournament, Richard Williams
had suggested that his daughters could end up meeting in this
final, and both of his daughters took him seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad's been right about most things,'' said Serena Williams,
who reiterated that Richard Williams, with some expert assistance
from his wife, Brandi, is the best and only coaching team she and
her sister require to complete their assault on the women's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did my part, now Venus has to do hers,'' the younger
Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   But Venus Williams, who seemed to cover a hundred miles of hard
court only to be hobbled by cramping in both thighs by the end her
match with Hingis, didn't hold up her end of the family bargain.
The 19-year-old, who has yet to win a Grand Slam and hasn't reached
a Grand Slam final since 1997, when she faced Hingis as an unseeded
player in the final of the U.S. Open, committed 60 unforced errors,
dropped her serve nine times, and saw her record against the
intractable Hingis drop to 3-8. On her 11th and last double fault,
she buried both serves in the net at double break point, granting
Hingis, who managed to hyperventilate and grin simultaneously, the
chance to serve out the match at 5-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately I was unable to close it out; I guess the
cramping is just from fatigue,'' said Williams, who immediately
switched her allegiance to her sister. ``Now she's playing for two
people; hopefully I gave Martina a good workout.''
</P>
<P>
   About her father's prediction, Williams said simply, ``He's 50
percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond handing off a hairbrush to Venus when the sisters brushed
shoulders in the locker room as Serena returned from the Arthur
Ashe Stadium and Venus headed out to face Hingis, Serena said there
was no sibling celebration of her coup. That had to wait. But
Serena Williams, who watched her older sister turn professional at
14 and then grab the glory here in 1997, has had plenty of
experience with patience, and it served her well Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Her 1-hour-52-minute slugfest with Davenport was delayed until
late afternoon by persistent cloudbursts at the National Tennis
Center, which buzzed like a beauty salon as the frantic grounds
crew brandished its electric dryers and towels inside the stadium.
When their match finally got under way, Davenport was the more
frazzled player, spraying groundstrokes, misjudging Williams'
serve, and getting into trouble on her own.
</P>
<P>
   Though Davenport, who dodged two match points in her
quarterfinal against Mary Pierce, managed to recover from a 0-40
deficit in the seventh game of the opening set, Williams held for
5-4 with an ace and then forged on and broke the defending champion
for the set. Davenport erased a 0-30 deficit, but Williams charged
the net and used a razor-edged forehand volley to push things to
deuce, and a pair of netted forehands from Davenport gave Williams
the first set.
</P>
<P>
   But the tempo turned in the middle set, wherein Davenport, aware
that she was being outserved and outslugged, began rushing the net
and forcing Williams to pass her. Suddenly Williams, who hadn't
faced a break point in the opening set, was on the defensive, a
posture inconsistent with her game and her personality. Williams
dropped her serve in the first, fifth, and seventh games. Ahead,
5-1, Davenport broke the teen-ager at love with a bullying backhand
return down the line at triple set point.
</P>
<P>
   At that point Williams regrouped. ``I got really determined,''
she said of her response to Davenport's second-set strategy. ``She
was just attacking literally everything; she's so powerful it was
all I could do to just be out there.''
</P>
<P>
   But then Williams reminded herself that Davenport was the
title-holder here. ``I was like, `I'm tired of this, I want
something also.'''
</P>
<P>
   Williams took the third set, and the match, by turning up her
aggression. After Davenport held for 1-0, Williams, remembering her
service breakdowns in the middle set, held for 1-1 by finishing the
game with three straight aces. Then came the fist in the air, the
first sign that Williams was beginning to believe that Davenport, a
player against whom she was 2-0 on hard courts, could be had on
this one, too.
</P>
<P>
   The fist went up after Williams took herself to a break point in
the seventh game with another pulverizing crosscourt forehand
volley, and she converted the break for 4-3 with a half-hit
forehand return that fell so short Davenport wasn't able to reach
it in time to shovel it up.
</P>
<P>
   In the next game, where Davenport squandered five break points,
Williams pumped out three double faults but hung on for a critical
5-3 edge when Davenport dumped a backhand volley in the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt that if I won that game, I would have a great chance of
winning the match because all I had to do was hold serve. I felt if
Lindsay won the game, I would have to fight,'' said Williams. ``I
was never going to give up. I never at one time felt I was going to
lose,'' Williams admitted.
</P>
<P>
   After Davenport saved a match point with a forehand volley
during her service game at 3-5, Williams, serving for the victory
at 5-4, earned a second match point with a 108 mph ace and danced
into her first slam final when the defending champion bent a
backhand return wide.

VENUS SURVIVES WILLIAMS SISTERS' TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The dream expired at 10 minutes after 8 on a cloudy
evening in a sweat box called Arthur Ashe Stadium. It dropped dead
with Venus's last two serves that plopped feebly into the bottom of
the net, as 20,009 witnesses gasped, and knew it was over, even
though a few minutes remained.
</P>
<P>
   It was a wonderful dream, that these two stunning kids, the
Sisters Sledgehammer _ Venus and Serena _ would assure a Williams
victory in the US Open by sweeping their foes out of Friday's
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   That was the brazen prediction of the man who had this dream
long ago, the patriarch Richard Williams, and worked so hard to
make it happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``My two girls will be in the final,'' he announced before the
tournament began, and he almost looked like Nostradamus Jr., as
Venus recovered her equilibrium after a hazy first set, grabbed the
second and splintered Martina Hingis's serve to go ahead, 2-1, in
the decisive third.
</P>
<P>
   Venus was galloping and the Williams daily double seemed about
to pay off. But Hingis, the tiny wicked witch of the west of
Florida (she recently moved to Wesley Chapel), intervened and won
by a nose, 6-1, 4-6, 6-3. The Williams clan had to settle for a
split of the day-night doubleheader at Flushing Meadow during which
Serena led off by deposing the champion, Lindsay Davenport, 6-4,
1-6, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   SMOKING IS NOT PERMITTED IN THE STADIUM.
</P>
<P>
   The order appeared several times on the gigantic scoreboard
during this marvelous day _ and it was defied by the Sisters
Sledgehammer and Davenport and Hingis. They produced such smoking
shotmaking that you wondered how they could avoid burning the joint
down.
</P>
<P>
   Never in the annals of the tournament had four women persisted
for so long in their Sunday punching. They raised the level
incredibly, and kept raising like mad poker players.
</P>
<P>
   Little Sister, the powerful 17-year-old now fits into today's
final that Venus lost at the same age two years ago. There's still
some dreaming to do for the Williams clan, a brood of five
daughters, whom mom Oracene and pop Richard lifted from a dangerous
Los Angeles neighborhood and transplanted in Florida with tennis as
the escape device.
</P>
<P>
   And there's some dreaming over in East Orange, N.J., where a
weary lady of 72, Althea Gibson, will be looking at the TV screen
and softly cheering for Serena. She has told friends that it's
about time some young woman followed in her sneaker steps.
Forty-one years have passed since Althea, who crashed the game's
color bar, then crashed the US Championships' winner's circle for a
second straight time.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson, the black pioneer, wasn't really wanted when she was
finally permitted to enter the tournament at age 24 in 1950. She,
too, was an exciting performer, but there was no money in what was
an amateur game.
</P>
<P>
   Serena can carry off $750,000 this afternoon if she gets even
for Big Sister against Hingis. Times have changed. The people who
operate the game couldn't wait for Venus and Serena to grow up into
what they are: a pair of prodigies with thunder in their strokes
and wings on their heels.
</P>
<P>
   It was a long damp day's journey into lights at the Meadow, and
it wound up with a bantamweight, Hingis, scoring a technical
knockout over the heavyweight, Venus.
</P>
<P>
   Those final two serves that cooked Venus, a double fault
awarding the eighth game and a 5-3 lead to Martina, were evidence
of legs that wanted no more. Cramping, she took an injury timeout,
but the trainer couldn't bring her around. ``I guess I didn't drink
enough water. I guess cramping is just fatigue, or you're sick,''
Venus said, offering a wan smile.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, she came out of her corner gamely for the last
round, and kept punching. Venus seized the first point against
Martina's serve, and the mob went wild. Was she recovering?
</P>
<P>
   Hingis wondered, too, and she didn't know she was going to win
until committing the shot of the day that took her to match point,
40-15. Venus finessed a drop volley, and it looked like 30-all, but
. . .
</P>
<P>
   But here came Hingis, a galloper herself, hurtling from a far
corner across the entire court in pursuit of the rubber lemon. It
was a frenzied dozen-yard dash.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm running . . . boom, boom, boom, every step. I thought I
could get to it, but the shot . . .'' she laughs. ``I never made a
shot like that. I've had to hit one-handed backhands, but not like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow she got her racket under the ball just as it was about
to bounce twice, and flicked it over the net sticks and into the
corner.''
</P>
<P>
   The disbelievers roared, and then this plucky mite reached back
for her mightiest delivery of the magnificent two hours, a
100-m.p.h. service winner.
</P>
<P>
   That punctured the dream for this year. But Serena and her
sledgehammer are still on the loose, and Althea Gibson remains
hopeful.

New York City is not the size of the health crisis _ it is
relatively modest and expected to remain so _ but the fact that the
disease turned up there at all. These are the first cases of St.
Louis encephalitis ever detected in the city.
</P>
<P>
   In the 36 years that this has been a reportable disease
nationwide, there had been only nine cases recorded in all of New
York state, the most recent in 1978. So health authorities
everywhere _ at the city, state and national levels _ were caught
by surprise when a cluster of worrisome neurological cases detected
in Queens were identified in laboratory tests as St. Louis
encephalitis. So far there have been nine confirmed cases and three
deaths, with an additional 60 or so cases under some degree of
suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody yet knows where the invading virus came from, as this is
a devilishly difficult disease to track. The virus is typically
carried by birds that can fly in from anywhere. Mosquitoes then
suck blood from the birds and can transmit the virus to humans.
That is what is presumed to have happened in Queens, although no
one can be sure until medical epidemiologists complete their
sleuthing.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the virus is here, the public has good reason to take
some precautions but no reason to panic. There is no need to leave
the city or keep children home from school to avoid infection. The
likelihood of any individual becoming ill is quite small. The chief
risk is to the elderly. Those stricken in New York range in age
from 58 to 87. All three deaths were in people over the age of 60.
</P>
<P>
   There is no vaccine to prevent infection and no medicine that
cures the disease. The only protection is to avoid getting bitten
by infected mosquitoes, by staying inside at dusk and dawn, wearing
protective clothing outside, or dousing oneself with insect
repellent. The most likely vector, the Culex pipiens mosquito, is
found virtually everywhere in the metropolitan area. But the
overwhelming majority of mosquitoes are not infected, and the
overwhelming majority of people bitten do not fall ill.
</P>
<P>
   City health officials estimate, based on experience elsewhere,
that even in areas where the disease has been found, only 1 in
every 1,000 mosquitoes carries the virus, and even if a person is
bitten by an infected mosquito, the odds of becoming ill are only 1
in 300. But each outbreak differs. In an epidemic in Dallas in
1966, the infection rate in mosquitoes reached 1 in every 167
tested. That is still a small percentage but a bit unnerving should
one be caught in a cloud of, say, 167 mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   The city seems to be taking responsible steps to control the
outbreak. It is spraying mosquitoes from the air and on the ground,
mostly with malathion, a pesticide that is widely used in home
gardens and is more benign than most. The concentrations sprayed
are fatal to mosquitoes but so diluted they pose little threat to
humans. The spraying will continue until the first frost arrives
and suppresses the mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   The city has not routinely been conducting an aggressive
surveillance campaign to look for the encephalitis virus in
mosquitoes or an annual spraying campaign to suppress mosquito
populations. The rationale, which seems sound, was that the threat
was so remote it did not deserve high priority in a city with other
pressing health needs.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the first outbreak in the city's history has occurred,
that approach will need revision. The virus can often find places
to survive the winter, and outbreaks elsewhere have often been
followed by another outbreak the following year. For the next few
years, at least, it would make sense to monitor the birds and the
mosquitoes and, at the first sign of the virus, or even
pre-emptively before any virus is found, start spraying.

AS LEAGUES' ROLE FADES,   COLEMAN DECIDES TO QUIT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Ill.)   By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With league presidents on the verge of becoming figureheads,
Leonard Coleman, not surprisingly, has decided to resign as
National League president.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman, in his sixth season, will leave after the World Series,
a baseball official who requested anonymity said Friday. He has
been headed in that direction since Commissioner Bud Selig began a
move to centralize all league functions under Major League
Baseball, including managing the umpiring staffs of the two
leagues, disciplining on-field personnel and creating schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman, baseball's highest ranking black official, issued no
statement about his impending resignation, but he opposed the
removal of power from the league offices. In his tenure, he has
been the most outspoken official on minority affairs, working out
front and behind the scenes to induce clubs to increase their
hiring of members of minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is unclear what Coleman will do, he may join the
campaign of George W. Bush for the Republican nomination for
president. Coleman has been active in Republican Party affairs and
served in several different roles in New Jersey state government.
</P>
<P>
   Fay Vincent, the former baseball commissioner, brought Coleman
into baseball in 1992 as executive director for market development,
and he became National League president March 1, 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did a terrific job,'' Vincent said Friday. ``He got
involved with race issues and the promotion of baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Vincent recalled that Coleman was instrumental in working to
raise the interest in baseball among black fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when he first came to baseball, he said the two
most important magazines in the black community were Jet and
Ebony,'' Vincent related in a telephone interview. ``But he said
they never write about baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   At Coleman's urging, Vincent said, Coleman accompanied him on a
visit to the publisher of the magazines in Chicago. ``He said, `No
one ever came to see me, and it matters that you came,''' Vincent
related.
</P>
<P>
   The move toward centralization, which many people feel was long
overdue, created disputes between Coleman and the commissioner's
office, particularly with Sandy Alderson, executive director for
baseball operations.
</P>
<P>
   Among other matters, Coleman and Alderson disagreed over the way
the commissioner's office handled the recent dispute with the
umpires.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have gone badly,'' said one lawyer connected to
baseball. ``There were a lot of intramural squabbles. Once Bud
decided to combine the umpiring staffs, there was nothing for those
offices to do, so I'm not surprised he's leaving.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Coleman, Gene Budig, the American League president, has
not fought hard against the move to remove the league presidents'
duties.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in his tenure as NL president, Coleman was a candidate
to become commissioner. He explored the possibility after Selig,
then the acting commissioner, repeatedly said he did not want the
job permanently.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman's candidacy did not get very far, however, just as the
search committee did not get very far in its consideration of
possible candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his public and private denials of his interest in the
job, Selig accepted it in July 1998. He initiated his plan to
centralize league functions shortly afterward. His office made
plans to merge the umpiring staffs under his management this season
but could not without negotiating the terms under the collective
bargaining agreement.

PATRIOTS WILLING TO PAY THE PRICE FOR SUCCESS

<P>
   They may not be getting any better, but you can't say the
Patriots aren't trying when you look at two facts.
</P>
<P>
   First, they are one of just three teams that has spent over the
salary cap. In fact, New England has until 4 p.m. Saturday to find
a way to move $636,000 in salary, or the league will force them to
get rid of a player or two before kickoff Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the most recent survey of ticket prices in the NFL shows
the Pats at $39.45 for the average ticket, which would place them
26th out of 31 teams. So they are spending near the top of the
league for players and charging near the bottom for tickets.

   Red Sox boss John Harrington says he is more confident than ever
that the financial plans for a new Fenway Park are feasible. The
Sox had Fleet look over the team's proposal this week. This doesn't
mean that Fleet will end up with the Sox in the final analysis _
Fleet will put the Red Sox' money plan up against present
marketplace prices, and state whether it thinks it is doable. There
has been much skepticism in the Boston business community by some
very successful people who say there is no way the plan can work on
a $535 million projection. We shall see . . . Sign of the times:
Never before has there been five major league teams and five NHL
teams for sale at the same time. Meanwhile, the Yankees and Mets
are trying to pull off mergers. When the NHL met to approve the
sale of the Pittsburgh Penguins to Mario Lemieux, Bruins owner
Jerry Jacobs asked Lemieux the amount of his player payroll.
Lemieux said $32 million for this year. Jacobs asked what his home
gate was for a sellout. The answer was $800,000. ``So I said to
Mario, well, there's no way you can make money, right?'' said
Jacobs. ``And he answered that was right.'' . . . In the aftermath
of its 30-29 overtime win over Baylor (in a game in which it
dominated), Boston College will spend much of its practice time
passing and defending the pass. Head coach Tom O'Brien felt his
team showed it could run the ball and stop the run. Look for
freshman running back William Green to get more carries each week.

   I would rather see Wilton Veras play third base for the Sox the
rest of the year rather than reinsert John Valentin, who took
himself out of a playoff run with patellar tendinitis, which is
nothing. Every pro football or basketball player goes into a game
with worse injuries than that. Valentin has been going downhill for
two years. He has no range, and without question, Veras is better
than Valentin getting the ball to his left and in front of him. He
also runs the bases better. When the realization hit that his
season was a bust, Valentin started complaining about pain in his
knee. The MRI showed there is nothing structurally wrong. He does
have a little swelling below the kneecap from the tendinitis, but
he should have been embarrassed to miss any playing time. The Sox
have to wonder if he is done. His bat speed and foot speed has
decreased from two years ago . . . Speaking of bat speed, Val's
pal, Mo Money, now batting under .260, has hit .219 since the
All-Star break, entering Friday night's game with Minnesota. Mo
likes to hover over the plate, which is OK if you can handle the
fastball inside. Now the book is to pitch him hard inside, under
the hands, and he has not been able to handle it . . . Bob Cousy,
Tom Heinsohn, and Walter McCarty, all taking part in the same
interview session, seemed to agree that the Celtics' rise or fall
this season will be in the hands of point guard Kenny Anderson.
``Anderson has to do a better job of spreading the ball around, but
it has been difficult for him to do because he is a better player
in transition than in the halfcourt game, and the Celtics are
playing the halfcourt game,'' said Cousy. Said Heinsohn, ``The
first five or six games Kenny was here, he looked like the answer.
He made everyone around him better. But that didn't happen last
year. He is capable of leading the offense, and if he plays the way
he can, the Celtics will be a lot better.''

   Enough of Michael Bishop. The kid looked great in preseason
running around and making plays. But you're not a big-time
quarterback in the NFL until you prove you can throw with accuracy
standing still. Right now, Drew Bledsoe is one of the most accurate
passers in the league. He is durable, and he can get it done in
prime time, at the end of the game. Why would you want to take him
out at any point? Ridiculous . . . From a state trooper to a friend
of this humble scribe: ``(Rod) Rutledge is lucky to be alive. A few
more feet one side or the other and it would have been very
serious.'' Although they won't say it for the record, the troopers
at the accident scene early Friday morning after the Patriots tight
end crashed in North Attleborough feel he was drag racing with
teammate Ben Coates and tried to cut through the rest area. This is
where his car bounced off two tractor trailers . . . There's only
one difference between the 22 major league umpires who were dumped
and the minor leaguers who replaced them: The new guys are most
likely to call the pitch (or the play) that could go either way in
favor of the home team . . . The NFL thinks it might draw an
all-time Sunday night TV rating with the Browns-Steelers game in
Cleveland. A 14.0 would break the mark, and the Browns coming back
to Cleveland might draw enough attention nationally to do it.

UMPIRES OPPOSED TO PHILLIPS AGREE TO FORM A NEW UNION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Major league umpires opposed to Richie Phillips' leadership of
their union agreed Friday to form a new union and seek
certification to represent all umpires.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 umpires were on a conference call, during which it was
decided to go ahead with the plan, a person who was on the call
said. The umpires created an organizing committee, he said, and
plan to petition the National Labor Relations Board as soon as
possible for an election.
</P>
<P>
   John Hirschbeck, Joe Brinkman and Dave Phillips, all American
League umpires, have been leaders of the anti-Phillips faction and
are among the members of the organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal labor regulations, an election would give members
of the umpires' bargaining unit the choice of the new union, the
existing union or no union at all. A majority of the votes cast
would determine the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   The key to a vote could be the status of the 22 umpires who lost
their jobs last week. The pro-Phillips members will argue that they
should be allowed to vote because they continue to be paid, though
they are not working. If the National Labor Relations Board allows
them to vote, the bargaining unit would have 93 umpires; if not,
the number would be 71.
</P>
<P>
   The board would very likely allow the 22 to vote but hold their
votes out of the tally until the arbitration case seeking to
restore their jobs is completed.
</P>
<P>
   The Major League Umpires Association, which has existed for 21
years, is headed by Phillips, a Philadelphia lawyer, who has been a
hard-edged negotiator in previous bargaining for labor agreements
with the National and American Leagues.
</P>
<P>
   After Phillips orchestrated a strategy of mass resignations in
July to get the attention of baseball officials, a sizable group of
umpires, mostly in the American League, backed away from the plan.
Some did not sign letters of resignation, and others quickly
rescinded their resignations.
</P>
<P>
   The move created a split in the umpires' ranks, primarily along
league lines. The two sides have sniped at each other for weeks,
and the heated words escalated when the 22 umpires lost their jobs.
The leagues accepted their resignations after they hired 25 new
umpires.
</P>
<P>
   The group opposed to Phillips has said it counts at least 39
umpires who are prepared to vote for a new union. The person who
was on the call Friday Friday said some of the umpires on it were
not among those 39.
</P>
<P>
   The umpires who oppose Phillips have said his style of
bargaining was the way to go in earlier years but no longer fits
the times. If a new union is formed, these umpires want to make it
more open than they say the existing union has been under Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Shapiro, a Baltimore lawyer, has been advising the insurgent
group but would not be expected to represent a new union. &QL;

PESTICIDE SPRAYING SLOWED BY HEAVY RAIN AND FOG 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Heavy rain and fog thwarted a plan to spray pesticide
over much of New York City Friday, but officials said they still
hoped to spray in every borough by the end of the weekend to curb
the recent outbreak of St. Louis encephalitis, a mosquito-borne
viral disease.
</P>
<P>
   City officials had planned to begin aerial spraying of Queens,
Brooklyn and the Bronx on Thursday night and continue Friday, but
two helicopters and a plane that they had arranged to borrow from
New Jersey and Pennsylvania could not fly into the city because of
the rain.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, a single helicopter sprayed over northeastern Queens,
where the first cases of encephalitis were reported last week, from
6 p.m. to 9 p.m. last night, while seven trucks were prepared to
dispense the pesticide, malathion, throughout much of Brooklyn
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are reworking the entire schedule,'' said Jerome M. Hauer,
director of the Mayor's Office of Emergency Management. ``But we
had to move quickly because it's important that we try to do
everything possible to control the adult mosquito population so
that additional people are not bitten.''
</P>
<P>
   The helicopters and plane are scheduled to spray pesticide over
all five boroughs by Sunday night, Hauer said. Trucks are to
dispense the malathion in Manhattan because of the density of the
buildings, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hauer said a helicopter would spray pesticide over Central Park
over the weekend, but he did not know when. Spraying can only take
place at night and in the early morning, when mosquitoes are most
active.
</P>
<P>
   The number of confirmed cases of encephalitis remained at nine
Friday, including three people who died of the disease. Of those,
eight were in Queens and one in Borough Park, Brooklyn. The number
of possible cases citywide was put at 62 Friday, but health
officials said only seven of those people were strongly believed to
have the disease. Of those, four cases are in the Bronx, two in
Queens and one in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   In neighboring Nassau County, the number of people being tested
for St. Louis encephalitis rose to five Friday from four on
Thursday. And health officials in New Jersey urged doctors to be on
the alert for symptoms of the disease, which include high fevers,
severe headaches, slurred speech, blurred vision and nervous tics.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Environmental Protection said Friday
that it was investigating the deaths of more than a hundred crows
in northeast Queens to determine if the deaths were related to the
outbreak, a department spokesman said Friday. The deaths were first
reported around Fort Totten, in Queens, in mid-August, although
what killed the birds has remained a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Queens veterinarian John Charos, who has treated more than two
dozen sick crows, said some of the birds he treated showed symptoms
similar to encephalitis, including high fever and a dazed demeanor.
About half of the birds Charos treated with antibiotics and feeding
tubes recovered, and he released them into the wild. Last week,
after learning of the outbreak of encephalitis among humans, Charos
reported his suspicions to the Department of Environmental
Protection.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Friday, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani repeatedly
sought to quell fears about the potentially deadly disease,
stressing that the number of confirmed cases was small and
insisting that the delay in spraying would not put the public at
increased risk. Nor would the rainy weather lead to an increase in
the mosquito population, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are doing, we are doing out of an excess of caution,''
Giuliani said during the afternoon news conference at City Hall.
``The city has handled this very well, and when you look at the
number of cases, it's been contained dramatically.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials said Friday that about 3,000 gallons of malathion
would be sprayed citywide, at the rate of three ounces per acre.
But despite increasing public concern about the pesticide, Giuliani
and Dr. Roger Nasci, a research entomologist at the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention who is monitoring the outbreak,
continued to stress that it would be sprayed in tiny droplets that
would not be harmful to humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The spraying is not dangerous,'' Giuliani said. ``We tell
people to remain inside and close their windows only because of
discomfort, not because there is any risk to them.''

EQUIPMENT FAILURE LEFT DAVIDIAN BODIES UNUSABLE FOR STUDY, LAWYERS
SAY
</HEADLINE>
 (EDS: Note graphic contents) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By JACK DOUGLAS 
And KAREN BROOKS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Lawyers in a wrongful death suit against the
federal government said on Friday that they have been unable to
fully explore what caused the deaths of about 80 Branch Davidians
in 1993 because many of their bodies liquefied when a cooler failed
at the Tarrant County morgue.
</P>
<P>
   The attorneys also are pursuing reports from a pathologist hired
by the family of Davidian Jimmy Riddle that portions of Riddle's
body disappeared during the more than two years it was stored in
Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   The missing body parts and the failed refrigeration unit at the
morgue are expected to be debated as part of a wrongful-death trial
scheduled to begin next month in Waco.
</P>
<P>
   The cooler failed weeks after Tarrant County Medical Examiner
Nizam Peerwani had performed autopsies on members of the religious
sect, including spiritual leader David Koresh. The Davidians died
in the April 19, 1993, blaze that destroyed their compound near
Waco.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Gavras, Peerwani's spokesman, said Friday afternoon that
there may be some mitigating factors concerning reports that the
morgue's cooler failed, but he declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Peerwani did not return telephone calls to his office. His
secretary, Linda Anderson, said he ``has been advised not to make
any further comments'' in the wake of Thursday's appointment of a
special counsel to investigate what happened at Mount Carmel on
April 19, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   He did, however, speak to reporters at the Waco Tribune-Herald
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Don Petty, who worked with Peerwani as a forensic photographer
on the Davidian case, and Fort Worth pathologist Stephen Putthoff,
who also worked on the Davidians, said the autopsies were conducted
accurately and professionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Peerwani did a superb job organizing the entire effort,''
said Putthoff, a deputy medical examiner for the county and
chairman of the pathology department for the University of North
Texas Health Science Center at Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   If the cooler malfunctioned, Putthoff said, it would not have
mattered because all of the autopsies had been completed and the
forensic evidence collected.
</P>
<P>
   But the lawyers suing the government say that when the badly
burned corpses were liquefied from exposure to high temperatures,
it prevented a second, independent examination to learn more about
what _ and possibly who _ caused the Davidians' deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk Lyons, who is representing three Davidian survivors of the
fire and the families of 23 dead sect members, said he has been
told that ``somebody accidentally pulled the plug, and the bodies
turned to soup.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It just destroys any chance for anybody to come back and
challenge what the government said happened,'' said Lyons, of Black
Mountain, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Don Petty, who worked with Peerwani as a forensic photographer
on the Davidian case, said he believes that ``approximately 40 or
50'' unclaimed Davidian bodies were in the cooler when it failed.
</P>
<P>
   The cooler, which is behind the morgue and still being used, was
given to the Tarrant County Medical Examiner's Office by the
federal government to hold the bodies of the sect members, Petty
said.
</P>
<P>
   Peerwani told CNN in an interview this week that his office was
not asked by the government to determine whether any of the
Davidians were killed by federal agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that was an issue at the time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Peerwani said he also was not asked by the government to
determine the manner of the deaths _ homicide, suicide or
accidental _ which is usually a routine procedure in autopsies.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this particular case, we were primarily focused on deciding
the cause of death. We had no control over the information that was
surrounding this compound's tragedy,'' the medical examiner told
CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Putthoff said the fiery end to the 51-day standoff between the
religious sect and federal agents was an ``extremely complex
disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the hardest part for the pathologists ... was
separating out and seeing the bodies of the children who were
co-mingled with the adult female bodies,'' Putthoff said.
</P>
<P>
   Putthoff said that most, if not all, of the Davidian bodies were
already terribly burned and damaged by the fire and exploding
shrapnel, making it extremely difficult for the team of
pathologists at the Tarrant County morgue to examine them.
</P>
<P>
   Houston lawyer Michael Caddell, who is representing the families
of 55 dead Davidians, said relatives of the Davidians wanted a
re-examination because ``we think the autopsies were by and large
not done in the best manner possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the damage done from the broken cooler, authorities may
still be able to learn more about the deaths of the Davidians by
studying their bones, said Mary Manhein, professor of forensic
pathology at Louisiana State University and deputy coroner of Baton
Rouge Parish.
</P>
<P>
   Bone marrow can harbor DNA samples for as long as 10 years, and
a study of the bones themselves can often solve the mysteries of a
violent death, Manhein said.
</P>
<P>
   But a better preserved body, including the existence of lung
tissue and blood samples, could help determine whether any of the
Davidians died from smoke inhalation or from poison caused by
government tear gas, said Jay Siegel, professor of criminal justice
and chemistry at Michigan State University.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they didn't find that out on the initial autopsy ... it
would be much more crucial to have something preserved,'' said
Siegel, a member of the American Academy of Forensic Science.
</P>
<P>
   Bodies begin to decompose from the moment of death, but the
speed with which they do so depends on the circumstances, Manhein
said.
</P>
<P>
   Decomposition is quicker in hotter temperatures and, even in
room temperature, can cause a body to deteriorate beyond
recognition within two to three days, Manhein said.
</P>
<P>
   Corpses can be preserved if temperatures are kept at least under
40 degrees, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs attorneys also have questions about the findings of
Dr. Ronald Graser, the private pathologist hired by Riddle's
family.
</P>
<P>
   Graser's examination found that body parts disappeared from
Riddle, whose remains were kept at Tarrant County Mortician
Service, a private mortuary in southeast Fort Worth, court
documents say.
</P>
<P>
   During that time, the body of Riddle, who had been killed by a
shot in the head, was kept in a ``crash bag'' and sealed in a metal
container in a cooler, said Tom Ramsey, owner of the mortuary.
</P>
<P>
   But when Graser examined the remains, he said part of the skull
was missing, including the section where the bullet entered and
exited, the court documents say.

ALFREDO KRAUS, LYRIC TENOR   REVERED FOR PHRASING, DIES AT 71  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Spain , Italy, Britian, Austria, Argentina, Switzerland,
Portugal, Canary Islands, Ill.)   By ALLAN KOZINN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alfredo Kraus, a lyric tenor who was revered for the refinement
of his phrasing and the artistry he brought to bel canto roles,
died Friday at his home in Madrid, Spain. He was 71.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was pancreatic cancer, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Although he never received the kind of popular acclaim accorded
Luciano Pavarotti and Placido Domingo, Kraus had a tremendous
following among opera connoisseurs. In particular he was admired
for his bright, trim timbre, his distinctive phrasing and an
assured, self-possessed acting style. In his performances in
signature roles like the Duke in ``Rigoletto,'' Alfredo in ``La
Traviata,'' Nemorino in ``L'Elisir d'Amore'' or the title role in
``Werther,'' Kraus avoided empty display, preferring to use a
composers' demand for virtuosity as an emotional element, intrinsic
to the character he was creating.
</P>
<P>
   Kraus' career was also an object lesson in how a singer might
preserve his voice, despite the temptations to sing too often and
too loud or to take on unsuitable roles. It was not for a lack of
offers that he did not sing such bread-and-butter roles as
Cavaradossi in ``Tosca'' or Pinkerton in ``Madama Butterfly.'' He
learned those roles, and he said that he gave single performances
of them early in his career. But he decided that his voice would
last longer and remain fresher if he confined himself to the lyric
roles of the bel canto repertory. Indeed, he was able to produce
his high D, at full power and with a lovely ring, well into his
'60s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of knowing what kind of voice you have from the
very beginning and learning to use that voice onstage, with the
right technique'' he told The New York Times in 1988. ``It is not
so easy, because we are using an instrument that is immaterial. We
can't touch it, it's only air. We don't even hear it properly,
because we hear a combination of inside and outside sound. You
cannot go by what you hear, you must learn to be very sensitive to
how it feels, and you can only speak of it in a very figurative
language.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraus also enjoyed running the business side of his career. He
did not employ a personal manager during his most active years,
preferring to make his own decisions, which were often based on
instinct. He would not, for example, work with conductors who he
felt tried to sublimate performers' personalities, no matter how
auspicious the engagement. He limited his schedule to about 60
appearances a year, and although these usually included
performances at the Metropolitan Opera, Covent Garden, the Vienna
State Opera, La Scala and the Teatro Colon, in Buenos Aires,
Argentina. He also made a point of appearing in small Spanish and
Italian opera houses normally outside the limelight.
</P>
<P>
   He owned and personally supervised a small Spanish record label,
Carillon Records. Carillon was the first Spanish company to release
a complete opera set, a recording of ``Pearlfishers,'' with Kraus
in the cast.
</P>
<P>
   Kraus was born in Las Palmas, in the Canary Islands, on Sept.
24, 1927. He enjoyed singing in church and at local celebrations,
but his father _ an Austrian who had taken Spanish citizenship _
insisted that he prepare for a career in the sciences. Kraus earned
a degree in electrical engineering, but when he was in his mid-20s,
he decided to study singing more seriously as well, first in
Valencia and Barcelona, later with Mercedes Llopart, in Milan,
Italy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1955 Kraus won the silver medal in a vocal competition in
Geneva. He had appeared onstage in zarzuela performances in Madrid,
in 1954, but he always gave the date of his formal operatic debut
as 1956, when he sang the Duke in a Cairo, Egypt, performance of
``Rigoletto.'' The Cairo engagement also included Kraus' only
performance as Cavaradossi.
</P>
<P>
   The same year as his Cairo debut, Kraus was engaged by the
Teatro La Fenice for performances of ``La Traviata'' with Renata
Scotto. In 1958 he sang with Maria Callas in the Lisbon
performances of ``La Traviata,'' which quickly became legendary
among collectors of pirated recordings of live opera performances.
Debuts followed at Covent Garden (as Edgardo in ``Lucia di
Lammermoor'') in 1959 and at La Scala (Elvino in ``La Sonnambula'')
in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Kraus' first appearance in the United States was as Nemorino at
the Lyric Opera of Chicago in 1962, and in 1966 he made his
Metropolitan Opera debut as the Duke. Other roles he has sung at
the Met include Don Ottavio in ``Don Giovanni,'' Ernesto in ``Don
Pasquale'' and the title role in ``Faust,'' as well as Werther,
Alfredo, the Duke and Nemorino.
</P>
<P>
   As a teacher Kraus gave master classes at the Accademia Musicale
Chighiana, in Siena, Italy, as well as at the Juilliard School, at
Covent Garden, and in Madrid and Rome. He returned frequently to
his birthplace, Las Palmas _ where a concert hall is named for him
_ to preside over the final rounds of the biennial Alfredo Kraus
International Competition, a vocal contest established in 1990 by
the Orquesta Filharmonica de Gran Canaria.
</P>
<P>
   Kraus' wife, Rosablanca, died in 1997. He is survived by three
daughters and a son.

RAY E. TRUSSELL, HOSPITALS COMMISSIONER FOR NEW YORK CITY, DIES AT
85  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa, La., Pa., Mass., N.J.)   By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dr. Ray E. Trussell, a former Commissioner of
Hospitals in New York City and later the general director of Beth
Israel Medical Center in Manhattan, died on Wednesday at his home
in Manhattan. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, Trussell was a passionate advocate of better
health care for the poor and members of minority groups. He was
also an early proponent of a nationalized health care system.
</P>
<P>
   As Hospitals Commissioner, Trussell's largest legacy may have
been establishing the link between municipal hospitals and
voluntary hospitals and medical schools, said his successor at Beth
Israel, Dr. Robert G. Newman. ``Thirty-five years ago, when he did
this, municipal hospitals had an impossible job of attracting
quality medical and support staff,'' Newman said.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Elbert Trussell was born on Feb. 7, 1914, in Toledo, Iowa.
He earned a bachelor's degree at the University of Iowa and an
medical degree at the College of Medicine at the University of
Iowa. He taught there as well, before serving during World War II
as an epidemiologist with the Army in the Pacific. He won a Bronze
Star and rose to the rank of major.
</P>
<P>
   After his military discharge, he earned a master's degree in
public health at Johns Hopkins University. In 1947, he worked with
the State of New York as an epidemiologist and taught at Albany
Medical College. In 1955, he became director of the Hunterdon
Medical Center in New Jersey and a professor at New York
University. In 1955, he joined the Columbia University faculty as
associate dean of the College of Physicians and Surgeons and
director of the School of Public Health and Administrative
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961, Mayor Robert F. Wagner asked him to run New York City's
hospital system. As commissioner of hospitals, he improved
ambulance service and expanded access to birth control. He also
began a pilot project for a 24-hour suicide prevention service and
improved children's psychiatric services.
</P>
<P>
   His major problem was the deteriorating quality of care in
municipal hospitals. Besides establishing the link between
municipal and voluntary hospitals, he also raised doctors'
salaries. ``What is most distinctive is the forcefulness and
uncompromising commitment throughout his career in many different
positions to insure the very best care for everybody who needs
it,'' Newman said.
</P>
<P>
   Though Trussell drew opposition throughout his career, Newman
said, critics ``might have disagreed with his positions but
recognized his absolute integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Trussell returned to Columbia in 1965. Three years later, he
became director of Beth Israel Medical Center, where he had helped
establish one of the largest methadone maintenance programs in the
nation. ``He basically guided what was a small, good community
hospital into becoming a multifaceted academic medical center with
a national reputation,'' Newman said. Trussell retired from Beth
Israel in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   He was the author of ``Hunterdon Medical Center: The Story of
One Approach to Rural Medical Care'' (1956) and, with Jack Elinson,
``Chronic Illness in a Rural Area'' (1959), both published by
Harvard University Press.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Dr. Elizabeth D. Trussell; four
children, Margaret Hardy of Iowa City, Iowa, Ray E. Trussell Jr.,
of New Orleans, Dr. Susan Stedman, of Paoli, Pa., and Joanne King
of Albany; a stepdaughter, Liberty Rashad of Cambridge, Mass.; 12
grandchildren and 16 great-grandchildren.

PATRIOTS TIGHT END FACES VEHICULAR VIOLATIONS AFTER CRASH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Patriots backup tight end Rod Rutledge will
face criminal charges following an early-morning accident Friday on
Interstate 95 in the North Attleborough area, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Rutledge, a second-year player out of Alabama, was returning
from the Foxy Lady nightclub in Providence, R.I. and reportedly
traveling in excess of 100 miles per hour when he lost control of
his 1996 Chevy Impala and hit a pair of tractor-trailer trucks
parked in a rest area.
</P>
<P>
   According to state police spokesman Lt. Paul Maloney, Rutledge
was driving down the middle lane of Interstate 95 northbound around
12:30 a.m. when he attempted to pass a car on the right while
speeding. He lost control of the car, skidded off the highway, and
struck the tractor-trailers.
</P>
<P>
   A second car, apparently following him, pulled into the rest
stop, picked up Rutledge and left the scene, Maloney said. The
Patriots identified the driver as Rutledge's teammate, tight end
Ben Coates, who Patriots officials confirm had been with Rutledge
at the nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   Rutledge, 24, who did not seek medical attention after the
accident but waited until Friday morning when the Patriots'
training staff attended to him, turned himself into the Foxborough
state police barracks about three hours after the accident. He was
charged with leaving the scene of an accident, operating to
endanger after causing property damage, and speeding. Rutledge will
appear in Attleboro District Court at a later date.
</P>
<P>
   Rutledge's vehicle was severely damaged and according to one
Patriots official, ``that car won't be driven again.' Patriots
coach Pete Carroll said Rutledge walked away with a bloody lip and
was able to practice Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Maloney was not aware whether sobriety tests were performed on
Rutledge, but indicated ``probably not because it was a substantial
time after the accident'' when he turned himself into police at
3:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Maloney identified the truck drivers as Robert Allen, a Cocoa
Beach, Fla. man who drives for Lake City Express based in Grove,
Okla., and Seward Smith of Hull, who works for Kelley Services
based in Augusta, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Allen said he was getting ready to go to bed in his
tractor-trailer when he felt something hit the back of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just taking my shoes off when it hit,'' he said. ``At
first, I thought another trailer had hit me.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen, 58, was ``shook up,'' but not injured in the crash. After
he looked outside and saw the car, he immediately called police. He
then left the trailer to see if Rutledge was OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him I had called police,'' Allen said. ``He told me he
was fine and then he walked back behind the trailer about 30 feet
to another car.'' Allen said the other car arrived from the other
direction about 3-5 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   ``The car was completely totaled,'' he said. ``He's certainly
lucky to be alive.''
</P>
<P>
   It was dark and the vehicle's headlights were facing him, and
Allen said he could tell only that the driver was male.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't make him out and when I looked up again, they were
gone,'' said Allen.
</P>
<P>
   Allen also spoke with Smith, the driver of the second trailer
struck by Rutledge. He was uninjured and left early Friday morning
to continue his delivery, Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   Allen, who was driving a load from Georgia to Foxborough, said
he was unable to leave the rest area Friday because of damage to
his trailer.
</P>
<P>
   According to Allen, an unidentified woman pulled into the rest
stop to check on the scene. She told the truck driver that she had
been passed by two cars ``that had been racing.'' It was uncertain
whether the car that picked up Rutledge had been one of the
speeding vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Maloney said police were searching for the operator of the
second car Friday and could not confirm reports that it was Coates.
It was also unclear if Rutledge and the other driver were racing
when Rutledge's car skidded off the highway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't tell if the drivers were drag racing,'' he said. ``It
may have just been a case of two speeding cars passing in the
night.''
</P>
<P>
   Patriots officials denied the players were drag racing but
conceded they were traveling at ``excessive speeds.'' A Patriots
official said Rutledge would be fined, but that Coates ``didn't do
anything wrong.'' In fact, Carroll said Coates ``just happened by''
when he picked up Rutledge. The team does not have a curfew during
the week.
</P>
<P>
   An employee of the the Foxy Lady, who identified himself only as
``Pucci'' said Coates and another Patriot he couldn't identify
arrived late, stayed for an hour, and seemed sober when they left.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have nothing against the athletes coming here,'' he said.
``They act like perfect gentlemen and the other customers like to
see them.''
</P>
<P>
   National Football League Players' Association spokesman Carl
Francis said that the Patriots could fine Rutledge anywhere from
one week's pay to a four-week suspension without pay. The team
would have to notify the league and the Players' Association they
were fining Rutledge for ``conduct detrimental to the football
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll was so concerned by the incident that he ordered the
locker room and media access to practice closed for the day.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Rutledge would be benched for Sunday's game,
Carroll said, ``it's too close to game time.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll called Rutledge's actions ``irresponsible'' and said
Rutledge exercised ``poor judgment'' in driving a car that fast and
that Rutledge was fortunate that he wasn't injured more severely or
that he didn't injure someone else.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll, who has shown a tougher approach since training camp,
was asked whether Rutledge would be disciplined by being benched.
Carroll said, ``he's part of the game plan.''
</P>
<P>
   There have now been three off-field incidents in each of
Carroll's years on the job, starting with the ``Mosh Pit'' incident
at The Paradise, a night club in Boston, involving Drew Bledsoe and
Max Lane right before the Patriots traveled to Tampa Bay, where
they were routed in an embarrassing loss on Nov. 13, 1997. Last
year, offseason incidents involved former cornerback Chris Canty
and Coates (during training camp).
</P>
<P>
   Dave Meggett was arrested in Toronto when he was charged with
robbing a Toronto prostitute of money after having sex with her at
a Toronto hotel room. Meggett was later released by the team.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, when Canty was cited for having an open container
of beer in his car at an Attleboro rest stop, the Patriots made him
apologize for his actions. Canty was released before the start of
training camp.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots do not have team rules concerning their players'
night activities, but late last season the NFL's security division
gave the team a list of Boston and Providence night spots where
players were advised to stay out of for security reasons. According
to a Patriots official, the Foxy Lady was not one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll hinted that he may begin to inhibit players from going
to certain night spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe so, if necessary, it will be done,'' said Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't allow any of this to be a distraction. We'll deal
with Rod's situation independently and in house.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as the majority of the Jets are concerned, the situation
is a nonissue, partially because to them, Rutledge is a nonentity.
The only Jet who recognized his name, when asked about the
incident, was punter Tom Tupa, his teammate last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say if it'll be a distraction because I don't know how
much he figures in the game plan,'' Tupa said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Jets receiver Keyshawn Johnson, ``Who's Rod Rutledge?
You're asking one offensive guy about another offensive guy I don't
even know. It could be a distraction. You don't want anything like
that to happen at this stage of the game or any stage of the game,
actually. But I don't know how important he is to the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll thought going through an exhibition season with no
incidents would be helpful to team unity and chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question we were hoping we had no incidents, but
when you do you have to deal with them,'' said Carroll. ``We're not
going to let this be a distraction. It's just poor judgment on
anyone's part to be driving that fast.''

RUTH ROMAN, GLAMOROUS AND WHOLESOME STAR, DIES AT 75  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mass., Lithuania)   By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ruth Roman, a screen actress who parlayed her electrically
charged combination of sexiness and wholesomeness into Hollywood
stardom in the late 1940s and '50s, died on Thursday at her home in
Laguna Beach, Calif. She was 75.
</P>
<P>
   She died in her sleep, said her son, Richard Hall.
</P>
<P>
   After her breakout role opposite Kirk Douglas in Stanley
Kramer's ``Champion,'' a 1949 adaptation of a Ring Lardner short
story about a maniacal prize fighter, Warner Brothers gave her
starring roles in nine films in under two years.
</P>
<P>
   In one day she leaped from working with Bette Davis in ``Beyond
the Forest'' to supporting Milton Berle in ``Always Leave Them
Laughing.'' A week after the completion of ``Strangers on a Train''
opposite Robert Walker, she was whisked into ``Tomorrow Is Another
Day'' with Steve Cochran.
</P>
<P>
   From 1948 to 1965, Ms. Roman appeared in more than 30 movies,
and in the 1960s and '70s in numerous television shows.
</P>
<P>
   Her romantic partners in films included Randolph Scott in ``Colt
.45,'' James Stewart in ``The Far Country'' and Gary Cooper in
``Dallas.''
</P>
<P>
   None of these films are classics. Few, if any, are studied in
film schools today. But in their time they made box office cash
registers ring like sleigh bells and in 1951 Ms. Roman was
receiving 500 letters a week from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   There were plenty of cheesecake queens in Hollywood seeking
roles when Ms. Roman arrived in 1945, but it was her come-hither
warmth, combined with her shapely, dark-haired good looks, that
made her a standout. When Collier's profiled her in 1951, the
magazine declared that Ms. Roman's career had been built on a
``pervasive air of wholesomeness.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an appeal that even Ms. Roman did not fully understand.
When she auditioned for a part in ``Champion,'' she thought she
would be right for the role of the gold-digging floozy and
accordingly wore a tight-fitting black dress and heavy makeup when
she swivel-hipped into Stanley Kramer's office.
</P>
<P>
   But somehow the wholesomeness showed through. ``Actually, I
thought of you for the other girl,'' said Kramer, then serving as
the film's producer.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Maxwell played the floozy, with Kirk Douglas as the
fighter and Ms. Roman as his demure and steadfast wife.
</P>
<P>
   It had been that same quality that landed Ms. Roman her first
film role: a bit part as a WAVE in ``Stage Door Canteen'' in 1942.
</P>
<P>
   Clem Beauchamp, company manager for ``Stage Door Canteen,'' told
an interviewer in 1951 that he chose Ms. Roman from dozens of eager
actresses because ``I felt right away that here was a girl who
would show up on time in the morning with her lines learned and no
nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   By Hollywood standards, Ms. Roman's romantic life was a bit
dull. She dated Bill Walsh, a publicity agent, for five years. She
once stepped out with Ronald Reagan. In 1950 she married Mortimer
Hall, a Los Angeles television executive. The marriage ended in
divorce. A second marriage, to Budd Burton Moss, also ended in
divorce. She told interviewers that she disliked nightclubs and
flashy clothes. Her one extravagance, she said, was her collection
of 35 pairs of shoes, and that consisted mainly of Indian
moccasins.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the excitement in her life was make-believe. In 1956
Ms. Roman was aboard the luxury passenger liner Andrea Doria when
it was struck by the Stockholm. Ms. Roman was returning from Italy
with her 3-year-old son, Dickie. She was dancing in the ship's
Belvedere room, she told a reporter for The New York Times, when
``we heard a big explosion like a firecracker.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she saw smoke coming from the general area of her cabin
and rushed there to protect her son. He was sound asleep. She said
she awakened Dickie and told him, ``We're going on a picnic.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was clear that the liner was sinking and passengers
began entering lifeboats, a seaman lowered Dickie into a boat. Ms.
Roman said she followed down a rope ladder, but when she was
halfway down the lifeboat pulled away. She called out to the boat
but it did not return. She was put on another lifeboat.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Roman told a reporter she was never in fear for her son's
life, but felt sure he would be safe in the lifeboat, which turned
out to be true. Ms. Roman and her son were among the 760 survivors
of the Andrea Doria.
</P>
<P>
   Her son, her only survivor, lives in California.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Lynn, Mass., on Dec. 23, 1923, she was the youngest of
three daughters of immigrants from Lithuania. Her father, Anthony
Roman, a carnival barker, died when she was a child, forcing her
mother to work as a waitress, cleaning woman and laundress.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Roman was proud of her family's endurance. ``For a while,''
she once told a reporter, ``we were moving regularly once a month
because we couldn't pay our rent.''
</P>
<P>
   But she never felt sorry for herself, she said, remarking,
``When you start out poor, you don't know what you're missing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Roman quit high school in her second year when she decided
to become an actress. During the day she worked as a movie usher
and at night she performed with the New England Repertory Company,
a semi-professional group in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   With $200 in her pocketbook, she soon struck out for Hollywood.
For a while, she lived in a boarding house with several other
aspiring actresses. They called their home the House of the Seven
Garbos.
</P>
<P>
   For six years she endured a series of disappointments. She got a
good part in a western called ``White Stallion,'' but it was never
released. Then came a role in ``A Night in Casablanca,'' but after
the filming her part was cut. Then everything changed after her
audition with Stanley Kramer.

MARTINEZ' ONE-MAN ACT ON OPENING NIGHT IS A SHOWSTOPPER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The weekend of expectation has arrived and Sunday
eight decades of fear and loathing crash-land in metropolitan New
York as Roger Clemens pitches against the Red Sox at Yankee Stadium
while Bill Parcells haunts the Patriots in Northern Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Rocket. Tuna. The grandsons of Harry Frazee and the daughter of
Babe Ruth should come to the Apple for ceremonial first-tosses.
Folks at the Delta and USAir Shuttle no doubt are working overtime.
Every New York-Boston game is sold out.
</P>
<P>
   The warmup act was Friday night in the Bronx and this must have
been what it was like when Springsteen opened for Chicago at the
Boston Garden in 1973. With his countrymen rocking the right- field
bleachers, Pedro Martinez mowed down the Yankees, striking out 17
and allowing just one hit and no walks in a 3-1 complete-game
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Yankee Stadium was the House of Pedro as representatives of the
Dominican Republic provided the World Cup flair we've learned to
love at Fenway when Pedro pitches. Longtime Yankee watchers say
it's the first time they remember a visiting pitcher feted with his
own sections of K-Cards. With the Yanks trailing, 2-1, in the
seventh (when New York still had only one hit), angry Yankee fans
ripped Pedro's K-Cards from the left-field, third-tier facade.
</P>
<P>
   Watching Pedro at this hour is akin to watching Sandy Koufax
and/or Juan Marichal when they dissolved Nationl League lineups in
the early 1960s. Seattle's Jay Buhner (0-8 vs. Pedro lifetime, all
strikeouts) last weekend said that Martinez is in a class by
himself and we saw nothing at the Zoo Friday night to discourage
the notion.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez has three pitches _ fastball, curve, changeup _ and he
throws them all for strikes almost anytime he wants. Hitters will
tell you that Martinez's change and curve are the best in baseball,
and the radar guns clock his fastball at 95 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Stanley, an ex-catcher who has hit off Martinez and watched
him from first base, said, ``You can sit on his changeup and still
miss it. And if you're looking curve and he comes in with a
fastball, you're in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second inning Friday night, Chili Davis guessed fastball
and guessed correctly. Davis's solo homer looked as if it might
hold up until Stanley (he loves Yankee Stadium the way Yaz loved
Detroit) hit an opposite-field, two-run homer in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro's best inning might have been the fifth when he fanned
Tino Martinez, Davis, and Ricky Ledee on 15 pitches. In the bottom
of the seventh, still nursing a one-hitter, Martinez befuddled
Derek Jeter with a 3-2 curveball. Jeter almost fell down as plate
umpire Jim Reynolds rang him up. Paul O'Neill was next and fanned
on a 3-2 fastball at the knees, then Bernie Williams almost screwed
himself in the ground flailing at an 0-2 curveball, Pedro's 96th
pitch. It was mound mastery at its best.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro and the Red Sox are no secret in the Yankee manager's
office. Before Friday's game, Joe Torre proclaimed Jimy Williams
American League manager of the Year and said he's ever-mindful of
the Red Sox threat from below.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm watching them, I admit it,'' said Torre. ``We're all here
in New York talking about lining up our pitching for the
postseason. But we're not there yet and Boston will not go away.
I'm very much aware of them and a lot of my players are, although
not all of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a credit to what the Red Sox have done. I wrote them off
a month and a half ago when Toronto was playing well. I thought
Toronto would run away and hide. But Boston is a resilient and
determined group, plus they've got the guy who can give you a win
every fifth day.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Martinez.

EDITORIAL NOTEBOOK: HARRY POTTER AND THE MARVELING MUGGLES
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By VERLYN KLINKENBORG  
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I am beginning to understand Quidditch, which is not a language
but a game played by the students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft
and Wizardry. It is played on brooms, over a field, in the sky,
with four balls, one of them, the Golden Snitch, by nature elusive,
self-propelled and worth 150 points. Quidditch is the main source
of rivalry between Hogwarts' four residential houses, Slytherin,
Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw and Gryffindor. Harry Potter resides in the
last and best of these houses with his friends Ron Weasley and
Hermione Granger. All of the students at Hogwarts are wizards and
witches in training, whether they descend from magical families or
from families that dwell in the preposterous, obstreperously
shortsighted, narrow-minded world occupied by people like you and
me, who are called Muggles. Our world is that place where the
people in photographs just stand there with frozen smiles on their
faces instead of waving back.
</P>
<P>
   This short summary of a few basic facts about Harry Potter and
his school will seem almost petulantly dull and obvious to the
legions of Harry Potter fans, who were gratified this past week by
the publication in America of the third Harry Potter book, ``Harry
Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.'' The Potter books, by the
Scottish writer J.K. Rowling, are delightful reading for anyone
whose soul is not utterly clotted with Muggled thinking. Those
people _ the Muggles through and through _ are the ones who tend to
talk mainly about the phenomenal sales these books are enjoying,
the way they have captured the best-seller lists in Britain and
America, the way they snatch up prizes left and right, and the way
that boys, actual boys, have flung themselves upon these novels.
</P>
<P>
   Those are subjects that Harry Potter's Muggle uncle, the
apoplectic Vernon Dursley, a drill maker living on Privet Drive,
would enjoy discussing with his wife, Petunia, and their porcine
son, Dudley. Harry and his sympathetic readers would rather think
about the post office in the village of Hogsmeade, which is filled
with long-distance, short-distance and express owls. Or just how it
is that Hermione can attend two classes that meet at the same time.
Or how riding a hippogriff differs from riding a Firebolt broom. Or
how far to rely upon Weasley's sensible adage, ``Never trust
anything that can think for itself, if you can't see where it keeps
its brain.''
</P>
<P>
   I finished ``Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'' on the
train home one night last week. It was nothing like the Hogwarts
Express, which leaves from King's Cross station, platform 9}. The
passengers had fallen sound asleep, their heads rocked back, their
mouths open wide, while a rain-dulled landscape slithered past
outside. Meanwhile, Harry was struggling with the Dementors of
Azkaban, who prey on happiness, and with the question of who
conspired to kill his parents when he was just a baby. His is an
utterly untendentious world, full of rules meant to be broken, but
with sobering penalties when they are. It is not a moralistic
world, however, which is one reason boys and girls and even adults
like it so much. Neither the good nor the evil at Hogwarts is
metaphysical. When I looked up at last, the train was nearly empty.
Night had come and the Muggles were gone. I could have been
anywhere, even on the main line to Hogwarts.

MARTINEZ MASTERS YANKEES IN 3-1 RED SOX WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There is a certain segment of the population that
refuses to acknowledge the splendor of any artist, regardless how
accomplished, unless they see it for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   There is a name for these people, known throughout the land: New
Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't matter if you were the Beatles or Baryshnikov, your
credentials were suspect until you showed what you had here.
</P>
<P>
   Understand then, that Friday night in the Red Sox' 3-1 win over
the Yankees in Yankee Stadium, Pedro Martinez crossed yet another
threshold of greatness in his season for the ages by throwing his
second career one-hitter and striking out 17. What has been cause
for a summer-long lovefest from Bar Harbour to Yarmouth was
recognized finally by the world's toughest critics: Martinez this
year is in a class by himself.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox ace retired the last 22 batters, striking out the last
five and eight of the last nine.
</P>
<P>
   In a game that contained all the best elements October playoff
baseball has to offer _ a feverish full house, two ancient rivals,
wire-to-wire high tension _ Martinez showed yet again why the Red
Sox believe that any time he pitches, they can beat anyone.
</P>
<P>
   That includes the Yankees of this or any other year, including
the '27 Bombers.
</P>
<P>
   Before a sellout crowd of 55,239 that paid Martinez the ultimate
sign of respect _ veteran press box observers said they've never
seen ``K'' cards displayed for an opposition pitcher _ Martinez
limited the '99 defending champions to one hit, a second-inning
home run by Chili Davis, and two base runners.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox, maintaining their three-game wild-card lead over
Oakland, a winner against Tampa Bay, gave Martinez all the offense
he would need when Mike Stanley, refried twice as a Yankee, twice
with the Red Sox, delivered a two-run home run off Yankees
lefthander Andy Pettitte in the sixth. Stanley's 17th home run
followed a walk to Nomar Garciaparra, who was batting with a shin
guard protecting his sore left foot.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, bidding for his 21st win, grazed the jersey of leadoff
man Chuck Knoblauch with his second pitch, and then faced just one
batter over the minimum through the first seven innings. Knoblauch
was erased attempting to steal, second baseman Jose Offerman making
a terrific pickup of Jason Varitek's one-hop throw _ and no other
Yankee spent any time on base.
</P>
<P>
   Davis toured the bases when he caught up with a Martinez
fastball and launched it into the right-field seats to give the
Yankees a 1-0 lead with two outs in the second. Martinez then
retired the next 22 Yankees in order. He struck out the next three
batters after Davis's home run _ Ricky Ledee, Scott Brosius, and
Joe Girardi.
</P>
<P>
   He struck out the side in the fifth _ Tino Martinez, Chili
Davis, and Ledee again. He fanned three of the best Yankee hitters
of their generation in order in the seventh _ Derek Jeter in an
epic nine-pitch at-bat that ended up with Jeter looking at a
full-count curveball, Paul O'Neill, and Bernie Williams. Williams
won the batting title last season; Jeter began the night tied for
the batting lead with Nomar Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez had a dozen strikeouts through the first seven innings,
the 51st time he has fanned 10 or more batters in a game, 24 times
with the Red Sox, 15 times this season, including his last five
starts. With each strikeout, entire sections of Dominican fans
packing the left-field and right-field bleachersd erupted with wild
cheering.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox did not make things easy for Martinez. They loaded the
bases with no outs in the seventh against Pettitte but came up
empty. Garciaparra tapped into a force play at the plate against
reliever Jeff Nelson, who then induced Stanley to hit into a
pitcher-to-home-to-first double play.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow Dominican Wilton Veras, who had doubled to open the
seventh, tripled off Yankee reliever Mike Stanton in the ninth and
scored an insurance run when Offerman, making it a Dominican
trifecta, lined a single to right.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox, who had 12 hits, loaded the bases on an intentional
walk to Garciaparra and a single by Stanley _ his fourth hit of the
night _ but were unable to add another run.
</P>
<P>
   The four-hit game was the fifth of Stanley's career, his first
since June 8, 1995. Stanley now has hit 51 homers in Yankee
Stadium. He began the season with no more than 18 homers in any
other park.

 &HT;    Report on Waco evidence contains classified military secrets,
DPS reveals
 &HT;    By Leah Quin and Mike Ward
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In an admission sure to fuel new questions about
military involvement in the Branch Davidian siege, state officials
revealed in an Austin courtroom Friday that parts of a Texas
Rangers' report on evidence collected at the scene contain
classified military secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the Texas Department of Public Safety said the
report can't be made public yet because other agencies needed time
to review it to see if any parts of it should remain confidential.
</P>
<P>
   The report, completed Thursday afternoon, consists of a 13-page
narrative and about 200 pages of exhibits. The department sent
copies to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Waco and to House Committee
on Government Reform, which is investigating whether federal
officials used incendiary devices during the 1993 siege on the
Branch Davidian sect's compound near Waco.
</P>
<P>
   They also said the findings would be forwarded to former
Missouri Sen. John Danforth, who is heading an independent inquiry
into the Waco debacle at the request of U.S. Attorney General Janet
Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's disclosure happened during a hearing on a lawsuit filed
by the Austin American-Statesman to force the DPS to immediately
make public the entire report. The agency had announced Thursday it
would make the report public, but on Monday at noon when the report
was scheduled to be posted on the DPS Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Four federal agents were among those who died during the 51-day
seige at the Branch Davidian compound near Waco, most of them in a
fire that destroyed the compound on April 19, 1993. Sect leader
David Koresh, the target of a federal firearms investigation that
triggered the standoff, was among the victims.
</P>
<P>
   After the siege ended, the Justice Department asked the Rangers
to conduct the follow-up criminal investigation. Since that inquiry
was completed, the tons of evidence have remained under Ranger
control _ locked in an Austin storage warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   In June, DPS Chairman James B. Francis Jr. ordered the Rangers
to re-examine all the stored evidence after learning that military
pyrotechnic tear gas canisters may have been fired by federal
agents in the waning hours of the seige. Federal officials had
repeatedly denied that any such fire-starting devices were used.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' final report had been completed Thursday. ``This
will be a document the whole country will be interested in,'' DPS
spokesman Mike Cox had said.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday afternoon, after the Statesman filed suit seeking to
have the report immediately made public, the agency's stance had
changed.
</P>
<P>
   Don Walker, who represented the Department of Public Safety,
which prepared the report, said its legal staff and other agencies
had not had time to determine if the report contained documents
that might not be public, such as classified Army documents. The
department needed the chance to retract certain information, if
necessary, Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   The department would seek a state attorney general's opinion on
whether to release deleted information, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In forwarding the Rangers' report on Thursday to the house
committee, DPS Assistant Director Thomas A. Davis made no mention
that it contained classified material. At the end, he noted that
DPS planned to make public the report on Monday ``unless otherwise
directed.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox was among several DPS employees _ none with any known
security clearances _ with access to copies of the report. On
Friday, The Associated Press reported that congressional aides were
busy sifting through the the report after it arrived in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Randall Terrell, attorney for the newspaper, said the Statesman
and other newspapers had requested the report, then being prepared,
at least eight days ago.
</P>
<P>
   Terrell cross-examined Duncan Fox, an attorney for the
Department of Public Safety, who said he did not know yet why parts
of the report might not be public. Fox also testified that there is
no state criminal investigation pending, which is an exception to
open records laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy for attorneys to say there is no exception to open
records laws,'' Walker countered. ``It's difficult for a state
agency to cite confidentiality statutes on very short notice.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Davis asked the state for a copy of the report, which he
had requested earlier in the day. They gave him the 13-page
narrative but said they hadn't brought the 200 pages of exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing irritated, Davis read the narrative in private. He
then ordered the state to turn over the report to the
American-Statesman, but postponed his own order until Saturday.
State attorneys would then have time to seek a reversal of his
order from the Third Court of Appeals in Austin, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While federal officials have long insisted there was no active
military involvement in the FBI's final tear gas assault, Francis
was quoted last month in one published report as saying the DPS had
evidence that could corroborate reports of active involvement by
the secret Delta Force in the April 19 debacle.
</P>
<P>
   Any direct military involvement in a civilian law enforcement
operation would have required a presidential waiver of the law
barring such activity. But military officials have insisted that
the military personnel on the scene were only observers.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Department of Defense documents had disclosed that
three special operations personnel were in Waco to observe the
April 19 assault. A Government Accounting Office investigator who
looked into military involvement in the Waco standoff was quoted
Tuesday in one published report as saying that military documents
indicate that classified technical gear provided to the FBI in Waco
included specialized robot-driven video equipment and electronic
jamming devices.
</P>
<P>
   Published reports this week also have revealed this week that a
GAO investigation on military involvement during the seige was
unable to resolve questrions about why the FBI acquired
high-explosive 40mm military rounds during the seige or why a
number of U.S. Army Special Forces personnel were sent to Waco.
</P>
<P>
   In other developments Friday, the Associated Press learned that
a lab document that the Justice Department failed to give Congress
discloses that the FBI knew within eight months of the fiery end of
the Branch Davidian siege that military tear gas projectiles were
used.
</P>
<P>
   A key final page from a 49-page FBI lab report was turned over
to the House Government Reform Committee this week, along with an
internal Justice Department memo acknowledging it ``was not
produced to Congress'' during the 1995 investigations into the
tragedy near Waco, Texas.
</P>

repeatedly denied that any such fire-starting devices were used.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' final report had been completed Thursday. ``This
will be a document the whole country will be interested in,'' DPS
spokesman Mike Cox had said.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday afternoon, after the Statesman filed suit seeking to
have the report immediately made public, the agency's stance had
changed.
</P>
<P>
   Don Walker, who represented the Department of Public Safety,
which prepared the report, said its legal staff and other agencies
had not had time to determine if the report contained documents
that might not be public, such as classified Army documents. The
department needed the chance to retract certain information, if
necessary, Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   The department would seek a state attorney general's opinion on
whether to release deleted information, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In forwarding the Rangers' report on Thursday to the house
committee, DPS Assistant Director Thomas A. Davis made no mention
that it contained classified material. At the end, he noted that
DPS planned to make public the report on Monday ``unless otherwise
directed.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox was among several DPS employees _ none with any known
security clearances _ with access to copies of the report. On
Friday, The Associated Press reported that congressional aides were
busy sifting through the the report after it arrived in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Randall Terrell, attorney for the newspaper, said the Statesman
and other newspapers had requested the report, then being prepared,
at least eight days ago.
</P>
<P>
   Terrell cross-examined Duncan Fox, an attorney for the
Department of Public Safety, who said he did not know yet why parts
of the report might not be public. Fox also testified that there is
no state criminal investigation pending, which is an exception to
open records laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy for attorneys to say there is no exception to open
records laws,'' Walker countered. ``It's difficult for a state
agency to cite confidentiality statutes on very short notice.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Davis asked the state for a copy of the report, which he
had requested earlier in the day. They gave him the 13-page
narrative but said they hadn't brought the 200 pages of exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing irritated, Davis read the narrative in private. He
then ordered the state to turn over the report to the
American-Statesman, but postponed his own order until Saturday.
State attorneys would then have time to seek a reversal of his
order from the Third Court of Appeals in Austin, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While federal officials have long insisted there was no active
military involvement in the FBI's final tear gas assault, Francis
was quoted last month in one published report as saying the DPS had
evidence that could corroborate reports of active involvement by
the secret Delta Force in the April 19 debacle.
</P>
<P>
   Any direct military involvement in a civilian law enforcement
operation would have required a presidential waiver of the law
barring such activity. But military officials have insisted that
the military personnel on the scene were only observers.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Department of Defense documents had disclosed that
three special operations personnel were in Waco to observe the
April 19 assault. A Government Accounting Office investigator who
looked into military involvement in the Waco standoff was quoted
Tuesday in one published report as saying that military documents
indicate that classified technical gear provided to the FBI in Waco
included specialized robot-driven video equipment and electronic
jamming devices.
</P>
<P>
   Published reports this week also have revealed this week that a
GAO investigation on military involvement during the seige was
unable to resolve questrions about why the FBI acquired
high-explosive 40mm military rounds during the seige or why a
number of U.S. Army Special Forces personnel were sent to Waco.
</P>
<P>
   In other developments Friday, the Associated Press learned that
a lab document that the Justice Department failed to give Congress
discloses that the FBI knew within eight months of the fiery end of
the Branch Davidian siege that military tear gas projectiles were
used.
</P>
<P>
   A key final page from a 49-page FBI lab report was turned over
to the House Government Reform Committee this week, along with an
internal Justice Department memo acknowledging it ``was not
produced to Congress'' during the 1995 investigations into the
tragedy near Waco, Texas.

 &HT;    Kafelnikov, Agassi bidding for No. 1
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Clarke
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Yevgeny Kafelnikov guaranteed last week that he,
Richard Krajicek or Andre Agassi would win this year's U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   He took care of Krajicek in the quarterfinals; he gets his
chance against Agassi in today's semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Kafelnikov and Agassi are playing for No. 1 in addition to
playing for a spot in the final against the winner of the senior,
all-nice guy semifinal between Todd Martin, 29, and Cedric Pioline,
30.
</P>
<P>
   The third-seeded Russian believes today's match against Agassi
essentially will be the final, meaning the victor should easily
beat the other finalist.
</P>
<P>
   But Agassi, 29, disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have to play on Sunday, it's very dangerous to think
like that,'' he said. ``It's actually absurd. It's a ridiculous,
ridiculous concept.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, the seventh seed, and Pioline, who is unseeded, probably
would agree with Agassi. They've been fighting to convince people
just to pay attention to their half of the draw since top seed Pete
Sampras withdrew with a back injury.
</P>
<P>
   Martin made a strong case with his five-set victories and his
recovery from illness. Pioline played an outstanding match against
fifth seed Gustavo Kuerten in the quarterfinals that even impressed
Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an interesting matchup,'' Martin said. ``We're both
pretty aggressive in different ways.''
</P>
<P>
   He's probably the prettiest player to watch on the tour. I'm
probably at the other end of the spectrum.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin said Friday he had recovered from the stomach virus that
hindered him all week and didn't need intravenous fluids after his
quarterfinal.
</P>
<P>
   Martin also was amused to consider that Kafelnikov, at 25, was
the only men's semifinalist under age 29.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the older body is fit and healthy, I think it makes sense
that there can be success at this age,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I think experience and knowledge, maybe a little more
perspective than some of the other guys, might actually help.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Space fans: Astronaut Dan Barry, a tennis player and fan,
attended the Open on Friday after taking a USA Tennis banner on
board a shuttle mission in May.
</P>
<P>
   He also attended a news conference during the rain delay to
acknowledge how he plans to use Martin's five-set victory and
ability to fight when he talks to kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to use him and his performance as as an example when
I go to the schools and talk to kids about space flight, the issue
of discipline, never letting go no matter how far down, not getting
discouraged,'' Barry said.

RUNAWAY _ Right now, 134 kids _ including a 10-year-old _ are
missing from Arizona foster homes, all runaways. But little is
being done to find them. Child welfare officials and police say
scouring the streets for these children _ who don't want to be
found anyway _ is mostly futile. By KARINA BLAND. Story will move

 &QL; 
VOTERS _ It's easy to develop theories on why American voters are
breaking records for low turnout in elections, but it's a lot
tougher to find solutions for reversing the trend. As America nears
its first election of the 21st century, lawmakers, foundations and
civic groups are urgently trying to lure citizens back to the
polls. By JEFF BARKER. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL;

SUPERVOTER _ Phoenix's supervoters, mostly older, educated Anglos,
half of whom live in north-central Phoenix, are the ones

contrary, most citywide elections _ including last Tuesday's _ are
decided by pretty much the same 96,000 residents. By PAT KOSSAN.

NORTHRIDGE ENTERS A DIFFERENT WORLD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAWRENCE, Kan. _ Just about the time they hear the roar of the
crowd, they'll realize they're not in Northridge anymore.
</P>
<P>
   The Cal State Northridge football players, who played in front
of 3,000 people in last week's home opener, will see almost 20
times that many today when they play host Kansas at 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Jayhawks, who were blown out 48-13 at Notre Dame on Aug. 28,
expect to sell out renovated Memorial Stadium, which seats 50,250.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN has played in front of loud, hostile crowds before at
Montana, Montana State and Idaho State. But those experiences may
not compare to this. It's not only a home opener for Kansas, but
fans and alumni have been promised this to be the best Jayhawks
team in at least five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you can play a Big 12 opponent,'' defensive line coach
Terrance Johnson said, ``you have to be excited. We want (the
players) to know what kind of atmosphere they are going into.
(Kansas) is going to try and push us around a little bit. I know
what type of environment we're going into.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has been in Memorial Stadium before _ twice as a
linebacker at Colorado. CSUN interim head coach Jeff Kearin, who
was a graduate assistant at USC, says the Matadors might be
intimidated by the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see the high stands and the press box,'' he said, ``but
that wears off really quick. I don't think (the players) care who
they are playing.''
</P>
<P>
   The same can't be said of Kansas, which returns 16 starters from
1998 under third-year head coach Terry Allen. The Jayhawks, ranked
65th in Division I-A by Sports Illustrated, play at Colorado next
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our situation is that we came off Notre Dame and the history
and things there and then turn around and play a Division I-AA
school,'' Allen said Wednesday. ``If we have the mistakes we had
against Notre Dame, with the penalties and turnovers, then we could
very easily be upset.''
</P>
<P>
   A few Matadors are looking at tonight's game as a showcase for
their ability. Senior cornerback Chazz Moore, who at 6-foot-3 and
210 pounds has the size to play in the NFL, called it ``one of the
biggest games'' of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my opportunity to show Kansas and the world and all of
the doubters that I can play at that level,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Senior wide receiver Aaron Arnold, who also has aspirations of
playing professionally, knows the game is a chance for him to
shine.
</P>
<P>
   ``A crowd like that . . . makes me want to play harder,'' he
said. ``No one knows about Northridge (in Kansas). They are first
hearing of us right now because they are playing us.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole atmosphere is what college football is all about,''
he said. ``If you can't get geeked up about that, then there's
something wrong.''

TOLEDO: KIDS WILL BE `WIDE-EYED'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Shaped like a horseshoe and nestled along the
Olentangy River, Ohio Stadium is one of college football's grand
venues. It's 77 years old, it has 89,000 seats (bleachers only),
and it oozes tradition _ from Archie Griffin and Woody Hayes to the
OSU band's dotting of the ``I.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is not the loudest or most intimidating stadium the
Bruins have visited in recent years. It's not as big as Michigan
Stadium, and it's not as loud as Washington's Husky Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been to 87 or 88 stadiums; I've traveled all over the
country,'' Ohio State coach John Cooper said. ``(Ohio Stadium) is a
beautiful setting, but I don't think it's an intimidating place to
play. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``The loudest stadium I've taken a team into is (Husky Stadium)
in Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruins coach Bob Toledo, who visited Ohio Stadium twice as an
Oregon assistant, is not concerned about the upperclassmen who've
played in Husky Stadium and Arizona Stadium. But he's worried about
the 13 freshmen and sophomores who will start for UCLA tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The older guys, it won't bother them,'' Toledo said. ``The
younger guys will be a little wide-eyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Psssst: In case noise becomes a factor, the Bruins devoted a few
minutes each practice to the whisper drill, in which the
quarterback whispers the call to the center, who passes it down the
line of scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   The whisper drill has been UCLA's noise antidote for years, and
it keeps Toledo's vocal cords in working order.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like the (stereo) speakers; you lose your voice,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Key to the game: The performance of quarterbacks, runners and
receivers is always important, but the linemen will determine
tonight's winner.
</P>
<P>
   The team that runs the ball effectively and protects its
inexperienced quarterbacks has an enormous advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The matchup that intrigues me most is the lines,'' Toledo
said. ``Whoever wins the battle in the trenches will win the game.
It's because of the makeup of their team. They have big-play guys
on the offensive and defensive fronts. If we don't control either,
it'll be a long day for us.''
</P>
<P>
   What if: Imagine a USC linebacking unit last year of Chris
Claiborne and Na'il Diggs, Ohio State's All-Big Ten performer? It
could have happened, at the possible expense of USC's basketball
program.
</P>
<P>
   Diggs, a Dorsey High graduate, was going to attend USC until
signing day 1996, when the Trojans fired basketball coach Charlie
Parker. Parker was dating Diggs' sister, Roslyn Simpson, at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had faxed my (letter of intent) over that morning and then
Charlie got fired,'' Diggs said. ``The papers hadn't been
processed, so my sister went up and retained them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good situation and a bad situation. I don't think
(Parker) should have gotten fired, but it was good it happened at
that time and not a day later. There was just enough time to get
the letter back.''
</P>
<P>
   And sign with Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   The specialists: As always, field position and special teams
will be critical. Give the edge to . . . nobody.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA will use freshmen Nate Fikse and Chris Griffith to handle
punting and place-kicking duties, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Stultz is Ohio State's punter and kicker. He hasn't made a
field goal beyond 40 yards in eight games, and he averaged just 37
yards punting against Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams have skilled punt returners: Freddie Mitchell for
UCLA and Nate Clements for Ohio State.

HINGIS INTERVENES IN GRAND WILLIAMS PLAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLUSHING MEADOWS, N.Y. _ Martina Hingis smiled when asked about
Richard Williams' prediction of a U.S. Open final between his two
daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis smiled when she presented Williams with an autographed
T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis even smiled early on during her semifinal match against
Venus Williams yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The smile, though, was deceptive. Hingis, who takes a great deal
of pride in being the best women's tennis player in the world,
found nothing funny about the thought of two of her rivals playing
for one of the biggest tournaments of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want that final to happen, Williams and Williams,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Serena Williams, 17, did her part to make it happen with a 6-4,
1-6, 6-4 victory against defending champion Lindsay Davenport in
the first semifinal. But Hingis shattered Richard Williams' dream
match with a gutsy 6-1, 3-6, 6-4 victory over Venus, 19, in the
nightcap.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was 50 percent right,'' Venus Williams said of her father.
</P>
<P>
   He was almost 100 percent correct.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis, 18, was nothing short of brilliant in the first set, but
Venus Williams rallied to win the second. When she broke for a 3-2
lead in the third, Hingis looked fatigued and papa's prediction
looked good.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis, though, wasn't finished. By this time the smile was
gone, replaced by a look of steely determination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got tired at 3-2 when I was down, but I decided to keep
doing it,'' she said. ``I knew she was getting tired, too. I was
trying to keep her on the run, going right-left, right-left.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis was aided by Williams' inability to serve effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' serve has been clocked at a women's record 127 mph and
usually is one of the biggest weapons in her fully stocked arsenal,
but it was misfiring. Beginning in the second set she abandoned her
cannon and started hitting spin serves, just to get them in the
court, but in the third not even that was working.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis broke back to even the match, then held her serve to take
a 4-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' problems were compounded by leg cramps, and she was
broken again when she hit two serves into the bottom of the net for
a double fault.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess cramping is just fatigue, or you're sick,'' Williams
said. ``I don't think I drank enough water, either. I should have
taken my opportunities earlier so I wouldn't have had to have been
out there at that point.''
</P>
<P>
   With the final in sight, Hingis closed in for the kill. She
played with new energy, and got to match point on a running,
one-handed backhand stab off a drop shot that somehow landed in the
court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so lucky,'' she said. ``I put my racket there, and it
just went in.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis then hit a big serve to the backhand that Williams hit
long, and she had eliminated two dreams. There won't be an
all-Williams final, and Venus won't win her first Grand Slam title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was expecting to do a little better than I did,'' Williams
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Williams family, though, gets another shot at Hingis today
with Serena playing her in the final.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now she's playing for two people,'' Venus said.
</P>
<P>
   If it was known that only one Williams would advance to the
final, the smart money would have been on Venus. She was supposed
to be the sister ready to break though with her first Grand Slam
title.
</P>
<P>
   Serena, on the other hand, was supposed to still be in the
learning mode. But Serena showed her fortitude after dropping the
second set against the second-ranked player in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Like her sister, Serena had her serve desert her when she was
broken three times in the second set. However, she regrouped before
the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just decided I couldn't lose serve,'' she said. ``I had to
hold my own. Even though I was down the breaks, I said, `Serena,
you've got to stay strong.'''
</P>
<P>
   She did. Williams broke Davenport for a 4-3 lead, then served
out the match.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's always had a good serve,'' Davenport said. ``She seems
now to make some first serves in some bigger moments in a match.
She serves better than Venus does. She'll throw in a 115 \Rmph\S,
and then she'll mix it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Hingis, not Serena's sister, gets to face that serve.

<P>
   On April 4, 1980, eight were among those arrested in a stolen
van in Evanston and charged in connection with the armed robbery of
a car rental agency in Evanston. Several pistol and rifles were
found in the van. They were also charged with plotting another
armed robbery. The following were convicted of federal charges of
seditious conspiracy; interference with interstate commerce by
threats of violence, possession of an unregistered firearm,

HINGIS LETS HER DEEDS DO THE TALKING FOR HER
</HEADLINE>
   (ko) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Martina Hingis' talking head was bobbing on the
television monitors while Serena Williams was pounding forehands
like a broom handle on a dusty rug, practicing on an outside court
almost two hours after finishing off Lindsay Davenport to advance
to the final of the United States Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's outside practicing?'' Hingis said when told of Williams'
late-night session under the eye of her mother, Brandi. ``Right. Go
more and get cramps, too. Work really hard. I'm going to have a
massage. That's what I'm going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   And the diva has spoken. Hingis spent the entire two weeks of
the Open listening to the bold predictions Richard Williams made
about an all-Williams final. Instead of retorting with a devilish
comeback, she coyly waited for the moment of truth.
</P>
<P>
   This was it. It was late in the third set of her exhausting
semifinal with Venus Williams when she pounced on a chance to end
all the chatter. After Hingis broke to go ahead by 5-3, Williams
winced and grimaced.
</P>
<P>
   A moment later, as Williams' legs were being packed in ice,
Hingis was lying on her back on the side of the court with her legs
propped up as if she were tipped back in an easy chair. She had
time to take a deep breath, take the court and put the match away.
At the same time, she defied the predictions of Richard Williams.
Maybe one day he would be right, but not now. Unflinching, she held
her serve to win the match, 6-1, 4-6, 6-3, and advance to face
Serena Williams in the final.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis had watched Serena Williams beat Davenport. ``It's a bit
nerve-racking when you watch them, and you know you have to be next
on the court against Venus,'' Hingis said. ``With talking, I can't
beat them. I know that. So I have to, you know, try to beat them on
the court.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate about formal education aside, Hingis won with her
pinpoint shot-making, a chess grandmaster's decision-making and her
surprising conditioning. She was all brains between the lines.
Venus Williams, at 6 feet 2 inches, was the long and lean of the
two, the one famed for her good muscles and fitness. Only recently,
as she watched the Williams sisters gain on her, has Hingis begun
to hit the gym.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love that statement by Martina Navratilova,'' Hingis said.
``She said: `Anybody can get in good shape. Anybody can get well
physically, in good condition.' I never really used that, but I
worked on myself and that's where I am today. I wouldn't be without
that in the finals of, you know, the U.S. Open today.''
</P>
<P>
   At 5 feet 6 inches, Hingis popped out of Venus Williams' looming
shadow and showed she is still No. 1, still the one to beat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just go out there on court and try to beat them,'' Hingis
said. ``That's all I can do. I don't want to fight with words.''
</P>
<P>
   She fought back on the court. But with the final still yet to
play, Hingis was not ready to talk too boldly just yet. She could
have said, ``See, I'm still here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say that, because the results and the
rankings show it all,'' Hingis said. ``So far, I've never been able
at the same tournament to beat them. But you know, hopefully there
is always a first time. I'm going with no, like, huge expectations
into tomorrow's match. Of course, I want to win. We both had tough
matches. Just, you know, whoever is patient, more calm in that
match is going to win, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   A massage might do the trick.

ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS SEIZED FROM VESSEL TAKEN TO BASE IN ESQUIMALT,
B.C. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, B.C. _ A Canadian navy destroyer carrying between 150
and 170 illegal Chinese migrants arrived in Esquimalt near
Victoria, B.C., Friday night, the latest development in what
officials are calling the largest human smuggling operation in
Canadian history.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese, believed to be from Fujien province, were earlier
taken off an unmarked coastal steamer that was boarded by Canadian
authorities off the coast of Vancouver Island on Thursday night.
They are being taken to the Canadian forces base in Esquimalt.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth such boat seized in Canadian waters since July
20. The boats have carried a total of more than 600 Chinese who
have pledged or paid smugglers an average of about $38,000 for the
trans-Pacific crossing, often in filthy, crowded conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the largest operation we have ever seen off the West
Coast. We believe organized crime is responsible,'' said Constable
Tracey Rook of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
</P>
<P>
   A fifth boat, spotted sinking off the Queen Charlotte Islands in
early July, is believed to have earlier discharged its human cargo
on shore. Immigration officials have not apprehended anyone from
the so-called ``ghost ship.''
</P>
<P>
   Rob Johnston, enforcement manager for Immigration Canada, also
described the succession of vessels as ``the largest smuggling
operation ever experienced in Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnston confirmed Friday that 32 Chinese from the first boat,
who were routinely released after applying for refugee status in
Canada, have disappeared. Nationwide warrants have been issued for
their arrests after they did not appear for scheduled meetings with
immigration officials.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials speculated privately that some or most
may have gone to New York, where they work off the cost of passage.
</P>
<P>
   Canada has since clamped down on subsequent releases. It was
holding 378 illegal migrants before the latest boat was seized off
Nootka Sound, about 170 miles northwest of Victoria.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ship is considerably larger than previous ships. It is a
small coastal freighter rather than a decrepit fishing boat,'' said
Lt. Cmdr. Chris Henderson of Canada's Department of National
Defense. He said the migrants aboard the ship appeared to be in
good health.
</P>
<P>
   The 250-foot-long ship was sighted about 500 miles off Vancouver
Island on Tuesday by a long-range military patrol aircraft. ``As
luck would have it,'' Henderson said, the naval destroyer Huron had
been dispatched to aid the RCMP and Immigration Canada in
apprehending the vessel.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian officials declined to say whether the United States
assisted in detecting smugglers' ships headed for the coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not at all prepared to discuss sharing of information
between the Canadian Armed Forces and the American military,''
Henderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration Canada said it knows of no other smuggler boats
presently headed for the West Coast. But the human cargoes have
been arriving at a rate of one every 12 days. Based on interviews
with the Chinese passengers, many of them reluctant to talk,
officials have privately speculated that as many as 11 boats are
headed eastbound across the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Canada hopes the arrival of fall storms from the Gulf of Alaska
will deter further human smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our understanding there is a finite window for this kind
of activity,'' said George Varnai, Vancouver manager for
Immigration Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The latest boat was ordered to halt late Thursday afternoon at a
point 18 miles off Vancouver Island. The smugglers' boat instead
increased its speed toward shore. But with the Huron bearing down
on it, and three helicopters hovering overhead, the boat stopped
and a white T-shirt was hoisted.
</P>
<P>
   The vessel was then escorted to historic Nootka Sound, where
18th-century British explorer Capt. James Cook first landed and
traded with natives for furs in what is now Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that _ thankfully _ we might have taken them by
surprise,'' Henderson said. ``It is critical that we deny certain
information to the persons planning these operations, so they do
not make changes in their plans.''
</P>
<P>
   The illegal immigrants, and those holding them, have been caught
in a vise.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese are mainly poor farmers or street merchants with
little education. They live in fear of the smugglers _ known as
``snakeheads'' _ and have been reluctant to provide information,
Rook said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston said reports from the Chinese community in Vancouver
indicate that smugglers and their agents have threatened those from
the first boatload of migrants who were released.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the illegal migrants have applied for refugee status in
Canada. Such applications take an average of 11 months to process,
although officials are trying to speed up the paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   Those whose refugee claims are refused will be repatriated to
China, if that country's government agrees to take them.

BUSH SKIPS A STOP, AND GORE ACTS FAST TO TAKE ADVANTAGE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rhode Island may be a tiny state, but no place is
too small for the presidential candidates to wage a symbolic battle
over education.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, the front-runner for the Democratic
nomination, decided to divert his campaign plane Friday to visit
elementary-school children there who were disappointed when George
W. Bush, the Republican front-runner, missed a scheduled visit on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bad weather had grounded his plane in New Hampshire, but Bush,
the Texas Governor, did manage to make a $1,000-per-person campaign
fund-raiser in Providence later that day.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Gore appeared at a ``press conference'' with the kids in
a crowded auditorium at the Ella Risk School in Central Falls, as
his spokesman, Chris LeHane, told reporters, ``We'll choose kids
over cash every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's trip to Rhode Island, which has four electoral votes, was
to showcase him at the school, where most of the students are
Hispanic. But he arrived more than an hour late and decided to skip
the school event and press ahead to the fund-raiser so that he
would be on time for his next stop, in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Bush told reporters at the airport that he was disappointed not
to visit the school. ``The weather prevented me from going,'' he
said. ``And people shouldn't read any message into the fact that I
wasn't able to make it to the school, because education has been my
top priority as governor of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats swooped in to portray the governor as
hard-hearted. William J. Lynch, chairman of Rhode Island's
Democratic Party, said, ``I was delighted to see that they could
make that big of a public-relations mistake,'' adding that Bush
could have gone to the school and skipped the fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   And Gore's supporters swung into action. Sen. Jack Reed, the
state's Democratic senator _ and chairman of Gore's campaign in
Rhode Island _ and Rep. Patrick J. Kennedy, D-R.I., alerted Gore,
Lynch said. The Gore campaign then decided to shoehorn in a visit
to the school on Gore's way to New Hampshire, demonstrating a
nimbleness that Gore has been criticized for lacking, but a certain
nervousness about the strength of the Bush campaign as well.
</P>
<P>
   Kiki Moore, a spokeswoman for Gore's campaign, said: ``It's
clear a lot of people took notice of this story. We got the
invitation, and we're happy to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Mindy Tucker, a spokeswoman for Bush, said that by the time Bush
could have gone to the school, ``the kids were at lunch and it
would have been pretty disruptive.'' She said he met with school
officials on his way out of town and promised to return later in
the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Of Gore's visit to the school, Ms. Tucker said: ``It's
interesting that the sitting vice president is not only copying
Governor Bush's campaign theme _ prosperity with a purpose _ but he
is now copying his schedule.''

FOR GONZALEZ, A HIGH PRICE FOR IMMORTALITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   POMONA _ There are two ways for a thoroughbred jockey to achieve
immortality. One is to win the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   J.C. Gonzalez took the more common way Thursday at Fairplex
Park. He died on the racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe there would have been a Derby in the future of the
23-year-old, Mexican-born Reseda resident who had made a first,
faint mark on the sport by winning the 1998 riding championship on
the small oval that claimed his life.
</P>
<P>
   But the chilling fact of the matter is that a young man who
chooses a career of clinging to the backs of 40 mph animals has a
better chance to end up draped in lilies than in roses.
</P>
<P>
   There's one Derby winner a year. The rules of thumb on jockeys'
mortality are that an average of two a year will be killed in races
and that about a dozen out of every 1,000 will meet their fates in
action.
</P>
<P>
   Something like 2,500 injuries are reported to the Jockeys' Guild
each year. Keep in mind that there are only a little more than
2,500 jockeys in North America.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a question of (begin ital)if(end ital) you're going
to get hurt,'' Guild national manager John Giovanni has said.
``It's a question of when you're going to get hurt, and how
severely.''
</P>
<P>
   Severely enough, and a jockey shares an all-too-permanent place
in history with dead race-car drivers, boxers and matadors, and
assassinated politicians. People who knew the risks and accepted
them as the price of glory.
</P>
<P>
   Any veteran fan of the local thoroughbred circuit can tell you
about George Woolf, a Santa Anita Handicap winner who mysteriously
toppled off a horse in the track's clubhouse turn and was killed;
about Jack Westrope, flung against a post inside the Hollywood Park
rail and killed; about Alvaro Pineda, smashed against a poorly
padded starting gate at Santa Anita and killed.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez replaces Pineda with the ``not since'' distinction
among Southern California thoroughbred riders.
</P>
<P>
   Harness fans will tell you about driver Shelly Goudreau, who
tried to bail out the back of a sulky at Hollywood Park and struck
his head on the hard-packed soil. Quarterhorse fans recall Juan
Limon, whose death at the Los Alamitos finish line in 1994 made him
the last man to die in a local race of any breed.
</P>
<P>
   According to the statistics, if you take into account the
paralyzing injuries as well as the fatal ones, that kind of
immortality is more likely to happen to a little man in a helmet,
flak jacket and boots than any other athlete.
</P>
<P>
   There are two ways of interpreting those stats: Way too many
jockeys get killed and maimed, or it's amazing it doesn't happen
more often.
</P>
<P>
   Jockeys bounce to their feet after horrific-looking accidents,
and fans come to think of them as bullet-proof. Riders get scooped
into ambulances and rushed to hospitals with what turn out to be
minor injuries, and race-watchers learn _ incorrectly _ to quit
worrying.
</P>
<P>
   I've watched races regularly for a decade and I've seen jockeys
killed a hundred times. J.C. Gonzalez was the first who actually
died.
</P>
<P>
   Kent Desormeaux was thrown from a crazy horse named Judge Hammer
in front of the Hollywood Park grandstand one soggy afternoon at
Hollywood Park in 1992, was kicked in the forehead by a trailing
runner, and was briefly motionless in the mud. For my money, he was
lucky to escape with a fractured skull and one deaf ear.
</P>
<P>
   Desormeaux was back riding at Santa Anita just six weeks later,
and bravely sent his first horse through a gap along the rail to
win. Jockeys, of all athletes, recover the quickest from injury
because they're incredibly fit and they don't earn if they don't
ride.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez was out for three months after breaking his pelvis and
a leg at Santa Anita in 1997. He won with his first mount back.
</P>
<P>
   ``He presented himself not as crazy, but as brave,'' said John
Daley, assistant to trainer Sandy Shulman, whose horse Wolfhunt
broke down under Gonzalez on Thursday. ``You knew he was going to
give you an honest effort.''
</P>
<P>
   You'll hear racegoers say they feel sadder for dead horses than
for dead jockeys. The horses, they note, weren't permitted a career
choice.
</P>
<P>
   You didn't hear anybody say that Thursday. You won't hear it for
a while.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a heroic bravery to ride the battle-scarred horses who
populate the county fairs, even the relatively classy Los Angeles
County Fair. When an athlete like that dies, a hero is lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never watch a race the same way again, I know that,''
Daley said Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Daley watches from the safety of a trainer's box. Imagine
watching from a saddle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been very fortunate in my career, so I tend to get a
Superman complex, like I'm invincible,'' said four-time Fairplex
riding champion Corey Black.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back to reality, boys.'' &QL;

MARTINEZ STRIKES OUT 17 AS RED SOX DOWN YANKEES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Information is shared freely on the Yankees' bench
during games, the hitters gossiping about the opposing pitcher's
weaknesses. But there was no free-flowing exchange of thought
Friday night, no theories. They said nothing, for they had nothing
to say while Boston's Pedro Martinez dominated them in historic
fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez struck out 17 _ the most ever against the Yankees _ and
allowed a single hit, and Boston beat the Yankees, 3-1, in a sense.
A total of 28 Yankees batted, one over the minimum, and those
making the loudest noises among the 55,239 at Yankee Stadium were
fans of the Red Sox, or just those cheering for Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't get beat by the Red Sox,'' said Paul O'Neill, the
Yankees' right fielder. ``We got beat by Pedro Martinez.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimy Williams, the Boston manager, said it was the best pitching
effort he's ever seen. David Cone agreed, less than two months
removed from throwing his own perfect game. Joe Torre, the Yankees'
manager, mentioned Bob Gibson and Sandy Koufax, as he drew
comparable efforts from his memory.
</P>
<P>
   Said Martinez: ``This is as good as it gets, I won't lie.''
</P>
<P>
   As if he might fool anybody. As if the Yankees had any chance.
Derek Jeter was Martinez's first strikeout victim, on a 97 mph
fastball in the first inning, and Chuck Knoblauch was his 17th and
last, on a 97 mph fastball. The Yankees scored their only run in
the second inning, when Chili Davis whacked a home run. Every
Yankee hitter struck out at least once, including Darryl
Strawberry, who pinch-hit in the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry smiled slightly when asked about his plan for his
at-bat. ``I didn't really have a plan,'' said Strawberry. ``I had
no clue, I didn't know what to try, or anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch was hit by a pitch in the first inning and was thrown
out attempting to steal. No other Yankee reached scoring position.
``We didn't have anybody on base,'' said Jeter, ``except Chili _ he
was on base for about five seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   It was as if the Yankees were swinging within a darkened closet,
for Martinez was throwing all three of his pitches for strikes. His
fastball was moving, said Tino Martinez, and he was spinning his
curveball for strikes, and when you looked for the fastball, then
he would throw a changeup, the ball dropping away like Pedro
Martinez was pulling the string on a yo-yo.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter struck out to lead off the seventh, and Martinez would
whiff seven of the last eight hitters he faced as well. He retired
the last 22 batters he faced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow'' Cone said to Mariano Rivera after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is pitching,'' Rivera replied.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Ledee slipped into a side room at Yankee Stadium Friday
afternoon to watch videotape of Martinez, to remind himself of how
the pitcher's fastball moves, how his changeup fades. You try to
keep the same approach against all pitchers, Ledee said, but facing
a great pitcher is a special challenge, the tension and
concentration increasing.
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate his point, Ledee told of facing Anaheim's All-Star
pitcher Troy Percival last Monday: Ledee drew a walk, after a tough
at-bat, and while leading off base, Ledee noticed a film of sweat
covered his arms. Sweat from nerves. Darryl Strawberry batted after
Ledee, battled but struck out to end the game, and as they sat in
front of their lockers side-by-side minutes later, Ledee saw the
same sweat on Strawberry's arms. This is what facing someone like
Martinez or Percival is like.
</P>
<P>
   Great pitchers make mistakes, Paul O'Neill said, but the
difference is they will not repeat their mistakes. If a hitter sees
a mistake from a great pitcher, he must take capitalize. Martinez
showed incredible stuff early: In one sequence of three pitches
against Derek Jeter, he ratcheted the velocity of his fastball from
93 to 95 to 97, and Jeter struck out.
</P>
<P>
   So did Bernie Williams, leading off the second inning, and Tino
Martinez was fooled with a changeup. Five Yankees had batted, none
of them appearing as if they had any chance at getting a hit.
</P>
<P>
   Davis batted with two outs in the second inning, no one on base.
He probably is in the final month of regular-season baseball in his
career and is often overpowered by high fastballs _ unless he
anticipates the pitch correctly. Martinez fired a fastball low but
over the middle of the plate, the sort of mistake O'Neill
mentioned: You must capitalize.

   Davis timed his swing and smashed the ball, and it quickly
carried into the raucous fans of the right field bleachers, the
18th home run of the season for Davis. ``When we hit the home
run,'' said Torre, ``you're hoping the score stays 1-0.''

   But Mike Stanley smashed a two-run home run off Andy Pettitte
for Boston in the sixth inning, and it seemed like the Yankees
trailed 10-0, Torre said; Martinez was that good. When the Red Sox
added a run in the top of the ninth, ``it was like we had another
mile to go,'' said Torre.

   Scott Brosius led off the bottom of the ninth and swung and
missed at a curveball. Strawberry was blown away by a high
fastball. And on his 120th and last pitch, Martinez fired a
fastball past Knoblauch, who walked away silently, like the rest of
his speechless teammates.  &QL;
