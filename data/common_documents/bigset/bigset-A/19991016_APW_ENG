<HEADLINE> Russia: Aeroflot Laundered Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Russian investigators suspect that  
media mogul Boris Berezovsky and two airline executives hid some 
$600 million of hard currency in Switzerland -- almost three times 
more than any figures previously revealed -- according to court 
papers released today. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators had previously accused Berezovsky of hiding and  
laundering about $200 million. The new figure was given to Swiss 
authorities by Russian investigators who asked for Swiss help in 
finding evidence and blocking bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian investigators claim Berezovsky, Nikolai Glushkov and  
Alexander Krasneker stole $400 million of profits from the Russian 
airline Aeroflot. They also allege the three took $200 million in 
air traffic fees. 
</P>
<P>
	The money was hidden in two Swiss companies, Andava and Forus  
Services, the Russian investigators say. It was then laundered 
through various financial operations, including purchases of 
property and shares, the investigators say. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation is still underway, and Berezovsky has denied  
the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The two Swiss companies and two of their directors had appealed  
many of the investigators' moves, including the freezing of bank 
accounts, the seizure of documents and the questioning of one of 
the directors by Swiss prosecutors in the presence of the Russian 
investigators. The Swiss federal court said today it has turned 
down those appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	Forus has insisted that ``it has not committed any  
irregularities whatsoever.'' The firm says it arranged some $180 
million of short-term credit facilities for Aeroflot in 1997 and 
1998 for such needs as buying airplanes. It insists it never 
possessed or had access to Aeroflot funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Swiss prosecutors seized large quantities of documents from  
Forus and Andava during a search of the two companies in July. The 
search came after Switzerland decided to help Russia investigate 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Forus said it filed a suit against  
Switzerland's former federal prosecutor, Carla del Ponte, for 
possible industrial espionage and breach of official secrecy. 
</P>
<P>
	Forus accused del Ponte and her colleagues of passing documents  
from Forus to Russian prosecutors, with the full knowledge that 
those documents would be passed on to Aeroflot. That improperly 
provided the airline with inside information on Forus, the company 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Berezovsky reportedly has considerable holdings in the media,  
auto manufacturing and the oil industry. He announced this summer 
that he would run for parliament in December elections.

<HEADLINE> Glance at Earthquake Magnitudes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	While no serious damage has been reported from today's Southern  
California earthquake, its preliminary magnitude -- 7.0 -- was more 
than strong enough to bring major destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	Earthquake magnitudes are measures of earthquake size calculated  
from ground motion recorded on seismographs. With each scale, an 
increase in one full number -- from 6.5 to 7.5, for example -- means 
the quake's magnitude is 10 times as great. 
</P>
<P>
	There is theoretically no top limit to the scale, but a  
magnitude 8 is considered to be capable of tremendous damage. On 
Sept. 19, 1985, a magnitude 8.1 earthquake in Mexico left 9,500 
people dead. 
</P>
<P>
	A magnitude 7 quake brings the potential of widespread damage.  
On Oct. 17, 1989, the Loma Prieta earthquake in Northern California 
killed 67 people and caused an estimated $6 billion in damage. It 
was a 7.1 magnitude. 
</P>
<P>
	While technically less severe, magnitude 6 quakes have sometimes  
proven more devastating in California. Southern California's last 
serious brush with such a quake was on Jan. 14, 1994, when a 
magnitude 6.7 quake struck Northridge, just north of Los Angeles, 
killing 72 people and causing an estimated $40 billion in damage.

	Report: U.S. Seeks Bargain on Russian Arms Treaty  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Clinton administration is offering to help  
Russia complete a large missile tracking radar if it agrees to 
renegotiate an arms control agreement so the United States could 
build a national missile defense system, The New York Times 
reported Sunday. Under the proposal, the United States would help 
the Russians finish their radar near Irkutsk, Siberia, the paper 
said, citing unidentified Russian and American officials. A 
nationwide defense system is prohibited by the 1972 Antiballistic 
Missile Treaty. Moscow has so far refused to alter it.

	N.C. Declares Emergency As Irene Nears  
</P>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, N.C. (AP) -- North Carolina Gov. Jim Hunt declared a  
state of emergency today and officials considered evacuations as 
Hurricane Irene rumbled it way up the East Coast. Officials warned 
that it wouldn't take much rain to push rivers in the eastern part 
of the state back above flood stages. Irene's 80-mph winds also 
could threaten camper villages populated by people left homeless by 
floods from Hurricane Floyd. As of 8 p.m. EDT, the center of the 
storm was about 250 miles south of Charleston, S.C., and moving 
north near 10 mph. So far, Irene has claimed at least seven deaths.

	SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Police scattered scores of supporters of  
Gen. Augusto Pinochet on Saturday, shooting water cannon at them as 
they protested the former dictator's arrest exactly one year ago. 
Reporters saw at least six demonstrators being detained by police 
during the protest by 500 people near the British and Spanish 
embassies in Santiago's upper class Las Condes district. Police

	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Iran on Saturday rejected Washington's  
latest request for dialogue, saying friendly words were not enough 
to make up for past insults. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State 
Martin Indyk on Thursday renewed an offer for Iran and the United 
States to hold talks ``on the basis of equality and mutual 
respect.'' The aim, Indyk said, was to encourage Iran to support 
Mideast peacemaking and to stop supporting terrorism by halting the 
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.

	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Following months of delays, the  
government and leftist rebels will begin peace negotiations next 
weekend in hopes of ending Colombia's 35-year civil conflict, the 
two sides announced Saturday. The talks will begin Oct. 24 in 
Uribe, one of five southern towns that has lived under open rebel

	JOSHUA TREE, Calif. (AP) -- A 7.0-magnitude earthquake in the  
Mojave Desert shook millions awake in three Western states early 
today, but left only a handful of injuries and no deaths. 
Californians credited location and luck for eluding catastrophe in 
the most powerful quake to hit the state since 1992. The quake 
derailed an Amtrak train and knocked out power to thousands. Up to 
90,000 utility customers lost power, mobile homes were knocked off 
pilings in the desert community of Ludlow and a highway bridge was 
cracked.

it down at a garage in Queens in time for his evening concert. ``I 
was in such a rush, I was so exhausted, I'd given a concert at 
Carnegie Hall last night. I just forgot,'' Ma said after he got the 
instrument back. Grinning with relief, he explained that police 
used the taxi receipt to find the driver within hours. ``Luckily, 
luckily I had the receipt, so all of you, take the receipt,'' Ma

<HEADLINE> Charges Filed in W.Va. Bank Failure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) -- Two officers of a failed West Virginia  
bank have been charged with interfering with federal regulators, 
including burying three truckloads of bank documents in a 100-foot 
trench. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Church, senior vice president of the First National Bank  
of Keystone and president of Keystone Mortgage Co., and Michael 
Graham, executive vice president of the mortgage company, were 
charged Friday with conspiracy to obstruct the Office of the 
Comptroller of the Currency in its investigation of bank activity. 
</P>
<P>
	The mortgage company is a wholly owned subsidiary of the bank.  
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Attorney's Office filed a motion to arrest Church and  
Graham but refused to say if they had been arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	The OCC, which regulates nationally chartered banks, closed the  
bank in southern West Virginia on Sept. 1 after discovering 
``apparent fraud'' involving $515 million in loans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Keystone bank management was unable to explain or eliminate  
the discrepancies,'' said an affidavit of FBI Agent Robert Selbe 
released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges are based on Church's and Graham's actions between  
June 21, when the comptroller's investigation of the bank began, 
and Sept. 1, said U.S. Attorney Rebecca Betts. 
</P>
<P>
	Missing bank records, enough to fill 22 boxes, were found at  
Church's home on Sept. 2, Selbe said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, investigators found a trench on her ranch filled  
with bank records. It was 100 feet long, 10 feet deep and 30 feet 
wide, Selbe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two large truck loads of documents, plus a pickup load, were  
dumped into the trench, Selbe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Church, 46, and Graham, 49, each face up to five years in prison  
and a $250,000 fine if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Church did not return a phone call Friday. Graham's home number  
is unlisted.

<HEADLINE> Battle for Control of L.A. Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A fight has erupted over who is running the  
nation's second-largest school district, with the Board of 
Education insisting that a new chief executive has been brought in 
to help, not shove aside the embattled superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
	Some supporters of Superintendent Ruben Zacarias questioned  
whether the school board's action to isolate him from day-to-day 
operations was racially motivated, while the man taking on those 
responsibilities insisted that he is simply there to help. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone in the city knows that the management of Los Angeles  
Unified School District needs help. We are here to help Dr. 
Zacarias,'' Howard Miller, the district's new chief executive 
officer, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the Board of Education voted 4-2 to create the  
position of CEO, give it to Miller effective immediately and have 
everyone in the school district but Zacarias report to Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	The move followed a board shakeup by voters in April and fierce  
controversy over management arising from construction of a $200 
million school on a toxic site and the possible loss of $900 
million in state bond money for 100 new schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The stakes are high: The 707-square-mile district is operating  
on a $7.4 billion budget, teaches 697,000 students, runs 790 K-12 
schools as well as 140 other types of schools and centers, and has 
67,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, dozens of parents, district employees and several  
Hispanic leaders, staged a rally in support of the superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
	``(This) is not about race, not about ethnicity. It is about  
stability. It is about process and it is about credibility,'' state 
Sen. Richard Polanco told Zacarias' supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	County Supervisor Gloria Molina said the issue was about race.  
</P>
<P>
	``Ruben is a symbol of what's going on here,'' Molina said. ``I  
think (this) is a direct attack on the Latino community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Board of Education President Genethia Hayes said Miller's  
appointment would not be rescinded. 
</P>
<P>
	The district has come under increasing criticism since it was  
discovered that the $200 million Belmont Learning Center, the 
nation's most expensive high school, was being constructed on a 
site contaminated with explosive methane and other toxic 
pollutants. 
</P>
<P>
	It was also recently discovered that the district is so far  
behind in its paperwork for building new schools that it may miss 
the deadline to qualify for $900 million in state bond money. 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone was happy about the new CEO.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think Mr. Miller is a lawyer and not a teacher, not an  
educator, so how can he know what's good for our kids?'' said 
Rafaela Macadamia, whose three daughters go to Toluca Lake 
Elementary School. ``When we were trying to get rid of a bad 
principal, I sent letters to Mr. Zacarias and he responded.''

<HEADLINE> Earthquake Strikes Southwest U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A magnitude-7.0 earthquake centered in the  
Southern California desert shook buildings from downtown Los 
Angeles to Las Vegas early today and knocked an Amtrak train off 
its tracks. There were no immediate reports of serious injuries or 
major damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak said its Southwest Chief en route from Chicago to Los  
Angeles derailed in the Mojave Desert near Ludlow, a community more 
than 125 miles northeast of Los Angeles. The passenger cars 
remained upright. 
</P>
<P>
	There were 155 passengers on the 25-car train. Passenger Sharon  
Kososinski said there was no panic on board. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most people were sound asleep,'' she told CNN. ``It was  
rocking and rolling, back at the sleeper cars ... That's the part 
of the train that's completely off the tracks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said one passenger dislocated her shoulder. Amtrak said it  
planned to take the passengers to Los Angeles by bus. 
</P>
<P>
	Karen Kahler, a seismologist at the California Institute of  
Technology, said the quake hit at 2:46 a.m. and was centered 32 
miles north of Joshua Tree, 100 miles east of Los Angeles. There 
were multiple aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The earthquake was felt across hundreds of miles of Southern  
California and at least as far away as Yuma, Ariz. With a 
preliminary magnitude of 7.0, it was more than strong enough to 
cause major destruction but was centered in a remote area with few 
structures or residents. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 5,000 and 10,000 people lost power in Los Angeles and  
there were scattered transformer explosions. Downed power lines 
started small brush fires near Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was a bad one. Things are bouncing around all over. But  
we are all right. I have to go and call the kids,'' Lucille Manning 
said from her home in Chino, east of downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	The earthquake woke up tourists in Las Vegas, more than 150  
miles from the epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't sure what it was,'' said John Fabian, who was staying  
on the 18th floor of the Mirage Hotel. ``My wife hit me and said 
we've got to get ... out of here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fabian's wife, Michele, added: ``The whole place was shaking  
like crazy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities in Las Vegas and the Los Angeles area said there  
were no reports of serious damage or injuries. Authorities received 
a few calls from frightened people who were curious about damage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most people just slept right through it,'' said Lt. Rich  
Paddock of the Orange County Sheriff's Department. ``It shook 
everything pretty good, but that was about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The effects of the earthquake were more pronounced near the  
epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
	California Highway Patrol dispatcher Joe Serrano in Barstow said  
a bridge on Interstate 40 was heavily damaged but the freeway 
remained open. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacob Naylor, night manager at the Joshua Tree Inn in Joshua  
Tree, said the structure lost power but there was no sign of 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Twelve guests, all definitely awake. A couple in from Holland,  
definitely shocked. A couple in from the U.K. asked me, `Is this 
normal?''' Naylor said. ``They're all taking it rather well, kind 
of excited. Vacationers, new experiences, what can I say?'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Yucca Valley, the Hi-Desert Medical Center was relying on  
emergency power, as was the San Bernardino County Sheriff's station 
in Joshua Tree. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerri Hagman, owner of the Homestead Inn in Twentynine Palms,  
near the epicenter, said she had a lot of broken dishes and things 
thrown off shelves. She couldn't see any structural damage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a native Californian and I've been in a lot of them; this  
was a whopper,'' Hagman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I live in town, and my house was rocking and rolling,''  
Gunnery Sgt. Leah Gonzalez said from the Twentynine Palms Marine 
base. ``We were diving for the door frames.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She paused as an aftershock hit at about 6 a.m., then said:  
``That was a strong one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Ridgecrest, a small community about 250 miles north of Los  
Angeles, groceries toppled from shelves and awoke residents, but 
officials said there were no reports of damage or injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was asleep and shaken out of bed,'' said Rachel Holden, an  
editor at the Ridgecrest Daily Independent. 
</P>
<P>
	On Jan. 17, 1994, a 6.7-magnitude quake struck Northridge, near  
Los Angeles, killing 72 people and causing an estimated $40 billion 
in damage. 
</P>
<P>
	``The level of shaking is comparable to what was experienced in  
Northridge,'' said Lucy Jones, a seismologist with U.S. Geological 
Survey at Caltech. ``The good news is that there are fewer people 
out there.''

<HEADLINE> SMU Warns of 'Disturbing' Violations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Suspended Southern Methodist University assistant  
football coach Steve Malin might have committed more serious 
violations than the school originally believed. 
</P>
<P>
	While most of the information gathered appears to be ``secondary  
in nature,'' not all the findings can necessarily be deemed as 
minor, athletic director Jim Copeland said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have found things that are disturbing beyond secondary  
violations,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	SMU announced on Aug. 6 that it suspended Malin with pay and  
hired the Kansas City law firm of Bond, Schoeneck &AMP; King to 
investigate. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA defines secondary violations as those that provide a  
limited recruiting or competitive advantage and are isolated or 
inadvertent. 
</P>
<P>
	Major violations are any other than secondary, specifically  
those that provide an extensive recruiting or competitive 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	Copeland would not discuss the specifics of the findings, but  
said they did not involve any other current or past SMU coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	Malin was interviewed in the past two weeks, the final step in  
the investigation, Copeland said. 
</P>
<P>
	SMU is the only school the NCAA has given its ``death penalty''  
to, shutting down the football program in 1987 after a string of 
``pay for play'' incidents. SMU sat out the 1988 season on its own 
in what would have been a restricted-schedule season. 
</P>
<P>
	Copeland said Friday he does not believe the new violations were  
severe enough to warrant death penalty considerations again. SMU 
has not decided whether to impose sanctions of its own when 
reporting its findings to the NCAA, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond, Schoeneck &AMP; King has worked extensively on university  
athletics investigations and worked closely with the NCAA in the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
	Copeland said NCAA officials sat in with the firm ``during areas  
that would have been sensitive'' in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about Malin's future as a coach at SMU, Copeland said,  
``That remains to be seen.''

<HEADLINE> Disarray in Planned GOP Advertising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Inaugurated three weeks ago with some fanfare  
as a multimillion-dollar ad campaign, an effort by House 
Republicans to target a dozen Democrats has been plagued by 
internal squabbling and embarrassing missteps as well as a spirited 
counterattack. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus far, a single commercial has aired in eight districts at an  
overall cost of about $300,000, according to Republican officials. 
</P>
<P>
	In part, the effort has been slow in starting because some  
Republicans -- GOP House campaign committee chairman Tom Davis among 
them -- are lukewarm to a costly campaign more than a year before 
the election. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, though, officials in Virginia, Davis' home state,  
asked that the ad not be run as planned. In Mississippi, an ad was 
aired in which the local Democratic congressman's name was 
mispronounced. In Texas, the Democratic target successfully 
appealed to television stations not to air the commercial. 
</P>
<P>
	The ad campaign, announced by Davis last month, is designed to  
depict Democrats as raiders of the Social Security trust funds, 
willing to plunder it for other ``big government'' programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Imagine a world where there's no punishment for a crime,'' the  
commercial begins, an announcer's ominous tones accompanied by 
menacing images and unsettling music. 
</P>
<P>
	The commercials are designed to dovetail with a Republican  
legislative strategy of passing spending bills that leave the 
Social Security surplus untouched. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans will spend ``in the millions'' of dollars airing the  
commercials, Davis told reporters Sept. 29, adding that the ads 
would air in ``upwards of a dozen'' districts. 
</P>
<P>
	While no ads have run for several days, ``We're going to do a  
new series of ads very soon,'' Jill Schroeder, spokeswoman for the 
National Republican Congressional Committee chaired by Davis, said 
Friday. She added that GOP leaders and others were being asked for 
money. ``This is really bothering the Democrats, and they're 
scared, and we've got them on the run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Erik Smith, a spokesman for the Democrats, countered that  
Republicans are running ``an incredibly shrinking ad campaign. 
There's no evidence of it anywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In private meetings, according to participants who spoke on  
condition of anonymity, Davis has expressed reluctance to use 
campaign committee funds for an advertising effort more than a year 
from the election. They said Davis was pressured by the powerful 
GOP whip, Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody was going to stampede me into doing things that  
leadership wanted to be done,'' Davis said in an interview. He said 
he ``held up the running of the ads until I was comfortable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the speaker's issue. I just implement,'' DeLay said in a  
separate interview, referring to House Speaker Dennis Hastert, 
R-Ill. ``He's been wanting things to go, and nothing seemed to be 
getting done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Numerous officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity,  
provided these other details: 
</P>
<P>
	--The Republican National Committee sent word to Davis in advance  
not to request money for the ad campaign, believing the election 
was too far away. 
</P>
<P>
	--The state Republican party in Virginia appealed successfully to  
the NRCC not to air ads as planned in the district of Democratic 
Rep. Owen Pickett, who was unopposed for re-election last year. 
</P>
<P>
	In a campaign subplot, Davis is attempting to recruit state Sen.  
Ed Schrock to challenge Pickett in 2000. Schrock is a state senator 
seeking a new term in next month's legislative elections, and a 
public decision to run for Congress would be an acknowledgment he 
does not intend to serve out the new term. 
</P>
<P>
	--Two top GOP targets -- first-term Democratic Reps. Rush Holt in  
New Jersey and Joe Hoeffel of Pennsylvania -- have not had ads run 
in their districts, in what one GOP aide said was a decision to 
save money. 
</P>
<P>
	There were other problems.  
</P>
<P>
	In the district of Rep. Ronnie Shows, a Mississippi freshman,  
the congressman's name was mispronounced by the announcer: It 
rhymes with how, not show. ``People are laughing about it'' at 
home, Shows said recently. The ads were remade to correct the 
error, although the state party asked the NRCC to refrain from 
airing them to avoid interference with statewide elections next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Chet Edwards successfully appealed to stations in his Waco,  
Texas, district not to run the commercial. ``They came awfully 
close to calling me a criminal,'' Democrat Edwards said of the GOP 
attacks. ``I didn't think they were supported'' by the facts. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Republican motives were more complicated than  
Davis acknowledged in remarks to reporters last month. 
</P>
<P>
	According to GOP officials, these included an effort to stiffen  
the resolve of rank and file GOP lawmakers to support spending 
bills that avoid using Social Security funds. 
</P>
<P>
	They also included a desire to prepare ground in swing districts  
for challengers either beginning their campaigns or as yet 
unidentified. Thus, the GOP ran ads in Michigan and West Virginia, 
where Democratic retirements have created two competitive open 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
	For their part, Democrats mounted a rapid counterattack.  
</P>
<P>
	The White House and Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt branded the  
commercials -- three were prepared but only one aired thus far -- 
``the big lie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee advised  
rank-and-file lawmakers to respond aggressively. Moreover, most of 
the lawmakers targeted by the commercials voted for Republican 
``lock box'' legislation to safeguard the Social Security trust 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the end, by talking about your member's record on Social  
Security, this debate will boost your member's credentials on this 
issue at a time when the public would otherwise not be paying 
attention,'' Democrats were advised in an internal memo.

<HEADLINE> 5 Killed When Irene Downs Powerlines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Mary Anne Ruda, her twin sons and their teen-age  
friend were out for a walk during a respite in Hurricane Irene, 
which had pounded south Florida all day. 
</P>
<P>
	For hours, the storm had raged, eventually dumping more than a  
foot of rain in some areas. Shortly before 10 p.m. Friday, after 
the rain subsided, Ms. Ruda, 48, and 11-year-old twins Max and Mike 
decided to go outside in their Weston neighborhood with their 
dachshund and 14-year-old Douglas Hemphill. 
</P>
<P>
	Strolling ahead of Ms. Ruda, the boys and the dog walked into a  
puddle, not seeing a power line submerged in the murky water. 
</P>
<P>
	They were all instantly electrocuted, their bodies collapsing  
into the water, said Cheryl Stopnick, a Broward Sheriff's Office 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Ruda ran toward her children. When she stepped into the  
water near the boys, she too was electrocuted. 
</P>
<P>
	The four were among the five people killed by Irene as it  
crossed Florida on Friday. The storm moved over the Atlantic early 
today and turned north. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida Power &AMP; Light responded immediately to the deaths in  
Weston, about 20 miles west of Fort Lauderdale, by cutting power to 
lines in the neighborhood, Stopnick said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's awfully tempting after a storm or when the rain lets up  
to go out or let your kids lay in the puddles,'' she said. ``But 
this is a tragic example of why this is a dangerous idea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fifth death was tragically similar. In Cooper City, 10 miles  
to the east, two teen-age brothers were walking home through partly 
flooded streets, after buying candy and soda. 
</P>
<P>
	The oldest, a 13-year-old, saw a power line under 18 inches of  
rain water and picked it up, sending deadly voltage coursing 
through his limbs, said Marvin Stoner, with the Cooper City Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	``His younger brother noticed his older brother was in distress  
and grabbed him,'' Stoner said. ``He was shocked, released his 
brother and ran home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The younger brother fetched his parents who returned to perform  
CPR to no avail. The older boy died at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Police did not identify the boys.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've been here 12 years and I can't remember in the past where  
anybody was electrocuted in this manner,'' said Stoner.

<HEADLINE> Chernobyl May Run Until Next Summer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -- The only working reactor at the Chernobyl  
nuclear power plant, site of the world's worst nuclear accident, 
will probably keep running until the summer of 2000, a news report 
said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision was taken ``in principle'' following a session of  
Ukraine's governmental commission on Chernobyl, held at the plant 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials pointed out at the meeting that there was enough  
nuclear fuel to operate Chernobyl's reactor No. 3 until next 
summer, the UNIAN news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Ukraine earlier pledged to close down the plant by 2000, but the  
government later said it wouldn't happen unless the former Soviet 
republic got enough money to complete two new reactors in 
compensation for power lost at Chernobyl. 
</P>
<P>
	The two new reactors, whose construction was halted after the  
1991 Soviet collapse, are more than 80 percent finished and are of 
a safer type than the reactor that exploded at Chernobyl in 1986.

<HEADLINE> Atlanta's Rocker Gets Burned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Don't expect one seeing-eye single to steal the  
swagger from John Rocker. That's not how this reliever works. 
</P>
<P>
	Rocker came running out of the Atlanta bullpen Saturday night in  
the eighth inning, anxious to finish a sweep of the New York Mets 
and clinch the National League pennant for the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	And, as far as he was concerned, he was as good as he's been,  
despite the two-run single by John Olerud that rescued the Mets for 
a 3-2 stay-alive victory in Game 4. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made the pitch I wanted, low and away,'' Rocker said. ``He  
hit a well-placed three-hopper. It was one of the cheaper hits off 
me my entire year. An infield hit cost us two runs. It wasn't like 
he hit a double off the wall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rocker arrived with runners at first and second and two outs and  
the Braves leading 2-1 and four outs away from the World Series. 
Olerud had homered earlier against John Smoltz for the lone Mets 
run, but the Braves played the percentages, putting in their power 
pitcher, a left-hander to face the lefty hitter. Olerud was 0-for-9 
with five strikeouts against Rocker, so the move was obvious. 
</P>
<P>
	With Shea Stadium rocking, water bottles flying out of the  
stands as the reliever ran to the mound, Rocker savored the moment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Didn't bother me at all,'' said the reliever, who celebrates  
his 25th birthday Sunday. ``They think they're in my head. They're 
not. I pitched as well the last two days as I have all year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All week, he has been Public Enemy No. 1 in New York after  
leveling a string of insults at the city and its fans. Rocker saved 
Game 3 for the Braves on Friday night and delighted in the moment. 
Now he was in position to finish the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Standing on the mound, he paid no attention to the runners --  
Roger Cedeno on second and Melvin Mora on first. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't thinking of the runners at all,'' he said. ``I was  
solely focused on the hitter. I couldn't tell you who was on first. 
Mora, I think. I've got a terrible pickoff move. What am I gonna 
do?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Bobby Cox excused the lapse.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think he was intent on getting the hitter out,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Rocker tried a curveball and the runners took off on a double  
steal. Suddenly, the tying and go-ahead runs were in scoring 
position. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew they were going to double steal there,'' Cox said.  
``That was an automatic. It was a curveball down and away and we 
couldn't get rid of the ball. We had a plan where to throw it. It 
was such a slow pitch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now it was up to Olerud. Atlanta's defense shaded him to the  
left, figuring he could not pull Rocker. 
</P>
<P>
	``We never play him to pull,'' shortstop Ozzie Guillen said.  
</P>
<P>
	Rocker went back to work on Olerud and made the pitch he wanted.  
Olerud slapped it up the middle. Guillen lunged for it. ``I touched 
it,'' he said. ``I catch it, he's out because he's a slow runner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the ball squirted through.  
</P>
<P>
	``If Ozzie's one step to the left, the play gets made,'' Rocker  
said. ``If the play's made, we're three outs away from the World 
Series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the ball bounced by and the runners scored. On the Mets  
bench, there was elation, not only because they had taken the lead 
but because it had come against Rocker, who had tormented them. 
Reliever Turk Wendell noted that Olerud was due. ``Rocker had 
dominated long enough,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	So was the victory sweeter because of the victim?  
</P>
<P>
	Wendell paused.  
</P>
<P>
	``No,'' he said. Then he added, ``It was beautiful.''

<HEADLINE> Body of Abducted Kansas Girl Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRAIN VALLEY, Mo. (AP) -- Cherri West made emotional appeals to  
her daughter's kidnapper and went sleepless for days after the 
10-year-old was snatched while roller skating in front of her home. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, her long vigil ended in heartbreak: Pamela Butler's  
nude body was found covered with sticks in a wooded area. The FBI 
would not disclose how the fifth-grader died or whether she had 
been sexually assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
	``For someone to come here and do this, it's just not right,''  
Ms. West said. ``She was just a little girl, she had a whole life 
ahead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 100 officers had searched a field and woods Friday in  
Grain Valley, about 25 miles from the girl's home in Kansas City, 
Kan. The body was found near a church where a pickup truck believed 
to have been used in the kidnapping was spotted a few hours after 
Pamela disappeared Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A suspect, Keith B. Nelson, 24, was captured Thursday after he  
was seen near the Kansas River. Police said he tried to swim away 
as officers approached. 
</P>
<P>
	The pickup truck was registered to a company formerly owned by  
David Cunningham, Nelson's boss. Cunningham said Nelson had been 
driving the truck for two weeks, the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
	In court papers, the agency quoted a coworker of Nelson's as  
saying that Nelson told him two weeks ago that he ``would like to 
kidnap a girl to rape, torture, electrocute, kill and bury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson, who underwent surgery Friday for knee and ankle injuries  
suffered in a fall after the abduction, has been charged with 
kidnapping. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Hill, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Missouri,  
said the death penalty is possible in a kidnapping case in which 
the victim dies. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are serious charges,'' he said. ``We now know there were  
serious consequences to this case, and we want to do what we think 
is appropriate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The only comment I will make at this time is that I hope the  
public remembers it's important to allow the criminal justice 
system to proceed,'' said Nelson's lawyer, Daniel Franco. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 200 people on Friday filled the tiny lawn in front of  
the Butler home for an informal memorial service, adding to a 
growing mound of flowers and stuffed animals on the porch. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. West said she had braced herself for bad news.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was worried about her not eating and being cold,'' she said,  
crying. ``Now I don't have to worry about that, but this isn't the 
way it should have been.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Giuliani Slipping in Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Whether or not they will be able to cast a  
vote for next year's Senate race in New York, Americans are looking 
less favorably upon anticipated candidates Rudolph Giuliani and 
Hillary Rodham Clinton, according to a poll released Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The CBS News poll found that 16 percent of those questioned  
nationwide earlier this month gave Giuliani, New York City's 
Republican mayor, an ``unfavorable'' rating. Six percent found him 
unfavorable in a March 1998 poll. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Giuliani's favorable rating also rose during the same  
period, with 21 percent of respondents reporting a favorable 
impression of the mayor, up from 16 percent in March 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Northeasterners are driving the ratings dive for Giuliani, with  
24 percent reporting unfavorable impressions of him this month, up 
from 7 percent in March 1998, the poll found. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani's popularity continues to rise among Republicans, with  
29 percent reporting favorable impressions of the mayor, up from 20 
percent in March 1998. Negative ratings among Republicans grew 
seven percentage points, from 3 percent to 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Mrs. Clinton, 36 percent of those polled this month had  
unfavorable impressions of her, up from 20 percent in January 1999. 
Forty percent said they had a favorable impression of the first 
lady, down from 55 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Pollsters found a drop in the number of women who look favorably  
on Mrs. Clinton and an increase in the number who see her 
unfavorably. Thirty-one percent of respondents this month said they 
have an unfavorable opinion of her, up from 17 percent in January 
1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-four percent said they have a favorable impression of Mrs.  
Clinton, down from 61 percent in January 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	With the election still more than a year away, neither Giuliani  
nor Mrs. Clinton has formally announced for the seat being vacated 
by Democratic Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oct. 3-4 telephone poll of 871 adults has a margin of error  
of 3 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	A poll earlier this month of New York voters found Giuliani and  
Mrs. Clinton in a statistical dead heat. 
</P>
<P>
	That poll, released Oct. 6 from Marist College's Institute for  
Public Opinion, found the mayor favored by 46 percent of the 
state's voters, while 42 percent backed Mrs. Clinton. Other polls 
have also shown them about even.

<HEADLINE> Spurs Win International Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILAN, Italy (AP) -- Now that's more like it.  
</P>
<P>
	One night after a cold-shooting Tim Duncan and the San Antonio  
Spurs narrowly averted an unprecedented upset, the NBA champions 
captured the McDonald's Championship with a record-setting 103-68 
rout of Brazil's Vasco da Gama in Saturday's finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan led all players with 32 points and 18 rebounds and was  
named tournament MVP. He helped remove any doubt about the eventual 
outcome, and the Spurs' second-stringers produced an impressive 
fourth quarter -- outscoring the South American champions 24-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Vasco da Gama's 68 points were the lowest for a McDonald's game.  
American guard Charles Byrd led Vasco with 17 points. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs upped the NBA's record to 18-0 in the 12-year history  
of an event billed as the world club championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan was as responsible as any of the Spurs for the team's  
dismal semifinal performance against Italy's Varese Roosters on 
Friday, hitting just 5-of-15 shots from the field and 5-of-12 from 
the free-throw line. San Antonio trailed until midway through the 
fourth quarter before prevailing 96-86. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 7-foot, 248-pound Duncan was unstoppable Saturday before  
a quiet crowd of 10,122 at Milan's sold-out FilaForum arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Vasco da Gama tied the game 10-10 just 5:39 in as Byrd made a  
free throw awarded when the normally cool David Robinson (16 
points, seven rebounds) drew a technical for arguing a charging 
call. 
</P>
<P>
	That's when the game fell apart for the South Americans. They  
went nearly five minutes without a field goal and compounded 
matters by not getting back on defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Avery Johnson, who finished with 14 points and six assists, made  
two baskets to get San Antonio going, before Duncan took over. 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA Finals MVP scored 10 consecutive points -- off a long  
jumper, two fastbreak layups and four free throws -- and added two 
blocks as the Spurs built a 24-10 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	At that juncture, nine minutes into the game, Duncan had  
outscored Vasco da Gama 16-10. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs stretched their advantage at halftime to 56-36 as  
Duncan reached the break with 20 points and seven rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brazilian team's only run during the first half came at the  
start of the second quarter, when Vasco cut the deficit to 11 as 
Duncan took a much-deserved rest for the first five minutes of the 
period.

	SoCal Quake Shakes Three States  
</P>
<P>
	JOSHUA TREE, Calif. (AP) -- A magnitude-7.0 earthquake in this  
remote Southern California desert retreat shook millions awake 
early today in three states and derailed an Amtrak train, but 
caused no serious damage or injuries. The quake jolted gamblers out 
of bed in Las Vegas and shook buildings as far away as Phoenix. Up 
to 90,000 utility customers lost power, mobile homes were knocked 
off pilings in the desert community of Ludlow and a highway bridge 
was cracked. Amtrak's Southwest Chief en route from Chicago to Los 
Angeles derailed in the Mojave Desert near Ludlow, 125 miles north 
of Los Angeles. But the passenger cars remained upright.

	CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand (AP) -- A crew wearing frosty beards  
and red coats bid an American doctor who may have breast cancer a 
joyful goodbye today as a plane rescued her from their South Pole 
research station -- in a relatively balmy 58 degrees below zero. Dr. 
Jerri Nielsen, a 47-year-old mother of three, was inspected by 
physicians after the flight from the pole to McMurdo base on 
Antarctica's coast. She was then believed to have been flown to 
Christchurch, in southern New Zealand, to wait for a flight to the 
United States, but military and U.S National Science Foundation 
officials refused to confirm her whereabouts.

	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Pakistani army officers combed bank  
records and questioned travelers at airports today after the new 
military regime made economic revival and the hunt for looted 
wealth its top priorities. The search for illicit assets was the 
first act of the regime, which ousted the elected government 
Tuesday, announced emergency rule and proclaimed army chief Pervaiz 
Musharraf as the supreme leader. Musharraf canceled a promised 
television address today that was expected to outline an interim 
government. His spokesman did not say when the speech would be

	Irene Blamed for Seven Deaths  
</P>
<P>
	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- A hurricane watch is up along much  
of the North Carolina coast today as Hurricane Irene threatens to 
bring heavy rains and wind tonight and tomorrow. The storm, blamed 
for at least seven deaths, was expected to hug the East Coast as it 
moved north and forecasters feared it could gain strength and dump 
several inches of rain on flood-weary eastern North Carolina 
through the weekend. A hurricane watch issued today stretches north 
to Cape Hatteras, N.C. The hurricane knocked out power to more than 
a million people in Florida.

	LINTHICUM, Md. (AP) -- The NAACP's national board today approved  
a tourism boycott of South Carolina until the state removes the 
Confederate battle flag from the Statehouse dome. ``The 
ratification officially mobilizes all of our chapters and members 
to not visit or spend dollars in South Carolina until the flag is 
removed,'' said NAACP spokeswoman Sheila Douglas. More than $280 
million a year that black travelers spend in South Carolina could 
be at stake.

	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Russian artillery and tanks dug in atop a  
hill just outside the Chechen capital Grozny today in preparation 
for what Moscow said was the next phase in its campaign to wipe out 
insurgents. After their deepest push yet into the breakaway 
republic, Russian troops were digging in on heights overlooking the 
city, which is now well within range of Russian artillery. Col. 
Gen. Viktor Kazantsev said that his troops had finished creating a 
security zone to seal off the militants, and that a second phase 
was underway to wipe out the bases of the insurgents.

	LONDON (AP) -- Bill Gates thinks if anyone wants to take over the  
world, it's the man who accused him of wanting to -- media tycoon 
Rupert Murdoch. In an interview with the BBC scheduled to air this 
weekend, the Microsoft Corp. chairman says: ``He's hiding behind 
me. He's your man.'' ``Someone who owns a newspaper can pick up the 
phone to the editor and say `run headlines I like,''' Gates says 
referring to Murdoch's News Corp. empire. ``What we do is create 
tools like a word processor that lets people express their ideas 
and we're not at all involved in how they choose to use it.''

	VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Fifth-seeded Greg Rusedski of Britain  
defeated unseeded Roger Federer of Switzerland 6-3, 6-4 today to 
reach the finals of the $800,000 CA Trophy tennis tournament. 
Rusedski will face Germany's Nicolas Kiefer, a 7-6 (11-9), 6-4 
winner over sixth-seeded Dutchman Richard Krajicek, in tomorrow's 
finals. Kiefer, who needs to be among the top eight to make the ATP 
World Championships in Hanover in November, picked up valuable 
points by moving into the final and increasing his ranking to 
sixth.

<HEADLINE> Pettitte, Saberhagen To Work Game 4 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- There is baseball after the dream duel. And some  
pretty good pitchers, too. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not Pedro Martinez vs. Roger Clemens, but Sunday night's  
Bret Saberhagen-Andy Pettitte matchup of stars who have overcome 
problems is still intriguing. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are all important at this particular time,'' Saberhagen  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The buzz from Boston's 13-1 win Saturday, which pulled the Red  
Sox to 2-1 in the best-of-7 AL championship series, may not have 
faded by the time Saberhagen and Pettitte try to improve on their 
seasons of struggle and success. 
</P>
<P>
	Saberhagen had three different stints on the disabled list but  
finished with a 10-6 record and 2.95 ERA. Pettitte nearly was 
traded to Philadelphia but stayed in New York, had five wins and a 
1.76 ERA in August and ended at 14-11. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the last couple of years I have kind of been in that same  
situation where they seemed like they talked about trading me,'' 
Pettitte said. ``So the only thing was this year it was intensified 
a little bit more and I really did feel like that I might be 
gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the deal with the Phillies in the works, Yankees manager  
Joe Torre and general manager Brian Cashman were able to persuade 
owner George Steinbrenner to keep the lefty. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was pleased that he allowed us to make that decision,''  
Torre said. Pitching coach ``Mel Stottlemyre and myself basically 
could not shake the memory of how well he has pitched in postseason 
and in very important games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1996 World Series, Pettitte pitched eight shutout innings  
in a 1-0 win over Atlanta that gave New York a 3-2 lead. In 1998, 
he pitched shutout ball in the Game 4 World Series clincher against 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	And in Game 2 of this year's division series sweep against  
Texas, he allowed one run over 7 1-3 innings of a 3-1 victory. It 
was a high point in a season in which he left the team to visit his 
father, who was having heart problems in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is tough'' to listen to trade rumors, said Pettitte, who  
ended the season at 14-11 and has 81 wins in five seasons. ``I felt 
that I was able to block that out and continue to try to work on my 
pitching, try to figure out what I was doing wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre said Pettitte was throwing his pitches well, but ``it was  
just a matter of how aggressive he was going to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Pettitte thought he'd be pitching for a different team,  
Saberhagen felt he might not be pitching at all. 
</P>
<P>
	He was just 21 in 1985 when he won the AL Cy Young Award and was  
MVP of the World Series with the champion Kansas City Royals. But 
he missed all of 1996 and most of 1997 following shoulder surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	He was 15-8 for Boston in 1998, but fraying of the rotator cuff  
in his shoulder forced him to the disabled list for the third time 
this year on Aug. 23. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we weren't in contention I probably would have kind of shut  
it down at that particular time,'' Saberhagen said. ``Really seemed 
like I went through spring training four different times this 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He went 3-0 in September and finished the season with 11 walks  
in 119 innings. But he had two poor starts in the division series 
against Cleveland, walking four in 3 2-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``My arm felt good for the first time in a while and I think  
that I was caught up with the way that the shoulder was feeling and 
not really concentrating on pitching,'' Saberhagen said. 
</P>
<P>
	He might need surgery in the offseason but works hard at his  
rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is a warrior,'' Red Sox manager Jimy Williams said. ``He  
has been through a tremendous amount of pain and hard work and 
coming to the park early.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With all that Pettitte and Saberhagen have endured, it would be  
nice if their meeting Sunday claimed at least a corner of the 
spotlight commanded by Clemens and Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is once in a lifetime,'' Torre said of Saturday's game.  
``Tomorrow we will get back to business again.''

<HEADLINE> Quake Upends Calif. Town of Ludlow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LUDLOW, Calif. (AP) -- David Rockwell stood in the middle of his  
kitchen on Saturday staring at the broken memories on the floor. 
Photographs, china, ceramic birds, all damaged or destroyed when a 
magnitude-7.0 earthquake struck this remote desert town. 
</P>
<P>
	Rockwell and his girlfriend, Jackie Adams, have one of 22 mobile  
homes in the Ludlow Mobile Home Park. Every one was knocked off its 
foundations, leaving the town's only residential neighborhood at a 
tilt. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's been saving almost all of this since we've been  
together,'' he said, picking up broken champagne glasses, given to 
them to toast their new life in Ludlow six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The epicenter was just a few miles south of Ludlow in a desolate  
mining patch called Hector. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten miles west of town, an Amtrak train on its way from Chicago  
to Los Angeles derailed when the quake knocked 21 of 25 cars off 
its rails, slightly injuring four people. Five miles away, an 
overpass on Interstate 40 was cracked at both ends. 
</P>
<P>
	``This kind of thing can put you out of business. It was a  
miracle it wasn't any harder. With the train and the overpass and 
the problems here, it's pretty bad,'' said town owner John Knoll. 
</P>
<P>
	Ludlow, founded in 1882 by the Ludlow Mining Co., was once a  
booming frontier post along the Santa Fe Trail. Route 66 was built 
through the town in the 1920s, making Ludlow a key stop on the 
2,448-mile ``mother road'' between Chicago and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Knoll and his brother bought Ludlow in 1978, a few years before  
Route 66 was decommissioned. Valued at $7 million, the town 125 
miles east of Los Angeles includes the boarded up Ludlow Fire 
Department, Ludlow Cafe and Ludlow Arco. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knolls provide free housing for 43 employees and  
transportation for a dozen more who are bused in from Barstow every 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	At the mobile home park, air conditioning and heating units were  
crumpled on driveways, staircases overturned, satellite dishes 
collapsed and windows shattered. 
</P>
<P>
	The three houses in Ludlow were still upright, but there was  
extensive damage, including crushed china, smashed pictures and 
dangling light fixtures. 
</P>
<P>
	Knoll said he even lost his toilet. ``It just rolled over on its  
side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Within minutes after the 2:46 a.m. quake, nearly all of the  
town's residents gathered in a parking lot to make sure everyone 
was OK, check damage and ride out a wave of aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
	They were joined by about half a dozen motorists who drove in to  
find the gas pumps out of commission because of a power outage. The 
next station is 35 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Ford was on his way home from Colorado to Lake Elsinore.  
</P>
<P>
	``We stopped here to get gas on our way to Colorado,'' he said.  
``We figured we could get it here on the way back. Now, I don't 
have enough to get to the next station.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Motorist John Ryan was so desperate he paid $20 for a 5-gallon  
can of gas from another driver hauling jet skis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not staying here any longer than I have to,'' he said  
following an aftershock.

<HEADLINE> Report: Mrs. Clinton Offered Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In the spirit of fairness, the talk-radio  
station that gives Mayor Rudolph Giuliani a weekly show is offering 
Hillary Rodham Clinton her own chance to take calls from New 
Yorkers, the Daily News reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	``She wants to do her listening tour. What better way to  
listen?'' said Phil Boyce, program director for WABC-AM. ``And she 
would be able to talk to 150,000 people at a time. She would be 
able to get her message out faster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aides to the potential Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate  
from New York said the idea hadn't been ruled out. Howard Wolfson, 
a spokesman for her Senate exploratory campaign, said he looked 
forward to talking with Boyce. 
</P>
<P>
	Should she accept the show, Mrs. Clinton would join a largely  
conservative program lineup, including Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, 
Matt Drudge and Curtis Sliwa. Also on WABC is Giuliani, who will 
likely pursue the Republican nomination for the seat being vacated 
next year by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan. 
</P>
<P>
	The hour-long call-in program would be run the same way as the  
mayor's Friday morning show, with calls screened by WABC staffers, 
said Boyce. 
</P>
<P>
	The slot is being offered now because it is the fair thing to  
do, he added. Federal law does not require the station to offer 
Mrs. Clinton equal airtime until both she and Giuliani become the 
official nominees of their parties, which would not happen until 
the Democratic primary in September.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Plan for Gov't Disabled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today announced new steps to  
promote the advancement of people with disabilities who work for 
the federal government, saying he wanted to ensure that the 
nation's largest employer leads by example. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm releasing the first-ever government plan to ensure  
positive career paths for people with disabilities in our federal 
work force,'' Clinton said in his weekly radio address. ``I'm 
directing every federal agency and department to take concrete 
action to expand opportunities for people with disabilities in all 
levels of the work force, from entry to senior ranks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president said that despite good economic times, three out  
of four people with disabilities who want to work can't find work. 
He also said that if economic prosperity is going to continue, 
employers must seek new pools of employees. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm calling on all agencies to recruit and promote people with  
disabilities, to reach out to students with disabilities, to 
provide reasonable accommodations for applicants and employees with 
disabilities,'' Clinton said. ``I'm also calling on our federal 
human resources agency, the Office of Personnel Management, to 
ensure that every agency gets the help it needs to fulfill these 
commitments. We are the nation's largest employer. I want it to be 
a model for private industry, and this plan will help to do just 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also renewed his call for Congress to pass legislation  
that would ensure that people with disabilities don't lose their 
federal health care coverage when they get jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the biggest barriers facing people with disabilities is  
the fear of losing their health insurance when they get a job,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under current law, many people with disabilities cannot keep  
their Medicaid or Medicare coverage if they work.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Volcano Threatens To Erupt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANOS, Ecuador (AP) -- Tungurahua volcano, which looms over the  
tourist town of Banos, could erupt any day, the government said 
Saturday as it began evacuating nearby communities. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said increased volcanic activity had forced them to  
declare an orange alert, which meant the mountain could erupt 
within days or weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	For a month Tungurahua had been under a yellow alert --  
predicting an eruption within weeks or months. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said at least 12,000 of the 25,000 people threatened  
by the volcano already had left the area. One hundred buses were 
evacuating the remaining inhabitants on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Banos, a town famed for its hot springs and mountain trekking,  
is wedged into a narrow valley directly at the foot of the volcano, 
75 miles south of Quito. 
</P>
<P>
	For several days, the volcano has been expelling gases, steam  
and ash, which has fallen on nearby villages. A government census 
revealed Thursday that ash had caused 40,000 chickens to die of 
respiratory infections. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts have calculated there is an 80 percent chance Tungurahua  
will erupt, as it has done 13 times since 1534. The last eruption 
was in 1920. 
</P>
<P>
	President Jamil Mahuad flew over the volcano and endangered  
communities on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're ready for the emergency, but you don't know how brutal  
the force of nature can be,'' he said in his weekly radio message 
to the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Ignacio Vargas, governor of Tungurahua province, said police and  
military were helping with the evacuation. 
</P>
<P>
	``This won't be permanent,'' he said. ``We will have to wait  
until the eruption ends so that everyone can return to his normal 
activities.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Sets Record for Fund Raising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                      *Associated Press Writer-    	
</P>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The Seattle Mariners' bats have been silent for  
days at Safeco Field, but Republican presidential front-runner 
George W. Bush hit the political equivalent of a grand slam 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor, whose campaign treasury is closing in on the  
$60 million mark, a record, lent his starpower and fund-raising 
prowess to Sen. Slade Gorton, the state GOP and the National 
Republican Senatorial Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The event, the first political event staged in America's newest  
and most expensive ballpark, raised more than $400,000, the largest 
single fund-raising event in Washington state history. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's senior advisers said it's part of a new strategy of  
cementing his relations with congressional incumbents -- the very 
ones he has criticized generically in recent days -- and with GOP 
organizations in key battleground states. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like to help my friends,'' Bush said in an interview.  
</P>
<P>
	Aides said Bush has been swamped for months with requests and  
that after the bulk of his own fund-raising was completed, the 
governor decided to work in some of the events. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary draw nearer, he  
will have to concentrate on his own race more, his political 
strategists said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a benefit for me to do this,'' Bush said. ``It will  
help me a lot, if I am elected president, to have my friends in the 
House and in the Senate and in governors' mansions all across this 
great land. I'm asked a lot (to do campaign appearances and 
fund-raising), and I will do what I can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans haven't carried Washington in the past three  
presidential elections. Bush's father, former President George 
Bush, lost the state in both 1988 and 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just about time to break that streak,'' Bush told about  
400 people at the Safeco Field event. He told reporters he thinks 
his platform -- including education, free trade, a strong military 
and sensible environmental controls -- will resonate with Washington 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a little early to tell what the dynamics are going to be  
for the general election, but my political antennae tell me I have 
a good chance. There is a certain disgruntlement with the status 
quo. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush fans paid $1,000 and up to dine on salmon, salad and wine,  
and hear speeches from Bush and Gorton. It was called a ``grand 
slam'' event -- and the setting was appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
	Tables, set up on the outfield, were covered with linen  
tablecloths, china and pots of flowers. The speeches were broadcast 
on giant screens on the Mariners' scoreboard.

<HEADLINE> Henderson Adds To Controversy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- By this time of the season, the New York Mets  
are used to dealing with turmoil. So what's one more episode? 
</P>
<P>
	Moments after New York's dramatic 3-2 win over Atlanta to stave  
off elimination Saturday night, reliever Turk Wendell lashed out at 
a teammate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a scrappy bunch because we don't quit,'' Wendell said  
after the Mets won Game 4. ``Except for one person. You'll find out 
who soon enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wendell apparently was directing his comments at Rickey  
Henderson, who bolted from the clubhouse less than three minutes 
after the game ended. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson, who was replaced by Melvin Mora in the top of the  
eighth inning, was already showered, dressed and on his way out of 
Shea Stadium with a cardboard box of bats in his hand and a 
clubhouse attendant following him with a duffle bag. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets already have had to deal with a season full of  
controversies. General manager Steve Phillips fired three coaches 
in June following an eight-game losing streak, causing friction 
with manager Bobby Valentine. 
</P>
<P>
	Valentine nearly came to blows with outfielder Bobby Bonilla in  
the middle of one game. Valentine also came back to the Mets dugout 
in a disguise after being ejected in a game in June, leading to a 
two-game suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest dispute came last week, when Valentine criticized his  
own players in Sports Illustrated. He told an interviewer: ``You're 
not dealing with real intelligent guys for the most part,'' and 
said five of the players were ``losers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 40-year-old Henderson, who hit .314 with 87 runs scored this  
season, was a spark plug at the top of the order for most of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	But his failure to run out balls consistently and some  
mysterious ailments have drawn criticism from some teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sept. 23 in Atlanta, Henderson jogged from first to third on  
Edgardo Alfonzo's double. Henderson then ran through a stop sign 
from third-base coach Cookie Rojas and was easily thrown out at the 
plate, costing New York at least one run in an important game. 
</P>
<P>
	He then pulled himself out of the game with what the team called  
a tight left hamstring. He didn't miss a game. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson also left Game 2 in the second inning with an upset  
stomach, prompting some clubhouse grumbling about his desire.

<HEADLINE> Yo-Yo Ma Forgets Cello in Cab </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It was the day the music almost disappeared.  
</P>
<P>
	Musician Yo-Yo Ma forgot his $2.5-million, 266-year-old cello in  
the trunk of a taxi on Saturday, but police tracked it down at a 
garage in Queens in time for his evening concert. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did something really stupid,'' Ma said sheepishly after he  
got the instrument back. ``I was in such a rush, I was so 
exhausted, I'd given a concert at Carnegie Hall last night. I just 
forgot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grinning with relief, he explained that police used the taxi  
receipt to find the driver within hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somehow magic happened, and I have my cello,'' said Ma. ``The  
instrument is my voice. So I need it. ... I would be crying right 
now'' if it hadn't been recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	Ma, who lives in Cambridge, Mass., put his cello in the taxi's  
trunk as he rode from Central Park West to the Peninsula Hotel on 
Fifth Avenue to prepare for a Saturday night concert at the 
Anchorage in Brooklyn, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the cab pulled away at 1:20 p.m., he realized he'd  
forgotten the cello, which was made in Venice in 1733. He declined 
to estimate the value of the instrument, but a police source said 
it was worth between $2 million and $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	He notified Peninsula security and they called police, said  
Inspector Thomas Purtell, commanding officer of the Midtown North 
precinct. 
</P>
<P>
	Police, working with officers from the Taxi and Limousine  
Commission, found the taxi's medallion number and discovered it was 
based at a garage in Queens. 
</P>
<P>
	Police had the cello back to Ma by 5:15 p.m., just in time for  
him to make it to his show beneath the Brooklyn Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
	``Luckily, luckily I had the receipt, so all of you, take the  
receipt,'' Ma said.

<HEADLINE> AL Playoffs Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- There was such a buzz about Saturday's pitching  
matchup between Roger Clemens and Pedro Martinez that even some of 
the players were caught up in the excitement. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I didn't have a ticket, I'd probably sneak in,'' said Red  
Sox pitcher Bret Saberhagen, who is scheduled to start Game 4 on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Saberhagen knows a little bit about excitement, having started  
and won Games 3 and 7 of the 1985 World Series for the Kansas City 
Royals, becoming the youngest player to be named Series MVP. 
</P>
<P>
	He went 20-6 with a 2.87 ERA that year to win the first of two  
Cy Young Awards. He won his second in 1989 after leading the league 
with 23 wins, a 2.16 ERA, 12 complete games and 262 1-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	So, how does a young Saberhagen compare with Martinez and  
Clemens? 
</P>
<P>
	``Not even close,'' he said. ``I was good, but I was never that  
good.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *CURSE OF THE BOOMER?* The Red Sox left tickets to the game for  
Toronto Blue Jays pitcher David Wells, saying they wanted to honor 
him for pitching a perfect game in '98. 
</P>
<P>
	But there might be more to it than that.  
</P>
<P>
	Wells pitched his perfect game for the Yankees and was one of  
their most popular players. After the season, though, he was traded 
to the Blue Jays for Clemens, who played 13 years in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Wells, nicknamed ``Boomer,'' is also a Yankee history buff and a  
bit of a rebel who once pitched wearing one of Babe Ruth's caps. 
Ruth, of course, was sold by Boston to New York in 1920. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox haven't won a World Series since, and some believe  
he has put a curse on the team. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL:* Yankees manager Joe Torre, who was fired  
from three previous managerial jobs, said Saturday he empathized 
with Mike Hargrove, who was fired by the Cleveland Indians on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you fire somebody, and I am speaking from experience, I  
wish the people would say we are going to make a change we are 
going to try something different, blah, blah, blah,'' Torre said 
before Game 3 of the AL championship series against Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just make a change. It is just a little insulting when some of  
the reasoning comes out that we are going to the next level. I 
mean, if you are going to make a move, I mean, eight or nine years 
is a time to wait and then use that as reasoning? That is the only 
thing that bothers me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove led the Indians to five consecutive AL Central titles.  
They reached the World Series twice, but lost both times, to 
Atlanta in 1995 and Florida in '97. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was the disastrous first-round loss to the Red Sox that  
did him in. Cleveland won the first two games before allowing 44 
runs in three consecutive losses to Boston for an early exit from 
the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mike keeps going to the postseason, and sometimes you get a  
little spoiled by that, and a little impatient with not going as 
far as you'd like to,'' Torre said. ``... But when you get into 
that three out of five or four out of seven, anything is liable to 
happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *THE THIRD TIME'S A CHARM:* Torre said he is enjoying himself  
more now than he did last year in the playoffs, when the Yankees 
steamrolled their way to a second World Series title in three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem: After winning 114 games in the 1998 regular season,  
anything less than a world championship would have been considered 
a failure. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, this is more fun,'' Torre said. ``Last year, you sort of  
felt obligated to go to the World Series and win the World Series 
otherwise people would have downplayed what you accomplished.''

<HEADLINE> 3 Japan Insurance Cos. To Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Three major Japanese insurance companies have  
agreed to bring their operations together by 2001, a major Japanese 
business daily reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a single holding company, Mitsui Marine and Fire Insurance  
Co., Nippon Fire and Marine Insurance Co. and Koa Fire and Marine 
Insurance Co. will tie up their damage investigation divisions and 
computer information systems, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun said. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance will produce the biggest Japanese non-life  
insurance group in terms of assets, overtaking Tokio Marine and 
Fire Insurance Co, the report said. Mitsui is the third largest, 
while Nippon is fifth and Koa eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance will fall short of a full-fledged merger, but the  
companies will cooperate in underwriting insurance policies as well 
as in asset management, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	As competition increases, non-life insurers are likely to be  
pressed to cut premiums. The three insurers hope to move ahead with 
cost-cutting by joining forces, the Nihon Keizai said.

<HEADLINE> Aerospace Deal Exit Clause Reported </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler has an exit clause in the deal to  
merge its aerospace unit DASA with France's Aerospatiale Matra if 
it feels the French government is interfering with business 
decisions, a German newsmagazine reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The French government, which held almost half of Aerospatiale  
Matra, will control half of the French-held 30 percent of the new 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler will hold 30 percent and the remaining 40  
percent is to be sold on the stock market. The new company is to be 
known as the European Aeronautic, Defense and Space Co., or EADS. 
</P>
<P>
	Der Spiegel newsmagazine said DaimlerChrysler's exit clause  
allows it to pull out after three years if it feels Paris is 
blocking job cuts or other measures required to increase efficiency 
and run the company in the most economically sensible way. 
</P>
<P>
	The French would then be required to buy out DaimlerChrysler's  
share of EADS at market value. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler representatives couldn't immediately be reached  
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, signed Thursday, would create the world's  
third-biggest aerospace company. The merged German-French firm said 
it expects to win regulatory approval and begin operating by June 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the talk about the new alliance has centered on Airbus  
Industrie, and hopes that the deal would accelerate the 
privatization of the commercial jet maker to make it a better 
competitor against U.S. market leader Boeing. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined company will control 80 percent of Airbus once  
DaimlerChrysler Aerospace's previously announced merger with the 
Spanish aerospace company CASA is completed.

<HEADLINE> Cops Probe Injury of Disabled Man </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Police are investigating allegations that  
officers injured a mentally retarded Ukrainian immigrant after 
mistaking him for a burglary suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	The department's internal affairs division opened the probe  
Friday, said Detective Sgt. Cheryl Kanzler. 
</P>
<P>
	Pavel Guzenko, 36, was carting firewood to his relatives Tuesday  
night when officers investigating a report of a stolen wheelbarrow 
attempted to question him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Two female officers responded, stopped a man they saw with a  
wheelbarrow, and that's when things went bad,'' Ms. Kanzler said. 
She did not identify the officers. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers issued several orders to Guzenko, who does not  
understand English. Witnesses said the officers then jumped 
Guzenko, leaving the right side of his face badly scraped. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told me he was trying to tell them in Russian, `I'm  
sorry,''' said his sister-in-law, Tanya Guzenko. 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives later took Guzenko to an emergency room. Blood was  
found in his urine, suggesting he might have suffered internal 
injuries, said the family's lawyer, Gary Lau.

<HEADLINE> Chilean's Mark Pinochet's Arrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- About 3,000 opponents of Gen. Augusto  
Pinochet beat drums and danced, marching down Santiago's main 
street Saturday to celebrate the first anniversary of the former 
dictator's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the ailing general's followers attended a  
Catholic Mass to pray for his health and early return to Chile, the 
South American country along the southern Pacific coast. 
</P>
<P>
	The 83-year-old was arrested Oct. 16, 1998, while in London  
recuperating from back surgery. He has spent the year battling his 
extradition to Spain, where he faces torture charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet led a bloody coup in 1973 and toppled a Marxist  
president, Salvador Allende. Chile has acknowledged that 3,197 
people were killed or disappeared during Pinochet's authoritarian 
rule. 
</P>
<P>
	A British magistrate ruled last week that Pinochet can be  
extradited, but the general's lawyers planned to appeal the 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, 300 gathered at the secluded estate where Pinochet  
lives under police guard, demanding he be extradited. 
</P>
<P>
	And in Spain, 200 people celebrated Pinochet's capture with a  
cake in the form of a jail, while singing and dancing at the 
central Colon Square. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no possible going back in the judicial process  
against Pinochet,'' said Patricio Suarez, a Chilean who was 
imprisoned under Pinochet. ``He will come to Spain, where he will 
have a trial with all the guarantees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Protesters in Chile held the ``Carnival for Justice,'' which was  
organized by leftists and human rights groups. One person wore a 
prison uniform and a mask with the face of Pinochet as he made his 
way with the procession down Santiago's Allemeda Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
	Viviana Diaz, president of an organization of relatives of  
dissidents who disappeared under Pinochet's rule, called his arrest 
``a sign of justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Many people thought something like this would be impossible.  
But it has happened, and it shows that fighting for justice pays,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The demonstrators in London sang songs, played music and read  
speeches condemning the Pinochet regime. 
</P>
<P>
	But at a Chilean armed forces chapel, retired Gen. Luis Cortes,  
a close associate of Pinochet, said during a Mass that Saturday was 
``a very sad day for all of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have not been able to bring my general back home,'' Cortes  
said. ``But the government has now opened the way to some hope by 
requesting Britain to release him for humanitarian reasons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Chile requested that Britain release the ailing  
general on the grounds that he was in no physical condition to

<HEADLINE> Baylor In the Running With 3 Teams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Atlanta Braves hitting coach Don Baylor could  
wind up as manager of the Milwaukee Brewers next season. Or the 
Anaheim Angels. Or maybe the Chicago Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
	One place he almost certainly won't be: Atlanta.  
</P>
<P>
	Baylor, who spent six years as manager of the Colorado Rockies,  
already has interviewed for openings with the Brewers, Angels and 
Cubs. The Braves, meanwhile, are anticipating life without Baylor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said when we hired him that he wasn't going to be here more  
than a year,'' general manager John Schuerholz said before Game 4 
of the NL championship series against the Mets. ``Even though we 
signed him to a two-year contract, come on, the guy's too good. We 
were fortunate to have him for a year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baylor downplayed talk about his future, saying he wanted to  
enjoy the postseason with the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're getting along in the process, but I can't allow myself  
to get caught up in that,'' he said. ``This is a good run for the 
team and a good one for me, too. This is what you thirst for, the 
playoffs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baylor, in an interview Friday with the Milwaukee Journal  
Sentinel, said he spoke with Milwaukee general manager Dean Taylor 
several times in recent weeks about becoming the Brewers' manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've talked about the organization itself, the type of  
players they have, what they're trying to do,'' Baylor said. ``We 
never talked about a contract, so we haven't gotten that far.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baylor said he had a three-hour talk with Taylor in Atlanta soon  
after Taylor left as assistant GM of the Braves to take over the 
Brewers on Sept. 21. The two have spoken six or seven times since. 
</P>
<P>
	Baylor denied reports of an oral agreement to manage the Chicago  
Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no agreement,'' he said. ``We made some progress. We  
have not talked about length of contract or a dollar figure 
whatsoever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schuerholz said he would not give permission to another team to  
hire Baylor while the Braves are in the playoffs.

	DALLAS (AP) -- Forward Ariel Graziani scored Dallas' first goal  
then assisted on the game-winner Saturday as the Burn beat the 
Chicago Fire 2-1 in the opening game of the best-of-3 MLS Western 
Conference semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago's defense of its MLS Cup '98 title got off to a rocky  
start, as the Fire lost its playoff opener after cruising through 
last year's postseason with five consecutive victories. 
</P>
<P>
	Graziani scored in the 52nd minute and got an assist on Mark  
Santel's goal in the 75th minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Second-half substitute John Ball scored his first MLS goal four  
minutes later to bring Chicago within 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
	A closely played first half ended with neither side registering  
a shot on goal, although Fire midfielder Paul Dougherty, a surprise 
starter for regular Jerzy Podbrozny, saw his shot in the 11th 
minute hit the crossbar. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago will play to Game 2 on Saturday at Soldier Field.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Giuliani Slipping in Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Whether or not they will be able to cast a  
vote for next year's Senate race in New York, Americans are looking 
less favorably upon anticipated candidates Rudolph Giuliani and 
Hillary Rodham Clinton, according to a poll released Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The CBS News poll found that 16 percent of those questioned  
nationwide earlier this month gave Giuliani, New York City's 
Republican mayor, an ``unfavorable'' rating. Six percent found him 
unfavorable in a March 1998 poll. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Giuliani's favorable rating also rose during the same  
period, with 21 percent of respondents reporting a favorable 
impression of the mayor, up from 16 percent in March 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Northeasterners are driving the ratings dive for Giuliani, with  
24 percent reporting unfavorable impressions of him this month, up 
from 7 percent in March 1998, the poll found. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani's popularity continues to rise among Republicans, with  
29 percent reporting favorable impressions of the mayor, up from 20 
percent in March 1998. Negative ratings among Republicans grew 
seven percentage points, from 3 percent to 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Mrs. Clinton, 36 percent of those polled this month had  
unfavorable impressions of her, up from 20 percent in January 1999. 
Forty percent said they had a favorable impression of the first 
lady, down from 55 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Pollsters found a drop in the number of women who look favorably  
on Mrs. Clinton and an increase in the number who see her 
unfavorably. Thirty-one percent of respondents this month said they 
have an unfavorable opinion of her, up from 17 percent in January 
1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-four percent said they have a favorable impression of Mrs.  
Clinton, down from 61 percent in January 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	With the election still more than a year away, neither Giuliani  
nor Mrs. Clinton has formally announced for the seat being vacated 
by Democratic Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oct. 3-4 telephone poll of 871 adults has a margin of error  
of 3 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	A poll earlier this month of New York voters found Giuliani and  
Mrs. Clinton in a statistical dead heat. 
</P>
<P>
	That poll, released Oct. 6 from Marist College's Institute for  
Public Opinion, found the mayor favored by 46 percent of the 
state's voters, while 42 percent backed Mrs. Clinton. Other polls 
have also shown them about even.

<HEADLINE> Disarray in Planned GOP Advertising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Inaugurated three weeks ago with some fanfare  
as a multimillion-dollar ad campaign, an effort by House 
Republicans to target a dozen Democrats has been plagued by 
internal squabbling and embarrassing missteps as well as a spirited 
counterattack. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus far, a single commercial has aired in eight districts at an  
overall cost of about $300,000, according to Republican officials. 
</P>
<P>
	In part, the effort has been slow in starting because some  
Republicans -- GOP House campaign committee chairman Tom Davis among 
them -- are lukewarm to a costly campaign more than a year before 
the election. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, though, officials in Virginia, Davis' home state,  
asked that the ad not be run as planned. In Mississippi, an ad was 
aired in which the local Democratic congressman's name was 
mispronounced. In Texas, the Democratic target successfully 
appealed to television stations not to air the commercial. 
</P>
<P>
	The ad campaign, announced by Davis last month, is designed to  
depict Democrats as raiders of the Social Security trust funds, 
willing to plunder it for other ``big government'' programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Imagine a world where there's no punishment for a crime,'' the  
commercial begins, an announcer's ominous tones accompanied by 
menacing images and unsettling music. 
</P>
<P>
	The commercials are designed to dovetail with a Republican  
legislative strategy of passing spending bills that leave the 
Social Security surplus untouched. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans will spend ``in the millions'' of dollars airing the  
commercials, Davis told reporters Sept. 29, adding that the ads 
would air in ``upwards of a dozen'' districts. 
</P>
<P>
	While no ads have run for several days, ``We're going to do a  
new series of ads very soon,'' NRCC spokeswoman Jill Schroeder said 
Friday. She added that GOP leaders and others were being asked for 
money. ``This is really bothering the Democrats, and they're 
scared, and we've got them on the run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Erik Smith, a spokesman for the Democrats, countered that  
Republicans are running ``an incredibly shrinking ad campaign. 
There's no evidence of it anywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In private meetings, according to participants who spoke on  
condition of anonymity, Davis has expressed reluctance to use 
campaign committee funds for an advertising effort more than a year 
from the election. They said Davis was pressured by the powerful 
GOP whip, Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody was going to stampede me into doing things that  
leadership wanted to be done,'' Davis said in an interview. He said 
he ``held up the running of the ads until I was comfortable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the speaker's issue. I just implement,'' DeLay said in a  
separate interview, referring to House Speaker Dennis Hastert, 
R-Ill. ``He's been wanting things to go, and nothing seemed to be 
getting done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Numerous officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity,  
provided these other details: 
</P>
<P>
	--The Republican National Committee sent word to Davis in advance  
not to request money for the ad campaign, believing the election 
was too far away. 
</P>
<P>
	--The state Republican party in Virginia appealed successfully to  
the NRCC not to air ads as planned in the district of Democratic 
Rep. Owen Pickett, who was unopposed for re-election last year. 
</P>
<P>
	In a campaign subplot, Davis is attempting to recruit state Sen.  
Ed Shrock to challenge Pickett in 2000. Shrock is a state senator 
seeking a new term in next month's legislative elections, and a 
public decision to run for Congress would be an acknowledgment he 
does not intend to serve out the new term. 
</P>
<P>
	--Two top GOP targets -- first-term Democratic Reps. Rush Holt in  
New Jersey and Joe Hoeffel of Pennsylvania -- have not had ads run 
in their districts, in what one GOP aide said was a decision to 
save money. 
</P>
<P>
	There were other problems.  
</P>
<P>
	In the district of Rep. Ronnie Shows, a Mississippi freshman,  
the congressman's name was mispronounced by the announcer: It 
rhymes with how, not show. ``People are laughing about it'' at 
home, Shows said recently. The ads were remade to correct the 
error, although the state party asked the NRCC to refrain from 
airing them to avoid interference with statewide elections next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Chet Edwards successfully appealed to stations in his Waco,  
Texas, district not to run the commercial. ``They came awfully 
close to calling me a criminal,'' Democrat Edwards said of the GOP 
attacks. ``I didn't think they were supported'' by the facts. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Republican motives were more complicated than  
Davis acknowledged in remarks to reporters last month. 
</P>
<P>
	According to GOP officials, these included an effort to stiffen  
the resolve of rank and file GOP lawmakers to support spending 
bills that avoid using Social Security funds. 
</P>
<P>
	They also included a desire to prepare ground in swing districts  
for challengers either beginning their campaigns or as yet 
unidentified. Thus, the GOP ran ads in Michigan and West Virginia, 
where Democratic retirements have created two competitive open 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
	For their part, Democrats mounted a rapid counterattack.  
</P>
<P>
	The White House and Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt branded the  
commercials -- three were prepared but only one aired thus far -- 
``the big lie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee advised  
rank-and-file lawmakers to respond aggressively. Moreover, most of 
the lawmakers targeted by the commercials voted for Republican 
``lock box'' legislation to safeguard the Social Security trust 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the end, by talking about your member's record on Social  
Security, this debate will boost your member's credentials on this 
issue at a time when the public would otherwise not be paying 
attention,'' Democrats were advised in an internal memo.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Pushes Diversity Acceptance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Of all the challenges the United States will  
face in the next century, by far the most important is building 
``one America out of this crazy quilt of all of us who live here,'' 
President Clinton told an Italian-American audience Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Too many people at home and abroad will enter the next  
millennium caught ``in a conflict between modern possibilities and 
primitive hatred,'' unable to grasp the fact they share ``a common 
humanity,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Solve the problem of prejudice and group hatred, Clinton said,  
``and we'll find a way to deal with all the rest of our problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton addressed the 24th annual black-tie dinner of the  
National Italian American Foundation, offering praise and thanks 
for the organization's support of his administration's ``One 
America'' initiative, which seeks to build unity out of the 
nation's rapidly increasing ethnic diversity. 
</P>
<P>
	The foundation is the major Washington advocate for nearly 15  
million Italian Americans, the nation's fifth largest ethnic group. 
</P>
<P>
	It is a group, Clinton said, that has suffered from prejudice  
and discrimination in the past and is still troubled by flawed and 
faulty ethnic stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have to do for the 21st century is to grow one country  
out of our diversity,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	And it is that very diversity, he added, ``which makes America a  
very interesting place to live in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was joined on the dais by first lady Hillary Rodham  
Clinton, who spoke of her interest in the issues of children. She 
did not mention her probable Senate race in New York state, where 
Italian-Americans are a politically potent ethnic group. 
</P>
<P>
	Guests at the bipartisan dinner included Italian Foreign  
Minister Lamberto Dini; singer Vic Damone; Supreme Court Justice 
Antonin Scalia; White House chief of staff John Podesta; and the 
actor-model known as Fabio.

<HEADLINE> Ramsey Case May Get New Prosecutor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- Gov. Bill Owens will meet with Boulder  
District Attorney Alex Hunter Monday night to discuss the 
possibility of appointing a special prosecutor for the JonBenet 
Ramsey case, one of Hunter's advisors said. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury investigation of the Ramsey case, launched by  
Hunter Sept. 15, 1998, ended Wednesday without any indictments. 
</P>
<P>
	Owens announced Wednesday that he would consider appointing a  
special prosecutor to review the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Adams County District Attorney Bob Grant, who is part of  
Hunter's team of advisors on the Ramsey case, said of the meeting: 
``The only person I'm sure will be there is me, since I haven't 
talked to anyone else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grant said he expects Hunter's grand jury team of Michael Kane,  
Bruce Levin, Mitch Morrissey and Denver-area prosecutors Bill 
Ritter, Dave Thomas and Jim Peters to be present at the meeting as 
well. Ritter, Thomas and Peters are from Denver, Jefferson County 
and Arapahoe County, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Amy Sampson, Owen's acting press secretary, declined to reveal  
the time or location of the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that they are planning a meeting soon, but they are  
still working out the details,'' Sampson said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said earlier that JonBenet's parents, John and Patsy  
Ramsey, remain under an ``umbrella of suspicion'' in the December 
1996 slaying of JonBenet, 6, at their Boulder home. Hunter said 
Thursday that they have not been eliminated from the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ramseys have said all along they are innocent.

<HEADLINE> Forbes Makes Offer for Debates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Presidential hopeful Steve Forbes  
offered Saturday to accept restrictions on his television 
advertisements if Republican front-runner George W. Bush would 
agree to a series of debates. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, campaigning in Seattle, immediately rejected the offer.  
``He can advertise any way he wants to advertise,'' Bush told 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've made the offer that if we have this series of in-depth  
debates, in my ads I'll only use material from those debates,'' 
Forbes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes, meeting with reporters after signing copies of his new  
book, said he wants five or six lengthy debates with the Texas 
governor to flesh out what he sees as broad differences between 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes came under fire in 1996 for launching an attack on  
eventual nominee Bob Dole. Dole said the negative commercials left 
him softened for the general election. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes said worries about attack ads can be avoided if Bush  
would agree to the debates. He said he would agree to restrictions 
``if it's a series of debates, not just one. Anyone can skate 
through one debate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most polls have shown Bush with a wide lead in the race for the  
GOP nomination, and he has raised far more money than any of his 
rivals. Forbes is the only candidate able to match Bush financially 
because of the publisher's personal fortune. 
</P>
<P>
	In Seattle, Bush said debates are on the schedule.  
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Forbes has all the right'' to run negative ads, he said.  
``I just hope he understands that what he did to Senator Dole in 
1996 is going to be rejected by the Republican Party. People don't 
want that kind of campaign, where he tears people down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, the Bush campaign has prepared responses to  
potential Forbes attack ads. His team made commercials attacking 
their candidate and showed them to focus groups. Coupled with Bush 
rebuttals, campaign aides said, the commercials did no harm to the 
audiences' conceptions of Bush.

	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Democrat Bill Bradley said Saturday he  
does not consider attacks by Vice President Al Gore on his party 
loyalty to be a significant issue and hears nothing about it while 
campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore hit Bradley on several fronts last week, including the  
former New Jersey senator's decision to quit the Republican-led 
Senate in 1997 and Bradley's brief refusal to rule out a challenge 
of President Clinton as an independent in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaigning in Iowa, where the caucuses on Jan. 24 officially  
open the run for the 2000 nomination, Bradley said he plans no 
change in his campaign tactics. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll run his campaign, and I'll run my campaign -- which is  
another way of saying, `You fight your war, and I'll fight mine,''' 
Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he would continue putting together a grass-roots  
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just proceeding steadily day-by-day, week-by-week,'' he  
said. ``We know there are 2,100 precincts where we need to 
organize, and we're going to try to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley and his wife, Ernestine, joined 8,000 people on a chilly  
Saturday for the Walk for the Cure, raising money for breast cancer 
research. Mrs. Bradley was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1992.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- To cheers of ``Run, Hillary, Run,'' probable  
Senate candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton told the main government 
workers' union Saturday that the union movement helped make America 
an economic powerhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mrs. Clinton said there is still work to do. ``As proud as I  
am of the economy, it hasn't reached everyone,'' she told members 
of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal 
Employees. ``We have to work to make sure upstate and some areas in 
the city receive the full benefits of this economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Citing the commitment to labor laws of her husband, President  
Clinton, and his administration, Mrs. Clinton said she is ``very 
proud'' of what she said the Clinton White House's partnership with 
labor has accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Mrs. Clinton has not officially announced her candidacy  
for the Senate seat being vacated by retiring New York Democrat 
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, it is widely believed she will run.

	AMES, Iowa (AP) -- Presidential aspirant Pat Buchanan gained his  
first foothold in Iowa's Reform Party, seating more than half the 
delegates to the party's annual convention. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, principally Connecticut and New Hampshire, efforts by  
Buchanan delegates to seat themselves in Reform conventions have 
met resistance. Signs of tension were in evidence Saturday between 
Buchanan's supporters and more established party members, but both 
sides promised to cooperate to their mutual advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody's welcome,'' said Jim Hennager, last year's Reform  
Party candidate for Iowa governor. ``I don't think we're going to 
have any serious problem in that regard. We're looking forward to 
new people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan remains a candidate for the Republican Party nomination

	IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) -- Medicare reform should be led by medical  
experts, not politicians, Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican presidential candidate, making campaign stops at  
long-term-care facilities in four Iowa cities, guaranteed that 
benefits will not be cut for current enrollees or for those almost 
eligible for Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal Hatch calls his Agenda for Senior Health Care also  
includes increased access to long-term care, established standards 
for long-term-care insurance policies and increased tax incentives 
for purchase policies.

<P>
	STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) -- Don't talk, play football paid off for  
No. 2 Penn State on Saturday as Eric McCoo slipped enough tackles 
to gain a career-best 211 yards and set up 10 points in leading the 
Nittany Lions to a 23-10 victory over No. 18 Ohio State. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn State remained perfect through seven games and gave Joe  
Paterno his 314th career victory, tying him for third place with 
Amos Alonzo Stagg for most among major college coaches. Bear Bryant 
has 323, and Pop Warner 319. 
</P>
<P>
	Saying his players have been besieged by fans and reporters all  
season, Paterno cut off most interviews this week in a rare policy 
change. The 72-year-old Paterno's edict came just after Ohio State 
coach John Cooper said if both teams played their best, the Lions 
would win, a remark that upset most Buckeyes players. 
</P>
<P>
	Paterno can thank McCoo and an inspired defense led by  
linebacker LaVar Arrington for playing their best. The Nittany 
Lions (7-0, 3-0 Big Ten) had two field goals blocked, fumbled in 
the end zone for a Buckeyes TD and had trouble scoring from inside 
the Ohio State 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State (4-3, 1-2) was outplayed from the start as the Lions  
held the Buckeyes to just 143 yards while piling up 422. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Bellisari was sacked eight times -- Arrington had 2 1/2 after  
entering the game with one all season -- and completed just seven of 
21 passes for 78 yards with an interception. 
</P>
<P>
	It was this bad for Bellisari: He missed a play near the end of  
the game after taking a vicious hit to the upper chest from 
Arrington with 2:23 left. 
</P>
<P>
	McCoo, a 5-10, 201-pound sophomore, carried nine times for 121  
yards in the first half as the Nittany Lions took a 13-10 lead at 
intermission. He finished with 22 carries for 211 yards, and also 
caught four passes for 47 yards. Last season, McCoo ran for 206 
yards against Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
	With Rashard Casey running the offense in the second half, Penn  
State scored on its first possession to take a 20-10 lead. Casey, 
who has alternated with Kevin Thompson all year, capped a 
seven-play, 62-yard drive with a 5-yard TD run on a perfectly 
executed bootleg, faking two handoffs, putting the ball on his hip 
and rolling left past a baffled Buckeyes defense. Casey was 
11-of-15 for 109 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Travis Forney added his third field goal of the game, a  
28-yarder early in the fourth quarter, to give the Lions their 
ninth consecutive victory, second-longest in the nation behind 
Marshall's 10 in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss not only dropped Ohio State out of the big bowl  
picture, but probably also ended their chances for a Big Ten title. 
The Buckeyes, who haven't lost four games in a season since 1994, 
have games remaining against nationally ranked Michigan State and 
Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nittany Lions, looking for their first national title since  
1986, have tough games left against Purdue next Saturday, Michigan 
and at Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn State led 13-3 with 3:40 left in the half, but was backed  
up to its own 6 when Thompson was slammed from behind by linebacker 
Na'il Diggs and fumbled, with free safety Gary Berry recovering in 
the end zone for a touchdown. Thompson injured his right shoulder 
on the play and sat out the rest of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lions wasted little time moving to a 7-0 lead as the Beaver  
Stadium crowd of 97,007 roared. Thompson hit McCoo with a 20-yard 
pass to open the game, and then McCoo slipped two would-be tacklers 
with nifty inside cuts and ran 53 yards to the Ohio State 7. Two 
plays later, Thompson hit fullback Mike Cerimele with a 6-yard 
scoring pass just 1:35 into the game. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense took over when Ohio State got the ball. Bellisari  
fumbled when sacked by end Courtney Brown for a 13-yard loss and 
linebacker Brandon Short recovered at the Buckeyes 19. Ohio State 
held and then linebacker Jason Ott blocked Forney's 39-yard field 
goal attempt. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Stultz kicked a 47-yard field goal midway through the  
quarter, but the Lions, who outgained the Buckeyes 238-71 in the 
first half, made it 10-3 on Forney's 38-yard field goal four plays 
after holder Matt Senneca ran 10 yards for first down on a fake 
field goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Forney kicked a 39-yard field goal with 6:49 left in the half  
before the Buckeyes scored on Berry's fumble recovery.

<HEADLINE> Aerospace Deal Exit Clause Reported </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler has an exit clause in the deal to  
merge its aerospace unit DASA with France's Aerospatiale Matra if 
it feels the French government is interfering with business 
decisions, a German newsmagazine reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The French government, which held almost half of Aerospatiale  
Matra, will control half of the French-held 30 percent of the new 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler will hold 30 percent and the remaining 40  
percent is to be sold on the stock market. The new company is to be 
known as the European Aeronautic, Defense and Space Co., or EADS. 
</P>
<P>
	Der Spiegel newsmagazine said DaimlerChrysler's exit clause  
allows it to pull out after three years if it feels Paris is 
blocking job cuts or other measures required to increase efficiency 
and run the company in the most economically sensible way. 
</P>
<P>
	The French would then be required to buy out DaimlerChrysler's  
share of EADS at market value. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler representatives couldn't immediately be reached  
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, signed Thursday, would create the world's  
third-biggest aerospace company. The merged German-French firm said 
it expects to win regulatory approval and begin operating by June 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the talk about the new alliance has centered on Airbus  
Industrie, and hopes that the deal would accelerate the 
privatization of the commercial jet maker to make it a better 
competitor against U.S. market leader Boeing. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined company will control 80 percent of Airbus once  
DaimlerChrysler Aerospace's previously announced merger with the 
Spanish aerospace company CASA is completed.

<HEADLINE> Website Logs Earthquake Anecdotes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In case of earthquake: duck, cover and log  
on. 
</P>
<P>
	Within a few hours of Saturday's magnitude-7.0 quake in the  
Southern California desert, more than 10,000 people ventured into 
cyberspace to register their experiences on a new Website 
(www-socal.wr.usgs.gov) run by the U.S. Geological Survey. 
</P>
<P>
	``Did you feel it?'' the site asks.  
</P>
<P>
	Scientists will use the thousands of anecdotal reports to  
determine whether they were right about the regions expected to 
suffer the worst shaking, USGS seismologist Mary Lou Zoback said. 
Though not conclusive, the results offer another way to gauge 
research on the mysterious mechanics of earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
	The online participants answer a host of questions, including:  
Were they inside or outside when the quake hit? Was it difficult to 
stand or walk? And what type of damage did their home sustain? 
</P>
<P>
	The responses are categorized by ZIP code. All other  
identification is voluntary, Ms. Zoback said. 
</P>
<P>
	A common assumption is that earthquake tremors radiate outward  
like ripples in a pool of water. In fact, the conditions of the 
ground can focus shock waves and bounce them around below the 
surface, hitting some areas harder than others, Ms. Zoback said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2-month-old Internet site, known as the Community Internet  
Intensity Map, uses the experiences of residents to place ZIP codes 
in a 12-level ranking system, which ranges from ``Not Felt'' to 
``Extreme.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers will use the stories to augment scientific data  
about areas that may require stronger structures and roadways to 
prepare for future quakes, Ms. Zoback said.

<HEADLINE> No.20 Purdue 52, No.5 Mich. St. 28 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) -- Purdue found a route for success  
against Michigan State's top-ranked rushing defense -- Drew Brees to 
Chris Daniels. 
</P>
<P>
	Brees threw five touchdown passes in the first half, including  
three to Daniels, and ran for one in the second half as No. 20 
Purdue ended No. 5 Michigan State's perfect season 52-28 Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue (5-2, 2-2 Big Ten) built a 35-14 lead by halftime as  
Brees completed 23-of-33 for 344 yards. Daniels had 12 catches in 
the first half for 200 yards, with TD receptions of 51, 10 and 4 
yards. Brees finished with a season-high 509 yards, hitting 
40-of-57. His career high is 522, set against Wisconsin last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniels, who went into the game leading the Big Ten with 57  
receptions, set Big Ten records with 301 receiving yards and 21 
catches. The old record for receiving yards was 285 by Thomas Lewis 
of Indiana in 1993 and Purdue's Randall Lane, who caught one of 
Brees' TD passes Saturday, set the reception record of 18 last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State (6-1, 3-1) scored first on an 18-yard TD pass  
from Bill Burke to Plaxico Burress. The Boilermakers, coming off 
consecutive road losses to Michigan and Ohio State, responded with 
three touchdowns in the opening quarter and built their lead to 
28-6 on a 7-yard pass from Brees to Lane with 12:46 left in the 
first half. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State, which came into the game allowing an average of  
36.7 rushing yards a game, surrendered 35 in the first half and 59 
for the game. Michigan State, which had Burke sacked four times in 
the first half for minus-34 yards, netted only 5 yards in the first 
two quarters and 44 for the game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boilermakers pulled away with three TDs in about six minutes  
with the help of two turnovers. Trailing 6-0 after Paul Edinger's 
extra point hit the goal post, the Boilermakers went 69 yards in 
five plays to score on a 51-yard pass play to Daniels, who got 
behind cornerback Amp Campbell and took the pass in stride. Travis 
Dorsch kicked the first of five extra points to put Purdue ahead 
for good with 8:40 remaining in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	On Michigan State's first play following the kickoff, Burress  
fumbled when hit by Mike Hawthorne and Mike Rose recovered for the 
Boilermakers at the Spartans 27. Vinny Sutherland, who threw an 
incomplete pass on first down, then caught a 27-yard TD pass from 
Brees with 8:14 left in the period. 
</P>
<P>
	Adrian Beasley intercepted Burke's pass at the Purdue 39 and  
returned it to the Michigan State 49. Eight plays later, Brees and 
Daniels connected on a 10-yard scoring pass. Brees completed all 
four of his pass attempts on the drive and also had a 10-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
	Two long returns of pass interceptions helped bring the Spartans  
back into the game. T.J. Turner brought the first back 88 yards in 
the second quarter and Michigan State cut its deficit to 35-28 when 
Brees threw into double coverage and Aric Morris brought it back 76 
yards for a touchdown with 4:14 left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue responded with a seven-play, 74-yard drive that ended  
when Brees raced to his right and stretched into the end zone on a 
1-yard run. Brees completed five passes on the drive with Daniels 
gaining 60 yards on three catches. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State had another chance to draw closer following its  
fourth interception off Brees in the fourth quarter. But the drive 
ended with Beasley's goal-line interception and 40-yard return. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boilermakers made it 45-28 on a 23-yard field by Dorsch with  
3:19 to play and David Nugent's 12-yard fumble return for a 
touchdown 18 seconds later.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Plan for Gov't Disabled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Directing the government to set an example by  
opening career opportunities to the disabled, President Clinton 
urged Congress to pass legislation to make sure people with 
disabilities don't lose insurance coverage when they accept jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm releasing the first-ever government plan to ensure  
positive career paths for people with disabilities in our federal 
work force,'' Clinton said Saturday in his weekly radio address. 
``I'm directing every federal agency and department to take 
concrete action to expand opportunities for people with 
disabilities in all levels of the work force, from entry to senior 
ranks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are the nation's largest employer, and I want us to be a  
model for private industry,'' Clinton said. ``This plan will do 
just that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president said that despite good economic times, three out  
of four disabled people who want to work can't find work. He also 
said that if economic prosperity is going to continue, employers 
must seek new pools of employees. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm calling on all agencies to recruit and promote people with  
disabilities, to reach out to students with disabilities, to 
provide reasonable accommodations for applicants and employees with 
disabilities,'' Clinton said. ``I'm also calling on our federal 
human resources agency, the Office of Personnel Management, to 
ensure that every agency gets the help it needs to fulfill these 
commitments. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan was developed by a task force headed by Vice President  
Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	``By addressing the intolerably high levels of unemployment  
among people with disabilities -- more than 75 percent -- we not only 
strengthen American families, but promote a stronger economy and 
ensure future prosperity,'' Gore said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also again asked Congress to approve legislation to  
ensure that the disabled don't put at risk their federal health 
care coverage by taking jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the biggest barriers facing people with disabilities is  
the fear of losing their health insurance when they get a job,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under current law, many people with disabilities cannot keep  
Medicaid or Medicare coverage if they work. 
</P>
<P>
	``This creates a tremendous disincentive to work because they  
have to have health care,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton noted that unlike other issues facing Congress, the  
legislation has been endorsed by a bipartisan majority in the House 
and has passed the Senate 99-0. 
</P>
<P>
	``So I say to Congress, don't water the bill down, guarantee its  
financing, and go ahead and send it to me so we can sign it without 
delay,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., chairman of the House Republican  
Conference, said in a statement that the disabilities legislation 
has been ``a Republican initiative for many years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Democrats are just now beginning to jump on board, and we  
welcome them to the table,'' he said. ``Offering incentives to work 
and tax relief to help those who need it most is what compassionate 
conservatism is all about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Watts said the full House will consider the legislation  
Wednesday. He predicted it will pass overwhelmingly.

<HEADLINE>  Ecuador Volcano Threatens To Erupt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANOS, Ecuador (AP) -- Tungurahua volcano, which looms over the  
tourist town of Banos, could erupt any day, the government said 
Saturday as it began evacuating nearby communities. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said increased volcanic activity had forced them to  
declare an orange alert, which meant the mountain could erupt 
within days or weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	For a month Tungurahua had been under a yellow alert --  
predicting an eruption within weeks or months. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said at least 12,000 of the 25,000 people threatened  
by the volcano already had left the area. One hundred buses were 
evacuating the remaining inhabitants on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Banos, a town famed for its hot springs and mountain trekking,  
is wedged into a narrow valley directly at the foot of the volcano, 
75 miles south of Quito. 
</P>
<P>
	For several days, the volcano has been expelling gases, steam  
and ash, which has fallen on nearby villages. A government census 
revealed Thursday that ash had caused 40,000 chickens to die of 
respiratory infections. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts have calculated there is an 80 percent chance Tungurahua  
will erupt, as it has done 13 times since 1534. The last eruption 
was in 1920. 
</P>
<P>
	President Jamil Mahuad flew over the volcano and endangered  
communities on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're ready for the emergency, but you don't know how brutal  
the force of nature can be,'' he said in his weekly radio message 
to the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Ignacio Vargas, governor of Tungurahua province, said police and  
military were helping with the evacuation. 
</P>
<P>
	``This won't be permanent,'' he said. ``We will have to wait  
until the eruption ends so that everyone can return to his normal 
activities.''

<HEADLINE> Colombian Peace Talks To Begin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Following months of delays, the  
government and leftist rebels will begin peace negotiations next 
weekend in hopes of ending Colombia's 35-year civil conflict, the 
two sides announced Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The talks will begin Oct. 24 in Uribe, one of five southern  
towns that has lived under open rebel rule since President Andres 
Pastrana cleared out his troops prior to the ceremonial 
inauguration of the peace process in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Citizen peace groups have set the same date for nationwide  
marches to demand a cease-fire, an end to violence against 
civilians, and the initiation of formal talks. 
</P>
<P>
	The conflict has claimed at least 30,000 lives, and fighting has  
raged unabated despite renewed peace efforts since Pastrana took 
office last year. 
</P>
<P>
	After reaching a sweeping negotiating agenda in May, the  
government and the rebel Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or 
FARC, hit a deadlock. Pastrana refused to proceed unless the 
15,000-member insurgency allowed an international commission to 
monitor its activities in the Switzerland-sized demilitarized zone. 
</P>
<P>
	The FARC refused, however, prompting the government to go ahead  
with the talks without international verifiers. 
</P>
<P>
	Skeptical of the rebels' professed desire for peace, U.S.  
officials have criticized Pastrana's decision while stepping up 
police and military aid to the Andean nation. Pastrana was in 
Washington recently to request hundreds of millions of dollars in 
aid to strengthen his hand on the battlefield and at the peace 
table. 
</P>
<P>
	In their joint statement Saturday, the government and FARC said  
they were ready to begin discussions on reforms to attack the 
country's endemic poverty and political corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	The venue for the talks, Uribe, was the FARC's longtime command  
center before a 1991 military offensive drove out the peasant-based 
insurgents.

<TEXT>
<P>
	While no serious damage has been reported from today's Southern  
California earthquake, its preliminary magnitude -- 7.0 -- was more 
than strong enough to bring major destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	Earthquake magnitudes are measures of earthquake size calculated  
from ground motion recorded on seismographs. With each scale, an 
increase in one full number -- from 6.5 to 7.5, for example -- means 
the quake's magnitude is 10 times as great. 
</P>
<P>
	There is theoretically no top limit to the scale, but a  
magnitude 8 is considered to be capable of tremendous damage. On 
Sept. 19, 1985, a magnitude 8.1 earthquake in Mexico left 9,500 
people dead. 
</P>
<P>
	A magnitude 7 quake brings the potential of widespread damage.  
On Oct. 17, 1989, the Loma Prieta earthquake in Northern California 
killed 67 people and caused an estimated $6 billion in damage. It 
was a 7.1 magnitude. 
</P>
<P>
	While technically less severe, magnitude 6 quakes have sometimes  
proven more devastating in California. Southern California's last 
serious brush with such a quake was on Jan. 14, 1994, when a 
magnitude 6.7 quake struck Northridge, just north of Los Angeles, 
killing 72 people and causing an estimated $40 billion in damage.

<HEADLINE> Four Students Killed in Car Wreck </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRAND HAVEN, Mich. (AP) -- Four high school freshmen riding in a  
stolen car were killed early Saturday when the vehicle struck a 
tree, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	The teen-agers were not wearing seat belts and died at the scene  
of the crash about 12:50 a.m. near this western Michigan community, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State Police identified the victims as driver John  
Mogielski, and passengers Ryan Lyles, Adam Bennett and David 
Morgan. Morgan was 15, the others 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Schools Superintendent Rick Kent described the mood among their  
classmates as ``one of shock when you have a tragedy of this 
magnitude.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There's tremendous sadness, tremendous feeling for the parents  
and the families of these four young people,'' he said. ``All four 
were very sociable, and they had a wide circle of friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ottawa County sheriff's officials said the four were occupants  
of a car stolen from an area residence. The crash happened while 
the vehicle was traveling at a high rate of speed, the sheriff's 
office said in a statement.

	Irene Leaves Florida Awash, Five Dead  
</P>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Five people were killed by power lines downed as  
Hurricane Irene hit Florida yesterday, dumping up to 18 inches of 
rain. Power was knocked out to 1.4 million people in the hurricane, 
and the five people killed were pedestrians. With winds of 75 mph, 
Irene was a relatively weak hurricane, but its heavy rain and 
sluggish pace made it a menace. And forecasters warned it was on a 
path that could bring more misery to flood-ravaged North Carolina. 
Scattered flooding was reported in a 200-mile area from Key West to 
West Palm Beach. In Miami, police listed at least 65 streets, 
including major intersections, with floodwaters at least 6 inches 
deep.

	Russia Begins Stage Two in Chechnya  
</P>
<P>
	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Russian troops today regrouped near the  
Terek River and fortified their positions in advance of what a 
Russian general said would be the second stage of the campaign 
against insurgents in Chechnya. A Russian military spokesman said 
Chechen guerrillas were suffering ``serious losses'' in the latest 
fighting. ``Federal troops are continuing to regroup and prepare 
artillery encampments on the right bank of the Terek River to meet 
likely offensives of guerrillas,'' the spokesman said. After weeks 
of air and artillery strikes, Russian troops were reported to be 
pushing closer to Grozny, in what Russia's top commander said would 
be the second phase of the military operation to destroy rebels 
throughout Chechnya.

	DILI, East Timor (AP) -- In the bloodiest clash since entering  
East Timor, Australian-led peackeepers battled with 
anti-independence attackers for more than an hour today, killing 
three of the militiamen and wounding three others. The peackeepers 
came to the Indonesian island Sept. 20 to stop a rampage by 
Indonesian forces and their militant allies after the territory 
voted for independence. No one in the international force was 
injured in the fighting near Marko, a village about 10 miles from 
Indonesian-controlled West Timor, said peacekeeping spokesman Col. 
Mark Kelly.

	Ailing Doctor Rescued at South Pole  
</P>
<P>
	CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand (AP) -- After five months isolated by  
the Antarctic winter and forced to treat herself for a breast lump, 
Dr. Jerri Nielsen finally put her care in somebody else's hands. In 
a daring operation, a crew from the New York Air National Guard's 
109th Airlift Wing rescued Nielsen today from the U.S. National 
Science Foundation's South Pole research station, where she was the 
only doctor. Nielsen, 47, discovered a lump in her breast in June 
after the darkness, swirling snow and ultra-cold temperatures of 
the Antarctic winter had closed in, sealing off the Amundsen-Scott 
research station and its 41 inhabitants to the outside world.

	Bill Loaded With Home Projects  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- While battling over the budget on other  
fronts, Republicans and President Clinton agreed on a $99 billion 
measure for veterans, housing and space programs that also is 
loaded with hundreds of projects for lawmakers' home districts. The 
Senate voted 93-5 to send the bill to Clinton yesterday, a day 
after the House approved it. But with other spending fights raging, 
another stopgap bill will be needed next week to keep federal 
agencies open, and White House officials indicated that Clinton 
would sign one. Republican leaders insist they are guided by a 
desire to constrain federal spending, but the veterans-housing 
measure suggests that other forces are afoot as well.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Army will lead the U.S. investigation of  
an alleged mass-killing of South Korean civilians by American 
troops during the Korean War, but the Defense Department will set 
up its own steering group to coordinate the work, Defense Secretary 
William Cohen said. In a letter sent yesterday to Army Secretary 
Louis Caldera, Cohen said the Army would conduct interviews and 
other work to determine ``the full scope of the facts'' and compile 
a report of its findings. He said there would be no deadline but 
the inquiry should be done as expeditiously as possible. ``I do not 
want to set an artificial deadline that might present an obstacle 
to a full presentation of the facts to the public,'' Cohen wrote.

	Indians Fire Manager Mike Hargrove  
</P>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Before Mike Hargrove became their manager, the  
Indians were baseball's biggest joke, and Cleveland was a wasteland 
for players, coaches and managers. It was not the place to be. But 
Hargrove helped change Cleveland's image, turning a laughingstock 
franchise into an envied one. Despite all his successes -- 721 
victories, five AL Central titles and two World Series trips -- 
Hargrove couldn't bring Cleveland a World Series title. And 
yesterday, that fact, coupled with another disappointing postseason 
for the Indians, cost Hargrove his job.

<HEADLINE> No.4 Va. Tech 62, No.16 Syracuse 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLACKSBURG, Va. (AP) -- Any thought of another Virginia Tech  
homecoming horror was emphatically dismissed well before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
	The unbeaten, fourth-ranked Hokies allowed No. 16 Syracuse just  
three first downs until the meaningless fourth quarter, and 
freshman quarterback Michael Vick did the rest in Saturday night's 
62-0 embarrassment of the Orangemen. 
</P>
<P>
	Juking and swiveling to turn losses into big plays, Vick  
completed 8 of 16 passes for 135 yards and one touchdown. In his 
last three games, Vick has completed 26 of 37 passes for 605 yards 
with six touchdowns and no interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	In the biggest game ever played at Lane Stadium -- even the  
crystal national championship trophy was on the sidelines -- 
Virginia Tech (6-0, 2-0 Big East) improved to its best start since 
1967 and ended its two-year homecoming jinx. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hokies entered homecoming unbeaten in 1997 and 1998, but  
were upset two years ago Miami of Ohio and last year by Temple. The 
margin of victory was the Hokies' largest since a 73-0 victory over 
Catholic in 1922. 
</P>
<P>
	Syracuse (5-2, 2-1), suffering its worst loss since a 62-0  
drubbing at Princeton in 1912, stuck to its quarterback rotation of 
Madei Williams and Troy Nunes -- and even let tailback Dee Brown 
handle some snaps -- but nothing any of them could do was effective 
against a Hokies defense allowing 8 points per game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orangemen, hurt by poor field position, gained just 56 yards  
in total offense against the first-string Hokies defense and 120 
yards for the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Syracuse has been outscored 169-34 in its last four trips to  
Blacksburg, and things started getting downright ugly for the 
Orangemen early in the third quarter. There were two aborted punts, 
a lost fumble on a kickoff and a general lack of effort by the 
defense as they let Shyrone Stith ramble for long gains up the 
middle. On offense, a rare first down went for naught when a 
personal foul penalty killed the drive. 
</P>
<P>
	Stith, who rushed for 140 yards and two touchdowns, and Vick  
provided the offensive spark, but it was Hokies defense that set 
the tone early. 
</P>
<P>
	Cornerback Anthony Midget, who punished the Syracuse receivers  
with big hits, created the first touchdown when he poked the ball 
away from Quinton Spotwood after a completed pass. Cory Bird 
scooped it up just before it hit the grass and ran 26 yards down 
the sideline to make it 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking the ball on punts, the Hokies marched downfield for  
touchdowns on their next three drives, with Stith scoring on a pair 
of 1-yard runs and the left-handed Vick throwing a bullet back 
across the field to Ricky Hall for an 8-yard score. 
</P>
<P>
	Andre Kendrick ran for a 7-yard score, and Andre Davis was  
untouched as he sprinted 28 yards on a reverse for a TD in the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillip Summers retured an interception 43 yards in the fourth  
quarter, the fourth TD scored by the Hokies defense this season. 
Tee Butler capped the scoring when he recovered a fumbled snap on a 
punt attempt in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
	Shayne Graham kicked field goals of 25 and 37 yards and made  
eight extra points, putting him back ahead of Syracuse kicker Nate 
Trout as the Big East's all-time leading scorer.

<HEADLINE> Life Returns to Atomic Desert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEVADA TEST SITE (AP) -- It was a perfect morning for an airdrop.  
No clouds, no wind -- nothing stirring in the big sky except the 
B-50 bomber circling the desert like a buzzard. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Freiter crouched in the roaring bird's belly. He was 24, an  
Air Force tailgunner on a secret mission: Operation 
Upshot-Knothole. Beside him sat Dixie, an atomic bomb as big as a 
Studebaker. 
</P>
<P>
	From his seat four miles up in the sky, Freiter couldn't see the  
dry lake bed. He couldn't see the army jeeps around it, or the 
life-sized plaster dummies outfitted in marine camouflage. He 
couldn't see the butterflies, the ravens, the tortoises, or the 
snakes that slithered beneath tufts of sage and cactus. 
</P>
<P>
	The bomb bay doors opened. The B-50 shuddered, then lurched  
upward. Dixie was gone. 
</P>
<P>
	Freiter could hardly hold a thought. The radioman shouted:  
</P>
<P>
	``Bob! We're making history here! Take a look!''  
</P>
<P>
	The 10 airmen had orders not to remove their goggles. Freiter  
yanked his off. He saw an 11-kiloton bomb shrink to a pinhead. 
Sweat beaded on his upper lip. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweet Jesus, he thought.  
</P>
<P>
	It was like a million flashbulbs popping in his face. Searing  
white-blue light. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sonofabitch! I can't see!''  
</P>
<P>
	The pilot took the bomber once around the churning column of  
pink, salmon, blue, violet, black and white smoke and got them out 
of there. 
</P>
<P>
	It was April 6, 1953. The desert died that day.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	A fly buzzes around Derek Scammell's neck. He swipes. The fly  
persists. Scammell swipes again. ``See?'' he says. ``There is life 
after the bomb.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For decades, there was no place for life. Not on Frenchman Flat,  
where America once practiced for doomsday. Where scientists and 
soldiers tested how efficiently their nuclear devices could destroy 
and kill. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, they blew up 928 nuclear bombs at the Nevada Test Site.  
After 1963, all were underground tests. But for the first 12 years, 
scientists detonated 100 atomic devices in Nevada's open air -- 14 
of them above this dry lake bed shaped like a teardrop. 
</P>
<P>
	Some were set off atop towers. A few were detonated from  
balloons. One was fired from a cannon. Others were pitched from 
planes. 
</P>
<P>
	Big Shot. Dog. Dirty Harry. Shamrock. Screamer. Wasp. Zucchini.  
</P>
<P>
	And Dixie.  
</P>
<P>
	The moment that bomb exploded, its core burned hotter than the  
sun. A milky white flash washed across the desert, followed by a 
wall of heat. 
</P>
<P>
	With everything around them burning and smoking, Marines,  
sheltered in a bunker 2,000 yards from ground zero, were ordered 
out of their foxholes and began a mechanical march toward the 
fireball. 
</P>
<P>
	The fallout drifted far and wide, all the way to New York,  
contaminating milk, wheat, soil and fish, killing sheep, horse and 
cattle. Every American in the Lower 48 was exposed to iodine-131, a 
radioactive form of iodine. The National Cancer Institute says the 
releases were at least 10 times larger than those from the 1986 
explosion at Chernobyl. As many as 75,000 people exposed during 
that period could develop thyroid cancer, the institute says. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, life is back. There are flies, sage -- even tourists.  
</P>
<P>
	Scammell squints from the glare off the hard, white earth split  
by millions of cracks. Nothing moves but the shadows of flies 
trying to hide from the sun. 
</P>
<P>
	He says: ``There it is. Ground zero. If you'd been standing here  
that morning, in 1953, you'd have been vaporized.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He grins.  
</P>
<P>
	``Makes you feel like an atomic molecule, doesn't it?''  
</P>
<P>
	When the site was carved out of the Las Vegas Bombing and  
Gunnery Range in 1951, Scammell was an ocean away, a teen-ager 
growing up in London. He is 62 now, a decorated Vietnam veteran, a 
spokesman for the Department of Energy, which oversees the test 
site -- an expanse of basins and ranges slightly larger than Rhode 
Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the ex-CIA and green berets in fatigues and mirror  
sunglasses who guard the entrance gate, Scammell is a keeper of the 
flame, a quasi curator of these 1,350 square miles where the United 
States carried out 90 percent of its nuclear trials. 
</P>
<P>
	This site was born at a time when Americans did not question  
their government, when Las Vegas hairdressers promoted ``atomic 
hairdos,'' when Nevadans stood on porches and saluted the giant, 
pink plumes as signs of strength and protection. 
</P>
<P>
	To many Americans, this wasteland is now little more than a Cold  
War artifact, an environmental menace that causes cancer, a 
reminder of the dark side of the human spirit and the terrible 
damage a cracked atom can do. 
</P>
<P>
	The shafts have been quiet since 1992, when President Bush  
declared a moratorium on nuclear testing. They are maintained, 
though, and, by law, must be ready to resume tests within two years 
of a presidential order. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the U.S. Senate rejected the 1996 Comprehensive Test  
Ban Treaty after opponents argued that the ban would allow other 
countries -- India, Pakistan, China, Russia -- to overtake the United 
States in modernizing their arsenals. President Clinton had pressed 
for ratification, saying tests can be simulated with powerful 
computers; regardless of the Senate action, he pledged the United 
States would continue its moratorium on tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Like many places that tied their fortunes to the arms race, this  
one is looking for a new role in new times. Staff has dropped from 
a Cold-War peak of 11,000 to fewer than 2,500; the annual budget 
from $1 billion to $400 million. 
</P>
<P>
	So, the government is considering another idea: To open this  
top-secret area to tour operators, who would guide visitors from 
around the world through this surreal moonscape. 
</P>
<P>
	A prototype tour already exists. Once a month, the Energy  
Department takes a busload of visitors through the site at no 
charge. It's no Disney World: Visitors need security clearances. 
They must bring their own lunches. Cameras, binoculars, tape 
recorders, cell phones are not allowed. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, it could be lucrative. Americans like historical  
sites of tragedy and pain. They flock to the Sixth Floor Museum of 
the School Book Depository in Dallas. They gather in Gettysburg's 
fields. They visit the Birmingham, Ala., church where four black 
Sunday school pupils died in a bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	Why not an A-bomb crater?  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	At Frenchman Flat, the debris of 14 atmospheric blasts mark a  
horrific trail. 
</P>
<P>
	There are the ``Butler'' bunkers, two long chains of square,  
concrete shelters that resemble a roadside motel. The bunkers were 
built in the late 1950s to see what could withstand a nuclear shock 
wave. 
</P>
<P>
	On May 8, 1953, scientists detonated Encore, a 27-kiloton bomb,  
a mile away. Butler's 2-inch-thick front walls collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
	``That,'' Scammell says, ``is what 20-pounds-per-square-inch  
pressure does.'' (At 20 pounds per square inch, the full length of 
each wall was subjected to 288,000 pounds of pressure. The shock 
wave hit the wall at a wind speed of 500 mph -- three times the 
force of winds generated by the worst hurricane.) 
</P>
<P>
	Behind the bunkers sits an M-48 tank, a late 1970s model. It's  
been roped off. There hangs a sign, yellow with black lettering: 
</P>
<P>
	CAUTION. RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL.   	
</P>
<P>
	``Don't touch the tank!'' Scammell shouts. A photographer,  
crouched near the tank, jumps back. Scammell blows on his glasses, 
wipes them, smiles. ``That thing used to fire uranium-tipped 
shells. The barrel and firing mechanism are contaminated. 
</P>
<P>
	``Beta radiation. Tricky stuff.''  
</P>
<P>
	From the thirsty plain rises a bridge to nowhere.  
</P>
<P>
	In the mid-1950s, engineers built the imitation train trestle  
for Priscilla. Priscilla was a 37-kiloton nuclear bomb. The men 
wanted to see what Priscilla could do to a bridge of inch-thick 
iron. So they suspended Priscilla by a helium balloon 700 feet 
above the ground, about four football fields away from the trestle, 
and on June 24, 1957, hit the button. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the bridge is a 30-foot boomerang.  
</P>
<P>
	Nearby sit a row of bomb shelters. They look like concrete  
igloos. The first dome held up against the nuclear shock wave; its 
concrete is 8 inches thick. The second, 6 inches thick, shows 
several cracks. The third is sheared in half. Its shell was only 2 
inches thick. 
</P>
<P>
	There are three other shelters, each of 1-inch thick aluminum.  
They look as if they were stepped on by giants. 
</P>
<P>
	Everything was exposed: Jeeps, armored personnel carriers,  
airplanes, a 55-ton diesel locomotive, a glass house, a man-made 
pine tree forest planted in concrete blocks, an underground garage 
full of cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the Mogler Safe Co. of San Francisco volunteered its best  
product -- a 12-by-15 foot walk-in vault with 1-foot-thick concrete 
walls and a 10-inch-thick steel door. ``They weren't sure real 
money would withstand the blasts,'' he says. ``So they filled the 
vault with stacks of paper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The concrete and iron reinforcing bars on the outer shell are  
peeled back like a banana skin. And the money? ``It was a little 
burned around the edges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The paper fared better than the animals.  
</P>
<P>
	Cattle were fed radioactive hay. Dogs, donkeys and rabbits were  
penned inside the experimental bomb shelters. Cheshire pigs -- whose 
skin resembles human skin -- were drugged and tied to circular cages 
a few thousand yards from ground zero. Some of the pigs were 
dressed up in fabrics worn by Americans in the 1950s, such as 
cotton, rayon and silk. 
</P>
<P>
	The pig cages are empty now. Their metal bars are black from  
rust. From them dangle fraying ropes. They sway, dully, when the 
wind stirs. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	RADIATION HAZARD: TOUCHING OR REMOVING SCRAP OBJECTS IS  
PROHIBITED. THIS INCLUDES BLASTED DEBRIS, FUSED SILICA, METAL 
FRAGMENTS, ETC. 
</P>
<P>
	Whisking past the sign, Scammell says: ``Radiation tends to glue  
itself to metal. That's why there's all the fuss about touching 
metal around here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The white Jeep Cherokee rumbles down Mercury Highway, a two-lane  
blacktop. There are 700 miles of roads in the test site. This one 
slices north towards the more secretive areas. 
</P>
<P>
	NO ACCESS BEYOND THIS FENCE.   	
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing to worry about,'' Scammell says. ``The radiation  
levels that keep you out of the ground zero area dissipate pretty 
quickly. You probably get more rad exposure from the lights on the 
Las Vegas strip.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some underground aquifers are tainted. Twice a year, they are  
tested for tritium, a radioactive substance. Earlier this year, two 
sectors, including the supersecret Area 51, made famous in the 
movie ``Independence Day,'' shut down because plutonium from 
underground tests sites was migrating in subterranean channels. 
</P>
<P>
	And in August, a scientific panel found what it called ``serious  
flaws'' in computer models designed to predict when radioactivity 
might leak from holes left by below-ground nuclear tests. 
</P>
<P>
	NO DIGGING AROUND THIS SITE.   	
</P>
<P>
	``Beta contamination is sealed in the dirt,'' Scammell explains.  
``You don't want to loosen any of that up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yucca Flat spreads out into dull, brown emptiness. In the  
distance, Joshua trees reach toward the sky. A tumbleweed scampers 
across the highway. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of craters from underground blasts pock the landscape  
like giant thumbprints in a pie. 
</P>
<P>
	POTENTIAL CRATER AREA. KEEP OUT.   	
</P>
<P>
	Scammell points to a few nuggets of nuclear history: See that  
light-colored spot on that hill? Smokey was detonated there to see 
how hills would deflect a blast. (It blew away the topsoil, all the 
way down to the volcanic rock.) See that building? That's where 
they test the ages of the plutonium in our nuclear warheads. See 
that white silo? That's Icecap. 
</P>
<P>
	Icecap is a 120-foot tower designed to shelter workers preparing  
for a blast. It was all ready for a ``nuclear event'' in spring 
1993, but then came the moratorium. A crane that would lower a bomb 
down the shaft looms over an empty hole. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffrey Cruser can hardly sit still. The 17-year-old and his  
dad, Alan, a school teacher, have come all the way from Beachwood, 
N.J., to see THE crater -- the Sedan Crater. And now, the tour bus 
they're riding is approaching it. 
</P>
<P>
	Sedan was a nuclear bomb the size of a volleyball with the force  
of 104,000 tons of TNT. It was detonated 635 feet underground on 
July 6, 1962, an attempt at finding peaceful uses for atomic 
explosives. Scientists had hoped to use nuclear devices to excavate 
harbors, reservoirs, even a new Panama canal. 
</P>
<P>
	Sedan released seismic energy equivalent to an earthquake of  
magnitude 4.75. It displaced 12 million tons of earth, leaving a 
cone-shaped pit 1,280 feet in diameter and 320 feet deep. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of that earth became radioactive dust that floated over  
Utah. Several years later, irregularly high numbers of children 
there developed leukemia. A statewide study by the University of 
Utah, published in 1990, said there is an association between 
radioactive fallout and leukemia risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffrey loves the science part. ``It's really cool how such a  
small little bomb can create such a huge explosion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On this tour are 24 female passengers, 13 male. They are from  
different corners of America, different generations. Yet as the bus 
rolls along, they all murmur, oooh and aaah, cover their mouths, 
get that glazed look in their eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are those solar panels?''  
</P>
<P>
	``See? I told you Kennedy was the only president who came  
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like a meteor landed there.''  
</P>
<P>
	``God, I feel like Jessica Lange in the movie where she rides  
out in the field on a horse to stop that nuclear test.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Oooh! Was that a roadrunner!''  
</P>
<P>
	Celia Owens, 50, an artist and writer who lives in New York  
City, gazes out the window at the desert scruff. Her father was a 
foreman for seven years at a nuclear weapons assembly plant in Oak 
Ridge, Tenn. He died in January, 1961, of a rare blood disorder 
that Owens attributes to radiation exposure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess I needed to see this for myself,'' she says, ``to see  
where profit and greed can lead people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beside her sits Lew Thompson, 78, from Santa Fe, N.M. In July of  
1945, Thompson was an army lieutenant in the 40th U.S. division on 
Panay Island in the Philippines, waiting for the final assault on 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would pass by the colonel's tent on the way to get chow,''  
he says, ``and every night we'd see him sitting on the end of his 
bunk with his head in his hands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His eyes glisten. ``A month later, after they dropped the bomb  
on Hiroshima, the colonel came and told us that our division had 
been chosen for a suicide mission on Tokyo. Today, the thought of 
dropping H-bombs on people makes me sick to my stomach. But I am 
alive only because of one thing -- the bomb.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bus clambers up a rise. Down a gravel slope, beyond a fence  
and white and yellow platform, Sedan awaits. 
</P>
<P>
	The visitors huddle near the railing, side-by-side, shoulders  
touching. The sage rustles at the lip of the crater. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, my.''  
</P>
<P>
	``Wow.''  
</P>
<P>
	``Good Lord.''  
</P>
<P>
	No one returns to the bus smiling.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time I come here, it seems as if it crumbles just a  
little more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scammell regards the house. It's a two-story, three-bedroom,  
wooden A-frame with a brick chimney and cinderblock basement. 
Typically suburban, American, 1950s style. It juts out of Yucca 
Flat, surrounded by tumbleweeds and all the space in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``Go on in,'' he says. ``Just watch where you step.''  
</P>
<P>
	It needs some paint, to cover up the scorch marks around the  
window frames. It could use some siding, a front door, roof 
shingles. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody has ever lived here.  
</P>
<P>
	This is one of two houses left in Survival Town. That was a  
cluster of 14 houses, propane station, radio station, electric 
grid, transformer station and supply store erected in the fall of 
1954 to see how middle-class America would fare against nuclear 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
	J.C. Penney provided couches, drapes, rugs, tableware,  
appliances, TV sets, bedspreads, toiletries, towels, radios, lamps. 
Fresh food was flown in and placed on dining-room tables. Canned 
food was stocked in cupboards. 
</P>
<P>
	Life-sized mannequins in suits, skirts, bathrobes and plaid  
pajamas were set up in poses -- cooking, knitting, watching 
television. And then, on the morning of May 5, 1955, Apple-2 was 
detonated atop a 500-foot tower, 6,000 feet away ... 
</P>
<P>
	The floorboards in the empty rooms feel as if they're about to  
give. Plywood dangles from the ceilings; a charred door sags 
against a living room wall. Everything else was taken away years 
ago. Buried. 
</P>
<P>
	In the upstairs bedroom, drops of rain slant through gaps in the  
roof and make tiny dots on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Buzzing. The wings of mayflies.  
</P>
<P>
	Moaning. The wind bringing the smell of rain through a missing  
window. 
</P>
<P>
	On the horizon, black clouds boil. Bolts of lightning slash the  
sky. A lone bird, a raven, spreads its wings. 
</P>
<P>
	It's nature's turn now.

<HEADLINE> N.C. Braces for Hurricane Irene </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, N.C. (AP) -- Hurricane Irene rumbled up the East  
Coast on Saturday, taking aim at flood-weary North Carolina, where 
residents began all-too-familiar preparations for another 
onslaught. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Jim Hunt declared a state of emergency. Officials  
considered evacuations and warned that it wouldn't take much rain 
to push rivers in the eastern part of the state back above flood 
stages. Irene's 80-mph winds also could threaten camper villages 
populated by people left homeless by floods from Hurricane Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Buday, whose government-provided camper is parked in his  
soggy yard, wore rubber gloves and boots Saturday as he hauled 
sodden carpeting and furniture to the street. Hurricane Floyd left 
water 16 inches deep in his brick home across the street from the 
Neuse River near Goldsboro, but Buday wasn't fretting about Irene 
just yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now it doesn't worry me, but I don't know what I'll feel  
like tomorrow,'' Buday said. ``The river's down. I don't think 
we'll have a problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the storm has been blamed for at least seven deaths --  
two in Cuba and five people near Fort Lauderdale, Fla., who were 
electrocuted by downed power lines. After drenching Cuba's tobacco 
fields and collapsing buildings in Havana, Irene rolled ashore 
Friday afternoon 75 miles southwest of Miami and headed north 
through the Everglades. 
</P>
<P>
	At its worst, the storm knocked out power to more than 1.5  
million customers, according to Florida Power &AMP; Light, the state's 
largest utility. Electricity was restored to about half of them by 
midday Saturday. As much as 18 inches of wind-driven rain caused 
scattered flooding over hundreds of miles, from Key West to West 
Palm Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could not give you a damage assessment (of crops). ... I  
would not be surprised if it were $100 million,'' said Miami-Dade 
Mayor Alex Penelas. ``It seems about every piece of farm land is 
literally under water.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irene intensified slightly as it headed north. Its 80 mph  
sustained winds were 6 mph more than the threshold for a hurricane 
and the storm was moving north at 12 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	At 8 p.m. Saturday, the center of the storm was about 250 miles  
south of Charleston, S.C.., and moving north near 10 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Projections from the National Hurricane Center put the ragged  
eye of the storm near Cape Romain, just northeast of Charleston, by 
Sunday afternoon -- and it was expected to make landfall near the 
North Carolina-South Carolina state line late Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	It was exactly a month ago Saturday that thousands of coastal  
residents returned home after fleeing Hurricane Floyd, which 
destroyed than 6,000 buildings and damaged 9,000 others. At least 
49 deaths and damage expected to exceed Hurricane Fran's record $6 
billion in 1996 were blamed on the huge storm. Piles of soggy 
furniture and ruined toys and appliances still line roads 
throughout the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Rain was already falling in southeastern North Carolina Saturday  
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no place for this rainfall to go, so any little bit of  
rain that we get from this hurricane could immediately cause 
flooding,'' said Laura Furgione, a meteorologist at the National 
Weather Service office in Newport on the central North Carolina 
coast. 
</P>
<P>
	A hurricane warning was in effect from Savannah, Ga., to Cape  
Hatteras, N.C., and a hurricane watch was posted for north of Cape 
Hatteras to the Virginia border. A tropical storm warning remained 
in effect north of Vero Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Emergency management officials discussed possible evacuations in  
Brunswick and New Hanover counties, where the hurricane warnings 
were in effect, and visitors were ordered off the Cape Lookout 
National Seashore. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials opened shelters to evacuate hundreds of residents who  
had moved to campers set up as temporary housing for people whose 
homes were ruined by Floyd's floods. In Pitt County, the evacuees 
were being offered space in the Pitt County Jail's gymnasium and in 
the county courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
	The state was mobilizing 300 National Guard troops Saturday to  
prepare for the recovery effort, and Eric Tolbert, North Carolina's 
emergency management director, said many supplies are already in 
place because of the recovery effort from Hurricane Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a little concerned about personnel resources being  
strained,'' Tolbert said. ``Our personnel are obviously tired.''

<HEADLINE> Boom Transforms Middletown USA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MUNCIE, Ind. (AP) -- The change shows in Art Emmerling's hands.  
</P>
<P>
	They're cleaner, softer and free of the blisters he earned in  
the profane din of Muncie's General Motors plant. The former 
factory worker is now chief programmer for an employer that went 
from silverware to software. ``I do more with the mind now,'' 
Emmerling says. 
</P>
<P>
	Here between Wall Street and Silicon Valley, America's  
extraordinary economic boom has transformed its most famously 
ordinary town. Muncie has been known as Middletown, USA, since 
1929, when two sociologists made it the setting for a book on the 
habits of typical Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	But what is typical in American economics has changed, and so  
has Muncie. ``The deindustrialization of Muncie is just about 
complete,'' says Bruce Geelhoed, who chronicles the city's 
evolution as director of the Center for Middletown Studies at Ball 
State University in Muncie. 
</P>
<P>
	Unemployment has reached historical lows, income has hit new  
highs. A prospering symphony recently drew the famed Marvin 
Hamlisch as guest director, and diners are paying $30 for tournedos 
a la Newburg at Foxfires. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers in this former rust-belt city have followed its move  
from manufacturing to service. Jobs in retailing overtook those in 
manufacturing in 1982, and service positions overtook manufacturing 
in 1989. The city built on Ball glass jars and Corvette 
transmissions now churns out professionals like Emmerling. 
</P>
<P>
	Emmerling's employer, Ontario Systems, is the fastest-growing  
division of Ontario Corp., a 40-year-old manufacturer that once 
made silverware and jet parts. Now it makes semiconductor equipment 
and debt-collection software. 
</P>
<P>
	Across town, another former manufacturing worker also prospers  
as a service professional. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig Johnson retired in February from Borg-Warner Automotive to  
expand a side business in designing custom homes. As home buyers 
took advantage of falling interest rates, Johnson went from 
designing 100 homes in 1990 to 180 last year, at $300 to $3,000 
apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the housing market was on its back, I probably would have  
toughed it out'' at the plant, says Johnson, 54. ``Now,'' he adds 
with a smile, ``I'm able to do this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's not alone in finding enough work. Muncie is the seat of  
Delaware County, where unemployment -- which peaked at 16.6 percent 
in 1983 -- is now at 2.7 percent. Per capita income rose from 
$15,001 in 1989 to $21,504 in 1997. The city has paced both the 
nation and the state, where family income rose 13 percent to 
$53,581 between 1994 and 1997, just $231 above the national figure. 
</P>
<P>
	That hasn't turned Main Street into Rodeo Drive, but there are  
signs of creeping affluence. Until last year a handful of local 
gourmands were quick to recommend Foxfires, the restaurant owned by 
``Garfield'' cartoonist Jim Davis. The tony bistro now faces stiff 
competition from Benjamin's, where stuffed veal goes for $23.96, 
and Lucy Lucy, where diners pay $22 for the 18-ounce ``cowboy 
steak.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``People are taking time to enjoy life a little more,'' says Dan  
Allen, a former GM plant manager who now heads the Chamber of 
Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	Economics are also changing the look of the city. Downtown, on a  
recent Monday, a pigeon perched on an unused billiard table in the 
window of Doc's. Another window promised: ``Opening soon.'' Across 
the street, where Kelso Inc. Educational Materials once did 
business, a sign said: ``Sold.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outside, jackhammers have chewed up Walnut Street in a  
renovation project meant to draw professional offices and 
restaurants. JC Penney and Sears long ago abandoned the downtown 
strip in favor of discount malls that line Muncie's outskirts. 
Those stores have succeeded at more than emptying downtown: From 
1990 to 1996, retail sales jumped 51 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Philanthropists are making a cultural mark. In the past few  
years Muncie has gained a cultural center and a new convention 
center with a children's museum. Alumnus David Letterman set up a 
scholarship to Ball State for ``C'' students. 
</P>
<P>
	Rising fortunes mean surging demand for service workers. At  
First Merchants Bank, the starting salary for tellers rose twice in 
a year. It took six months to fill three technology jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Fauquhar may be partly responsible. The founder of Ontario  
Systems says he's paying technology workers $28,000 to $60,000. 
Designers and sales managers make as much as $80,000, in a town 
where $100,000 buys a comfortable ranch house. The business, which 
employed 50 workers in 1990, now has 325. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chamber of Commerce is considering ways to lure workers,  
including a possible ``come back home'' campaign for Ball State 
alumni. ``Everybody's having difficulty getting employees,'' Stefan 
Anderson says. 
</P>
<P>
	The labor market isn't the only way in which Muncie mirrors  
national trends. The city has typified America since the 1920s, 
when Robert and Helen Lynd singled it out in their book, 
``Middletown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The town is still considered a microcosm of the country. In  
Muncie, according to Life magazine, ``you may look at the average 
1937 American as he really is.'' Forty years later, the town's 
ordinariness attracted director Steven Spielberg as the setting for 
his 1977 film, ``Close Encounters of the Third Kind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The town's cost of living is still 99.5 percent of the national  
average, and its voters serve as a political weather vane. With the 
exception of John Kennedy, they've picked every president in the 
past 60 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The rising economic tide has not lifted all boats. Manufacturing  
workers have seen their fortunes sink. Service jobs have grown 3.8 
percent a year since 1989 while factory jobs fell 0.6 percent 
annually. Manufacturers employed 35.3 percent of local workers in 
1974. Now it's half that. That mirrors a national decline, from 
25.6 percent of jobs in 1974 to 14.9 percent now. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, glassmaker Ball Corp. moved to Colorado, though its  
founders remain. The Balls, dubbed Muncie's Royal Family by the 
Lynds, gave the town its identity -- and its two largest employers, 
the university and Ball Memorial Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was supposed to be what God intended,'' says Bill  
Spurgeon, retired executive editor of The Muncie Star and Muncie 
Evening Press. ``There was supposed to be glass made in Muncie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997 and 1998, manufacturers closed plants and cut more than  
1,500 jobs. Charlene Doss Morales once earned $18.60 an hour at 
Borg-Warner's manual transmission plant. But the market for manuals 
declined, and the production line was sold off. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Mrs. Morales drives her Pontiac Grand Prix (an automatic) 60  
miles to Indianapolis and a part-time job at American Trans Air 
where she makes $7.50 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure I'll ever get up to what Borg-Warner was paying,  
but it'll be rewarding,'' says Ms. Morales, 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of factory workers face a similar plight. The  
production workers who earned $18.60 now average $11.26 an hour, 
according to job relocation program funded by the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, manufacturing cuts have had a limited effect on  
the local economy. Unemployment hasn't exceeded 5 percent, and the 
number of jobs in Delaware County rose 2.7 percent in the past 
year, to 59,800. The city's population, meanwhile, fell from 70,800 
in 1992 to 66,800 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite the industrial layoffs, which have been nothing other  
than a hiccup, Muncie and other Indiana cities are putting the 
labor force to work,'' says Patrick M. Barkey, director of Ball 
State's Bureau of Business Research. 
</P>
<P>
	A program trained jobless factory workers for new jobs in  
construction but couldn't fill all the slots. Unemployed and 
unhappily employed workers later enrolled. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Neely saw it as the route to a new career. Laid off a  
decade ago, he took the first job he could find: driving a truck 
for Unitog uniform rentals, picking up dirty garments and dropping 
off clean ones for $14 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	With jobs easier to find this year, Neely, 40, quit to retrain  
as an electrician. He gets $7.50 an hour as an apprentice, but in 
five years he'll earn union scale, now $23.80. He envisions his own 
company one day. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a change he wouldn't have made in the 1980s.  
</P>
<P>
	``Back then unemployment was so high you couldn't even get a job  
at McDonald's,'' says Neely at a construction training site on 
Muncie's southwest side. ``I just told my wife, `There's nothing 
like coming home and feeling good about what you do.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The new economy has also caused something of an identity crisis.  
</P>
<P>
	On both sides of the railroad tracks that neatly divide Muncie's  
professional north side from its blue-collar south side, the roads 
are lined with the GMs, Fords and Chryslers of Munsonians who 
proudly ``buy American.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That slogan has no longer carries the meaning it once did.  
Chryslers are now made by a German-American hybrid, DaimlerChrysler 
AG. The manual transmissions that Borg-Warner once made for GM in 
Muncie are now made in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda, Toyota and Jaguar have leather interiors installed at the  
Muncie shop of Bartlett Corp. And one of the town's newest 
employers will be Honda supplier Keihin Corp. though most Hondas 
here still bear out-of-state plates. Starting in April, the new 
factory will ship air conditioners to the Japanese automaker's 
plants in Ohio. Honda also hires Bartlett Corp. of Muncie to 
install leather interiors. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't have the freedom here in Indiana to bash outsiders  
anymore,'' Ball State's Barkey says, ``because those outsiders are 
providing a lot of the jobs here.''

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- New York Mets catcher Mike Piazza was in the  
lineup for Game 4 of the NL championship series Saturday night, 
despite a slight concussion and sore left hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel good enough to go out there,'' he said before playing  
the Atlanta Braves. ``They checked me out. My hand is fine. I'm 
feeling a little better. When I woke up, I felt OK. There was a 
little whiplash and a little soreness. But this is a playoff game 
and the adrenaline has a way of taking over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Game 3 Friday night, Piazza was involved in a home-plate  
collision with Bret Boone, leaving the catcher with a slight 
concussion. Then, Piazza was hit on the hand by Gerald Williams' 
backswing. 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza missed the last two games of the division series against  
Arizona with a sprained and swollen left thumb. After the collision 
with Boone, he had his first two hits of the NLCS following an 
0-for-8 start. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *MORE TRASH TALK:* Though manager Bobby Cox is clearly upset by  
his behavior, Atlanta closer John Rocker was still talking trash 
before Saturday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	The left-hander made a point to stop on the top step of the  
dugout after batting practice, even though New York fans were 
shouting obscenities at him. Rocker pointed his glove at one man 
and said, ``You can't ... beat me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then, as he walked up the ramp toward the clubhouse, a reporter  
asked if he planned to tone down his antics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why? It's working, ain't it,'' said Rocker, who had two saves  
in the series. ``The only thing I'm changing is my clothes after I 
get champagne all over them tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rocker stirred up angry feelings in New York by saying he hates  
the Mets and calling their fans ``stupid.'' Cox met with Rocker 
before Game 3, but the pitcher was his usually demonstrative self 
after working a scoreless ninth to preserve a 1-0 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``Apparently, it didn't do much good,'' Cox said of their  
conversation. ``We'll meet again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Braves general manager John Schuerholz was not upset by Rocker's  
antics, saying the pitcher is merely reacting to abuse from the 
fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been blown way out of proportion,'' Schuerholz said.  
``He's a young, vulnerable guy and (reporters) know he's going to 
say something.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *PEREZ ON TOP:* Backup catcher Eddie Perez, who became a regular  
for Atlanta when Javy Lopez was lost for the season because of a 
knee injury, was the Braves' leading hitter through the first three 
games of the NLCS. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez hit important home runs in each of the first two games and  
had two of Atlanta's three hits Friday night, lifting his average 
for the series to .600. He went into Saturday's Game 4 with nine 
hits in his last 13 NLCS at-bats over two years. During the regular 
season, he batted .249 with seven homers. 
</P>
<P>
	Unaccustomed to the full-time work load, Perez said, ``Right  
now, my knees feel worse than Javy's.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *HELPING OUT:* With three assists Saturday night, the Mets  
outfield set an NLCS record for a nine-inning game. 
</P>
<P>
	Rickey Henderson threw out runners at second base in consecutive  
innings after failing to record an assist in the regular season. 
Rookie Melvin Mora had the other assist, throwing out Bret Boone 
trying to score in the first inning. Henderson's last two-assist 
game came on Aug. 1, 1992, at Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets outfielders had 21 assists in the regular season.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SECOND-GUESSING:* Like any manager, Bobby Valentine of the Mets  
isn't crazy about second-guessing. And he refuses to do it to 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that stuff is all crazily overrated, for what it's  
worth,'' he said. ``I watch all the games again. I know what went 
on the first time. I don't necessarily need to do it twice because 
I don't get to do it over. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'd rather have guys get a 3-2 pitch and hit it in the gap  
or get a ground ball when you need it. You'd always rather have 
that happen. Then you wouldn't have to worry about anything else.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *CLOSING THE CASE:* Leading 3-0, the Braves went for the sweep  
against the New York Mets on Saturday night. It was a role reversal 
from a year ago, when San Diego won the first three NLCS games 
against Atlanta. The Braves came back against the Padres in that 
series, winning the next two games to force it to Game 6 before San 
Diego closed the series. 
</P>
<P>
	Braves manager Bobby Cox had an explanation for that. ``It's  
difficult to win any game this late in the season,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	No team has ever recovered from a 3-0 deficit in a best-of-7  
series. 
</P>
<P>
	Mets GM Steve Phillips said Saturday, ``Some day, someone will  
come back from three down. To me, it's harder to pitch a perfect 
game or 56 consecutive scoreless innings than to come back from 
three down. So why not us?''

<HEADLINE> Dolphins Vs. Pats NFL's Big Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The attraction is obvious: Miami at New England, each with one  
loss and both in a three-way race with Buffalo in the AFC East, the 
NFL's toughest division. 
</P>
<P>
	But instead of worrying only about Drew Bledsoe and the  
Patriots, Jimmy Johnson and Dan Marino are worrying about each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guys, I'm sick of these. Enough, OK?'' Johnson said when he  
was asked this week about his reported threat to bench Marino for 
lackluster performances against Arizona and Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	That debate is over, at least for now, after Marino rallied the  
Dolphins past the Colts last week, throwing for 393 yards and 
completing a 48-yard fourth-down pass to Oronde Gadsden to set up 
the winning score. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, maybe it was Johnson's motivation. More likely it was  
simply Marino demonstrating that at 38, he still retains some of 
the brilliance he had at 28. 
</P>
<P>
	The real problem might be an old one -- a weak running game that  
doesn't take the pressure off Marino. It's averaging 82 yards a 
game, 23rd in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel we're making strides,'' Johnson says. ``But people have  
heard that statement for about the past 15 years here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Patriots, who won their first four games by a total of 19  
points, lost last week when the usually reliable Adam Vinatieri hit 
the upright with a 32-yard field goal attempt that would have 
beaten Kansas City. That probably was the football gods telling 
Vinatieri and the Pats they weren't good enough to be 5-0 in this 
watered-down NFL; even coach Pete Carroll concedes New England 
could have lost three of its four wins. 
</P>
<P>
	This has become one of the NFL's more bitter series, with the  
Patriots winning five of the last six, including three in 1997, 
when they beat the Dolphins twice by a total of five points in the 
regular season, then 17-3 in a playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	In other games Sunday, Cleveland is at Jacksonville;  
Indianapolis at the New York Jets; Minnesota at Detroit; Oakland at 
Buffalo; Philadelphia at Chicago; Pittsburgh at Cincinnati; St. 
Louis at Atlanta; Tennessee at New Orleans; Seattle at San Diego; 
Carolina at San Francisco; Green Bay at Denver; and Washington at 
Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas it at the New York Giants on Monday night.  
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore, Kansas City and Tampa Bay are off.  
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
                    *Green Bay (3-1) at Denver (1-4)    	
</P>
<P>
	This replay of the 1998 Super Bowl is the perfect example of  
what a good quarterback means these days. Without Brett Favre, the 
Packers probably would be 0-4; without John Elway ... Denver's 
record speaks for itself. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway, of course, isn't the only missing Denver star. Add  
Terrell Davis and now Shannon Sharpe to the injury list. Brian 
Griese, who was supposed to be benched until Bubby Brister pulled a 
muscle in his rib cage, beat Oakland last week, but he can't match 
Favre (or Elway, of course) for last-minute heroics. 
</P>
<P>
                 *San Francisco (3-2) at Carolina (1-3)    	
</P>
<P>
	This is a reunion game: George Seifert against the team he  
coached to two Super Bowls in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Seifert's Panthers, who were off last week, have been getting a  
brilliant season from Tshimanga Biakabutuka, who has been 
alternating with Fred Lane, but is averaging 10.8 yards per carry 
to Lane's 3.3 -- a good reason to play Biakabutuka more. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers' problem is not Jeff Garcia, who will start again at  
quarterback for Steve Young. It's the fact there's little young 
blood on a team that's finally falling back to the pack. 
</P>
<P>
                 *Dallas (3-1) at New York Giants (2-3)    	
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys not only lost Michael Irvin in Philadelphia, they  
managed to find a way to lose to the Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
	First Jerry Jones and then Deion Sanders embarrassed the Giants  
in their last two Monday night appearances at Giants Stadium. The 
Giants' quarterbacking has been embarrassing (Kent Graham will 
start), but the defense remains good enough to make this a close -- 
probably boring -- game for the prime-time audience. 
</P>
<P>
                   *St. Louis (4-0) at Atlanta (1-4)    	
</P>
<P>
	Two teams that symbolize the modern NFL, one going up, the other  
tumbling after soaring from the bottom to the top a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Again it's quarterbacks -- Atlanta has missed in-and-out Chris  
Chandler, the Rams are riding the arm of Kurt Warner, of whom the 
coaching staff thought so little they left him exposed in the 
expansion draft. The Rams and Warner could be ripe for a fall here. 
The Falcons finally won in New Orleans last week and have seen 
Warner once, in a 35-7 loss in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
                    *Oakland (2-3) at Buffalo (4-1)    	
</P>
<P>
	The Raiders' three losses are by a total of eight points, but  
they count the same as blowouts. Just as it has been the past few 
seasons, it's ``Just Lose, Baby,'' the other side of owner Al 
Davis' catch phrase. 
</P>
<P>
	And yet another reason why this is a quarterback league: The  
Bills have the NFL's fifth-ranked defense, but it's Doug Flutie who 
makes the difference between winning and mediocrity. 
</P>
<P>
                   *Seattle (3-1) at San Diego (3-1)    	
</P>
<P>
	Another example of the upside-down season is two teams from the  
lower depths of the AFC West playing for the division lead. Credit 
two new coaches named Mike -- Holmgren and Riley, with the latter 
doing just as well with the Chargers as his much more renowned 
colleague is doing up north. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense has been the key for San Diego. But so has  
quarterback, where Jim Harbaugh and Erik Kramer are a major upgrade 
from Ryan Leaf and Craig Whelihan. 
</P>
<P>
                  *Washington (3-1) at Arizona (2-3)    	
</P>
<P>
	The Redskins are yet another example of the year of the  
quarterback. They rank last in the league in yards allowed and are 
giving up 30 points a game. But the offense, led by Brad Johnson, 
is averaging 37.5 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
	Jake Plummer, who has thrown three TD passes and 12  
interceptions, got things turned around a bit last week in a 14-3 
win over the Giants, his first game without an INT. 
</P>
<P>
                   *Minnesota (2-3) at Detroit (2-2)    	
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings are in crisis after losing at home to the Bears.  
``My spirit is crushed,'' says cornerback Jimmy Hitchcock, speaking 
for a team that's lost three times as many games as it did last 
season and has yet to score 24 in a game -- the fewest the Vikes had 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lions, who have lost two straight after a 2-0 start, are  
proving they do miss Barry Sanders after gaining just 37 yards on 
the ground in a 20-10 loss to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
               *Indianapolis (2-2) at New York Jets (1-4)    	
</P>
<P>
	The 25 points the Colts allowed Miami in the fourth quarter last  
week are an indication they're not quite ready for the playoffs 
despite the heroics of Peyton Manning, Marvin Harrison and Edgerrin 
James. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Jets aren't a playoff team either with Rick Mirer at  
quarterback -- he's starting again, although Bill Parcells has been 
considering playing either Ray Lucas or punter Tom Tupa. 
</P>
<P>
                 *Tennessee (4-1) at New Orleans (1-3)    	
</P>
<P>
	The NFL in microcosm: Three of the Titans' four wins are by a  
total of five points, and the other is unimpressive because it was 
against Cleveland. The Saints have lost three straight by a total 
of 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Was Ricky Williams worth two years' worth of drafts to the  
Saints? Maybe, but not yet. Bothered by an ankle injury, he's 19th 
in the NFL in rushing with 257 yards and a 3.6 average. 
</P>
<P>
                 *Philadelphia (1-4) at Chicago (3-2)    	
</P>
<P>
	The Bears might be the NFL's most pleasant surprise, thanks to  
Dick Jauron, one of the least heralded new coaches. Cade McNown 
will get his first start in place of Shane Matthews, another 
pleasant surprise, who's out with a pulled hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the Eagles seemed surprised the offense last week produced  
their first touchdown since the first quarter of the opening game. 
They were even more surprised that it gave them a 13-10 upset over 
Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
                *Cleveland (0-5) at Jacksonville (4-1)    	
</P>
<P>
	The Jags, despite their relative lack of offense, are on track  
to get home field in the AFC because of games like this -- 10 of 
their final 11 games are with teams that currently have losing 
records. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns had their best shot at their first win last week  
against the Bengals. But Akili Smith, who thought he should have 
been taken No. 1 by Cleveland instead of Tim Couch, did them in 
with a last-minute TD pass. 
</P>
<P>
                 *Pittsburgh (2-3) at Cincinnati (1-4)    	
</P>
<P>
	The Steelers still have the reputation, but look at the record.  
They've lost three in a row, eight of their last 10 and 10 of their 
last 14, which puts them down near the Bengals, whose only win came 
last week over the winless Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	The one positive for Cincinnati was the play of Akili Smith, who  
demonstrated the promise that made him the No. 3 overall pick in 
last April's draft.

<HEADLINE> Steinbrenner Upset After Big Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- George Steinbrenner didn't pay $85 million to  
see this. 
</P>
<P>
	Especially not in the playoffs.  
</P>
<P>
	Especially not against the Boston Red Sox.  
</P>
<P>
	The New York Yankees owner walked through the clubhouse after  
Boston's record-setting 13-1 rout Saturday that pulled the Red Sox 
to 2-1 in the best-of-7 AL Championship Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not the way we play Yankee baseball,'' he said.  
``We've got to get it out of our system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roger Clemens was pounded for five runs and six hits in two-plus  
innings. Hideki Irabu gave up eight runs and 13 hits in 4 2-3 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, this game was a huge lift to their club,'' Yankees  
catcher Joe Girardi said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the largest margin of defeat for the Yankees in their 254  
postseason games, topping the 12-1 loss to Atlanta in Game 1 of the 
1996 World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	The 13 runs matched the most against the Yankees in the  
postseason, accomplished by the New York Giants (13-5) in Game 3 of 
the 1921 World Series, the Brooklyn Dodgers (13-8) in Game 2 of the 
1956 Series and the Milwaukee Braves (13-5) in Game 2 of the 1958 
World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	And the 21 hits were a record, too, one more than the Giants had  
during Game 3 in 1921. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, we have to forget about this,'' said catcher Jorge  
Posada, who took over from Girardi in the fourth. ``That's easy to 
say and not so easy to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The World Series champions had won 12 consecutive postseason  
games, tying the record set by the Yankees during Series sweeps in 
1927, '28 and '32. The streak is over, and the possibility of a 
sweep is gone. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a short series, a game turns it momentum-wise,'' Yankees  
manager Joe Torre said. ``For sure, the Red Sox feel good about 
themselves tonight and we are just the opposite. But that is what 
makes these short series great. It tests your insides, basically.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With on-and-off Andy Pettitte starting Game 4 against Bret  
Saberhagen on Sunday night, there's a possibility the best-of-7 
series could be tied. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's 2-to-1,'' Paul O'Neill said. ``We have to think no matter  
how bad they beat us up tonight, we're still up 2-to-1.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Columbus NHL Dispute Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- The Columbus Blue Jackets will begin play  
in the National Hockey League next year without Lamar Hunt as an 
owner. 
</P>
<P>
	A tentative agreement was reached that ended Hunt's attempt for  
a share of the team and handed the franchise to the ownership group 
headed by steel magnate John McConnell and his partner, Wolfe 
Enterprises Inc., The Columbus Dispatch reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawsuits each side filed to win control of the team will be  
dropped and Hunt, owner of the NFL's Kansas City Chiefs and the 
Columbus Crew of Major League Soccer, will not receive damages for 
being excluded from McConnell's ownership group, attorneys for both 
sides told the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, both sides are going to go on their way,'' said  
Anthony Celebrezze Jr., Hunt's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	John Zeiger, an attorney for McConnell's group, confirmed that  
an agreement was reached, but said the document had not been 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe it would be premature to comment before each of the  
parties have executed the agreement,'' Zeiger said. 
</P>
<P>
	Messages seeking comment Saturday were left at the offices of  
both attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunt, McConnell and Wolfe Enterprises were part of the original  
group of investors who formed Columbus Hockey Ltd. in 1996 to 
pursue an NHL expansion franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	A rift developed in the group after voters rejected a sales-tax  
issue in May 1997 that would have financed a downtown arena and a 
soccer stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	McConnell and his partners reached a deal with Nationwide to  
build an arena for the franchise after Hunt turned down a contract 
with Nationwide. They sued Hunt to validate the group's ownership 
claim without him. 
</P>
<P>
	On Aug. 31, the 10th District Court of Appeals upheld a Common  
Pleas Court ruling that said the McConnell group did nothing wrong 
when it acquired the franchise without Hunt. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court, however, reversed the lower court when it  
ruled Hunt did not have to pay McConnell's group $920,000 in legal 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunt, of Dallas, accused the NHL and Nationwide of bad-faith  
bargaining and breach of contract. He countersued in a New York 
court, seeking to have the franchise taken away from Columbus and 
asking for $50 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Both suits will be dropped in the agreement.  
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is, both sides will walk away with where they  
were at the appeals court,'' Celebrezze said. ``Neither side is 
going to file an appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Jackets will begin play next October in Nationwide  
Arena, which is being built downtown.

<HEADLINE> Lugar Not Sold on Crop Insurance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The owner of the Lugar farm in Indiana is a  
tough sell when it comes to crop insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, the 600-acre corn and soybean operation has not had a  
significant crop loss in more than four decades, and he only 
started buying the federally subsidized insurance a couple of years 
ago because he wanted to see how it worked. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's possible in America for 41 years to make a profit with or  
without crop insurance,'' says that farmer, Republican Sen. Richard 
Lugar. 
</P>
<P>
	Now as chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Lugar has  
delayed work on an overhaul of the insurance system that sharply 
would cut the premiums producers pay for the coverage. The policies 
cover losses from storms or drought; some also protect producers 
from sharp drops in commodity prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The House last month approved legislation that would double the  
federal subsidy for the program to $3 billion a year. The idea is 
to get farmers to buy more coverage, or in many cases to purchase 
the insurance for the first time; a third of the eligible acreage 
nationwide is not insured. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lugar does not think that is the best use of taxpayers'  
money. He has declined to schedule any action on several insurance 
bills that have been introduced in the Senate, including one 
cosponsored by 10 of his committee's 18 members. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's broad consensus on what needs to be done ... and one  
man stands in the way of it,'' said Rep. Earl Pomeroy, D-N.D. 
</P>
<P>
	``He sees the entire country from that can't-miss stretch of the  
Corn Belt that he represents'' and ``has very little understanding, 
or, for that matter, concern for farmers producing in areas where 
risk factors are higher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lugar says cutting premiums will encourage farmers to increase  
production of commodities already in surplus and to plant crops in 
areas where they will not grow well. 
</P>
<P>
	He also says a third of the money the government puts into the  
system goes not to farmers but to the companies selling and 
servicing the policies. 
</P>
<P>
	He has introduced legislation that would give the extra cash  
directly to farmers to spend as they choose rather putting it into 
insurance system. To get the money, about $1.3 billion a year, 
farmers would have to show they are taking some steps to reduce 
their financial risk -- buying crop insurance, paying down debt, 
putting money into savings or selling crops under contract, for 
example. 
</P>
<P>
	He has the support of one of the nation's leading agricultural  
economists, Bruce Gardner of the University of Maryland, who says 
the proposed premium cuts would give farmers an extra incentive of 
$8 to $10 an acre to plant crops in areas they otherwise would 
leave alone. 
</P>
<P>
	That is enough of an incentive ``that we can expect to see  
expanded production in risky areas'' and ``weaken commodity prices 
to some extent,'' Gardner, president-elect of the American 
Agricultural Economics Association, told Lugar's committee 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
	But farm groups including the American Farm Bureau Federation  
disagree with Lugar. They support the House legislation and a 
similar Senate bill sponsored by Sens. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., and Bob 
Kerrey, D-Neb. 
</P>
<P>
	Those proposals are seen as a way to help farmers survive  
financially when weather is bad or prices are depressed, as has 
been the case the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Many farmers have declined to buy the coverage because they say  
it is not worth the cost, especially in the East, South and areas 
of the Midwest like Indiana where there usually is enough rain 
every year. Producers in other parts of the country where the 
policies are popular complain they lose their insurance if they 
have a series of weather-related losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig Hill, an Iowa corn producer and Farm Bureau member, said  
it is ``is imperative that Congress enact major reforms'' of the 
insurance system. 
</P>
<P>
	The government now pays 13 percent to 57 percent of the premium;  
farmers pick up the rest. Under the House-passed legislation, the 
government would pay from 31 percent to 67 percent, depending on 
the level of coverage. The Roberts-Kerrey bill also would increase 
the subsidy but at different rates. Other Senate bills are targeted 
at helping producers in the South and states growing fruits and 
vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerrey pressed Lugar without success last week to schedule votes  
on the insurance issue, saying there is a ``lot of pent-up 
frustration'' among farmers at the Senate's inaction. Lugar said he 
wants to work out a consensus on the issue.

<HEADLINE> Furyk Leads Las Vegas Invitational  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Defending champion Jim Furyk, his game steady  
despite gusting winds that sent scores soaring, shot a 1-under 71 
Saturday to open a three-shot lead in the Las Vegas Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
	Furyk, who also won the tournament title in 1995 and has won  
just one other event in six years on the PGA Tour, pulled out of a 
three-way tie at the top and went to 23 under through four rounds 
of the five-day event. 
</P>
<P>
	Jonathan Kaye began the day one shot off the lead and moved into  
second alone with a 73 at the 7,243-yard TPC at Summerlin course. 
</P>
<P>
	It was two more shots back to Harrison Frazar, who struggled to  
a 76 as gusts up to 40 mph turned club selection into a guessing 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob May, who shared the third-round lead with Furyk and Frazar,  
had a 78 to fall seven shots behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Vijay Singh, who complained after the third day that the  
low-scoring tournament was turning into a putting contest and said 
he wished there was some wind, got his wish. One shot behind the 
leaders heading into the fourth round, he ballooned to an 80 that 
left him 10 shots behind Furyk. 
</P>
<P>
	Some other well-known players also had their problems. Fred  
Couples, in contention early in the tournament, had a 79 and was 11 
under. Justin Leonard had a 78 and was 8 under, along with Phil 
Mickelson, who had a 79. 
</P>
<P>
	Furyk was able to shoot a respectable score by keeping the ball  
in the fairway and having an accurate short game. 
</P>
<P>
	The tournament scores were almost embarrassingly low the first  
three days, when conditions were ideal. 
</P>
<P>
	A pair of unheralded players, Craig Barlow and Frazar, set the  
early pace. Barlow had a first-round 61, and Frazar had cards of 
65-62-67 to go to 22 under heading into the fourth day. 
</P>
<P>
	The second day also featured a brush with the tour's magic  
number, 59. Tommy Armour III shot 12 under, close to the tour 
record round for 18 holes shared by Al Geiberger, Chip Beck and 
David Duval. 
</P>
<P>
	Players had been predicting a winning score of around 35 or 36  
under -- unless the wind began blowing. 
</P>
<P>
 *Divots:* The cut Friday to the low 70 scorers and ties was 11  
under, lowest ever for a tour event; players at 10 under and worse 
were sent packing. The previous record also came in on desert 
courses with a pro-am format, the 1993 Bob Hope Classic in Palm 
Springs, Calif., when players at 10 under made it, and those 9 
under and beyond went home. ... The leaderboard had been crowded 
the first three days in Las Vegas, but the wind put some air into 
it, with only six players within seven shots of the lead or closer.

<HEADLINE> Galarraga an Inspiration for Braves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Andres Galarraga stood alongside the batting  
cage prior to Game 3 of the NL championship series, a glove 
dangling from his left hand, his eyes focused intently on Andruw 
Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	When Jones finished his swings, he stepped around the screen,  
found a spot next to Big Cat and listened to a few words of advice 
on the subtle points of hitting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told Andres the other day that he's the highest-paid  
assistant in the history of the game,'' joked Don Baylor, hitting 
coach for the Atlanta Braves. ``It's been a joy just having him 
around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The feeling is mutual. Cured of cancer and looking forward to  
resuming his playing career next year, Galarraga is willing to 
settle for being close to his teammates during this postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	He's part cheerleader, part coach, part motivator for a team  
that was trying to reach another World Series without his potent 
bat in the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as I got to the team, everybody was happy to see me,''  
said Galarraga, who rejoined the Braves for the final month of the 
regular season after seven months of chemotherapy and radiation 
treatments. ``It works both ways. To be with the guys is special 
for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And special to them as well.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's inspirational,'' said outfielder Brian Jordan. ``That's  
just the type of guy he is. I can't wait to play with him next 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sure, Galarraga would prefer to be out on the field once the  
game begins. It's tough to look at someone else playing first base 
and someone else hitting in the cleanup spot where he produced a 
.305 average, 44 homers and 121 RBIs last season. 
</P>
<P>
	But he smiles constantly and is patient with his recovery,  
knowing it will be a couple of more months before he begins 
full-scale workouts. For now, he is content to shag flies in the 
outfield and hang around the batting cage prior to the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew he was feeling better when he asked me which group he  
was hitting in,'' Baylor said. ``I told him not yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was only a few days ago that Galarraga was given clearance by  
his doctors to begin a light exercise program. A bone in his back, 
once stricken with cancer, is now sturdy enough to endure some 
weights, jogging and calisthenics. 
</P>
<P>
	``That made me very happy,'' he said. ``This is another level  
for me to be ready next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He expects to begin his regular workout program in December,  
which would give him three months to prepare for spring training. 
But he is 38 years old, so there's no guarantee a comeback will be 
successful. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know,'' Baylor conceded. ``(Golfer) Paul Azinger came  
back from a similar thing, but he was younger. Andres is going to 
be in a situation where he's got 60 feet, 6 inches to react to a 95 
mph fastball. But I know he will work as hard as he can to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unable to work out until recently, Galarraga is about 25 pounds  
above his normal playing weight of 235. But his salt-and-pepper 
hair, which he shaved off during chemotherapy, has fully grown 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before I started losing my hair, I went ahead and shaved it,''  
he said. ``I didn't want to see my hair coming out everywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As with most cancer survivors, Galarraga has emerged with a new  
perspective on life. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to enjoy every minute,'' he said. ``When they told me I  
had cancer, I thought I was going to die the next day. Now, I have 
the opportunity to be healthy and enjoy a good, long life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors discovered the cancerous tumor in Galarraga just days  
before the start of spring training in February. He underwent four 
months of chemotherapy, followed by radiation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The chemo was bad,'' Galarraga recalled. ``I was really sick,  
had a lot of nausea. But I couldn't complain about the medicine. 
That was helping me kill all the bad stuff in my body.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On a larger scale, he viewed his illness as a chance to help  
others in a similar predicament. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought God sent the cancer to me to show other people they  
can be positive,'' Galarraga said. ``It helps for people to be 
positive. That helps the medicine work better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Galarraga recovered, the Braves kept winning. They  
captured their eighth straight division title and led the majors 
with 103 victories, even while four other players suffered 
season-ending injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really proud of them,'' Galarraga said. ``They're doing  
great. Even with all the injuries, they found a way to win.''

<HEADLINE> Kwan Unveils Elegant Short Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- If her grades are as high as the marks  
she received Saturday for her new short program, Michelle Kwan will 
soon be an honor student at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing hooky from her freshman studies, the 19-year-old,  
two-time world champion and 1998 Olympic silver medalist 
successfully unveiled an elegant new short program in the Masters 
of Figure Skating, one of the first big competitions of the skating 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``This program is completely different. It's a bluesy version of  
a Beatles song. It's not like Rachmaninoff or classical,'' Kwan 
said. ``I was really at ease. I felt like I was over my skates. 
Today, I just felt like the ice and I were one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan skated to a Jeff Beck version of the Beatles tune ``A Day  
in the Life,'' a natural choice because she said her father ``named 
me after the song (Michelle, a Beatles hit).'' He also named her 
sister, Karen, after another favorite singer, Karen Carpenter. 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan followed her short program with a long routine as elegant  
as her sheer lavender costume to win the women's championship. 
Skating to ``Kissing You'' from the movie ``Romeo and Juliet,'' 
Kwan performed three triple jumps in a mistake-free program that 
earned her her 40th perfect mark of 6.0 as fans littered the ice 
with flowers and stuffed animals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know it was the 40th,'' Kwan said. ``That's  
incredible. These judges don't give 6.0s that easily. What is 
perfect, that's what I'm thinking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite falling twice, Maria Butyrskaya of Russia finished  
second after a dramatic, exquisitely skated long program to a 
Spanish melody by Bizet. 
</P>
<P>
	Todd Eldredge, first after the short program, skated strongly  
and cleanly in the long to beat three other skaters including 
Alexei Yagudin, the two-time world champion from Russia who 
finished second. 
</P>
<P>
	Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov, second after the short  
program, skated well enough in the finale to win the pairs. Kyoko 
Ina and John Zimmerman of the United States came back strong to 
finish second while Xue Shen and Hongbo Zhao of China fell from 
first to third. 
</P>
<P>
	The short program counted for one-third of the final score and  
the long program two-thirds. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the added pressure of college studies, Kwan skated a  
flawless short program, receiving all 5.8 scores for required 
elements and 5.8 and 5.9 marks for presentation to distance her 
competition. Clad in a sparkling red dress with silver slashes, 
Kwan had the crowd at the Brown County Arena standing and cheering 
at the finish of her new 2 1/2-minute routine. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter how many times you do it in the ice rink, in  
practice, it's not the same as getting out there in front of the 
judges, the people. I was really at ease so I just went out and had 
fun,'' said a relieved Kwan. 
</P>
<P>
	Fun is also something Kwan is having in college, which she feels  
is important even though she already has a lucrative career in 
figure skating. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want more than just to be a skater. It's a great  
opportunity,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kwan admits that taking 12 credits while continuing to skate  
competitively has made for a busy life. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got midterms coming up, I've got a paper due, I've pulled  
all-nighters. That's hard when you have to wake up in the morning 
and try to skate,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the short program is ``just for the season'' and won't  
be around for the 2002 Olympics, Kwan will be. The silver medalist 
in 1998 to Tara Lipinski, Kwan will go for the gold in Salt Lake 
City. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't wait until 2002. I'm really excited because it's in  
the United States,'' she said with real enthusiasm. ``I know how 
supportive everybody is. Everybody will be waving the American 
flag. It's going to be awesome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eldredge, who has failed to medal in two Olympics despite an  
impressive career that includes a world championship, will also be 
in Salt Lake City. And his energetic, technically superb short 
program showed he still has the talent to be a medal threat. 
</P>
<P>
	``That has always been something for me for a long time -- I want  
an Olympic medal, I want an Olympic medal,'' he admitted. 
</P>
<P>
	But Eldredge is approaching the 2002 Olympics differently.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's still something that would be nice to have, but the  
priority for me now is to have more fun with skating,'' he said. 
``I think I put a lot of pressure on myself in the last Olympics to 
try to skate better than I normally do. And I think that hurt. I 
think I'll enjoy it more next time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eldredge in 1998 finished fourth, narrowly missing a bronze.

<HEADLINE> Flyers Start Is Worst for Club </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- At the start of a season that Eric Lindros  
has labeled as crucial, the Philadelphia Flyers have stumbled to 
their worst start in franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
	The star player is searching for answers, the coach is being  
asked about job security and anxiety is increasing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't walk away from this thinking that there isn't a high  
level of anxiety in here,'' Lindros warned Friday. ``There 
certainly is. There's a lot going on here. A lot is at stake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those are ominous words, considering Lindros said before the  
season, ``I want to see the direction that the team goes. I want to 
see what happens this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Translation: Lindros opted for a one-year contract for this  
season instead of a long-term deal. This was not the time for an 
0-4-1 start. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's urgency to win a game,'' said Lindros' linemate, John  
LeClair. 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers, who have lost key forwards Rod Brind'Amour and Keith  
Jones for up to two months with injuries, lost 5-4 in overtime to 
the Montreal Canadiens on Thursday night. It is the first winless 
five-game start in 32 years of the franchise's existence. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss also came one day after team chairman Ed Snider met for  
nearly six hours with general manager Bob Clarke, coach Roger 
Neilson and the front office staff at the team's New Jersey 
training facility. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't be worried about that,'' said Neilson, who replaced  
Wayne Cashman late in the 1997-98 season. ``We've played five games 
in an 82-game schedule.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's impossible to keep the speculation from trickling to the  
locker room. Lindros, who has spoken publicly in support of 
Neilson, said he wouldn't make the case to Clarke or anyone in the 
front office. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't go upstairs,'' Lindros said. ``I don't get involved in  
that. I talk to you guys. I haven't been upstairs in years. And 
never once when I went upstairs was it about something like that. 
That's not my responsibility. We're given a game plan and as 
players, we've got to perform it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers were shut out in their first two losses. Lindros and  
LeClair have regained their scoring touch, but defensive lapses and 
shaky goaltending have become the new culprit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tough situation. Everybody knows it,'' said defenseman  
Eric Desjardins, who is minus-6 in two games and looks sluggish 
after offseason knee surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Neilson scolded his team Friday for the third time in five days  
for its lack of communication and inability to move the puck out of 
its own zone. 
</P>
<P>
	``We weren't happy this morning when we talked to the team,''  
Neilson said. 
</P>
<P>
	But there have been no tantrums yet. At this point, the anger in  
the locker room hasn't degenerated into finger-pointing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you think anybody here likes what's going on?'' LeClair  
said. ``You can't get mad, you've got to do something about it. The 
embarrassment factor alone should be motivation enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clarke met with his scouting staff again Friday and worked the  
phones, trying to find a way to plug the holes with a trade. He 
turned over nearly half the roster with trades last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what to expect,'' Lindros said. ``I don't know  
what he's going to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of a big deal, Clarke simply re-acquired forward Jody  
Hull from the Atlanta Thrashers on Friday for future 
considerations. Hull, chosen by Atlanta in the expansion draft, 
should bolster the Flyers' struggling penalty killing. 
</P>
<P>
	John Vanbiesbrouck, nursing a strained hip, will be back in goal  
tonight in Detroit. Neilson's decision to start rookie Brian 
Boucher backfired Thursday night. Boucher was shaky, allowing three 
goals between his legs in his NHL debut. 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers, desperately needing a victory, haven't won in  
Detroit since Nov. 1988 (0-8-2). 
</P>
<P>
	``It just gets better, doesn't it?'' Lindros said. ``You turn it  
around, break that string and turn over a new leaf. It's got to 
start some time.''

<HEADLINE> Diamond Trade Fuels Africa's Wars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It hardly is a coincidence that bloody African  
civil wars have broken out in Sierra Leone, Congo and Angola: Each 
boasts a rich reserve of diamonds that rebels have exploited to 
finance their quest for power. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright comes face to face Monday  
with the grim legacy of the eight-year war in Sierra Leone when she 
visits a camp housing some of the conflict's victims. It is the 
second stop on her six-country tour of Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	That legacy can be seen in countless lost fingers, hands, lips  
and ears, which reflect the RUF rebel movement's fascination for 
mutilation. Some victims were as young as 3 or 4 years old. 
</P>
<P>
	For Albright, the stop in Sierra Leone easily will be the most  
difficult of her weeklong tour. She also will visit Guinea, Mali, 
Nigeria, Tanzania and Kenya. 
</P>
<P>
	The secretary of state will encourage both sides in Sierra Leone  
to abide by terms of a peace agreement negotiated three months ago. 
One meeting is planned with RUF leaders who oversaw the brutality. 
Susan Rice, Albright's top aide for African affairs, said the 
meeting is necessary because peace in Sierra Leone will be 
impossible if the insurgents are ignored. 
</P>
<P>
	When the RUF, the acronym for Revolutionary United Front, took  
up arms eight years ago, they had just a few hundred men. But as 
they tapped diamond mines in areas under their control, the ensuing 
windfall reached $100 million to $150 million annually, and the 
number of combatants soon rose to 10,000 to 15,000, according to 
U.S. estimates. The diamond trade enabled the RUF to buy weapons as 
well as influence. 
</P>
<P>
	The consequences were catastrophic for the West African nation,  
a former British colony. U.S. officials say almost half the 
population of 4.6 million has been uprooted from their homes -- and 
these are the lucky ones. Thousands more have been killed or maimed 
in RUF attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	As U.S. officials see it, the diamond trade tends to prolong  
conflicts in Sierra Leone and elsewhere on the continent. The 
struggle for justice becomes a struggle to maintain an economic 
enterprise, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	In Sierra Leone's case, diamonds often are transferred to  
neighboring Liberia, then flown to Europe. Much of the RUF's output 
ends up in shops in the United States, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Democratic Republic of Congo, thousands of Zimbabwean  
troops protect rich diamond areas in the southwestern part of the 
country from encroachment by rebel forces fighting the government 
of President Laurent Kabila. Part of the diamond haul is used to 
pay the Zimbabwe military for its protection. 
</P>
<P>
	Instability has kept eastern Congo in turmoil recently because  
the armies of both Rwanda and Uganda have been drawn there by 
diamond deposits. The competition has produced outbreaks of 
fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	Profits from diamonds also have enabled Angola's UNITA rebel  
movement, a Cold War ally of the United States, to persist in its 
24-year civil war. 
</P>
<P>
	UNITA has been able to flout an effort by the United Nations to  
force a peace settlement through economic sanctions. According to 
U.N. estimates, UNITA has earned $4 billion from diamond sales 
since the sanctions took effect in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	David Newsom, a former deputy secretary of state, points out  
that not only are diamonds valuable, but they are often easy to 
transport and hide. 
</P>
<P>
	Newsom said he was told of a Lebanese diamond merchant in Angola  
who moved from place to place with a pet boa constrictor, ``which 
conveniently swallowed and disgorged diamonds on demand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. official who monitors Africa's conflicts says the  
administration hopes to get an international movement under way to 
distinguish between the ``clean'' diamond trade, involving 
countries such as Botswana, Nigeria, Australia and Russia, and the 
``dirty'' one that feeds Africa's conflicts. The latter trade is 
estimated to account for 30 to 40 percent of African production. 
</P>
<P>
	Any such movement would require the cooperation of the De Beers  
diamond conglomerate, which controls about 70 percent of the

<HEADLINE> Perfect To A Tee Wins in Maryland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUREL, Md. (AP) -- Perfect To A Tee came from off the pace, took  
the lead around the final turn and then held off Steak Scam by a 
nose to win the $200,000 Maryland Million Classic on Saturday at 
Laurel Park. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the third straight win for the Linda Albert-trained  
7-year-old, who won for the fourth time this year and has finished 
in the money in eight of 10 starts. 
</P>
<P>
	The 9-to-5 favorite was clocked in 1:56 3-5 for the 1 3-16 miles  
and paid $5.80, $3.80 and $2.80. Steak Scam paid $9.40 and $6.20, 
while Testafly, who was third in the field of 10, paid $4.20 to 
show. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the early favorites, Fred Bear Claw, was a late scratch.  
</P>
<P>
	Praise Heaven and Monk's Falcon traded the lead throughout most  
of the race, with Perfect To A Tee, who has a history of coming 
from off the pace, sitting fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	He made his move heading into the final turn, taking the lead by  
a head, then held off the fast-charging Steak Scam. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the third Maryland Million win for Albert, who won last  
year with long shot Perfect Challenge in the Lassie and Miss 
Angelina in the Distaff Starter. 
</P>
<P>
	It was also the richest win of her 11-year career, which has  
included a pair of $100,000 stakes victories. 
</P>
<P>
	Other winners on the day included Riff in the Steeplechase;  
Tropical Punch in the Distaff Starter; Gin Talking in the Lassie; 
Flippy Diane in the Distaff; Saratoga Friends in the Oaks; Vaguely 
Rich in the Ladies; Darwin in the Nursery; Private Slip in the 
Turf; and Aristotie in the Sprint. 
</P>
<P>
	The Maryland Million was the brainchild of ABC sportscaster Jim  
McKay, and is open only to horses sired by Maryland stallions.

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Treaty a Political Football </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With President Clinton accusing Senate  
Republicans of reckless, blatant partisanship, Democrats are trying 
to stir the rejection of the nuclear test ban treaty into a 2000 
campaign issue. 
</P>
<P>
	But even Clinton had to acknowledge that it may not work. He had  
said earlier that the test ban would not be a huge issue either 
way, and the polls indicate that probably is so. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the end of the Cold War, foreign policy concerns have  
slipped down the list of voter priorities, dominated by issues at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the Senate ``clearly disregarded the views of the  
American people who have consistently and strongly supported this 
treaty ever since it was first pursued by Presidents Eisenhower and 
Kennedy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eisenhower proposed a nuclear test ban in 1958, in a different  
world, challenging the old Soviet Union to agree to stop testing. 
Kennedy signed, and the Senate approved, a limited test ban treaty 
in 1963, barring all but underground nuclear tests by the United 
States and the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty Clinton signed in 1996 and lost in the Senate would  
extend an international ban on atmospheric tests to underground 
testing. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican opponents said the ban couldn't be enforced, and was  
dangerous to future U.S. security. They voted it down 51 to 48 on 
Wednesday, with four Republicans in favor. Ratification would have 
required a two-thirds majority, 67 votes, and Clinton never was 
close to that strength. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a political deal and I hope it will get the treatment  
from the American people it richly deserves,'' the president said 
after the vote he knew he would lose. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also said that the treaty will ultimately be ratified.  
But it obviously won't happen on his watch, with Republicans in 
55-to-45 Senate control through 2000, and therefore in command of 
what is brought up for action. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Democrats tried to challenge that GOP prerogative, and  
delay action on the treaty, they lost, on straight party lines. 
</P>
<P>
	That doesn't kill the treaty outright. Vice President Al Gore  
said rejection was ``an act of almost breathtaking 
irresponsibility.'' He then made it the subject of his first 
campaign television commercial. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe in my heart this vote does not speak for the  
American people,'' the vice president says in the ad. ``So why 
don't we do something about it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	He asked voters for their support in his campaign, and for a  
mandate to send the treaty back to the Senate in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Rival Democrat Bill Bradley also favors the treaty.  
</P>
<P>
	Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican front-runner for 2000, is  
opposed, as are the other GOP candidates. But Bush says he would 
continue the voluntary moratorium on U.S. testing that has been in 
effect since 1992. Britain, France, Russia and, since 1996, China 
also are refraining from testing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Never before has a serious treaty involving nuclear weapons  
been handled in such a reckless and ultimately partisan way,'' 
Clinton said. ``This issue should be beyond politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But campaign politics is the only arena in which the Democrats  
can pursue it now. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., who started the  
process that led to rejection and then couldn't control it, said he 
doubts they can make a winning campaign issue of the treaty because 
Americans know it is flawed. 
</P>
<P>
	Public opinion polls do show overwhelming support for a treaty  
prohibiting nuclear weapons test explosions worldwide -- 82 percent, 
according to a 1999 survey the Democrats cite. But in issue 
surveys, foreign policy in general is cited by only about 5 percent 
of potential voters as a top priority, and the issue of nuclear 
weapons ranks even lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said at his news conference on Thursday that he never  
wanted the treaty to be a political issue, but it might become one 
now that the Republicans have blocked it. 
</P>
<P>
	But he also acknowledged that Americans aren't worried about the  
nuclear threat as they were in the Cold War era. So he said it may 
or may not have an impact on the campaign. He wants it to, although 
he minimized the prospect earlier when he was trying to get the 
Senate vote delayed, to avoid the defeat he knew was coming. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not going to be a huge issue in the election one way  
or the other,'' Clinton said on Oct. 8. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Olerud Gives Mets One More Miracle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- John Olerud provided the New York Mets one more  
miracle in this dramatic season. 
</P>
<P>
	Olerud drove in all of New York's runs, including a two-run  
single in the eighth inning off John Rocker, as the Mets staved off 
elimination in the NL Championship Series with a 3-2 victory 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	New York, which trails the NLCS 3-1, still needs an even bigger  
miracle. No team has ever come back from a 3-0 deficit in baseball 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	But for a Mets' team that has been counted out many times this  
season, that won't be their worry until Game 5 on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	After coming from two games back with three to go to force a  
wild-card playoff, winning that tiebreaker in Cincinnati and 
eliminating Arizona in the division series on Todd Pratt's 
10th-inning homer one week ago, no task seems overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
	Especially after they finally silenced and solved Rocker -- New  
York's Public Enemy No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Rocker saved two of the first three games and hadn't allowed an  
earned run to the Mets all season. He had infuriated New Yorkers by 
saying he hates the Mets, calling their fan ``stupid'' and a 
``tired act.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He had especially been tough on Olerud and Robin Ventura -- New  
York's best left-handed hitters, who were 0-for-14 against the 
Braves' closer. Manager Bobby Valentine even juggled his lineup to 
keep Olerud and Ventura farther apart in response to Rocker. 
</P>
<P>
	That decision paid off in a different way when Olerud came to  
bat against Rocker with runners on first and second and two outs in 
the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	Olerud was 2-for-13 in the series before giving the Mets a 1-0  
lead in the sixth inning with a solo homer. Getting a hit off 
Rocker was another matter. 
</P>
<P>
	He was 0-for-9 in his career against Rocker and looked helpless  
in two strikeouts against him in Atlanta. Olerud, a free agent who 
could have been playing his last game as a Met, made sure his New 
York career would last at least one more day. 
</P>
<P>
	After Roger Cedeno and Melvin Mora pulled off a double steal on  
a 1-1 count, Olerud hit a grounder up the middle that bounced off 
shortstop Ozzie Guillen's glove and rolled into shallow center. 
</P>
<P>
	Cedeno and Mora scored easily, with Mora jumping for joy as he  
crossed the plate with the winning run for the second time in two 
weeks. He scored the winning run on a wild pitch in the ninth 
inning to give the Mets a 2-1 win over Pittsburgh on the final day 
of the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	Like that run, this one also extended New York's season at least  
another day. They'll need more miracles to keep it going after 
that.

<HEADLINE> Bill Loaded With Home Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- While battling over the budget on other  
fronts, Republicans and President Clinton agreed on a $99 billion 
measure for veterans, housing and space programs that also is 
loaded with hundreds of projects for lawmakers' home districts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate voted 93-5 to send the bill to Clinton on Friday, a  
day after the House approved it. But with other spending fights 
raging, another stopgap bill will be needed next week to keep 
federal agencies open, and White House officials indicated that 
Clinton would sign one. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders insist they are guided by a desire to  
constrain federal spending, but the veterans-housing measure 
suggests that other forces are afoot as well. It distributes 
hundreds of millions of dollars for home-district projects across 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
	It takes nearly six pages of fine print in the Congressional  
Record to list the measure's community development projects, just 
one of several categories of spending directed to specific sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Included is $1.5 million for a loan fund to help Oklahoma City  
recover from the 1995 bombing of its federal building; $250,000 for 
Virginia Beach to expand its marine science museum; $300,000 to 
restore a historic boiler house in Cresson, Pa.; and $400,000 to 
build a memorial in Springfield, Mass., for native son Theodor 
Geisel, better known as Dr. Seuss, who died in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill once faced a veto threat, but that vanished after  
Republicans agreed to add $7 billion above what the House 
originally approved. In the end, NASA, the Environmental Protection 
Agency and veterans' health-care got even more than Clinton 
initially requested, and the GOP dropped plans to cut some 
low-income housing programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure is the 10th of the 13 annual spending bills for  
fiscal 2000, which began Oct. 1. Clinton has vetoed one financing 
the District of Columbia, and is poised to veto a second covering 
foreign aid. 
</P>
<P>
	Three others are still working through Congress in the face of  
veto threats, covering the departments of Labor, Health and Human 
Services, Education, Interior, Commerce, Justice, State, and some 
smaller agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Underlining the remaining tensions, House Appropriations  
Committee Chairman Bill Young, R-Fla., accused Democrats of 
withdrawing commitments to support a final $14 billion Interior 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it was part of a ``blatant partisan move'' to blame  
Republicans for failing to quickly finish spending work. Democrats 
said they had not made such commitments for a bill they said has 
anti-environmental provisions and lacks enough money. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders want to send Clinton all the bills by next  
Thursday, when a measure keeping agencies temporarily open expires. 
They believe this would bolster their argument that if another 
stopgap extension is needed, it is only because Clinton vetoed 
bills he felt did not spend enough. 
</P>
<P>
	It is all but certain that some of the spending measures won't  
be finished by Thursday night. GOP leaders contemplate a second 
extension that would last a week or more. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no intent to shut the government down, not on our  
part, not on the president's part,'' said House Speaker Dennis 
Hastert, R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart signaled that Clinton would  
sign another extension if lawmakers ``come back here and if they 
can make a credible case about why they need an extra week to 
finish the work.''

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Cancels Football Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Hurricane Irene probably won't force  
the Jacksonville Jaguars to postpone their game Sunday against the 
Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	But team vice president Michael Huyghue said the NFL was  
monitoring the weather in North Florida, and had contingency plans 
to move the game to later in the afternoon, or to Monday night, if 
extreme conditions existed. 
</P>
<P>
	The weather forced the Browns to travel to Jacksonville late  
Friday, instead of Saturday, which is their normal travel day. The 
storm was just off the east coast of Florida, about 200 miles south 
of Jacksonville, at midday Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the winds should be clear of Jacksonville by the  
scheduled 1 p.m., EDT kickoff Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Two college football games, one involving No. 24 Miami, and two  
major thoroughbred races were postponed Friday because of the 
weather. 
</P>
<P>
	The Miami Hurricanes rescheduled Saturday's game with Temple  
because the Owls had trouble getting a flight to South Florida. The 
game will be played Dec. 4. 
</P>
<P>
	Bethune-Cookman College postponed its game against South  
Carolina State in Daytona Beach. The game, scheduled for Saturday 
night, will be played Thursday night.

<HEADLINE>  New Pakistan Regime Targets Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Pakistani army officers combed bank  
records and questioned travelers at airports Saturday after the new 
military regime made economic revival and the hunt for looted 
wealth its top priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	The search for illicit assets was the first act of the regime,  
which ousted the elected government Tuesday, announced emergency 
rule and proclaimed army chief Pervaiz Musharraf as the supreme 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Musharraf canceled a promised television address Saturday that  
was expected to outline an interim government. His spokesman did 
not say when the speech would be rescheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	In the city of Lahore on Saturday, police raided a sugar factory  
owned by the family of ousted prime minister Nawaz Sharif and 
hauled away boxes of documents and checks. 
</P>
<P>
	The military sent out orders Friday freezing hundreds of bank  
accounts owned by politicians, and banning the politicians from 
leaving the country.. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are happy with the effort to recover the nation's looted  
wealth, but in return we hope that there will be real 
accountability and not just an eyewash,'' said Sarfaraz Shahid, 
manager of an Allied Bank branch in the northeastern city of 
Lahore. 
</P>
<P>
	In a meeting of his senior officers, Musharraf said ``economic  
revival, accountability and ensuring national integration'' topped 
his agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, U.S. Ambassador William Milam delivered to Musharraf  
a message from President Clinton that the United States wants to 
see a rapid return to civilian rule, an embassy spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said  
Milam failed to win a commitment for an early restoration of 
civilian rule. He admitted the United States had little leverage 
over Pakistan, which is already under sanctions imposed last year 
after Islamabad tested a nuclear bomb. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. military leaders view Musharraf as pro-Western and capable  
of controlling the country's nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	The 15-nation European Union, meanwhile, threatened to halt aid  
to Pakistan unless it produces a plan to restore democracy by Nov. 
15. The United States has said it will impose new sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	At military headquarters in Rawalpindi, Musharraf met the  
Japanese ambassador Saturday, the latest in a series of contacts 
with diplomats in hope of establishing some tolerance for his 
military regime. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistanis are wary of the military, which has ruled the country  
for 25 of its 52-year history, but they have generally welcomed the 
ouster of an unpopular prime minister and his corrupt 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	At several of the nation's banks, uniformed officers sat  
alongside bank officials scouring mounds of records. Among the 
accounts frozen were those of Sharif and his family, and his 
predecessor Benazir Bhutto. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharif has been under arrest but it was not known where he was  
being kept. Bhutto has stayed outside Pakistan since Sharif's 
government began a corruption probe against her.

<HEADLINE>  New Pakistan Regime Targets Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Pakistani army officers combed bank  
records and questioned travelers at airports Saturday after the new 
military regime made economic revival and the hunt for looted 
wealth its top priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	The search for illicit assets was the first act of the regime,  
which ousted the elected government Tuesday, announced emergency 
rule and proclaimed army chief Pervaiz Musharraf as the supreme 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Musharraf canceled a promised television address Saturday that  
was expected to outline an interim government. His spokesman did 
not say when the speech would be rescheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	In the city of Lahore on Saturday, police raided a sugar factory  
owned by the family of ousted prime minister Nawaz Sharif and 
hauled away boxes of documents and checks. 
</P>
<P>
	The military sent out orders Friday freezing hundreds of bank  
accounts owned by politicians, and banning the politicians from 
leaving the country.. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are happy with the effort to recover the nation's looted  
wealth, but in return we hope that there will be real 
accountability and not just an eyewash,'' said Sarfaraz Shahid, 
manager of an Allied Bank branch in the northeastern city of 
Lahore. 
</P>
<P>
	In a meeting of his senior officers, Musharraf said ``economic  
revival, accountability and ensuring national integration'' topped 
his agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, U.S. Ambassador William Milam delivered to Musharraf  
a message from President Clinton that the United States wants to 
see a rapid return to civilian rule, an embassy spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said  
Milam failed to win a commitment for an early restoration of 
civilian rule. He admitted the United States had little leverage 
over Pakistan, which is already under sanctions imposed last year 
after Islamabad tested a nuclear bomb. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. military leaders view Musharraf as pro-Western and capable  
of controlling the country's nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	The 15-nation European Union, meanwhile, threatened to halt aid  
to Pakistan unless it produces a plan to restore democracy by Nov. 
15. The United States has said it will impose new sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	At military headquarters in Rawalpindi, Musharraf met the  
Japanese ambassador Saturday, the latest in a series of contacts 
with diplomats in hope of establishing some tolerance for his 
military regime. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistanis are wary of the military, which has ruled the country  
for 25 of its 52-year history, but they have generally welcomed the 
ouster of an unpopular prime minister and his corrupt 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	At several of the nation's banks, uniformed officers sat  
alongside bank officials scouring mounds of records. Among the 
accounts frozen were those of Sharif and his family, and his 
predecessor Benazir Bhutto. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharif has been under arrest but it was not known where he was  
being kept. Bhutto has stayed outside Pakistan since Sharif's 
government began a corruption probe against her. 
</P>
<P>
	At least a dozen people, including a Cabinet minister and aides  
of the prime minister, have been detained since the coup. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan's black money -- unreported and untaxed income -- is  
estimated by some analysts at nearly $3.5 billion.

<HEADLINE> House Lawmaker Touts Charters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- While a federal role cannot be denied,  
education in America must return to its local foundations to 
protect the nation's future, a Republican congressional expert on 
education said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Local supervision of schools has been the hallmark and promise  
of American education,'' Rep. Bill Goodling said in the weekly GOP 
radio address. 
</P>
<P>
	``The federal government must aid in those efforts by providing  
special assistance for the disadvantaged, ensuring equal access to 
a quality education'' and gathering information about conditions 
that cross state borders,'' said Goodling, chairman of the House 
Committee on Education and the Workforce. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodling, R-Pa., said the Republican-controlled Congress is  
working on an overhaul of the main government school program, the 
$13.9 billion Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Its current 
target is to amend the act's Title I, which aims to provide quality 
education for poor children. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since Title I's inception in 1965,'' Goodling said, ``the  
federal government has poured $120 billion into the program. Yet 
the achievement gap between disadvantaged children and other 
students in our schools continues unabated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He urged Congress to pass a bill coming up for a House vote this  
week that would make it easier for poor children to leave 
inadequate schools in their neighborhoods so they can attend better 
schools elsewhere. The bill cleared Goodling's committee last week 
by a 42-6 vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every American child deserves a quality education,'' Goodling  
said. ``We're not talking about Democrat, Republican or Independent 
children. We're talking about all of our children, who are the 
future of this country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would provide money to allow parents of poor children  
to either a better public school or charter school. Money would be 
available to transport them. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodling said the law would help more children attend such  
schools as the Edison-Friendship Charter School in Washington, ``a 
remarkable school in the shadow of the Capitol's dome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charters are public schools, often organized by parents and  
community business leaders, that receive special leeway from most 
regulations as long as their pupils perform at a higher educational 
level. 
</P>
<P>
	Edison-Friendship is a year-old 924-student school with a  
waiting list of 500. It offers character education, an eight-hour 
school day, shorter summer vacations and a home computer for each 
child once their parents receive computer training. 
</P>
<P>
	By its first anniversary in September, students' test scores had  
doubled, Goodling said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also praised a second plan to give states and all public  
schools more flexibility in spending federal money in exchange for 
proven student achievement. Goodling's committee also was passed 
that plan on a party-line vote, and it too is moving to the House. 
Opposed by Democrats for its lack of control over federal money, it 
faces the threat of a veto by President Clinton.

<HEADLINE> Expensive Road Ahead for Democrats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Democratic presidential campaign is  
threatening to become a long, costly battle that could leave the 
eventual nominee broke and politically weakened. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore's slide, rival Bill Bradley's advantage  
in fund raising and a highly competitive primary calendar all point 
toward a race that could last deep into the spring. Interviews with 
a dozen Democrats inside and outside the campaigns suggest Gore 
remains the party favorite, but Bradley holds appeal in many early 
voting states. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gore is likely to win, but it's not going to be an elevating  
experience,'' said Democratic consultant Geoff Garin, who is not in 
either camp. 
</P>
<P>
	It all starts, as it always does, in Iowa and eight days later  
in New Hampshire -- where momentum seized by a candidate is more 
important than the small number of delegates awarded by state 
parties. 
</P>
<P>
	In Iowa, Gore holds a double-digit lead in polls over the former  
New Jersey senator. Though Bradley has narrowed the gap, both 
campaigns expect the vice president's institutional advantages -- 
such the AFL-CIO's endorsement -- to give him the edge on Jan. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Then comes New Hampshire on Feb. 1  
</P>
<P>
	Bradley has rallied to pull even, and the vice president is  
running scared. He will be in the state for most of the next two 
weeks, preparing for a forum with Bradley at month's end. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, consultants say, the edge goes to Bradley. Who wins may  
not matter as much as who exceeds expectations and heads into the 
delegate-rich section of the calendar with momentum. 
</P>
<P>
	The current schedule, which Democratic leaders are tinkering  
with, has no delegates awarded between Feb. 1 and March 7. That 
would give the New Hamsphire winner five weeks to ride the tide of 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen states and American Samoa have scheduled primaries and  
caucuses March 7. More than 1,300 delegate votes will be up for 
grabs, 61 percent of the 2,169 needed to win the nomination under 
current assumptions. 
</P>
<P>
	The day was tailor-made for Bradley, whose strong ties to the  
Northeast date to his Hall of Fame career as a professional 
basketball player with the New York Knicks. Connecticut, Maine, 
Maryland, Massachusetts, New York and Rhode Island are leaning 
toward Bradley, consultants say. 
</P>
<P>
	He also is strong in Minnesota and his home state of Missouri,  
they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the remaining states, only California's 367 delegates and  
Ohio's 146 delegates pack a punch. Gore holds a 5-2 lead over 
Bradley in the Golden State and must maintain it. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Gore ends up losing in both California and New York, it's  
not necessarily a fatal blow. But it's pretty close to it,'' Garin 
said. The flip side, consultants say, is that the race could end 
March 7 if Gore wins New Hampshire, New York and California. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, it's advantage Gore,'' said Los Angeles consultant  
Bill Carrick, a Gore ally. ``But this is a trendy place where votes 
can move really fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With 41 percent of the delegate votes awarded through March 7,  
Gore and Bradley would spend the next week battling in Utah (edge 
to Bradley), Nevada (edge to Gore), Colorado (toss-up) and a few 
other states before a Southern showdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Up next, March 14: Bradley's day of reckoning. If Bradley had a  
good week, this is Gore's chance for a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president is from Tennessee and enjoys 3-to-1 support  
among blacks, two advantages that could give him a sweep of the 
day's six states -- Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, 
Tennessee and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley plans to pick one state to focus his resources, hoping  
to stall Gore's momentum. His top aides have worked in Mississippi, 
and Bradley is within 12 percentage points of Gore in Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Begala, a Democratic consultant and Gore ally, said Bradley  
will run out of oxygen after the March 7 primaries, which are 
stocked with high-salaried, well-educated voters who tell pollsters 
they favor Bradley over Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	With little support from labor or minority voters, Bradley will  
not feel as welcome among Southern Democrats, Begala said. 
``Bradley is down now to Chablis drinkers and Brie eaters and Volvo 
drivers,'' he said. ``Those are wonderful Democrats, but you've got 
to have some beer drinkers or you don't get the nomination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two-thirds of the delegates will be pledged through March 14,  
awarded proportionally based on the candidates' showing in 
congressional districts and statewide. If Bradley wins New 
Hampshire, sweeps the Northeast, loses California and is swept by 
Gore on March 14, the delegate count at this point could still be 
roughly even. 
</P>
<P>
	Consultants say it could be a slugfest after March 15, with the  
advantage going to Gore because of his support among party leaders. 
He should get a lion's share of the 799 ``super delegates'' -- 
elected officials and party leaders whose votes are not tied to 
primary results. 
</P>
<P>
	One wild card may be Bradley's larger-than-expected campaign  
treasury. Gore's free-spending ways continue this week with a 
$440,000 ad campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The worst-case scenario for Democrats: The primary fight for  
liberal voters drags into May or June. If the GOP contest is 
settled sooner, the Republican nominee would get a head start 
courting general election voters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gore will be the ultimate nominee, but he will be defined way  
to the left of mainstream -- out of money and short on ideas,'' said 
GOP consultant Scott Reed. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed managed the 1996 campaign of Republican nominee Bob Dole,  
who staggered out of the primary -- broke and easily cast by 
President Clinton as a pawn of extremists in his party. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats do not want to repeat that history.

<HEADLINE> NAACP OKs Tourism Boycott of S.C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LINTHICUM, Md. (AP) -- The NAACP's national board on Saturday  
approved a tourism boycott of South Carolina until the state 
removes the Confederate flag from the Statehouse dome. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ratification officially mobilizes all of our chapters and  
members to not visit or spend dollars in South Carolina until the 
flag is removed,'' said NAACP spokeswoman Sheila Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Gov. Jim Hodges said the boycott decision will  
make it harder to get a compromise to resolve the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Nina Brook also criticized the House, and Republican Speaker  
David Wilkins for the failure to get a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	``A very real obstacle remains, a majority in the House who say  
they will not vote for a compromise, and the speaker of the House 
who says he will not vote for a compromise,'' Brook said. 
</P>
<P>
	The House rejected a compromise to move the flag to a  
Confederate monument on the Statehouse grounds several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have not seen a significant change or shift in the House's  
position on that,'' Wilkins said. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters say the flag it represents Southern heritage and  
honors South Carolinians who died in the Civil War. The NAACP says 
it is a symbol of racism. 
</P>
<P>
	The South Carolina branch of the National Association for the  
Advancement of Colored People proposed the tourism boycott of the 
state in July. It would begin Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The NAACP's national leaders say they are working to make sure  
South Carolina will feel economic pain from the national boycott. 
</P>
<P>
	More than $280 million a year that African-American travelers  
spend in South Carolina could be at stake. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know that economic sanctions work,'' said Lonnie Randolph  
Jr., chairman of the NAACP's programs and research committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Several groups from across the nation have already canceled  
plans to hold meetings and conventions in South Carolina since the 
NAACP called for the boycott. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, the Seventh-day Adventist Church canceled a  
meeting that would have brought 7,000 people to Columbia for four 
days in March. Officials said the event would have brought $500,000 
worth of tourism business. 
</P>
<P>
	The flag controversy has embroiled South Carolina for years. The  
state is the only one in the nation to fly the Confederate flag 
over its Statehouse, although Georgia and Mississippi incorporate 
part of the design into their state flags. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the state NAACP office in Columbia said 42 state  
and national groups have now joined the boycott, either canceling 
meetings or holding them out of state.

<HEADLINE> Virus Found in Bird Far From NYC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The encephalitis virus that has killed six  
people and infected 55 others in the New York City area has been 
found in a dead bird 150 miles north of Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	State Health Department officials, however, said Friday the risk  
of upstate residents contracting the West Nile-like virus is 
minimal. No human encephalitis cases have been reported upstate. 
</P>
<P>
	The virus, which is carried by mosquitos, was found in a dead  
crow collected earlier this month in the Saratoga County village of 
Ballston Spa and in a cuckoo found at the U.S. Military Academy at 
West Point, 40 miles north of Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials urged upstate residents to take precautions against  
mosquito bites until freezing weather further decimates the bug 
population. 
</P>
<P>
	Finding birds with the virus upstate doesn't mean the  
encephalitis outbreak is spreading broadly, said health department 
spokesman John Signor. The birds may have become disoriented 
because of the virus and flown north instead of south, he said.

<HEADLINE> Pope John Paul II Marks 21st Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VATICAN CITY (AP) -- Pope John Paul II began perhaps the  
most-anticipated year of his papacy on Saturday: his 22nd as pope, 
when he will lead the Catholic Church into its third millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	Congratulations poured in from heads of state on the anniversary  
of Karol Wojtyla's Oct. 16, 1978, election to what would prove the 
longest papal service of this century. 
</P>
<P>
	Premier Massimo D'Alema lauded the 79-year-old pope's ``untiring  
dedication ... in spreading the message of peace and goodwill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Italian media recalled the prediction of John Paul's late mentor  
on the night fellow cardinals elevated the then-Krakow archbishop 
to the papacy. ``You will guide the church into the third 
millennium,'' Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski declared at that time. 
</P>
<P>
	John Paul in recent years has asked believers to pray for him so  
he would meet that goal. 
</P>
<P>
	The church's Holy Year calendar takes note of his 80th birthday  
on May 18, 2000. The Vatican plans for John Paul to make near-daily 
appearances over the millennial year. 
</P>
<P>
	John Paul already is the most-traveled of any pope -- 88 pastoral  
voyages outside of Italy -- and has proclaimed more saints than any 
other: 284. 
</P>
<P>
	In statistics cited by the Vatican on Saturday, the pope in his  
21 years has created 157 cardinals, written 13 encyclicals, 
convened 14 synods, and greeted an estimated 14 million faithful in 
his general audiences.

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Treaty a Political Football </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With President Clinton accusing Senate  
Republicans of reckless, blatant partisanship, Democrats are trying 
to stir the rejection of the nuclear test ban treaty into a 2000 
campaign issue. 
</P>
<P>
	But even Clinton had to acknowledge that it may not work. He had  
said earlier that the test ban would not be a huge issue either 
way, and the polls indicate that probably is so. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the end of the Cold War, foreign policy concerns have  
slipped down the list of voter priorities, dominated by issues at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the Senate ``clearly disregarded the views of the  
American people who have consistently and strongly supported this 
treaty ever since it was first pursued by Presidents Eisenhower and 
Kennedy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eisenhower proposed a nuclear test ban in 1958, in a different  
world, challenging the old Soviet Union to agree to stop testing. 
Kennedy signed, and the Senate approved, a limited test ban treaty 
in 1963, barring all but underground nuclear tests by the United 
States and the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty Clinton signed in 1996 and lost in the Senate would  
extend an international ban on atmospheric tests to underground 
testing. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican opponents said the ban couldn't be enforced, and was  
dangerous to future U.S. security. They voted it down 51 to 48 on 
Wednesday, with four Republicans in favor. Ratification would have 
required a two-thirds majority, 67 votes, and Clinton never was 
close to that strength. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a political deal and I hope it will get the treatment  
from the American people it richly deserves,'' the president said 
after the vote he knew he would lose. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also said that the treaty will ultimately be ratified.  
But it obviously won't happen on his watch, with Republicans in 
55-to-45 Senate control through 2000, and therefore in command of 
what is brought up for action. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Democrats tried to challenge that GOP prerogative, and  
delay action on the treaty, they lost, on straight party lines. 
</P>
<P>
	That doesn't kill the treaty outright. Vice President Al Gore  
said rejection was ``an act of almost breathtaking 
irresponsibility.'' He then made it the subject of his first 
campaign television commercial. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe in my heart this vote does not speak for the  
American people,'' the vice president says in the ad. ``So why 
don't we do something about it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	He asked voters for their support in his campaign, and for a  
mandate to send the treaty back to the Senate in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Rival Democrat Bill Bradley also favors the treaty.  
</P>
<P>
	Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican front-runner for 2000, is  
opposed, as are the other GOP candidates. But Bush says he would 
continue the voluntary moratorium on U.S. testing that has been in 
effect since 1992. Britain, France, Russia and, since 1996, China 
also are refraining from testing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Never before has a serious treaty involving nuclear weapons  
been handled in such a reckless and ultimately partisan way,'' 
Clinton said. ``This issue should be beyond politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But campaign politics is the only arena in which the Democrats  
can pursue it now. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., who started the  
process that led to rejection and then couldn't control it, said he 
doubts they can make a winning campaign issue of the treaty because 
Americans know it is flawed. 
</P>
<P>
	Public opinion polls do show overwhelming support for a treaty  
prohibiting nuclear weapons test explosions worldwide -- 82 percent, 
according to a 1999 survey the Democrats cite. But in issue 
surveys, foreign policy in general is cited by only about 5 percent 
of potential voters as a top priority, and the issue of nuclear 
weapons ranks even lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said at his news conference on Thursday that he never  
wanted the treaty to be a political issue, but it might become one 
now that the Republicans have blocked it. 
</P>
<P>
	But he also acknowledged that Americans aren't worried about the  
nuclear threat as they were in the Cold War era. So he said it may

<HEADLINE> Rocket Rocketed Out of Fenway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Can't win the big one, that's what they say here  
about Roger Clemens. 
</P>
<P>
	Couldn't win it during 11 seasons with the Boston Red Sox, can't  
win it now with the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	He has five Cy Young Awards, but no World Series rings, the only  
gem he says he ever really wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	From Clemens' very first batter Saturday, it was a party at  
Fenway Park, and he was the pinata as Red Sox fans celebrated a 
13-1 victory that pulled them to 2-1 in the AL Championship Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``My emotions were under control,'' Clemens insisted, repeatedly  
saying this game was no different than any other. ``I always want 
to pitch well. Makes no difference if it's here or there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But some in the Yankees' clubhouse weren't so sure.  
</P>
<P>
	``He shuts things out, but I think the crowd may have affected  
him,'' Yankees pitching coach Mel Sottlemyre said. 
</P>
<P>
	They booed when Clemens warmed up in the bullpen, a passionate  
angry roar directed toward one of their own who had defected and 
joined their enemy. 
</P>
<P>
	They booed again when he walked out to the mound, already deep  
in shadows as brilliant autumn sunshine lighted up the old 
grandstands, filled with fans longing for their team's first World 
Series title since 1918. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rog-ger, Rog-er'' they sang again and again, a slow singsong  
designed to make sure he appreciated the magnitude of their 
disdain. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it got into his head,'' Boston's Nomar  
Garciaparra said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans even tried to claw at the canvas tribute to his two  
20-strikeout games for Boston, attached to a brick wall outside the 
Red Sox clubhouse. It was shredded near the bottom, even with four 
policemen standing guard. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was locked in pretty good,'' Clemens said. ``Anytime you're  
in a visiting stadium, it's going to be loud, so you are used to 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just two pitches in, the booing abruptly ended, replaced by  
cheers as Jose Offerman's leadoff drive sailed over the head of 
Paul O'Neill in right, caroming off the low fence and back toward 
the infield as Offerman sped to third. 
</P>
<P>
	Five pitches later, John Valentin lofted the ball toward the  
Green Monster and out it went, over the 37-foot fence and into the 
23-foot screen, even deeper than Bucky Dent's famous drive 21 years 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Some fans were still walking in, and already Clemens was behind  
2-0. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt great,'' Clemens said. ``In the bullpen everything went  
pretty well. My velocity was pretty good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd felt even better.  
</P>
<P>
	``Rog-ger, Rog-er'' they kept singing as he finally retired the  
side. 
</P>
<P>
	Then in the second came a double by Trot Nixon, a single by  
Offerman, an RBI grounder by Valentin and a run-scoring double by 
Garciaparra. By then, Hideki Irabu was starting to warm up in the 
bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Stanley started the third with a single, and Clemens threw  
a first-pitch strike to Brian Daubach, his 61st pitch of the 
afternoon. It turned out to be his last. 
</P>
<P>
	As Clemens gave manager Joe Torre the ball and walked off the  
mound, back to the Yankees' dugout on the third-base side, the fans 
started booing, wanting to leave him with the sound of their hate 
in his ears. 
</P>
<P>
	``No sense in using him all the way up,'' Torre said.  
</P>
<P>
	To fans, the 247-134 regular-season record and 3,316 strikeouts  
don't matter. They remember that he went 1-2 in nine postseason 
starts for Boston, and that new hero Pedro Martinez, who struck out 
12 and allowed just two hits in seven shutout innings Saturday, 
already is 3-0 in his career during the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've thrown the ball well in postseason play,'' Clemens said  
when asked about the disparity. 
</P>
<P>
	Seconds after they started booing Clemens again, what had  
happened suddenly struck them. They started cheering for Boston, a 
loud release that reverberated out to Kenmore Square and on to the 
Back Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens' line read: five runs, six hits, just two innings  
pitched. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly he was disappointed, but it wasn't as if he was on  
suicide watch after the game,'' New York's David Cone said, looking 
ahead to a possible start by Clemens if a Game 7 is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	By the seventh inning, when the score reached 13-0, the chant  
had changed to, ``Where is Roger?'' A full half-hour after the 
game, a couple hundred people were still by Boston's dugout, still 
chanting. 
</P>
<P>
	For once, Red Sox fans dreamed the dream and it came true.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Coyote Reichel Signs Overseas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) -- Forward Robert Reichel has signed  
a two-year contract with HC Litvinov of his native Czech Republic 
after failing to get a deal from the Phoenix Coyotes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't intend to be idle all season,'' Reichel told the Mlada  
Fronta Dnes newspaper on Saturday. ``I want to play hockey and I 
haven't reached an agreement with any NHL club.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reichel, who earned $1.7 million last season, has been seeking a  
multiyear contract for more than $3 million a season. He has 
repeatedly said he would not return to the NHL if his expectations 
were not met. 
</P>
<P>
	Reichel has already started the season in his native Litvinov,  
scoring five goals in seven games. Under the new contract, he can 
leave for the NHL if he gets a suitable offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Reichel was traded to Phoenix from the New York Islanders in  
March and became a restricted free agent at the end of the last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	He has chosen Europe over the NHL before. After consecutive  
40-goal seasons with Calgary and scoring at a 40-goal pace in the 
strike-shortened 1994-95 season, he reached a contract impasse with 
the Flames. The following season he played in the German Hockey 
League with the Frankfurt Lions. 
</P>
<P>
	He returned to Calgary in 1996-97 and signed a three-year deal  
that expired at the end of the last season. 
</P>
<P>
	He has scored 209 goals in the NHL.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Doctor Leaves South Pole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand (AP) -- Researchers wearing frosty  
beards and red coats bid a joyful goodbye Saturday to an American 
doctor with a lump in her breast as a plane rescued her from their 
South Pole research station. 
</P>
<P>
	As the special, ski-equipped U.S. military plane taxied slowly  
to avoid creating propeller-driven storms of ice granules before 
taking off, the crew aboard saw ``waves, thumbs up'' from members 
of the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Research Station. 
</P>
<P>
	``People were just really pleased we were able to get in and get  
her out,'' said Col. Graham Pritchard, senior commander of the 
rescue team from the New York Air National Guard's 109th Airlift 
Wing. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Jerri Nielsen, a 47-year-old mother of three, was inspected  
by physicians after the flight from the pole to McMurdo base on 
Antarctica's coast. 
</P>
<P>
	She then flew to Christchurch, in southern New Zealand, where  
she was booked on a flight to Auckland, airport officials said on 
condition of anonymity. Auckland is the country's main 
international gateway. I 
</P>
<P>
	t was believed she would then head home to the United States,  
but military and U.S National Science Foundation officials refused 
to discuss her movements. The 41 researchers at the station were 
from the science foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	Nielsen's rescue from the coldest place on Earth was possible  
only after the Antarctic winter relented slightly, making it warm 
enough -- 58 degrees below zero -- to risk the flight. Even so, in 
temperatures lower than minus-56, the plane's hydraulic systems -- 
critical to its ability to land and take off -- become hard to 
handle. 
</P>
<P>
	``The risk factor was eight or nine out of 10,'' said pilot Maj.  
George R. McAllister. ``It was at the limits of the operational 
ability of the plane.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The very thing that brought the warmer weather also reduced  
visibility,'' U.S. Air Force spokesman Capt. Victor Hines said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nielsen, from Youngstown, Ohio, discovered a lump in her breast  
in June after the darkness, swirling snow and ultra-cold 
temperatures of the Antarctic winter had closed in, sealing off the 
Amundsen-Scott research station and its inhabitants to the outside 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	She was the only doctor among staff at the domed research  
station and had been treating herself with chemotherapy since July, 
when medical supplies were dropped to her in another daring mercy 
mission. 
</P>
<P>
	Nielsen was unavailable for comment following her rescue, shying  
away from the international media attention focused on her rescue. 
</P>
<P>
	``She has become a public figure through circumstance and not  
through choice,'' National Science Foundation director Rita Colwell 
said in a written statement, asking the media to respect Nielsen's 
privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Before she noticed the lump, Nielsen would regale her parents  
with letters about her friendships at the research station and the 
need to do just about everything -- even performing emergency dental 
work. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the rescue operation was possibly the earliest  
ever post-winter flight to the South Pole. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane carried extra fuel for the six-hour, 1,600-mile round  
trip from McMurdo, giving it the capacity to circle over the pole 
if visibility was too poor to land. The precaution, however, proved 
unnecessary.

<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Al Unser Jr. is likely to soon be  
joining the IRL. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Galles, owner of Galles Racing, said the final details are  
being hammered out for a reunion with Unser, with whom he won the 
1992 Indianapolis 500. The pair were together for nearly seven 
years before Unser went with Roger Penske in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Unser, meanwhile, is calling it a done deal. He's told people in  
Australia, where he's racing in CART's Honda 300, that he's signed 
a five-year deal to drive in the IRL with Galles and sponsor 
Valvoline. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am very exciting about the possibility of Al joining us next  
year,'' Galles said. ``We will most likely be prepared to make an 
announcement at the end of this month.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not wanting to divert attention from the season-ending Mall.com  
500, Galles said a date for the announcement could come as soon as 
Monday. Galles said he'll retain current driver Davey Hamilton in 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	NOT SWITCHING: Scott Sharp is staying with Kelley Racing.  
</P>
<P>
	Sharp had been rumored to be joining a Winston Cup team A.J.  
Foyt is forming next year. Instead, he's re-upped with Kelley 
Racing through 2001 and sponsor Delphi Automotive Systems also has 
agreed to stick around that long. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am looking forward to accomplishing our team's many goals in  
the years to come,'' said Sharp, winner of the Kobalt Tools 500 in 
July. 
</P>
<P>
	Team co-owner Tom Kelley said he and Delphi would consider  
moving to Winston Cup if they thought it could be profitable. 
Although they're researching it, they remain committed to the IRL. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel that a long-term relationship with Scott Sharp is in  
our team's best interest,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Delphi also announced an associate sponsorship of the IRL car  
driven by Mark Dismore, another Kelley racer. 
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	MAKING AMENDS: Sitting together at a post-qualifying news  
conference, Greg Ray apologized to Mark Dismore for some harsh 
words uttered after Dismore banged into him at the IRL's last race, 
in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	Dismore prompted Ray's public apology by reminding him that he  
had something to say. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was upset when it happened,'' Ray explained. ``I spoke to  
Mark after the race, we sat down and determined what had happened. 
We determined it was his spotter's fault. We understand there was 
no malicious intent in any way on his part.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So who is spotting for Dismore on Sunday?  
</P>
<P>
	``The same guy,'' he said, laughing. ``But he's gotten a  
lecture.'' 
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	MORE AERODYNAMIC: Sam Schmidt's long sideburns are gone and the  
Las Vegas chapter of Speedway Children's Charities is better off 
for it. 
</P>
<P>
	A member of the IRL's official fan organization challenged  
Schmidt to get a trim. Schmidt turned it into a fundraiser, getting 
$500 donations from Greg Ray, Scott Goodyear and several other 
drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmidt's goal of $3,000 was easily beaten.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a great cause,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Doctors in Timor Respond To Nobel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LIQUICA, East Timor (AP) -- In the latest trouble spot where  
Doctors Without Borders teams are at work, its medical personnel on 
the ground were too busy to spend much time celebrating their 
group's winning of the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize. 
</P>
<P>
	In a sweltering, makeshift clinic in the town of Liquica, 25  
miles west of the East Timor capital of Dili, a young French doctor 
wiped sweat from his brow between tending today to a steady stream 
of patients: a baby with malaria, a teen-age boy badly bruised from 
what he said was a beating by militiamen, a toddler with a 
suspected case of tuberculosis. 
</P>
<P>
	``So many people here need help,'' said Jean-Olivier Guintran, a  
31-year-old physician from Marseilles who arrived three weeks ago 
as part of a 30-member team from the group. ``The prize, it's very 
nice, but it's the patients that matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Medecins Sans Frontieres, as the group is called in French, is  
one of more than a dozen private relief agencies to rush to East 
Timor, the scene of a humanitarian crisis in the aftermath of an 
Aug. 30 referendum in which East Timorese voted overwhelmingly in 
favor of independence from Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote triggered a violent rampage by anti-independence  
militia groups, causing tens of thousands of East Timorese to seek 
shelter in the rugged forest. An estimated 250,000 either fled or 
were driven out of the territory, with most ending up at refugee 
camps in neighboring West Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	An Australian-led peacekeeping force now numbering nearly 8,000  
troops entered the territory Sept. 20 to restore order, but it has 
not yet spread out through the entire province. 
</P>
<P>
	Militias continue to mount a stubborn resistance; a firefight  
today with a reconnaissance team from the international force left 
three of the paramilitary fighters dead, the peacekeepers said. 
</P>
<P>
	As the foreign forces assert control, refugees are trickling  
down from the mountains, where some hid out from the militias for 
weeks. They are suffering from a range of ailments, some readily 
treatable, others much more serious, medical workers say. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are seeing lots of problems related to bad sanitation and  
living out in the open -- skin rashes, respiratory infections, 
diarrhea -- but also diseases like malaria and tuberculosis,'' said 
Heidi Quinn, a 34-year-old Doctors Without Borders field 
coordinator from London who was working at the clinic in Liquica. 
</P>
<P>
	In Dili, the France-based group runs a tent clinic in a downtown  
soccer stadium where thousands of people sought shelter during the 
worst of the violence. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the immediate problems, Doctors Without Borders  
and other relief groups are worried about the coming rainy season, 
the threat of epidemics and a burgeoning demand for medical care as 
more and more of refugees are repatriated. 
</P>
<P>
	Guintran, who joined Doctors only six weeks ago, said he and  
young colleagues saw the Nobel as honoring colleagues of decades 
past who pioneered the group's practice of swooping into difficult 
and dangerous situations to provide care. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all our former teams who deserve this,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Outside the clinic, 32-year-old Jacinta dos Santos cradled her  
feverish 18-month-old daughter as she waited her turn. She had 
arrived at the clinic by foot, a two-hour journey from her village. 
</P>
<P>
	``We heard that there were doctors here,'' she said. ``If not  
for them, we would have only God to help us.''

<HEADLINE> SBC To Upgrade Internet Access </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- SBC Communications, the local phone company for  
the Southwest and Midwest, plans to spend billions of dollars more 
to bring robust Internet access to its customers sooner, according 
to an industry report. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, which just completed its $73 billion acquisition of  
rival baby Bell Ameritech, is expected to announce on Monday that 
it will invest up to $2.5 billion more in upgrading its local phone 
networks over the next three years, the investment firm Goldman 
Sachs &AMP; Co. said in a report to its customers. 
</P>
<P>
	SBC had previously planned to spend about $1 billion per year on  
deploying more robust equipment for Internet services, according to 
past news releases. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Antonio-based company declined to comment on the subject  
of a ``major'' press conference scheduled for Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The main motivation behind SBC's accelerated spending, of  
course, is competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Although dialing up by phone is still the primary means by which  
most people access the Internet at home, cable television and 
wireless communications companies have been moving quickly to 
introduce faster, higher capacity Web service along with calling 
and TV service. AT&AMP;T, for example, has committed more than $100 
billion to buying cable TV systems and upgrading them for those 
purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, phone companies have been rushing to deploy a  
technology called DSL, or digital subscriber line, that enables 
regular copper-phone lines to carry much more data at far greater 
speeds. That increased capacity is becoming vital with the 
increasingly elaborate graphics and capabilities of many Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	But because a DSL signal can't travel more than a few miles  
without fading, telephone companies like SBC will need to spend 
billions to dig up old copper cables and install fiber optic lines 
in every neighborhood they hope to introduce the service. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast with dial-up service, DSL is a live, continuous link  
to the Internet, enabling users to starting surfing with a single 
mouse click. It usually features speeds at least five times faster 
than a dial-up connection through a 56k modem. 
</P>
<P>
	SBC plans to provide DSL speeds 20-to-30 times faster to all its  
customers over the next three years, Goldman Sachs analyst Frank J. 
Governali wrote in the report. 
</P>
<P>
	SBC provides local phone service in most of the Southwest,  
Midwest and California with 59 million access lines.

<HEADLINE> Peacekeepers Kill 3 in East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, East Timor (AP) -- In the bloodiest clash since  
international forces arrived in East Timor nearly a month ago, 
anti-independence militiamen ambushed a peacekeeping patrol today, 
setting off a firefight that left three of the militants dead and 
three wounded, an official said. 
</P>
<P>
	No one in the international force was injured in the clash,  
which took place near the village of Marko, said peacekeeping 
spokesman Col. Mark Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
	Marko is about 10 miles from the border of Indonesian-controlled  
West Timor, where many of the anti-independence militiamen have 
been gathering. 
</P>
<P>
	The Australian-led foreign force was deployed to East Timor on  
Sept. 20 to stop a rampage by Indonesian forces and their militant 
allies after the territory voted for independence. Militia leaders 
who fled to West Timor when the peacekeepers arrived have 
repeatedly threatened to launch a guerrilla war against the foreign 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
	At least three pro-Indonesian militants have been killed in  
other skirmishes with the peacekeepers over the last 10 days, but 
they weren't as deadly as today's. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly said a reconnaissance patrol of about half a dozen foreign  
soldiers was attacked by a group of about 20 militiamen. After a 
60- to 90-minute battle, a rapid-reaction unit flew to the area by 
helicopter and evacuated the foreign patrol, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The militia units, which were set up earlier this year by the  
Indonesian army, were armed with assault rifles and other automatic 
weapons, Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the tactics they're employing ... show a level of  
training, a level of aggression,'' he said in Dili, East Timor's 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
	In Jakarta, Indonesia's military spokesman, Maj. Gen. Sudrajat,  
didn't dispute Kelly's account, saying he is still awaiting a 
report on the battle from his men. However, he denied that any 
paramilitary units have been set up or armed by Indonesia's army. 
</P>
<P>
	``That accusation isn't true at all. The Indonesian military is  
in no position to set up a militia,'' Sudrajat said. ``The 
peacekeepers are only accusing us to find a scapegoat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the Indonesian soldiers who controlled East Timor for 24  
years have returned to their country since the territory's vote for 
independence on Aug. 30 and the mayhem that followed. 
</P>
<P>
	The peacekeeping forces, which number about 8,000 soldiers, have  
taken control of heavily damaged Dili, and are now being deployed 
to most other cities in the territory. They also are boosting their 
presence along the border with West Timor, where a clash last week 
with militants and Indonesian forces led Jakarta to accuse the 
peacekeepers of violating Indonesia's sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
	However, there are still many remote areas of East Timor which  
the foreign forces do not yet control. 
</P>
<P>
	In another development, the United Nations said it will send a  
five-member team to East Timor to investigate allegations of 
atrocities there following the independence vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, an emergency session of the U.N. Human Rights  
Commission voted 32-12 for the international inquiry, calling for 
an ``adequate representation of Asian experts.'' The team announced 
Friday will be led by Sonia Picado of Costa Rica and will include 
members from India and Papua New Guinea. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia has rejected an international inquiry, saying its own  
national rights commission should investigate abuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Wiranto, Indonesia's military commander, told the Straits  
Times newspaper in Singapore on Friday that there is no evidence 
that mass killings occurred in the territory. He said U.N. 
officials and relief agencies, which initially reported that 
thousands of East Timorese were killed by Indonesian forces, 
exaggerated the death tolls to discredit his soldiers.

<HEADLINE> Woodstock CD To Benefit Rape Hotline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME, N.Y. (AP) -- Some proceeds from a compact disc and a video  
of the Woodstock '99 concert -- which ended with reports of rapes 
and other sexual asaults -- will go toward a national rape hot line. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt we had to do something to make sure this never happens  
again,'' co-promoter John Scher said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the donation, every copy of the Woodstock '99 CD and  
home video will include information about the hot line. Rape Abuse 
and Incest National Network spokesman Scott Berkowitz said the 
money also will be used to expand the group's outreach and 
educational programs. 
</P>
<P>
	During the final act of the concert, which was held in July at a  
former Air Force base and attracted an audience of 225,000, a small 
group of concertgoers set fire to 12 tractor-trailers, a small bus 
and several portable toilets. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight alleged rapes and other sexual assaults during the concert  
were reported to police, but crisis intervention workers said many 
more went unreported.

<HEADLINE> Catalan Leader Challenged in Spain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BARCELONA, Spain (AP) -- Jordi Pujol, the Catalan regional  
president and national power broker, wears a smile on his campaign 
posters, but he faces a tough challenge to his 19 years office in 
Sunday's regional election. 
</P>
<P>
	For many Spaniards, Pujol, 69, personifies Catalan nationalism --  
a local hero ever since his defiance of former dictator Francisco 
Franco's ban on using the ``subversive'' Catalan language earned 
him two years in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	But cracks have appeared in his aura of indestructibility. For  
the first time since taking office in 1980, Pujol faces a serious 
rival, popular Socialist Pasqual Maragall, a former Barcelona 
mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the first time, there is a candidate with a powerful  
political personality of his own who is not afraid of Pujol,'' says 
Catalan political analyst Rafael Jorba. 
</P>
<P>
	As Barcelona mayor from 1982 to 1997, Maragall, 58, championed  
urban renewal and brought international prestige to the city by 
staging the 1992 Summer Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	A center-left politician with a modern, media-friendly image,  
Maragall's campaign is based on the assumption that Catalonia's 6 
million people are ready to move beyond the Pujol era. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need a hurricane to sweep everything clear,'' Maragall told  
supporters in Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
	But outside the city, people worry that Maragall will give  
priority to projects in Barcelona and the surrounding industrial 
zone, populated by migrants running from unemployment elsewhere in 
Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maragall was a good mayor of Barcelona, but Pujol is a real  
Catalan, he's one of ours,'' Agustin Fontanez, 50, said after Pujol 
slapped him on the back as he campaigned through a local market in 
the rural town of Tortosa. 
</P>
<P>
	For Pujol, being a ``real Catalan'' has little to do with  
ancestry or secessionist dreams. He frequently insists Catalan 
identity is open to anybody living in the wealthy northeastern 
region. He does not seek secession from Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the last 19 years, Pujol's very personalized style has  
succeeded in identifying Catalonia with him alone,'' says Jorba, 
pointing to Pujol's tireless promotion of the Catalan language. 
</P>
<P>
	Pujol also seeks credit for constantly fighting for Catalonia's  
interests in Madrid. Over the years, his conservative Convergence 
and Union party has thrown its weight behind minority national 
governments in return for privileges for Catalonia.

<HEADLINE> Bush Sets Record for Fund Raising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                      *Associated Press Writer-    	
</P>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The Seattle Mariners' bats have been silent for  
days at Safeco Field, but Republican presidential front-runner 
George W. Bush hit the political equivalent of a grand slam 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor, whose campaign treasury is closing in on the  
$60 million mark, a record, lent his starpower and fund-raising 
prowess to Sen. Slade Gorton, the state GOP and the National 
Republican Senatorial Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The event, the first political event staged in America's newest  
and most expensive ballpark, raised more than $400,000, the largest 
single fund-raising event in Washington state history. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's senior advisers said it's part of a new strategy of  
cementing his relations with congressional incumbents -- the very 
ones he has criticized generically in recent days -- and with GOP 
organizations in key battleground states. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like to help my friends,'' Bush said in an interview.  
</P>
<P>
	Aides said Bush has been swamped for months with requests and  
that after the bulk of his own fund-raising was completed, the 
governor decided to work in some of the events. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary draw nearer, he  
will have to concentrate on his own race more, his political 
strategists said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a benefit for me to do this,'' Bush said. ``It will  
help me a lot, if I am elected president, to have my friends in the 
House and in the Senate and in governors' mansions all across this 
great land. I'm asked a lot (to do campaign appearances and 
fund-raising), and I will do what I can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans haven't carried Washington in the past three  
presidential elections. Bush's father, former President George 
Bush, lost the state in both 1988 and 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just about time to break that streak,'' Bush told about  
400 people at the Safeco Field event. He told reporters he thinks 
his platform -- including education, free trade, a strong military 
and sensible environmental controls -- will resonate with Washington 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a little early to tell what the dynamics are going to be  
for the general election, but my political antennae tell me I have 
a good chance. There is a certain disgruntlement with the status 
quo. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush fans paid $1,000 and up to dine on salmon, salad and wine,  
and hear speeches from Bush and Gorton. It was called a ``grand 
slam'' event -- and the setting was appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
	Tables, set up on the outfield, were covered with linen  
tablecloths, china and pots of flowers. The speeches were broadcast 
on giant screens on the Mariners' scoreboard.

<HEADLINE> Brush Fires Break Out in California </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELLA VISTA, Calif. (AP) -- Residents living near this rural  
Northern California town were hastily evacuated Saturday because of 
a fast-moving brush fire that grew from 3,000 to 15,000 acres in a 
single afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty to 70 homes and other structures had been consumed by the  
blaze, which broke out about 4:15 a.m. Saturday in an area that 
experienced a similar brush fire just weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have nothing left in this town,'' said California  
Department of Forestry spokeswoman Rose Wyckoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents in the town of Millville, Jones Valley and Palo Cedro  
had also been evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Wyckoff said the exact number of evacuees was not available.  
</P>
<P>
	The fire was consuming heavy timber in some areas and lighter  
grassy brush in others. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 500 firefighters were working the blaze, which was  
made more intense by warm temperatures and gusty winds over 25 mph. 
Late Saturday, CDF officials reported a volunteer firefighter had 
been killed when she was struck on a highway by a fire truck. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the fire was not known and there was no estimate of  
a time for containment. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're praying for rain,'' said Ms. Wyckoff.  
</P>
<P>
	An evacuation center was set up at Anderson High School.

<HEADLINE> Yankees Deny Hiring Permission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The Baltimore Orioles can forget about trying to  
hire New York Yankees executive Gordon Blakeley as their next 
general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees owner George Steinbrenner has denied permission for the  
Orioles to interview Blakeley, team sources told The Associated 
Press on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Blakeley is the director of international and professional  
scouting for the Yankees, and his speciality is Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	Blakeley was instrumental in bringing pitcher Orlando ``El  
Duque'' Hernandez and top infield prospect Alfonso Soriano to the 
World Series champions. He also helped in the pursuit of pitcher 
Hideki Irabu. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles fired GM Frank Wren on Oct. 7, after his first  
season with the team. Earlier this week, Wren was hired by Atlanta 
as an assistant general manager. Baltimore also dismissed manager 
Ray Miller the same day after a disappointing 78-84 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Blakeley is based at the Yankees' complex in Tampa, Fla., and is  
part of team's inner circle in decisions involving talent. He is in 
the middle of a multiyear contract. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, Steinbrenner has occasionally blocked other teams  
from talking to his executives when jobs became available. Sources 
said the Orioles sought permission to speak with Blakeley this week 
and were turned down. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbrenner was in Boston on Saturday, watching the Yankees  
lose to Boston 13-1 in Game 3 of the AL championship series. 
Despite the most lopsided loss in their postseason history, the 
Yankees lead 2-1 in the best-of-7 matchup. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the Yankees promoted Mark Newman to director of  
baseball operations. That move, which elevated to a position 
ranking ahead of general manager Brian Cashman, came amid 
speculation that other teams wanted to interview him for general 
manager vacancies. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbrenner, sources said, let it be known that he did not  
intend for Newman or Blakeley to go work for another team while 
under contract to the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles, who have interviewed third base coach Sam Perlozzo  
for the managing job, have not yet talked to any candidates for the 
GM spot. 
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore is said to want to set up a front office system much  
like the one used by the Yankees, with several people playing key 
parts in the decision-making process, and thought Blakeley would be 
a good person to head it.

<HEADLINE> Twelve Injured In Pit Road Wreck </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Twelve people, including nine members  
of Tyce Carlson's crew, were injured Saturday when rookie Niclas 
Jonsson lost control of his car on pit road during practice for the 
Indy Racing League's Mall.com 500. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the injuries were considered life-threatening. Jonsson  
sustained a slight concussion and was among 10 people who were 
hospitalized. Carlson wasn't injured, but his father, Richard 
Carlson, who has a heart problem, was hospitalized as a precaution. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident occurred with only a few minutes left in the  
post-qualifying ``happy hour'' practice. Jonsson was heading back 
onto the track after a pit stop when his car jerked left, hit the 
retaining wall and smacked into Carlson's parked car. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlson's crew was working on an electrical problem. They never  
saw or heard Jonsson coming. The Swede had been building up speed 
for about 50 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no screeching at all -- just bam!'' witness Jeff Ross  
said. ``They had just pulled the cover off the car and were looking 
at the motor. I was looking right at the car and saw the car go and 
the people go with it. 
</P>
<P>
	``One guy went flying in front, one guy ended up on top of the  
two cars and another guy came hopping over the wall where I was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jonsson will miss Sunday's season-ending race, which would have  
been only his second on the circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlson, who qualified ninth, was going to decide whether to  
compete on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Team owners Blueprint-Immke Racing want to try and other teams  
have offered ``whatever we need,'' including crew, said Carlson's 
team manager, Rob Yankauskas. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Jonsson and the elder Carlson, the other eight  
people who were hospitalized included Speedway Motorsports Inc. 
employee Brian Figg and seven members of Carlson's crew. 
</P>
<P>
	The conditions of Figg and the crew were not immediately  
available. The injured crew members were: Tracy Hash, Tom Bose, 
Jeff Howerton, Mike Alessi, Tom Beaudry, Greg Height and Bill Dyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Two members of Carlson's crew, Jason Beck and Derek Branch, were  
treated and released at the infield car center. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the accident was not immediately known. Jonsson was  
too shaken up to discuss what happened. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am willing to bet money he pushed the wrong button and  
deactivated it,'' said driver Eddie Cheever, who was three pits 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	The 32-year-old Jonsson was the 27th and last qualifier. Even if  
he felt well enough to drive Sunday, the damage to his car would 
keep him out of the race.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Project Workers Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A review of work passes of employees at a  
Pentagon construction site alerted authorities to 33 illegal aliens 
who were later arrested, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The workers were arrested during a raid on the work site  
Thursday. Immigration rights groups said four of the workers had 
been released but a Pentagon spokesman could not confirm the 
account. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon's Defense Protective Service notified officials at  
the Immigration and Naturalization Service ``after it was 
determined that several foreign nationals had presented fraudulent 
immigration documents to obtain building work passes,'' said Lt. 
Col. Mike Milord, a Pentagon spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Milord had no further details of the raid and an INS spokesman  
did not immediately return calls seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Immigration rights group complained that witness accounts  
indicate Latino workers may have been separated from the crowd, 
leaving workers to wonder why they were being singled out. 
</P>
<P>
	Abel Nunez of CARECEN, a community-based immigration service  
group, said, it was seeking information ``from people that were 
present and from the different enforcement agencies to ensure that 
the civil rights of the workers were not violated.''

<HEADLINE> Quake Upends Calif. Town of Ludlow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LUDLOW, Calif. (AP) -- David Rockwell stood in the middle of his  
kitchen on Saturday staring at the broken memories on the floor. 
Photographs, china, ceramic birds, all damaged or destroyed when a 
magnitude-7.0 earthquake struck this remote desert town. 
</P>
<P>
	Rockwell and his girlfriend, Jackie Adams, have one of 22 mobile  
homes in the Ludlow Mobile Home Park. Every one was knocked off its 
foundations, leaving the town's only residential neighborhood at a 
tilt. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's been saving almost all of this since we've been  
together,'' he said, picking up broken champagne glasses, given to 
them to toast their new life in Ludlow six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The epicenter was just a few miles south of Ludlow in a desolate  
mining patch called Hector. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten miles west of town, an Amtrak train on its way from Chicago  
to Los Angeles derailed when the quake knocked 21 of 25 cars off 
its rails, slightly injuring four people. Five miles away, an 
overpass on Interstate 40 was cracked at both ends. 
</P>
<P>
	``This kind of thing can put you out of business. It was a  
miracle it wasn't any harder. With the train and the overpass and 
the problems here, it's pretty bad,'' said town owner John Knoll. 
</P>
<P>
	Ludlow, founded in 1882 by the Ludlow Mining Co., was once a  
booming frontier post along the Santa Fe Trail. Route 66 was built 
through the town in the 1920s, making Ludlow a key stop on the 
2,448-mile ``mother road'' between Chicago and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Knoll and his brother bought Ludlow in 1978, a few years before  
Route 66 was decommissioned. Valued at $7 million, the town 125 
miles east of Los Angeles includes the boarded up Ludlow Fire 
Department, Ludlow Cafe and Ludlow Arco. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knolls provide free housing for 43 employees and  
transportation for a dozen more who are bused in from Barstow every 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	At the mobile home park, air conditioning and heating units were  
crumpled on driveways, staircases overturned, satellite dishes 
collapsed and windows shattered. 
</P>
<P>
	The three houses in Ludlow were still upright, but there was  
extensive damage, including crushed china, smashed pictures and 
dangling light fixtures. 
</P>
<P>
	Knoll said he even lost his toilet. ``It just rolled over on its  
side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Within minutes after the 2:46 a.m. quake, nearly all of the  
town's residents gathered in a parking lot to make sure everyone 
was OK, check damage and ride out a wave of aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
	They were joined by about half a dozen motorists who drove in to  
find the gas pumps out of commission because of a power outage. The 
next station is 35 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Ford was on his way home from Colorado to Lake Elsinore.  
</P>
<P>
	``We stopped here to get gas on our way to Colorado,'' he said.  
``We figured we could get it here on the way back. Now, I don't 
have enough to get to the next station.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Motorist John Ryan was so desperate he paid $20 for a 5-gallon  
can of gas from another driver hauling jet skis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not staying here any longer than I have to,'' he said  
following an aftershock.

<HEADLINE> Bankers Boost Bush Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawyers, stockbrokers and a bank with  
legislation before Congress were among the biggest givers to the 
presidential candidates over the last three months. 
</P>
<P>
	Employees of MBNA Corp., a major bank and issuer of credit cards  
that has two major issues before Congress, were Texas Gov. George 
W. Bush's biggest contributors during the last three months, 
according to an Associated Press computer analysis of contributions 
to the candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Sen. Bill Bradley's most generous donors between July 1  
and Sept. 30 were employees of the same Wall Street investment 
houses that have supported him throughout his campaign. Bradley is 
a former consultant to financial companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore's top givers were two lawyer-lobbying  
firms. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush raised $77,400 from employees of MBNA Corp., a major bank  
holding company and the nation's second largest issuer of credit 
cards. Congress is considering legislation to allow banks, 
insurance companies and investment houses to enter each others' 
markets -- eagerly sought by all three industries -- and a credit 
card industry-backed bill to overhaul bankruptcy laws. Bush had 
raised $61,750 from MBNA employees through June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush also raised $54,750 from employees of Ernst &AMP; Young, an  
accounting firm that lobbies for electric utilities and the 
high-technology industry, among other clients. Ernst &AMP; Young, which 
earlier gave Bush's campaign $73,950, has been Gore's top financial 
backer with $115,950 in contributions through June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley raised $167,200 from employees of Goldman Sachs, $75,450  
from employees of Lehman Brothers and $63,440 from employees of 
Merrill Lynch, which also is pushing for the banking bill. Lehman 
earlier gave Bradley $81,500, and Merrill Lynch earlier gave 
$58,500. Merrill Lynch also gave Bush $63,600 through June 30, 
while Goldman Sachs earlier contributed $58,750 to Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore took in $21,750 from members of the law firm of Mayer,  
Brown &AMP; Platt, which lobbies on behalf of Boeing, General Electric, 
United Parcel Service and others; and $20,750 from members of the 
law firm of Robins, Kaplan, Miller &AMP; Ciresi, whose clients include 
Honeywell. 
</P>
<P>
	``They represent a pretty elite and rarefied group of  
interests,'' said Sheila Krumholtz, research director for the 
Center of Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research group. 
``These players ... have specific legislative agendas that they are 
pursuing. Their giving represents all of the reasons their clients 
are hiring them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley spokeswoman Anita Dunn said the former senator is  
getting money from Wall Street because he is a familiar figure. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has been a well-known figure in New York for his entire  
professional life,'' Dunn said. ``It's the area where he's lived, 
where he played basketball, where he was a familiar presence from 
serving 18 years in the Senate from New Jersey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., raised $75,663 from political action  
committees over the last three months. Many of his donors have 
interests that come before the Senate Commerce Committee, of which 
he is chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, a major force in making telecommunications law, received  
the maximum $5,000 contribution from Cablevision, a Long Island 
cable operator, and from Comsat. He also was given $5,000 by the 
American Moving and Storage Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaigns themselves emphasized their small donors. Bush has  
raised an average of $386 per donation; Bradley, an average $334; 
and Gore, an average $187.

<HEADLINE> Ramsey Case May Get New Prosecutor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- Gov. Bill Owens will meet with Boulder  
District Attorney Alex Hunter Monday night to discuss the 
possibility of appointing a special prosecutor for the JonBenet 
Ramsey case, one of Hunter's advisors said. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury investigation of the Ramsey case, launched by  
Hunter Sept. 15, 1998, ended Wednesday without any indictments. 
</P>
<P>
	Owens announced Wednesday that he would consider appointing a  
special prosecutor to review the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Adams County District Attorney Bob Grant, who is part of  
Hunter's team of advisors on the Ramsey case, said of the meeting: 
``The only person I'm sure will be there is me, since I haven't 
talked to anyone else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grant said he expects Hunter's grand jury team of Michael Kane,  
Bruce Levin, Mitch Morrissey and Denver-area prosecutors Bill 
Ritter, Dave Thomas and Jim Peters to be present at the meeting as 
well. Ritter, Thomas and Peters are from Denver, Jefferson County 
and Arapahoe County, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Amy Sampson, Owen's acting press secretary, declined to reveal  
the time or location of the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that they are planning a meeting soon, but they are  
still working out the details,'' Sampson said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said earlier that JonBenet's parents, John and Patsy  
Ramsey, remain under an ``umbrella of suspicion'' in the December 
1996 slaying of JonBenet, 6, at their Boulder home. Hunter said 
Thursday that they have not been eliminated from the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ramseys have said all along they are innocent.

<HEADLINE> Quake Stops Gambling -- for a Minute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- The 7.0-magnitude earthquake in the Southern  
California desert did what a lack of sleep and a lot of bad luck 
can rarely do: stop gambling in Las Vegas for a few moments. 
</P>
<P>
	But only for a few.  
</P>
<P>
	Not long after frightened guests left high-rise rooms for  
ground-level casinos early Saturday, the cherries and oranges soon 
started spinning again in the slots and gamblers restacked chips on 
black and red. Wagers picked up at a faster pace than before. 
</P>
<P>
	``I figure if I'm up, I may as well lose some more change,''  
said Martha Anderson of Chicago, cradling her cup of coins for the 
slots at Caesars Palace. ``I don't think I could go back to sleep 
now, anyway. It scared the devil out of me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Candy McCain of Phoenix only briefly stopped feeding coins into  
slots at The Mirage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't sure exactly what was going on, but then I saw the  
signs swaying and the leaves on the fake palms rustling, so I 
thought it must be an earthquake,'' she said. ``When it stopped, I 
started playing again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The quake struck at 2:46 a.m. and was centered 150 miles to the  
west, causing the hotels along the famed Strip to sway, but there 
were no reports of damage or injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	But it rattled the nerves of many out-of-towners.  
</P>
<P>
	Lisa Taylor of Boerne, Texas, and friends Dorothy and Sherry  
Garner of Wister, Okla., were hesitant to go back inside their 
hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	``At first I thought it was hail,'' Taylor said, still looking  
jittery as she sat on a bench outside the Mirage. ``I jumped out of 
bed and realized the room was swaying back and forth. We were on 
the 19th floor and it really seemed to move a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dorothy Garner, 66, said she couldn't believe she made it down  
18 flights of stairs so quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	``It must have been some kind of record,'' she said. ``I don't  
even like to use stairs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The quake also was a first for Veronica DeMarzo of New York.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm 71 years old and I've never felt anything like that,'' she  
said. ``It shook me right out of my bed.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Plan for Gov't Disabled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today announced new steps to  
promote the advancement of people with disabilities who work for 
the federal government, saying he wanted to ensure that the 
nation's largest employer leads by example. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm releasing the first-ever government plan to ensure  
positive career paths for people with disabilities in our federal 
work force,'' Clinton said in his weekly radio address. ``I'm 
directing every federal agency and department to take concrete 
action to expand opportunities for people with disabilities in all 
levels of the work force, from entry to senior ranks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president said that despite good economic times, three out  
of four people with disabilities who want to work can't find work. 
He also said that if economic prosperity is going to continue, 
employers must seek new pools of employees. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm calling on all agencies to recruit and promote people with  
disabilities, to reach out to students with disabilities, to 
provide reasonable accommodations for applicants and employees with 
disabilities,'' Clinton said. ``I'm also calling on our federal 
human resources agency, the Office of Personnel Management, to 
ensure that every agency gets the help it needs to fulfill these 
commitments. We are the nation's largest employer. I want it to be 
a model for private industry, and this plan will help to do just 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also renewed his call for Congress to pass legislation  
that would ensure that people with disabilities don't lose their 
federal health care coverage when they get jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the biggest barriers facing people with disabilities is  
the fear of losing their health insurance when they get a job,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under current law, many people with disabilities cannot keep  
their Medicaid or Medicare coverage if they work.

<HEADLINE> Buddy Bell May Be Rockies' Manager </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The Colorado Rockies reportedly are close to  
hiring Cincinnati Reds farm director Buddy Bell as their next 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell could be hired as soon as next week, The Denver Post and  
Denver Rocky Mountain News reported in Saturday's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell reportedly will fly to Denver next week for a formal  
interview with Rockies general manager Dan O'Dowd, vice president 
Keli McGregor and owners Jerry McMorris, Charlie Monfort and Dick 
Monfort. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Dowd did not return telephone messages left by The Associated  
Press. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Dowd said he and Bell have had preliminary discussions, but  
the deal has not been finalized. O'Dowd denied reports that Bell 
has already been hired. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's premature,'' O'Dowd told the Post. ``It could turn out  
that way, but we don't have the day firmed up yet on when we can 
get Buddy out here. I will say that I'm ready to take this to the 
next stage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Dowd said there is no deadline for hiring a manager, but it is  
likely to happen in the next week. Major League Baseball has a 
hiring blackout in effect during the World Series, which begins 
Oct. 23. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell said he is not interested in the Cleveland Indians  
managerial job that opened up with Friday's dismissal of Mike 
Hargrove. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of my focus is on getting this done with the Rockies,''  
Bell told the News. ``I'm excited about getting a chance to talk to 
Jerry McMorris and the Monforts, and seeing if this is a fit for 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	None of the other managerial candidates interviewed so far --  
Rich Donnelly, Clint Hurdle, Lynn Jones, Ken Griffey Sr., Carlos 
Tosca and Willie Randolph -- have met with the Rockies' owners. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Dowd also had an initial telephone conversation on Thursday  
with Hall of Famer George Brett, a vice president of the Kansas 
City Royals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did talk to Dan, and it was a very nice talk,'' Brett told  
the Post. ``But anything more than that better come from them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Dowd interviewed Tosca, the Arizona Diamondbacks bench coach,  
on Thursday, and said he was impressed. The Cuban-born Tosca, 46, 
has managed 16 years at every level of the minor leagues, finishing 
first five times. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Dowd described Tosca as a viable candidate with few  
weaknesses. But he reportedly has been telling other candidates 
that Bell is his first choice. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell began his 18-year big league playing career with Cleveland  
from 1972-78, and was Hargrove's bench coach from 1994-95. 
</P>
<P>
	One hitch in signing Bell could be his reluctance to move his  
family from Cincinnati, but Bell reportedly has not raised the 
issue in discussions with the Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
	``That may be, but if that's the case, he's not going to be the  
manager of this club,'' O'Dowd said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't discussed any specific issues with the Rockies at  
all,'' Bell told the Post. ``I have talked to Danny a couple times, 
but not about that. I'd like to get to the point where we will 
consider each other.''

<HEADLINE> SBC To Upgrade Internet Access </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- SBC Communications, the local phone company for  
the Southwest and Midwest, plans to spend billions of dollars more 
to bring robust Internet access to its customers sooner, according 
to an industry report. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, which just completed its $73 billion acquisition of  
rival baby Bell Ameritech, is expected to announce on Monday that 
it will invest up to $2.5 billion more in upgrading its local phone 
networks over the next three years, the investment firm Goldman 
Sachs &AMP; Co. said in a report to its customers. 
</P>
<P>
	SBC had previously planned to spend about $1 billion per year on  
deploying more robust equipment for Internet services, according to 
past news releases. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Antonio-based company declined to comment on the subject  
of a ``major'' press conference scheduled for Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The main motivation behind SBC's accelerated spending, of  
course, is competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Although dialing up by phone is still the primary means by which  
most people access the Internet at home, cable television and 
wireless communications companies have been moving quickly to 
introduce faster, higher capacity Web service along with calling 
and TV service. AT&AMP;T, for example, has committed more than $100 
billion to buying cable TV systems and upgrading them for those 
purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, phone companies have been rushing to deploy a  
technology called DSL, or digital subscriber line, that enables 
regular copper-phone lines to carry much more data at far greater 
speeds. That increased capacity is becoming vital with the 
increasingly elaborate graphics and capabilities of many Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	But because a DSL signal can't travel more than a few miles  
without fading, telephone companies like SBC will need to spend 
billions to dig up old copper cables and install fiber optic lines 
in every neighborhood they hope to introduce the service. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast with dial-up service, DSL is a live, continuous link  
to the Internet, enabling users to starting surfing with a single 
mouse click. It usually features speeds at least five times faster 
than a dial-up connection through a 56k modem. 
</P>
<P>
	SBC plans to provide DSL speeds 20-to-30 times faster to all its  
customers over the next three years, Goldman Sachs analyst Frank J. 
Governali wrote in the report. 
</P>
<P>
	SBC provides local phone service in most of the Southwest,  
Midwest and California with 59 million access lines.

<HEADLINE> Atlanta's Rocker Gets Burned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Don't expect one seeing-eye single to steal the  
swagger from John Rocker. That's not how this reliever works. 
</P>
<P>
	Rocker came running out of the Atlanta bullpen Saturday night in  
the eighth inning, anxious to finish a sweep of the New York Mets 
and clinch the National League pennant for the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	And, as far as he was concerned, he was as good as he's been,  
despite the two-run single by John Olerud that rescued the Mets for 
a 3-2 stay-alive victory in Game 4. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made the pitch I wanted, low and away,'' Rocker said. ``He  
hit a well-placed three-hopper. It was one of the cheaper hits off 
me my entire year. An infield hit cost us two runs. It wasn't like 
he hit a double off the wall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rocker arrived with runners at first and second and two outs and  
the Braves leading 2-1 and four outs away from the World Series. 
Olerud had homered earlier against John Smoltz for the lone Mets 
run, but the Braves played the percentages, putting in their power 
pitcher, a left-hander to face the lefty hitter. Olerud was 0-for-9 
with five strikeouts against Rocker, so the move was obvious. 
</P>
<P>
	With Shea Stadium rocking, water bottles flying out of the  
stands as the reliever ran to the mound, Rocker savored the moment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Didn't bother me at all,'' said the reliever, who celebrates  
his 25th birthday Sunday. ``They think they're in my head. They're 
not. I pitched as well the last two days as I have all year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All week, he has been Public Enemy No. 1 in New York after  
leveling a string of insults at the city and its fans. Rocker saved 
Game 3 for the Braves on Friday night and delighted in the moment. 
Now he was in position to finish the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Standing on the mound, he paid no attention to the runners --  
Roger Cedeno on second and Melvin Mora on first. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't thinking of the runners at all,'' he said. ``I was  
solely focused on the hitter. I couldn't tell you who was on first. 
Mora, I think. I've got a terrible pickoff move. What am I gonna 
do?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Bobby Cox excused the lapse.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think he was intent on getting the hitter out,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Rocker tried a curveball and the runners took off on a double  
steal. Suddenly, the tying and go-ahead runs were in scoring 
position. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew they were going to double steal there,'' Cox said.  
``That was an automatic. It was a curveball down and away and we 
couldn't get rid of the ball. We had a plan where to throw it. It 
was such a slow pitch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now it was up to Olerud. Atlanta's defense shaded him to the  
left, figuring he could not pull Rocker. 
</P>
<P>
	``We never play him to pull,'' shortstop Ozzie Guillen said.  
</P>
<P>
	Rocker went back to work on Olerud and made the pitch he wanted.  
Olerud slapped it up the middle. Guillen lunged for it. ``I touched 
it,'' he said. ``I catch it, he's out because he's a slow runner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the ball squirted through.  
</P>
<P>
	``If Ozzie's one step to the left, the play gets made,'' Rocker  
said. ``If the play's made, we're three outs away from the World 
Series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the ball bounced by and the runners scored. On the Mets  
bench, there was elation, not only because they had taken the lead 
but because it had come against Rocker, who had tormented them. 
Reliever Turk Wendell noted that Olerud was due. ``Rocker had 
dominated long enough,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	So was the victory sweeter because of the victim?  
</P>
<P>
	Wendell paused.  
</P>
<P>
	``No,'' he said. Then he added, ``It was beautiful.''

<HEADLINE> SoCal Quake Shakes Three States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JOSHUA TREE, Calif. (AP) -- A 7.0-magnitude earthquake in the  
Mojave Desert shook millions awake early Saturday in three states 
and derailed an Amtrak train, but caused no serious damage or 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The quake jolted gamblers out of bed in Las Vegas and shook  
buildings as far away as Phoenix and Tijuana, Mexico. Up to 90,000 
utility customers lost power, mobile homes were knocked off pilings 
in the desert community of Ludlow and a highway bridge was cracked. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 2:46 a.m. earthquake -- the most powerful to strike  
California since a 7.3-magnitude temblor in 1992 -- caused little 
more than incidental damage in the huge population centers to the 
west and south. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thank God it took place in a remote area where there appears  
to be no tremendous damage or personal injuries,'' said Mayor 
Richard Riordan in Los Angeles, where the 6.7-magnitude Northridge 
quake killed 72 people and caused $25 billion in damage in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak's Southwest Chief, en route from Chicago to Los Angeles,  
derailed in the Mojave near Ludlow, more than 125 miles northeast 
of Los Angeles. Four of the 155 passengers on the 25-car train 
suffered minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our saving grace was, we were following a freight train,''  
said Glenn Morton, the train's conductor. ``We were going 60 mph 
instead of the 80 mph we normally would do through here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All the homes in a nearby mobile home park were shoved off their  
foundations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody was running out. The dogs were howling. The cats  
were hiding. And the kids were freaking,'' said Barbara Houseworth, 
19, who fled her trailer with her 3-year-old child. ``When mobile 
homes rock, they really rock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A concrete bridge over Interstate 40 had large cracks, but the  
highway remained open. Merchandise flew off shelves and at least 
one supermarket was left with structural damage. Small brush fires 
were ignited by downed power lines in Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
	Light damage was also reported on the sprawling Marine Air  
Ground Combat Center south of Ludlow in Twentynine Palms, including 
broken water and gas lines. 
</P>
<P>
	The quake was centered 32 miles north of Joshua Tree, 100 miles  
east of Los Angeles, according to the California Institute of 
Technology. Aftershocks rolled through the region for hours, 
including a 5.8 and a 5.3 and more than a dozen of magnitude-4 or 
greater. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands more aftershocks are expected, but there is only a 5  
percent chance that a quake bigger than the original will strike in 
the next week, said Lucy Jones, chief seismologist at the U.S. 
Geological Survey's office in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities in Las Vegas and the Los Angeles area said there  
were no reports of serious damage or injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shook everything pretty good, but that was about it,'' said  
Lt. Rich Paddock of the Orange County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
	A hotel near Disneyland evacuated guests as a precaution, and  
many gamblers in Las Vegas left their high-rise hotel rooms for the 
ground-level casinos. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole place was shaking like crazy,'' said Michelle  
Fabian, awakened on the 18th floor of the Mirage Hotel, 150 miles 
from the epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
	The effects of the earthquake were more pronounced near the  
epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Did you ever play a pinball machine and see the ball get stuck  
in there and go bam-bam-bam-bam-bam-bam? It just threw my body back 
and forth as I ran down the hallway,'' surf guitarist Dick Dale 
said from his home 30 miles from the epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
	But although the Joshua Tree Inn lost power, it had no  
significant damage, night manager Jacob Naylor said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Twelve guests, all definitely awake. A couple in from Holland,  
definitely shocked. A couple in from the U.K. asked me, `Is this 
normal?''' Naylor said. ``They're all taking it rather well, kind 
of excited. Vacationers, new experiences, what can I say?''

<HEADLINE> GOP Leaders Differ on Campaign Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gathered in a Capitol conference room, Speaker  
Dennis Hastert and other House GOP leaders wanted to learn results 
of a focus group conducted days earlier to gauge reaction to a 
series of campaign commercials. 
</P>
<P>
	According to participants in the session, who spoke on condition  
of anonymity, Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the GOP Whip and a proponent 
of a vigorous advertising effort, said he had been informed the 
commercials had been well received when viewed by the audience 
assembled to see them. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Tom Davis of Virginia, the campaign committee chairman  
who was less eager to commit to a costly ad campaign, said he had 
been told the results were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	A staff aide was called on to resolve the differing opinions,  
but the event provided an awkward moment for the leadership, 
according to several GOP aides who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours later, on an early autumn evening, the leadership met  
again in Hastert's office to view the commercial itself. The 
decision was to go ahead and air it. 
</P>
<P>
	Even then, there was dissent when Davis convened the executive  
committee of the National Republican Campaign Committee the 
following day. 
</P>
<P>
	One member of the group, Rep. David Hobson, R-Ohio, objected  
according to several sources. Hobson's concern was that the wording 
of their ads would complicate their stated purpose, which was to 
enlist Democrats in the effort to safeguard the Social Security 
surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	Hobson declined comment.

<HEADLINE> Expensive Road Ahead for Democrats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Democratic presidential campaign is  
threatening to become a long, costly battle that could leave the 
eventual nominee broke and politically weakened. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore's slide, rival Bill Bradley's advantage  
in fund raising and a highly competitive primary calendar all point 
toward a race that could last deep into the spring. Interviews with 
a dozen Democrats inside and outside the campaigns suggest Gore 
remains the party favorite, but Bradley holds appeal in many early 
voting states. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gore is likely to win, but it's not going to be an elevating  
experience,'' said Democratic consultant Geoff Garin, who is not in 
either camp. 
</P>
<P>
	It all starts, as it always does, in Iowa and eight days later  
in New Hampshire -- where momentum seized by a candidate is more 
important than the small number of delegates awarded by state 
parties. 
</P>
<P>
	In Iowa, Gore holds a double-digit lead in polls over the former  
New Jersey senator. Though Bradley has narrowed the gap, both 
campaigns expect the vice president's institutional advantages -- 
such the AFL-CIO's endorsement -- to give him the edge on Jan. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Then comes New Hampshire on Feb. 1  
</P>
<P>
	Bradley has rallied to pull even, and the vice president is  
running scared. He will be in the state for most of the next two 
weeks, preparing for a forum with Bradley at month's end. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, consultants say, the edge goes to Bradley. Who wins may  
not matter as much as who exceeds expectations and heads into the 
delegate-rich section of the calendar with momentum. 
</P>
<P>
	The current schedule, which Democratic leaders are tinkering  
with, has no delegates awarded between Feb. 1 and March 7. That 
would give the New Hamsphire winner five weeks to ride the tide of 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen states and American Samoa have scheduled primaries and  
caucuses March 7. More than 1,300 delegate votes will be up for 
grabs, 61 percent of the 2,169 needed to win the nomination under 
current assumptions. 
</P>
<P>
	The day was tailor-made for Bradley, whose strong ties to the  
Northeast date to his Hall of Fame career as a professional 
basketball player with the New York Knicks. Connecticut, Maine, 
Maryland, Massachusetts, New York and Rhode Island are leaning 
toward Bradley, consultants say. 
</P>
<P>
	He also is strong in Minnesota and his home state of Missouri,  
they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the remaining states, only California's 367 delegates and  
Ohio's 146 delegates pack a punch. Gore holds a 5-2 lead over 
Bradley in the Golden State and must maintain it. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Gore ends up losing in both California and New York, it's  
not necessarily a fatal blow. But it's pretty close to it,'' Garin 
said. The flip side, consultants say, is that the race could end 
March 7 if Gore wins New Hampshire, New York and California. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, it's advantage Gore,'' said Los Angeles consultant  
Bill Carrick, a Gore ally. ``But this is a trendy place where votes 
can move really fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With 41 percent of the delegate votes awarded through March 7,  
Gore and Bradley would spend the next week battling in Utah (edge 
to Bradley), Nevada (edge to Gore), Colorado (toss-up) and a few 
other states before a Southern showdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Up next, March 14: Bradley's day of reckoning. If Bradley had a  
good week, this is Gore's chance for a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president is from Tennessee and enjoys 3-to-1 support  
among blacks, two advantages that could give him a sweep of the 
day's six states -- Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, 
Tennessee and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley plans to pick one state to focus his resources, hoping  
to stall Gore's momentum. His top aides have worked in Mississippi, 
and Bradley is within 12 percentage points of Gore in Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Begala, a Democratic consultant and Gore ally, said Bradley  
will run out of oxygen after the March 7 primaries, which are 
stocked with high-salaried, well-educated voters who tell pollsters 
they favor Bradley over Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	With little support from labor or minority voters, Bradley will  
not feel as welcome among Southern Democrats, Begala said. 
``Bradley is down now to Chablis drinkers and Brie eaters and Volvo 
drivers,'' he said. ``Those are wonderful Democrats, but you've got 
to have some beer drinkers or you don't get the nomination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two-thirds of the delegates will be pledged through March 14,  
awarded proportionally based on the candidates' showing in 
congressional districts and statewide. If Bradley wins New 
Hampshire, sweeps the Northeast, loses California and is swept by 
Gore on March 14, the delegate count at this point could still be 
roughly even. 
</P>
<P>
	Consultants say it could be a slugfest after March 15, with the  
advantage going to Gore because of his support among party leaders. 
He should get a lion's share of the 799 ``super delegates'' -- 
elected officials and party leaders whose votes are not tied to 
primary results. 
</P>
<P>
	One wild card may be Bradley's larger-than-expected campaign  
treasury. Gore's free-spending ways continue this week with a 
$440,000 ad campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The worst-case scenario for Democrats: The primary fight for  
liberal voters drags into May or June. If the GOP contest is 
settled sooner, the Republican nominee would get a head start 
courting general election voters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gore will be the ultimate nominee, but he will be defined way  
to the left of mainstream -- out of money and short on ideas,'' said 
GOP consultant Scott Reed. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed managed the 1996 campaign of Republican nominee Bob Dole,  
who staggered out of the primary -- broke and easily cast by 
President Clinton as a pawn of extremists in his party. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats do not want to repeat that history.

<HEADLINE> Gates: Watch Murdoch's Influence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Bill Gates thinks if anyone wants to take over the  
world, it's the man who accused him of wanting to -- media tycoon 
Rupert Murdoch. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with the BBC scheduled to air this weekend, the  
Microsoft Corp. chairman says: ``He's hiding behind me. He's your 
man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gates says running Microsoft is ``not like owning a newspaper,''  
referring to Murdoch's News Corp. empire, which includes newspapers 
in the United States, England and Australia, as well as the 20th 
Century Fox movie studio, Fox Television, the Los Angeles Dodgers 
baseball team and satellite TV networks on several continents. 
</P>
<P>
	``Someone who owns a newspaper can pick up the phone to the  
editor and say `run headlines I like,''' Gates says. ``What we do 
is create tools like a word processor that lets people express 
their ideas and we're not at all involved in how they choose to use 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing we're involved with has democratized communications,  
and anyone can publish on the Internet. You don't have to own a TV 
channel or a newspaper.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Giuliani Slipping in Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Whether or not they will be able to cast a  
vote for next year's Senate race in New York, Americans are looking 
less favorably upon anticipated candidates Rudolph Giuliani and 
Hillary Rodham Clinton, according to a poll released Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The CBS News poll found that 16 percent of those questioned  
nationwide earlier this month gave Giuliani, New York City's 
Republican mayor, an ``unfavorable'' rating. Six percent found him 
unfavorable in a March 1998 poll. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Giuliani's favorable rating also rose during the same  
period, with 21 percent of respondents reporting a favorable 
impression of the mayor, up from 16 percent in March 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Northeasterners are driving the ratings dive for Giuliani, with  
24 percent reporting unfavorable impressions of him this month, up 
from 7 percent in March 1998, the poll found. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani's popularity continues to rise among Republicans, with  
29 percent reporting favorable impressions of the mayor, up from 20 
percent in March 1998. Negative ratings among Republicans grew 
seven percentage points, from 3 percent to 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Mrs. Clinton, 36 percent of those polled this month had  
unfavorable impressions of her, up from 20 percent in January 1999. 
Forty percent said they had a favorable impression of the first 
lady, down from 55 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Pollsters found a drop in the number of women who look favorably  
on Mrs. Clinton and an increase in the number who see her 
unfavorably. Thirty-one percent of respondents this month said they 
have an unfavorable opinion of her, up from 17 percent in January 
1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-four percent said they have a favorable impression of Mrs.  
Clinton, down from 61 percent in January 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	With the election still more than a year away, neither Giuliani  
nor Mrs. Clinton has formally announced for the seat being vacated 
by Democratic Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oct. 3-4 telephone poll of 871 adults has a margin of error  
of 3 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	A poll earlier this month of New York voters found Giuliani and  
Mrs. Clinton in a statistical dead heat. 
</P>
<P>
	That poll, released Oct. 6 from Marist College's Institute for  
Public Opinion, found the mayor favored by 46 percent of the 
state's voters, while 42 percent backed Mrs. Clinton. Other polls 
have also shown them about even.

<HEADLINE> Plot Leader Gets 11 Years in Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A judge handed an 11-year prison sentence to a  
man who once plotted to bomb New York landmarks and kill Egypt's 
president, crediting the man with substantial cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Michael Mukasey on Friday said Siddig  
Ibrahim Siddig Ali provided intelligence information to the United 
States that ``to a certain degree made up for what you did and 
helped the government not only in this case but perhaps to prevent 
future cases.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said the sentence ``balances the enormity of what you  
did and intended to do against the substantial cooperation you 
provided.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Siddig Ali, 38, said he was ``arrogant, immature and foolish''  
in 1993 when he designed the plots and discussed them at length 
with a government informant who was secretly taping the 
conversations. 
</P>
<P>
	Siddig Ali, of Jersey City, N.J., pleaded guilty shortly after  
the start of a 1995 trial of Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman and others in 
a plot to blow up New York City landmarks and assassinate Egyptian 
President Hosni Mubarak. 
</P>
<P>
	During that plea to all charges against him, including seditious  
conspiracy, Siddig Ali said the blind sheik had given him a fatwa, 
or religious edict, to kill Mubarak and bomb the landmarks. 
</P>
<P>
	He and other Islamic militants plotted to blow up the United  
Nations, the FBI headquarters in New York and two tunnels and a 
bridge connecting New Jersey to Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	The attacks were to take place just months after the Feb. 26,  
1993, World Trade Center bombing which killed six people and 
injured more than 1,000 others. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to extend my sincere apologies to the people of  
New York, to the American people for my actions,'' Siddig Ali said. 
``My actions in no way reflect the peaceful spirit of Islam nor do 
they reflect the majority of decent and peace-loving Muslims around 
the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he now condemned those who ``fraudulently preserve the  
sacredness of Islam to perpetrate their unholy war against the 
innocent and the unsuspecting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know now more than ever that only through peaceful dialogue  
can we resolve our differences. Terrorism is evil and ungodly,'' 
Siddig Ali said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Siddig Ali did not testify at the trial of the  
Abdel-Rahman, the sheik was convicted of conspiracy and sentenced 
to life in prison without parole.

<HEADLINE> New Kosovo Police Officers Graduate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The first cadets to graduate from  
Kosovo's new police academy received their diplomas Saturday and 
heard an admonition from their class leader to fight crime without 
regard for personal or ethnic interests. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Kosovo police will be the protector of human rights and  
will fight against any type of crime or corruption,'' the class 
leader, Nuredin Ibishi, a former Kosovo Liberation Army officer, 
told the 173 graduates in the ceremony, a symbol of international 
attempts to bring normality to Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Ibishi said the tragic experience with the Serbian police force  
should make the new officers aware of their responsibility to treat 
all the province's citizens with respect and fairness. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will never again be deportations, massacres or rapes by  
uniformed men,'' Ibishi said. ``This will be a police which will 
respect the law, and above everything, will respect the human 
factor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The graduates, wearing blue uniforms with the insignia ``Kosovo  
Police Service,'' received their certificates from Bernard 
Kouchner, the U.N. administrator in the province. The group, mostly 
ethnic Albanians, included 39 women, eight Serbs, three Bosnians 
and three Turks. 
</P>
<P>
	``With you lies a real possibility to break with the past, from  
the hardship and intolerance that has prevailed for too long in 
Kosovo,'' Kouchner told the graduates. 
</P>
<P>
	Training began Sept. 7. The average age of the graduates is 33  
years, the youngest being 20 and the oldest 46. Many of the new 
officers have a military background. 
</P>
<P>
	The ceremony, attended by families, international officials and  
Kosovo political leaders, was held in the sports center of the 
University of Pristina. Also present were Hashim Thaci, political 
chief of the officially disbanded KLA, and Rexhep Selimi, the 
minister for public order in the KLA-backed provisional 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The ceremony came a day after violence erupted in the town of  
Kosovska Mitrovica when ethnic Albanians tried to force their way 
across a bridge to the Serb side of town, leaving more than 100 
people injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Braving a shower of stones, French-led peacekeepers used tear  
gas and percussion grenades Friday to drive back hundreds of ethnic 
Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	The town was quiet Saturday, and there were plenty of NATO  
soldiers and police officers guarding the bridge. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of those injured Friday were ethnic Albanian demonstrators  
hurt by the percussion grenades and tear gas. Two Danish U.N. 
soldiers and five police officers were wounded, but none of the 
injuries were serious, NATO spokesmen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosovska Mitrovica's Albanians say they are being kept from  
their homes, schools and a mine in the Serb part of town by the 
NATO forces. However, allowing them to cross would spark far 
greater violence, the peacekeeping forces say.

<HEADLINE> Blackhawks' Dumont Injured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Chicago Blackhawks forward Jean-Pierre Dumont  
left the ice on a stretcher in the third period of Saturday night's 
game against the Pittsburgh Penguins after he was hit by defenseman 
Darius Kasparaitis. 
</P>
<P>
	Dumont was injured 5:04 into the third period when he was caught  
on the chin by Kasparaitis' elbow near the boards as both players 
were skating toward the puck. Dumont was prone on the ice as 
several of his teammates went after Kasparaitis. 
</P>
<P>
	Dumont appeared to be conscious and talking to teammates as he  
was attended to by medical personnel. His neck was immobolized with 
a brace before he was wheeled off the ice. 
</P>
<P>
	Referees Paul Devorski and Brad Watson gave Kasparaitis a  
five-minute major penalty for elbowing and a game misconduct. 
Kasparaitis was playing his first game after missing training camp 
in a contract dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	Dumont, 21, is in his second NHL season with Chicago.

<HEADLINE> Mother Crusades Against Rape Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKWOOD, Mich. (AP) -- The mother of a teen who died after  
drinking a Mountain Dew spiked with a so-called ``date rape'' drug 
is determined to spread the word about the dangers of the 
substance. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's preoccupied every free thought I have,'' Judi Clark said  
this week. ``I dream about it. It's 24 hours a day, seven days a 
week. It's costing my social life, but so what?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her 15-year-old daughter, Samantha Reid, and two girlfriends  
were at a party Jan. 16 in Grosse Ile when three teen-age boys 
allegedly made them drink soda pop laced with GHB, or the related 
substance GBL. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors have said Samantha ingested twice the amount of GHB,  
gamma hydroxybutyrate acid, that is considered lethal. One of the 
other girls required hospitalization, but recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	Facing manslaughter and three felony poisoning counts are Joshua  
Cole and Daniel Brayman, both 18, and Nicholas Holtschlag, 17. 
</P>
<P>
	A person who drinks a soda laced with a few drops of GHB -- which  
is colorless and odorless -- can lose consciousness within 20 
minutes. Victims frequently have no memory of what happened, and 
the drug is difficult to trace, often leaving the body within 24 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug is legal in 30 states and is used by body builders as a  
steroid. Others take it as an aphrodisiac or for weight loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1990, at least 32 deaths and more than 3,500 overdoses  
have been linked to the drug nationwide, according to the Drug 
Enforcement Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Clark and others have created the Samantha Reid Foundation,  
with the goal of warning people about the dangers of GHB. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have that deep-seeded emotional pain you get when you lose a  
child,'' Ms. Clark said. ``It has torn me up emotionally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. House this week passed a bill to tighten federal  
control of GHB and another compound that have been used as ``date 
rape'' drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, introduced by Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., would amend  
the Controlled Substances Act to place GHB on a list of drugs that 
are the most strictly regulated under the federal Controlled 
Substances Act because of their danger. Ketamine, an animal 
tranquilizer, would be listed, but at a lower level of 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would make it illegal to possess GHB with the intent to  
manufacture, distribute or dispense it, with a maximum prison term 
of 20 years for a first offense.

said. ``I hope it continues. I'm sure it will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox cut the New York Yankees lead in the AL Championship  
Series to 2-1 Saturday with a 21-hit attack in a 13-1 win. It was 
somewhat of a slump at home since they won their previous game 
there 23-7 with 24 hits against Cleveland six days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	They play their next two games Sunday and Monday nights before  
cranked-up fans in the coziest ballpark in the majors where they 
have a total of 45 runs in the last 20 innings. They have scored in 
16 of them. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is our home field, our own fans,'' said Jason Varitek,  
who somehow managed to go hitless in four at-bats. ``I don't know 
if it helps, but it can't hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Every other Red Sox starter had at least one hit as the team's  
batting average soared to .448 in three home playoff games, all 
victories. 
</P>
<P>
	And get this: their slugging percentage in those games is .824  
compared to .459 at home during the regular season. Of their 56 
playoff hits at Fenway, 27 went for extra bases, including nine 
homers. 
</P>
<P>
	Compare that to their road problems where they're 1-4 with a  
.225 batting average and four homers in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, they set LCS records with 38 total bases and 10  
extra-base hits. They set ALCS records with 21 hits and a 12-run 
victory margin and tied the ALCS mark with 13 runs. 
</P>
<P>
	And the 21 hits were the most ever against the Yankees in their  
254 postseason games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've played well here at Fenway all year, especially in the  
playoffs,'' said Brian Daubach, who went 2-for-4 with a homer after 
going 1-for-10 in the first two games in New York. ``I think the 
crowd has a lot to do with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, the Red Sox scored six runs over the first three  
innings, one more than their total for the first two games at 
Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The targets at Fenway are inviting. There's the Green Monster in  
left field and Pesky's Pole, the yellow foul pole down the short 
right-field line. 
</P>
<P>
	The fans are invigorating -- cheering every liner and roaring as  
Red Sox runners use the basepaths like a youngster uses a carousel 
that he doesn't want to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always nice to play in your own park,'' said Mike  
Stanley, who went 2-for-4. ``They're not yelling at you so much in 
the on-deck circle. You have the comforts of your own clubhouse. 
It's more relaxing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the regular season, the Red Sox hit .291 at home and .265 on  
the road. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a ballpark that's tailored for offense,'' said Darren  
Lewis. ``I think this team really feeds off the fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boston had lost the first two games of the AL division series in  
Cleveland 3-2 and 11-1. Then they came home to take the next two 
games 9-3 and 23-7. 
</P>
<P>
	Hitting had become such a habit that, for the only time in this  
year's playoffs, it carried over to the road as the Red Sox won the 
clinching fifth game 12-8. 
</P>
<P>
	The road woes resurfaced in Yankee Stadium where Boston lost the  
first two games of the ALCS 4-3 and 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
	John Valentin has been Boston's most valuable hitter at home in  
the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox, facing the embarrassment of being swept by  
Cleveland, were tied 2-2 before Valentin's solo homer in the bottom 
of the sixth of Game 3. The Indians tied it again in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
	But Valentin's two-run double gave the Red Sox the lead for good  
in a six-run seventh. In the next game, he had two homers and seven 
RBIs as the Red Sox tied the series 2-2. They won it the next night 
in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston opened the ALCS in New York, and Valentin went 1-for-8 in  
the two losses. But on Saturday, he set the offensive tone with a 
two-run homer on Roger Clemens' seventh pitch of the game as his 
hyped duel never materialized with Pedro Martinez, who allowed two 
hits and two walks and struck out 12 in seven scoreless innings. 
</P>
<P>
	There were other offensive stars. Nomar Garciaparra went 4-for-5  
and he, Valentin and Daubach homered, while Jose Offerman and Nixon 
each had three hits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't be concerned with how many or how little we score,''  
said Bret Saberhagen, Boston's probable starter in Game 4. ``My job 
is to get them out and give our team a chance to hit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then watch what happens.

<HEADLINE> Memos Reveal FBI Watched Dr. Spock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Newly opened FBI files reveal that former Director  
J. Edgar Hoover ordered extensive surveillance of famed baby expert 
Dr. Benjamin Spock because of his anti-Vietnam war speeches. 
</P>
<P>
	``He reportedly is liberal, `politically speaking,' and his  
stand on nuclear disarmament and some social reforms have caused 
some people (to) question his loyalty,'' Hoover wrote in a 1965 
letter to President Lyndon Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI released more than 1,700 pages of Spock's files after a  
Freedom of Information Act request from The Dallas Morning News, 
which reported on the material Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Spock rose to international renown with his 1946 book on raising  
children, ``Baby and Child Care,'' which sold more that 40 million 
copies. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1990, Life magazine listed him among ``The 100 Most Important  
Americans of the 20th Century,'' and Newsweek in 1994 called him 
``arguably, the most influential American alive today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spock died last year at age 94.  
</P>
<P>
	To the FBI, Spock was a subversive and a ``rabble rouser.''  
</P>
<P>
	The file on Spock provides a window on the government's campaign  
against left-wing protesters of the era, a time of deep suspicion 
and acrimony on both sides of the Vietnam issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The bureau had done a routine background check on the  
pediatrician in 1964 before his appointment by President Johnson to 
the National Advisory Council for the war on poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	A memo to Hoover noted that Spock was ``not known to be a member  
of, or sympathetic to, the Communist Party.'' Nevertheless, his 
anti-war activities -- mainly marches and speeches -- caught the 
bureau's attention. 
</P>
<P>
	Spock urged draftees to resist conscription, and in 1968 he was  
indicted for conspiracy to violate Selective Service laws. Some 
evidence against him was came from an FBI wiretap of his office, 
the files show. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal court convicted Spock, but he was acquitted on appeal.  
</P>
<P>
	Still, the FBI surveillance did not stop, the files demonstrate.  
Spock had been placed on the bureau's ``agitator index,'' with 
information on his activities furnished to the White House ``on a 
continuing basis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By 1972, the bureau was having second thoughts about watching  
Spock. Acting Director L. Patrick Gray asked whether the Spock 
inquiry should be closed, and an FBI official responded: 
</P>
<P>
	``There are more dangerous characters around needing our  
attention. ... The basis for investigation appears to be -- pick 
someone you dislike and start investigating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	FBI spokesman David Miller told the Morning News that such  
tactics are ``of a bygone age.'' Investigative guidelines were 
tightened beginning in the late 1970s, he said.

<HEADLINE> Russian Troops Near Chechan Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Russian artillery and tanks dug in atop a  
hill just outside the Chechen capital Grozny on Saturday in 
preparation for what Moscow said was the next phase in its campaign 
to wipe out insurgents. 
</P>
<P>
	After their deepest push yet into the breakaway republic,  
Russian troops were digging in on heights overlooking the city, 
which was now well within range of Russian artillery. There were no 
indications whether Russian commanders would try to push in to 
Grozny, which is heavily defended by Chechen forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Col. Gen. Viktor Kazantsev said that his troops had finished  
creating a security zone to seal off the militants, and that a 
second phase was underway to wipe out the bases of the insurgents. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will not launch strikes against peaceful villages,'' he  
told The Associated Press on Saturday. ``We will destroy the 
bandits on the territory of Chechnya.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the Russian troops dug in near Grozny, Chechen militants  
led by a prominent warlord struck back with a nighttime raid, 
crossing the Terek River and taking back a small village, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shamil Basayev, who led two separate raids on villages in  
neighboring Dagestan this fall, told The Associated Press his men 
had killed 26 Russian troops in the attack Saturday on the village 
of Shchedrinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	``This war has proved once more that the Russians don't learn  
anything,'' Basayev said. ``They're not a serious opponent. We have 
beat them before and will beat them again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russian forces were badly defeated in a 1994-96 war in the  
republic, eventually withdrawing and giving Chechnya de facto 
independence. But Russia's military commanders say they can defeat 
the insurgents this time. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian side said it was making extensive progress with few  
losses. A military spokesman on Saturday said units of Russia's 
58th Army had taken control of the highway linking Grozny with 
Nazran, the capital of Chechnya's western neighbor Ingushetia, the 
ITAR-Tass news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The spokesman also said that the Chechen guerrillas suffered  
``serious losses'' from Russian artillery and air raids on several 
villages on Friday and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Before its push toward the Chechen capital, Russia had overrun  
Chechnya's northern plains, halting their operations for a while 
along the line of the Terek River. The militants have been 
reluctant to hit north of the river, where the plains favor the 
Russian tanks and big guns. 
</P>
<P>
	But the latest movements and claims from both sides indicated  
that they were gearing up for heavy fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	Kazantsev, at a news conference Friday, said Russian troops in  
Chechnya suffered 47 people killed and 33 wounded since Sept. 25. 
They also lost one tank, five armored personnel carriers and two 
other combat vehicles to enemy fire. At least 1,500 rebels have 
been killed, Kazantsev claimed. 
</P>
<P>
	Chechen officials have said that hundreds of Russian soldiers  
have been killed, and put their own losses at just a few dozen. 
Neither side's claims could be independently confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the 1994-96 war, the current campaign has widespread  
public support among most Russians. Four September apartment bomb 
blasts that killed 300 people have been blamed on Chechen 
militants, and many say they should be destroyed at all costs.

<HEADLINE> Indians Fire Manager Mike Hargrove </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Before Mike Hargrove became their manager, the  
Indians were baseball's biggest joke, and Cleveland was a wasteland 
for players, coaches and managers. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not the place to be.  
</P>
<P>
	But Hargrove helped change Cleveland's image, turning a  
laughingstock franchise into an envied one. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite all his successes -- 721 victories, five AL Central  
titles and two World Series trips -- Hargrove couldn't bring 
Cleveland a World Series title. 
</P>
<P>
	And Friday, that fact, coupled with another disappointing  
postseason for the Indians, cost Hargrove his job. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove, who eight years ago inherited an Indians team which  
would lose 105 games, was fired by general manager John Hart just 
four days after Cleveland's collapse against the Boston Red Sox in 
the AL playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``John told me that he decided that he needed to make a  
change,'' Hargrove said. ``That the team needed a new voice. That 
he wanted a new environment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can accept that reason. I can live with that reason. I'm not  
saying I agree with it, but I can accept that rather than him 
saying I didn't know how to do my job or that the players didn't 
respect me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After he was dismissed during an afternoon meeting with Hart,  
Hargrove spent several hours driving around the Cleveland area 
trying to sort out his thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
	He had heard reports of his firing on local radio, and listened  
to Hart's news conference during which the GM talked about his team 
needing a manager who could get them to the ``next level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``And that's so wrong,'' Hargrove said, fighting back tears, his  
voice choking with emotion. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart said no single event prompted the firing, which came after  
the Indians lost their third straight game to Boston. But 
Cleveland's inability to put the Red Sox away, and the complete 
disintegration of the Indians' pitching staff in the final three 
games, certainly factored into Hart's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm flabbergasted,'' Atlanta manager Bobby Cox said. ``That's  
really a shocker. ... To me, he's a real good manager. There must 
have been underlying problems with the front office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indians pitchers gave up 44 runs in the final three games,  
including a postseason-record 23 in Game 4. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove, who was second-guessed for some of his pitching moves  
in Game 3, said he doesn't think he's being used as a scapegoat by 
Hart. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't pitch in the 23-run game,'' Hargrove said. ``I don't  
think I've been set up as the fall guy. We just didn't get the job 
done in the postseason and somebody has to be responsible, and I'm 
responsible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hart said the team would immediately begin interviewing  
candidates to replace Hargrove. The Indians coaching staff, with 
the exception of bullpen coach Luis Isaac, has been given 
permission to explore other opportunities, Hart said. On Thursday, 
pitching coach Phil Regan resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart set no deadline for hiring someone.  
</P>
<P>
	Among the names that could surface are Atlanta hitting  
instructor and former Rockies manager Don Baylor, Indians coach 
Brian Graham, Indians batting instructor Charlie Manuel, former 
Detroit manager Buddy Bell and New York Yankees coaches Chris 
Chambliss and Willie Randolph. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove, 49, had just completed his eighth full season with the  
Indians, and is the second-winningest manager in club history, 
behind Lou Boudreau's 728. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been able to oversee the resurgence on the field of a  
proud franchise that was in a very sad state,'' Hargrove said. 
</P>
<P>
	A former Indians player, Hargrove became manager on July 6,  
1991. By 1995, Hargrove's Indians won 100 games and the first of 
five straight AL Central titles in their new home at Jacobs Field. 
In '95 and 1997, Cleveland won the AL championship. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hargrove's inability to get Cleveland its first World Series  
title since 1948 cost him his job. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Indians won the first two games against Boston,  
Cleveland appeared in control of the series. But Game 3 starter 
Dave Burba had to leave after four innings with a strained forearm, 
leading to some harshly criticized pitching moves by Hargrove. 
</P>
<P>
	``Am I perfect?'' he said. ``No. I make mistakes like everybody  
else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Cleveland easily won its division year after year,  
Hargrove was constantly second-guessed and many wondered why a team 
with so much talent couldn't win a World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	With the addition of All-Star second baseman Roberto Alomar,  
Cleveland looked set this year for another World Series run. But 
injuries, another year of suspect pitching and some questionable 
moves left the Indians short. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a difficult year, given the expectations that we had  
coming out of spring training,'' Hargrove said. ``It was a very 
stressful season, maybe the most stressful I've had. People thought 
that all I had to do was push a button and everything would be all 
right. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there is a perception that managing the Cleveland  
Indians is a cushy job,'' Hargrove said. ``There's a lot more to do 
than just fill out the lineup card.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And that wasn't always easy.  
</P>
<P>
	The grumblings about Hargrove increased in July, when he  
incorrectly filled out his team's lineup card, forcing Indians 
pitcher Charles Nagy to bat against Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he had any regrets, Hargrove on Friday paused and said  
he couldn't think of any. 
</P>
<P>
	``Except for maybe checking that lineup card over one more  
time,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove enjoyed a good relationship with his players.  
Affectionately known as ``Grover'' around Cleveland, he was a 
fixture on local television and radio, not only as the manager but 
as a commercial pitchman. 
</P>
<P>
	His tenure as manager was third in the major leagues behind  
Minnesota's Tom Kelly and Cox. Hargrove was signed through 2000, 
with a club option for 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would manage again next year if the right job presented  
itself,'' said Hargrove, who will be paid about $600,000 through 
next season. ``But over the winter, I want to relax. I told (wife) 
Sharon that I don't have to answer to anybody but her now.''

<HEADLINE> Radio Storyteller Shepherd Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jean Shepherd, the prolific radio raconteur  
whose easy storytelling style earned comparisons to fellow 
Midwesterner Mark Twain, died early Saturday. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
	Shepherd, once described by media critic Marshall McLuhan as  
``the first radio novelist,'' died in a hospital near his home in 
Sanibel Island, Fla., said his longtime friend and business 
adviser, Irwin Zwilling. 
</P>
<P>
	Shepherd spent 21 years on 50,000-watt WOR-AM in New York City,  
attracting a large, loyal following along the Eastern seaboard. He 
worked without a script, conjuring tales based on his Indiana 
upbringing, creating characters like his alter-ego, Ralph Parker, 
and his neighbors, the Bumpuses. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there was ever a voice to hypnotize ... it was Old Shep's;  
familiar but not condescending; sharing (it seemed) confidences 
with masculine camaraderie; constantly interrupting itself in a 
stream-of-consciousness more properly described as a torrent,'' 
read a 1971 profile of Shepherd in The New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
	In a move that likely inspired the climactic scene in the movie  
``Network,'' Shepherd would tell his listeners to crank up the 
volume on their radios and scream along with him. ``Drop the tools, 
we've got you covered!'' was one of Shepherd's favorite shout-along 
phrases. 
</P>
<P>
	Shepherd, while best known for his radio work, excelled as a  
multimedia performer. His films included the 1983 classic ``A 
Christmas Story,'' a sardonic look at the holiday that he wrote and 
narrated. He had hoped to call it ``Satan's Revenge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His writing appeared in a vast assortment of publications, from  
the Times to National Lampoon. He wrote several books, including 
1966's ``In God We Trust'' and the 1971 story collection, ``Wanda 
Hickey's Night of Golden Memories and Other Disasters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shepherd did a pair of syndicated PBS TV programs, ``Jean  
Shepherd's America'' and ``Shepherd's Pie,'' and often sold out 
Carnegie Hall for his live shows. 
</P>
<P>
	He was born July 21, 1921, in Hammond, Ind. -- a town that later  
became ``Hohman'' in his tales. He began his radio career at age 
16, doing weekly sportscasts for a local station. 
</P>
<P>
	Shepherd served in World War II in the Army Signal Corps,  
developing a distaste for authority that later cropped up in his 
stories. He did radio shows in Cincinnati and Philadelphia before 
briefly moving into TV. 
</P>
<P>
	His Philadelphia TV program, ``Rear Bumper,'' attracted the eye  
of original ``Tonight'' show host Steve Allen, who recommended 
Shepherd as his replacement on the NBC fixture. 
</P>
<P>
	When that didn't work out, Shepherd launched his career at WOR,  
performing in off-hour shifts for an audience that he dubbed the 
``Night People.'' The station's powerful signal attracted diehard 
Shepherd-philes from Canada to Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, Shepherd stayed out of the public eye, making  
infrequent radio appearances. His last radio date came on WFAN-AM 
in New York in September 1996, appearing on a show co-hosted by 
Zwilling. 
</P>
<P>
	Shepherd's third wife, Leigh, died last year after 21 years of  
marriage. The couple had no children, and there were no survivors, 
Zwilling said.

<HEADLINE> Reed Helps Mets Extend Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For seven innings Rick Reed was absolutely  
brilliant, using pinpoint control to silence the Atlanta Braves and 
keep the New York Mets alive. 
</P>
<P>
	Three pitches into the eighth inning, Reed thought he had cost  
the Mets their season. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I could've crawled under the mound, I would have,'' Reed  
said Saturday night of the consecutive homers by Brian Jordan and 
Ryan Klesko that gave Atlanta a 2-1 lead and left them six outs 
away from the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets made an amazing comeback in bottom of the eighth to  
beat the Braves 3-2 and cut their lead in the best-of-7 NL 
Championship Series to 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
	For seven innings Reed was better than any of Atlanta's more  
accomplished starters had been during the series. Making just his 
second career postseason start, Reed needed only 70 pitches to get 
through seven innings, facing the minimum number of hitters. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seemed like they came out swinging and that seemed to work  
to my advantage, especially with the breaking ball,'' Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
	The only hit he allowed came in the fourth when Bret Boone  
singled. Boone was later caught stealing by Mike Piazza and Reed 
didn't allow another runner until the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	The way Reed was pitching, it looked like John Olerud's  
sixth-inning homer would be more than enough for the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	``He moved the ball around well tonight,'' said Piazza, who  
thought Reed pitched even better than he did two weeks ago when his 
three-hit shutout against Pittsburgh moved New York into a tie for 
the wild-card lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was locating his fastball well. It was very effective. I  
saw some pretty good hitters take some pretty bad swings at the 
breaking ball,'' Piazza said. 
</P>
<P>
	Not in the eighth inning.  
</P>
<P>
	Jordan hit the first pitch of the eighth over the center-field  
fence and two pitches Klesko cleared the wall in right. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, I think I was trying to hit with my fastball on the  
corner, and then they got them that time,'' Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed walked behind the mound, hanging his head and muttering to  
himself. Piazza came out to console him and pitching coach Dave 
Wallace trudged to the mound to relieve Reed. 
</P>
<P>
	It looked like his -- and the Mets -- season was over. New York  
will keep playing, but without at least one more win, Reed might 
only be able to watch.

<HEADLINE> Service Held for Wilt Chamberlain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Wilt Chamberlain was remembered Saturday more  
for his curiosity, intellect and quiet generosity than his 
unparalleled abilities on the basketball court. 
</P>
<P>
	Laughter punctuated the 1 1/2-hour memorial service at City of  
Angels Church of Religious Science, where about 800 people 
celebrated the 7-foot-1 Hall of Famer. 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain died Tuesday of apparent heart failure. He was 63.  
His body was cremated. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Wilt's life, there were no sad songs. He lived his to the  
fullest,'' said Meadowlark Lemon, a Chamberlain teammate on the 
Harlem Globetrotters. 
</P>
<P>
	Others attending included Bill Russell, whose Boston Celtic  
teams twice beat Chamberlain's teams in the NBA finals; Alex 
Hannum, who coached Chamberlain and the Philadelphia 76ers to the 
NBA title in 1967; NBA greats Elgin Baylor, Connie Hawkins, Bob 
Lanier, Nate Thurmond, Bill Walton and Jerry West. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell, also a Hall of Fame center, recalled his intense  
showdowns with Chamberlain, who was 3 inches taller and 50 pounds 
heavier. Although Russell's Celtics had a 29-20 edge in 
regular-season games, Chamberlain averaged 25.7 points and 28 
rebounds to Russell's 14.9 points and 24.7 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``He sent me through hell so many nights, but it was not a  
rivalry, it was a competition,'' Russell said. ``As we got older, 
the more we liked each other because we knew, basically, we were 
joined at the hips. We were both important to each other because we 
both knew what we were doing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew how good he was and he knew that I knew how good he  
was,'' Russell said, drawing laughter. ``I'll just say that as far 
as I'm concerned, he and I will be friends through eternity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two photos graced the church's stage: the famous black and white  
shot of Chamberlain holding up a piece of paper with 100 on it 
after he scored that many points in a game and, a color photo of 
him smiling in his Los Angeles Lakers jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	But only one speaker made a passing reference to Chamberlain's  
incredible statistics, including the 100-point game, the 55-rebound 
game (against Russell) and the five seasons averaging at least 40 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the memories focused on Chamberlain away from the court,  
including his habit of phoning friends and family at 3 a.m. to quiz 
them about geography or history. 
</P>
<P>
	``He lived a really good life,'' said Sy Goldberg, Chamberlain's  
attorney and friend of 40 years. ``He didn't want to be a 
basketball player, he wanted to be the man for all seasons, and I 
think he was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goldberg said Chamberlain's tough exterior hid a softer side.  
</P>
<P>
	``He would give money to almost anyone who needed it,'' Goldberg  
said. ``The important thing was you were to keep your mouth shut 
about it. No one could publicize his philanthropy. It was always 
direct to the person who needed it and there was no publicity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Shaw co-wrote Chamberlain's first autobiography, which  
Chamberlain insisted on titling: ``Wilt: Just Like Any Other 7-Foot 
Black Millionaire who Lives Next Door.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw recalled being with Chamberlain and three others 20 years  
ago in a boat that pulled up 4 feet short of the dock on the San 
Francisco Bay. Chamberlain planted his left foot on the dock, his 
right foot in the boat and lifted his four companions ``like a 
5-pound sack of flour.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What I remembered most was not the feat of strength, but the  
determination to overcome any obstacle, the determination to help 
his friends and his ability to laugh at the absurdity of any 
situation,'' Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain, nicknamed ``Stilt'' and ``The Big Dipper'' during  
his career, loved to talk and friends often found themselves doing 
most of the listening. 
</P>
<P>
	``I imagine he's up in heaven now right next to the other Big  
Dipper looking God straight in the eye -- somebody bigger than him 
finally -- making some outlandish statement or other,'' Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernie Casey, a former wideout for the San Francisco 49ers and  
Los Angeles Rams, became friends with Chamberlain late in their 
respective careers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was fascinated by this man's versatility as a human being --  
inquisitive, intelligent, full of trivia,'' Casey said. ``He could 
quote statistics from 1910 and he loved ... that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After retiring from the NBA, Chamberlain kept himself in shape  
playing volleyball and running marathons. He wrote books, did some 
acting and honed his investment abilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was so busy doing, I'm not surprised he had a tired  
heart,'' said Barbara O. Lewis, one of Chamberlain's four sisters. 
</P>
<P>
	She recalled Chamberlain as a 5-year-old sneaking outside at 5  
a.m. in his native Philadelphia to help the men who delivered ice 
and milk. 
</P>
<P>
	When his mother asked what he was doing, Chamberlain replied,  
``I'm strong, Mom, and I'm smart. I'm going to make me a lot of 
money one day and I can't stay in the bed. I got things I got to 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis said her parents showered love on their nine children and  
three others the family took in. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had such a gift of love and that gift spread right through  
him,'' she said. ``He ended up being a giving, loving, big-mouthed 
person, but a loving person.''

<HEADLINE> No.2 Penn St 23, No. 18 Ohio St. 10 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) -- Don't be deceived by the final score:  
No. 2 Penn State's 23-10 victory over No. 18 Ohio State was a rout, 
plain and simple. 
</P>
<P>
	Had the Nittany Lions not stubbed their toes nearly every time  
they moved inside the Buckeyes 25-yard line, who knows how large 
the winning margin would have been? 
</P>
<P>
	``We should have put 40 on the board,'' fullback Mike Cerimele  
said Saturday after catching a 6-yard touchdown pass from Kevin 
Thompson on the game's opening possession. ``We had two field goals 
blocked, we stopped ourselves inside their 25 all day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then he pointed to his noggin: ``Stupid head problems. We have  
to cut them out or it will catch up to us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Penn State (7-0, 3-0 Big Ten) wasn't about to be caught by Ohio  
State (4-3, 1-2), which managed only 11 first downs and 143 total 
yards while the Nittany Lions were rolling up 422, including 306 on 
the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric McCoo slipped tackles from get-go and finished with a  
career-best 211 yards on 22 carries, including runs of 53, 43, 24 
and 22 yards. He also caught four passes for another 47 yards as 
the Lions won their ninth straight game -- the second-longest 
winning streak among major schools behind Marshall's 10 in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't do anything different,'' said McCoo, a sophomore  
whose previous top game was a 206-yard effort against Michigan 
State last season. ``Everybody thinks we're fooling people. We're 
just running off tackle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Nittany Lions also gave Joe Paterno career win No. 314,  
tying him for third place with Amos Alonzo Stagg for most victories 
among major college coaches. Bear Bryant has 323, and Pop Warner 
319. 
</P>
<P>
	Paterno, in his 34th season, was more concerned with mistakes  
than history. The Lions were penalized 10 times for 85 yards and 
Kevin Thompson fumbled in the end zone to hand the Buckeyes their 
only TD of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were in scoring position and then our own carelessness and  
bad plays took us right out of it,'' Paterno said. ``There was 
absolutely no reason for (the blocked field goals). That could have 
cost us the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the Lions' best defensive effort of the season made sure  
Ohio State and quarterback Steve Bellisari couldn't take advantage. 
Bellisari ran for his life as the Beaver Stadium crowd of 97,007 
roared in approval. The left-hander was sacked eight times -- 2 1/2 
credited to linebacker LaVar Arrington -- and was 7-of-21 for 78 
yards and an interception. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could not get the ball rolling today,'' said Bellisari, who  
left the game for one play with 2:32 left after taking a vicious 
hit from Arrington in the upper chest. ``I saw a lot of him. He got 
to me, knocked me down, knocked the wind out of me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Penn State led 13-3 with 3:40 left in the half, but was backed  
up to its own 6 when Thompson was slammed from behind by linebacker 
Na'il Diggs and fumbled, with free safety Gary Berry recovering in 
the end zone for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson sustained a slightly separated right shoulder on the  
play and sat out the rest of the game. His status for next week's 
game against Purdue was uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
	With Rashard Casey running the offense in the second half, Penn  
State scored on its first possession to take a 20-10 lead. Casey, 
who has alternated with Thompson all year, capped a seven-play, 
62-yard drive with a 5-yard TD run on a perfectly executed bootleg, 
faking two handoffs, putting the ball on his hip and rolling left 
past a baffled Buckeyes defense. Casey was 11-of-15 for 109 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Travis Forney, who had field goals blocked in the first and  
third quarters, converted from 38, 39 and 28 yards, the final one 
coming early in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss not only dropped Ohio State out of the big bowl  
picture, but probably ended their chances for a Big Ten title as 
well. The Buckeyes, three-game losers this early for the first time 
since coach John Cooper's first season in 1988, still have games 
remaining against nationally ranked Michigan State and Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you can't block and you can't tackle then you are not going  
to beat a good football team,'' said Cooper, who earlier in the 
week said Penn State would win if both teams played their best. It 
was a psychological ploy that failed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lions wasted little time moving to a 7-0 lead. Thompson hit  
McCoo with a 20-yard pass to open the game, and then McCoo slipped 
two would-be tacklers with nifty inside cuts and ran 53 yards to 
the Ohio State 7. Two plays later, Thompson connected with Cerimele 
just 1:35 into the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State's Dan Stultz kicked a 47-yard field goal midway  
through the quarter, but the Lions made it 10-3 on Forney's 38-yard 
field goal four plays after holder Matt Senneca ran 10 yards for 
first down on a fake field goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Penn State's run for its first national title since 1986  
moves forward. Ahead are road games against Purdue, Illinois and 
Michigan State and home games with Minnesota and Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are far from the finish line,'' linebacker Brandon Short  
said. ``We get Drew Brees next week, and that's what we'll get 
ready for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paterno, saying his players have been besieged by fans and  
reporters all season, cut off most interviews this week in a rare 
policy change. 
</P>
<P>
	After the game, McCoo said: ``Everybody was going to say what  
they say every week, anyway. We just didn't have to practice our 
speech.''

<HEADLINE> Martinez Is Priceless for Red Sox </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The ``M-V-P!'' chants coming from the Fenway Park  
stands don't quite do justice to what Pedro Martinez has meant to 
the Boston Red Sox this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Valuable?  
</P>
<P>
	Try priceless.  
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox ace rescued his team from another deep hole  
Saturday, striking out 12 in seven shutout innings to help Boston 
beat the New York Yankees 13-1 and avoid a three-game deficit in 
the American League championship series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if we would be in the postseason without him,''  
said Bret Saberhagen, who will start Game 4 for Boston. ``He's the 
heart and soul of this team. You can't say enough about him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 12 strikeouts were the most for a Red Sox pitcher in a  
postseason history that includes Cy Young, Babe Ruth and Smoky Joe 
Wood. Martinez did not allow a batter to reach second base -- he 
hasn't, in fact, since the third inning of the first-round series 
against Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	In 14 1-3 innings since then, Indians and Yankees hitters are  
just 2-for-45 against him with two singles, five walks and 22 
strikeouts. He has struck out at least one batter in all but two 
playoff innings while running up a 17-inning shutout streak. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Martinez said Saturday that he hasn't felt the same since  
straining a back muscle in Game 1 against the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am hurting. I'm hurting in every pitch I throw,'' he said.  
``But it doesn't matter how much I hurt. If I can throw the ball 
over, and get one out and get the team to win a game, I'm going to 
do it. That's what I'm here for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It sure is.  
</P>
<P>
	Martinez is certain to be named baseball's best pitcher this  
year and some say he is the regular season MVP, though there are 
probably enough voters who won't pick a pitcher that he will have 
to settle for his second Cy Young Award. 
</P>
<P>
	But there's only one reason why the Red Sox are still playing.  
</P>
<P>
	``If we didn't have Pedro,'' third baseman John Valentin said,  
``I don't know if we'd be here today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez went 23-4 in the regular season, and the Red Sox won  
two of his three no-decisions. That means Boston, which won 94 
games, was just 69-63 when he didn't pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	He also picked up an All-Star game MVP right here in Fenway  
Park, striking out four MVPs and a home run champ in two innings of 
work. 
</P>
<P>
	But his best performance came Sept. 10 at Yankee Stadium -- where  
he'll start Game 7, if the series makes it that far -- when he 
struck out 17 and allowed only one hit. Following his lead, the Red 
Sox swept the three-game series. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't seem as healthy as he was in September. You can see  
he's not 100 percent. But he still dominates like he did,'' New 
York shortstop Derek Jeter said. ``We felt the whole way we could 
come back. But it was getting later and later, and we couldn't do 
anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez left his Game 1 start against Cleveland after four  
innings, but he came out of the bullpen in the decisive fifth game 
and fanned eight in six no-hit innings to complete Boston's 
comeback from a two-game deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	Add it all up, and Martinez was pretty valuable this season --  
maybe even the Most Valuable Player. 
</P>
<P>
	Even at $12.5 million a year.  
</P>
<P>
	``With what he's done, it's tough not to say that he is MVP,''  
said Saberhagen, a two-time Cy Young-winner himself. ``He's the 
best pitcher I've ever seen, and he means an awful lot to this 
team.''

<HEADLINE> Big Quake Potential Looms for Calif. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Just two days before this weekend's magnitude 7.0 earthquake in  
Southern California, the U.S. Geological Survey released a grim 
forecast: 
</P>
<P>
	There is a 70 percent chance of a major earthquake in the San  
Francisco Bay area in the next 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Geological Survey said its estimate is for an  
earthquake at or above a magnitude of 6.7 -- the strength of the 
1994 Northridge quake that killed 67 people and caused $20 billion 
in damage in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
	The forecast, which comes with an uncertainty factor of plus or  
minus 10 percent, is different from earlier projections because it 
expands the danger zone from the Pacific Ocean to the Sacramento 
Delta, about 40 miles inland. 
</P>
<P>
	Another report released Thursday, by the Association of Bay Area  
Governments, said hundreds of thousands could be left homeless if a 
large quake hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years ago, the 7.1-magnitude Loma Prieta quake rocked  
Northern California during the World Series and brought down a 
50-foot section of the upper deck of the bridge, which connects San 
Francisco and Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	That damage was fixed, but seismologists say the eastern span  
could collapse in a large quake. Regional authorities approved 
construction of a new single-tower suspension structure for the 
eastern span in 1998 but progress has been held up by political 
squabbling.

<HEADLINE> Bill Loaded With Home Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- While battling over the budget on other  
fronts, Republicans and President Clinton agreed on a $99 billion 
measure for veterans, housing and space programs that also is 
loaded with hundreds of projects for lawmakers' home districts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate voted 93-5 to send the bill to Clinton on Friday, a  
day after the House approved it. But with other spending fights 
raging, another stopgap bill will be needed next week to keep 
federal agencies open, and White House officials indicated that 
Clinton would sign one. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders insist they are guided by a desire to  
constrain federal spending, but the veterans-housing measure 
suggests that other forces are afoot as well. It distributes 
hundreds of millions of dollars for home-district projects across 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
	It takes nearly six pages of fine print in the Congressional  
Record to list the measure's community development projects, just 
one of several categories of spending directed to specific sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Included is $1.5 million for a loan fund to help Oklahoma City  
recover from the 1995 bombing of its federal building; $250,000 for 
Virginia Beach to expand its marine science museum; $300,000 to 
restore a historic boiler house in Cresson, Pa.; and $400,000 to 
build a memorial in Springfield, Mass., for native son Theodor 
Geisel, better known as Dr. Seuss, who died in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill once faced a veto threat, but that vanished after  
Republicans agreed to add $7 billion above what the House 
originally approved. In the end, NASA, the Environmental Protection 
Agency and veterans' health-care got even more than Clinton 
initially requested, and the GOP dropped plans to cut some 
low-income housing programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure is the 10th of the 13 annual spending bills for  
fiscal 2000, which began Oct. 1. Clinton has vetoed one financing 
the District of Columbia, and is poised to veto a second covering 
foreign aid. 
</P>
<P>
	Three others are still working through Congress in the face of  
veto threats, covering the departments of Labor, Health and Human 
Services, Education, Interior, Commerce, Justice, State, and some 
smaller agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Underlining the remaining tensions, House Appropriations  
Committee Chairman Bill Young, R-Fla., accused Democrats of 
withdrawing commitments to support a final $14 billion Interior 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it was part of a ``blatant partisan move'' to blame  
Republicans for failing to quickly finish spending work. Democrats 
said they had not made such commitments for a bill they said has 
anti-environmental provisions and lacks enough money. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders want to send Clinton all the bills by next  
Thursday, when a measure keeping agencies temporarily open expires. 
They believe this would bolster their argument that if another 
stopgap extension is needed, it is only because Clinton vetoed 
bills he felt did not spend enough. 
</P>
<P>
	It is all but certain that some of the spending measures won't  
be finished by Thursday night. GOP leaders contemplate a second 
extension that would last a week or more. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no intent to shut the government down, not on our  
part, not on the president's part,'' said House Speaker Dennis 
Hastert, R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart signaled that Clinton would  
sign another extension if lawmakers ``come back here and if they 
can make a credible case about why they need an extra week to 
finish the work.''

<HEADLINE> House Lawmaker Touts Charters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republicans gave strong support today to a  
bill coming up for a House vote next week that would make it easier 
for poor children to go to better schools outside their 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	In the weekly GOP radio address, Rep. Bill Goodling urged  
Congress to pass the measure, which cleared Goodling's Committee on 
Education and the Workforce by a 42-6 vote Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	It would provide money to allow parents of poor children in  
low-performing schools to send the children elsewhere, either a 
better public or charter school. Money would be available to 
transport them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every American child deserves a quality education,'' Goodling,  
R-Pa., said today in the weekly Republican radio address. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodling said the law would help more children attend such  
schools as the Edison-Friendship Charter School in Washington. 
Charters are public schools allowed special leeway from most 
regulations as long as they boost pupils' achievement. They often 
are organized by parents and community business leaders.

<P>
	He called Edison-Friendship ``a remarkable school in the shadow  
of the Capitol's dome.'' The 924-student school has a waiting list 
of 500, offers character education, an eight-hour school day, 
shorter summer vacations and a home computer for each child once 
their parents receive computer training. 
</P>
<P>
	By its first anniversary in September, students' test scores had  
doubled, Goodling said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also praised a second plan to give states and all public  
schools more flexibility in spending federal money in exchange for 
proven student achievement. That plan, opposed by Democrats, also 
was passed by Goodling's committee Wednesday and is moving on to 
the House. It faces the threat of a veto by President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	A Senate GOP plan released Friday also would increase the pool  
of federal money that states and school boards can spend on 
education priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Such laws are important, Goodling said, because ``Local  
supervision of schools has been the hallmark and promise of 
American education.''

<HEADLINE> Slow Trains Draw Ire of Ohio Towns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FOSTORIA, Ohio (AP) -- Children climb under boxcars to get home  
from school. Firefighters send two trucks on different routes to 
the same fire -- just to be sure one gets through. One neighborhood 
can be entirely hemmed in by trains. 
</P>
<P>
	No wonder many people in northern Ohio are experiencing ``rail  
rage,'' as a bottleneck of train traffic boils tempers and tests 
patience. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've threatened to do everything but blow the damn train,''  
Huron County Sheriff Dick Sutherland said at a recent town meeting 
-- where the only topic was train traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	The rail jams are being blamed on one of the most massive rail  
acquisitions in U.S. history. Traffic along some routes in the 
Midwest has tripled since CSX Corp. and Norfolk Southern Corp. 
started splitting up Conrail's routes in June. 
</P>
<P>
	There simply were too many trains and not enough tracks.  
</P>
<P>
	``We absorbed more cars than could be processed efficiently, and  
we found ourselves in a deep hole from which we're having a hard 
time recovering,'' Norfolk Southern Chairman David Goode said last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	CSX and Norfolk Southern spent two years planning the Conrail  
split, but have had problems with computerized routing systems and 
staffing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal first and foremost is not blocking railroad  
crossings,'' said Norfolk Southern spokeswoman Susan Terpay. ``It's 
impacting our customers and the communities we work in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both railroads have lost business to trucking companies because  
of train delays. United Parcel Service and General Motors Corp., 
two of the largest rail customers, turned to trucking companies in 
order to meet shipping deadlines. 
</P>
<P>
	But for residents in the affected areas, waiting for stopped  
trains is becoming more than an inconvenience -- it's downright 
dangerous, say ambulance drivers and firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
	This summer, a train crew blocked two crossings for three hours  
and forced an ambulance to make a 21-mile detour while carrying a 
patient to a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	In Fostoria, a town with three major rail lines and 100 trains a  
day, the traffic forces the fire department to alter its routes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time we go on a run, we'll send one truck one way and one  
the other way so that at least one truck will make it,'' said Fire 
Lt. Bob Young. 
</P>
<P>
	One section of town known as the ``Iron Triangle'' is completely  
enclosed by railroad tracks. Firefighters were once blocked from 
getting to a kitchen fire in the neighborhood and had to crawl 
under a train with extinguishers in tow. 
</P>
<P>
	Another time, three police officers who had responded to a  
traffic accident inside the triangle couldn't get out. And they 
were the only officers on duty. 
</P>
<P>
	In Sandusky, children have crawled under stopped trains that  
were blocking streets, said City Manager Gerald Lechner. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say there is little they can do to get the trains  
moving. Cities can fine railroads a maximum of $1,000 for blocking 
a crossing, but townships and counties are limited to $65 fines. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fines are a spit in the wind for the railroads,'' said  
Republican state Rep. Rex Damschroder. He and other Ohio lawmakers 
are working on legislation to make the penalties a lot more costly.

 *Donald D. Dahl    	
</P>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Donald D. Dahl, who spent 28 years with  
The Albuquerque Tribune before retiring in 1982 as news editor, 
died Friday. He was 79. 
</P>
<P>
	Dahl began his career at The Tribune in 1954 as a copy editor.  
He later was a telegraph editor before becoming news editor. 
</P>
<P>
	He was born in Savage, Mont., but moved to Rhame, N.D., when he  
was a year old. He helped his mother publish the weekly Rhame 
Review. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was setting type by the time I was 15 years old,'' Dahl used  
to say. 
</P>
<P>
	He received a journalism degree from the University of North  
Dakota in 1941, then served in the Navy during World War II. After 
the war, he earned a master's degree from the Columbia University 
School of Journalism. 
</P>
<P>
	Dahl also worked as managing editor of the Navy News, a daily  
newspaper published by the Navy in Manila. He also worked for The 
Providence Journal-Bulletin of Rhode Island and for United Press. 

</P>

 *Donald Riddle    	
</P>
<P>
	NEWTOWN, Pa. (AP) -- Donald H. Riddle, the former president of  
the John Jay College of Criminal Justice of the City University of 
New York, died Monday after a long illness. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
	Riddle was credited for changing the college's curriculum to  
produce more highly educated law enforcement officers by 
introducing required courses in language and the humanities. Before 
his tenure, from 1968 to 1975, police were commonly trained as 
little more than gun-carrying security officers. 
</P>
<P>
	``When people asked President Riddle how to educate the police,  
he famously replied, 'Like everybody else,''' said Gerald W. Lynch, 
the college's president. 
</P>
<P>
	Riddle also gained national attention in 1970 for standing up to  
then-FBI head J. Edgar Hoover on a matter of academic freedom. 

</P>
<P>
 *Luis Sa    	
</P>
<P>
	LISBON, Portugal (AP) -- Luis Sa, a leading member of the  
Portuguese Communist Party and former member of the European 
Parliament, died Friday of a heart attack. He was 47. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in the former Portuguese colony Angola, Sa joined the  
Communist party in 1974, after the April 25 Carnation Revolution 
that toppled a 41-year-long rightist dictatorship. 
</P>
<P>
	A law graduate, he was first elected to the Republican Assembly,  
Portugal's Parliament, in 1991 and was recently re-elected as No. 2 
in the party's list for the general elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Sa also was a member of the European Parliament for a few months  
in 1994. 

</P>
<P>
 *Jean Shepherd    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jean Shepherd, the prolific radio raconteur  
whose easy storytelling style earned comparisons to fellow 
Midwesterner Mark Twain, died Saturday. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
	Shepherd, once described by media critic Marshall McLuhan as  
``the first radio novelist,'' died in a hospital near his home in 
Sanibel Island, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Shepherd spent 21 years on WOR-AM in New York City, attracting a  
large, loyal following along the Eastern seaboard. He worked 
without a script, conjuring tales based on his Indiana upbringing, 
creating characters like his alter-ego, Ralph Parker, and his 
neighbors, the Bumpuses. 
</P>
<P>
	In a move that likely inspired the climactic scene in the movie  
``Network,'' Shepherd would tell his listeners to crank up the 
volume on their radios and scream along with him. ``Drop the tools, 
we've got you covered!'' was one of Shepherd's favorite shout-along 
phrases. 
</P>
<P>
	Shepherd, while best known for his radio work, excelled as a  
multimedia performer. His films included the 1983 classic ``A 
Christmas Story,'' a sardonic look at the holiday that he wrote and 
narrated. He had hoped to call it ``Satan's Revenge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His writing appeared in a vast assortment of publications, from  
The New York Times to National Lampoon. He wrote several books, 
including 1966's ``In God We Trust'' and the 1971 story collection, 
``Wanda Hickey's Night of Golden Memories and Other Disasters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shepherd did a pair of syndicated PBS TV programs, ``Jean  
Shepherd's America'' and ``Shepherd's Pie,'' and often sold out 
Carnegie Hall for his live shows.

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Irving Siders, a producer who took Broadway  
shows on the road across the nation, died Wednesday. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
	For 20 years, Siders organized national tours of Broadway  
productions, from serious drama like Athol Fugard's ``Master Harold 
... and the Boys,'' to rollicking musicals like ``Ain't 
Misbehavin.''' In 1987 he brought a tour back to New York, staging 
a revival of Michael Bennett's ``Dreamgirls,'' which received a 
Tony nomination for best revival. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the course of his career, Siders worked with many of the  
major stars and star makers of the American theater. 
</P>
<P>
	At 16, Siders first took to the road when he left Boston to work  
as a band boy for pianist Fats Waller. Working the city-a-day job 
introduced him to the gritty and seductive world of jazz, clubs and 
show people. 
</P>
<P>
	After World War II, Siders developed a career as a talent  
manager and booking agent for performers including Ella Fitzgerald 
and the Count Basie Band. He later joined the jazz label Verve as a 
manager, and worked briefly as entertainment director for Playboy 
Clubs.

 *Jim Jensen    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Former WCBS-TV anchorman Jim Jensen, whose  
gravelly voice and deliberate demeanor brought three decades of 
news to millions of New York area viewers, died Saturday. He was 
73. 
</P>
<P>
	Jensen apparently suffered a heart attack on Friday, said Carlos  
Hernandez, a WCBS-TV assignment editor. 
</P>
<P>
	Jensen, who began work at WCBS in 1964, covered Robert F.  
Kennedy's Senate campaign, sat behind the anchor desk during the 
1977 New York City blackout and went to Israel to cover the Gulf 
War. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wherever the news was happening, if it was possible for him to  
go, he was there,'' said Chris Borgen, a longtime colleague. 
</P>
<P>
	Jensen, who once played for a minor league baseball team in  
Minneapolis, got a job as a newspaper sportswriter after an injury 
ended his pitching career, Borgen said. He was soon hired by a 
Minneapolis radio station, then moved to Boston, where he spent 
three years reporting for CBS radio and television affiliates. He 
began working as an anchorman soon after his move to WCBS. 
</P>
<P>
	Jensen left WCBS in 1995.  
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife, two daughters and a son.  

</P>
<P>
 *Glen Payne    	
</P>
<P>
	FRANKLIN, Tenn. (AP) -- Gospel singer Glen Payne, the lead  
vocalist of the Cathedrals, died Friday. He was 72. 
</P>
<P>
	Payne was diagnosed with liver cancer six weeks ago.  
</P>
<P>
	``He passed away peacefully without any pain, with his family  
near him. He spent yesterday singing `Victory in Jesus,''' Debbie 
Bennett, a producer and family friend said in a note to fans posted 
on the group's Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	During Payne's nearly 60 years in gospel music, his group won  
numerous awards and was nominated for 11 Grammys. 
</P>
<P>
	His work was honored by inductions into the Gospel Music  
Association's Hall of Fame, the Texas Music Hall of Fame, the 
Southern Gospel Music Association's Hall of Fame and the Radio 
Music Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1951 to 1957, Payne sang in the Stamps-Ozark Quartet before  
leaving to join the Weatherfords. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1963, Payne formed a trio to perform at evangelist Rex  
Humbard's Cathedral of Tomorrow in Akron, Ohio. George Younce 
joined the trio and it changed its name to the Cathedral Quartet. 
</P>
<P>
	Payne and Younce became constants in the group that would  
feature 17 other members over the next 35 years on its way to 
becoming one of the preeminent southern gospel groups.

<HEADLINE> United 2, Fusion 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Forward Jaime Moreno scored both goals  
Saturday night as D.C. United extended its MLS playoff home winning 
streak to 10 games with a 2-0 victory over the Miami Fusion in Game 
1 of the Eastern Conference semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreno drove the middle of the field from the left wing and  
passed to midfielder Marco Etcheverry. He quickly tapped the ball 
right back to Moreno, who blasted a shot from beyond the 18 past 
Fusion goalie Jeff Cassar in the 34th minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreno, assisted by Carey Talley, added an insurance goal in the  
88th minute to complete United's first step in their quest for a 
fourth consecutive berth in the MLS Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory in the best-of-3 series ended a two-game losing  
streak for United and snapped a two-game winning streak by Miami, 
which was 0-4 against D.C. in the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	These teams also met last year in the Eastern Conference semis,  
with United sweeping. United has won seven straight against the 
Fusion. 
</P>
<P>
	Game 2 is at Miami on Oct. 24.  
</P>
<P>
	Moreno, United's most consistently dangerous playmaker  
throughout the regular season, pressured the Fusion with crossing 
passes to the front of the goal in the 23rd and 24th minutes. Roy 
Lassiter failed to convert one of the potential assists with a 
header that sailed wide left. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreno also fired a shot in the 19th minute, which Cassar saved.  
He hit the left post in the 20th minute, and Cassar stopped another 
of Moreno's shots in the 23rd minute.

<HEADLINE> Big Quake Potential Looms for Calif. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Just two days before this weekend's magnitude 7.0 earthquake in  
Southern California, the U.S. Geological Survey released a grim 
forecast: 
</P>
<P>
	There is a 70 percent chance of a major earthquake in the San  
Francisco Bay area in the next 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Geological Survey said its estimate is for an  
earthquake at or above a magnitude of 6.7 -- the strength of the 
1994 Northridge quake that killed 67 people and caused $20 billion 
in damage in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
	The forecast, which comes with an uncertainty factor of plus or  
minus 10 percent, is different from earlier projections because it 
expands the danger zone from the Pacific Ocean to the Sacramento 
Delta, about 40 miles inland. 
</P>
<P>
	Another report released Thursday, by the Association of Bay Area  
Governments, said hundreds of thousands could be left homeless if a 
large quake hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years ago, the 7.1-magnitude Loma Prieta quake rocked  
Northern California during the World Series and brought down a 
50-foot section of the upper deck of the bridge, which connects San 
Francisco and Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	That damage was fixed, but seismologists say the eastern span  
could collapse in a large quake. Regional authorities approved 
construction of a new single-tower suspension structure for the 
eastern span in 1998 but progress has been held up by political 
squabbling.

<HEADLINE> Kwan Unveils Elegant Short Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- If her grades are as high as the marks  
she received Saturday for her new short program, Michelle Kwan will 
soon be an honor student at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing hooky from her freshman studies, the 19-year-old,  
two-time world champion and 1998 Olympic silver medalist 
successfully unveiled an elegant new short program in the Masters 
of Figure Skating, one of the first big competitions of the skating 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``This program is completely different. It's a bluesy version of  
a Beatles song. It's not like Rachmaninoff or classical,'' Kwan 
said. ``I was really at ease. I felt like I was over my skates. 
Today, I just felt like the ice and I were one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan skated to a Jeff Beck version of the Beatles tune ``A Day  
in the Life,'' a natural choice because she said her father ``named 
me after the song (Michelle, a Beatles hit).'' He also named her 
sister, Karen, after another favorite singer, Karen Carpenter. 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan followed her short program with a long routine as elegant  
as her sheer lavender costume to win the women's championship. 
Skating to ``Kissing You'' from the movie ``Romeo and Juliet,'' 
Kwan performed three triple jumps in a mistake-free program that 
earned her her 40th perfect mark of 6.0 as fans littered the ice 
with flowers and stuffed animals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know it was the 40th,'' Kwan said. ``That's  
incredible. These judges don't give 6.0s that easily. What is 
perfect, that's what I'm thinking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite falling twice, Maria Butyrskaya of Russia finished  
second after a dramatic, exquisitely skated long program to a 
Spanish melody by Bizet. 
</P>
<P>
	Todd Eldredge, first after the short program, skated strongly  
and cleanly in the long to beat three other skaters including 
Alexei Yagudin, the two-time world champion from Russia who 
finished second. 
</P>
<P>
	Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov, second after the short  
program, skated well enough in the finale to win the pairs. Kyoko 
Ina and John Zimmerman of the United States came back strong to 
finish second while Xue Shen and Hongbo Zhao of China fell from 
first to third. 
</P>
<P>
	The short program counted for one-third of the final score and  
the long program two-thirds. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the added pressure of college studies, Kwan skated a  
flawless short program, receiving all 5.8 scores for required 
elements and 5.8 and 5.9 marks for presentation to distance her 
competition. Clad in a sparkling red dress with silver slashes, 
Kwan had the crowd at the Brown County Arena standing and cheering 
at the finish of her new 2 1/2-minute routine. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter how many times you do it in the ice rink, in  
practice, it's not the same as getting out there in front of the 
judges, the people. I was really at ease so I just went out and had 
fun,'' said a relieved Kwan. 
</P>
<P>
	Fun is also something Kwan is having in college, which she feels  
is important even though she already has a lucrative career in 
figure skating. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want more than just to be a skater. It's a great  
opportunity,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kwan admits that taking 12 credits while continuing to skate  
competitively has made for a busy life. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got midterms coming up, I've got a paper due, I've pulled  
all-nighters. That's hard when you have to wake up in the morning 
and try to skate,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the short program is ``just for the season'' and won't  
be around for the 2002 Olympics, Kwan will be. The silver medalist 
in 1998 to Tara Lipinski, Kwan will go for the gold in Salt Lake 
City. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't wait until 2002. I'm really excited because it's in  
the United States,'' she said with real enthusiasm. ``I know how 
supportive everybody is. Everybody will be waving the American 
flag. It's going to be awesome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eldredge, who has failed to medal in two Olympics despite an  
impressive career that includes a world championship, will also be 
in Salt Lake City. And his energetic, technically superb short 
program showed he still has the talent to be a medal threat. 
</P>
<P>
	``That has always been something for me for a long time -- I want  
an Olympic medal, I want an Olympic medal,'' he admitted. 
</P>
<P>
	But Eldredge is approaching the 2002 Olympics differently.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's still something that would be nice to have, but the  
priority for me now is to have more fun with skating,'' he said. 
``I think I put a lot of pressure on myself in the last Olympics to 
try to skate better than I normally do. And I think that hurt. I 
think I'll enjoy it more next time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eldredge in 1998 finished fourth, narrowly missing a bronze.

Nikodinov of the United States and Ekaterina Gordeeva of Russia. 
</P>
<P>

all-nighters. That's hard when you have to wake up in the morning 
and try to skate,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the short program is ``just for the season'' and won't  
be around for the 2002 Olympics, Kwan will be. The silver medalist 
in 1998 to Tara Lipinski, Kwan will go for the gold in Salt Lake 
City. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't wait until 2002. I'm really excited because it's in  
the United States,'' she said with real enthusiasm. ``I know how 
supportive everybody is. Everybody will be waving the American 
flag. It's going to be awesome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eldredge, who has failed to medal in two Olympics despite an  
impressive career that includes a world championship, will also be 
in Salt Lake City. And his energetic, technically superb short 
program showed he still has the talent to be a medal threat. 
</P>
<P>
	``That has always been something for me for a long time -- I want  
an Olympic medal, I want an Olympic medal,'' he admitted. 
</P>
<P>
	But Eldredge is approaching the 2002 Olympics differently.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's still something that would be nice to have, but the  
priority for me now is to have more fun with skating,'' he said. 
``I think I put a lot of pressure on myself in the last Olympics to 
try to skate better than I normally do. And I think that hurt. I 
think I'll enjoy it more next time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eldredge in 1998 finished fourth, narrowly missing a bronze.

<HEADLINE> Cup Hangover Plague Winless Buffalo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Four months after Brett Hull's goal beat  
them in the Stanley Cup finals, the Buffalo Sabres are still 
reeling. 
</P>
<P>
	Holdouts and another bad bounce also have conspired to keep the  
Eastern Conference champion Sabres winless with two losses and a 
pair of ties. 
</P>
<P>
	But they hope all that will change with games in Montreal  
tonight and Philadelphia on Sunday. The Flyers also are looking for 
their first win. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres finally have all their players back after several  
training camp no-shows. But the hangover from losing in the Stanley 
Cup finals to the Dallas Stars on a dubious goal persists. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think this Cup hangover is so bad,'' defenseman Jason  
Woolley said. ``I've had worse hangovers than this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The image is frozen: Buffalo Sabres goaltender Dominik Hasek is  
stretched across the crease, a pad extended to each corner. 
</P>
<P>
	Sabres center Brian Holzinger is kicking a skate out behind him  
in hopes of getting a blade on the Stanley Cup-clinching shot that 
Dallas sharpshooter Brett Hull launches with a skate in the crease. 
</P>
<P>
	The controversial shot was counted and the Sabers haven't won  
since. Are they cursed? 
</P>
<P>
	``We just have to play a little harder and play a little  
smarter,'' Sabres wing Dixon Ward said Friday. ``We're going to be 
all right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo, whose streak of futility includes an embarrassing 5-5  
tie with the expansion Atlanta Thrashers in which Hasek was benched 
in the second period, could have offered plenty of plausible 
excuses. 
</P>
<P>
	The playoffs were emotionally and physically draining and a  
short offseason offered little recovery time. Holdouts have yet to 
get up to speed including the team's leading scorer from last year, 
Miroslav Satan, and defensemen Rhett Warrener and Jay McKee. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other defensemen, Alexei Zhitnik and Richard Smehlik, are  
coming off injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have any excuses, but there's no reason to panic or  
to be frustrated at this point,'' forward Geoff Sanderson said. 
``It's only four games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The playoffs are still six months away. ``If we're winless in  
four games and we're the Buffalo Bills, we're worried. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek, who has led the league in save percentage in each of the  
last six seasons, has allowed 11 goals in less than four full games 
including a game-tying pinball of a shot that handcuffed the 
goaltender in the final seconds in a 2-2 tie with Phoenix on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek's solution: Get over it.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's been too much talk about the Stanley Cup finals and  
players holding out in training camp,'' Hasek said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I haven't played my best game yet,'' Hasek said. ``But  
I feel good. Hopefully, we can get our first win this weekend.''

<HEADLINE> Canada GM Plant Denounces Outscoring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Plans by General Motors of Canada Ltd. to end  
production at the St. Therese, Quebec, assembly plant and outsource 
other work could lead to a walk-out by Canadian Auto Workers, union 
president Buzz Hargrove said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The outsourcing positions they have on the table will cause a  
strike,'' Hargrove said at a Toronto news conference. ``Under no 
circumstances are we going to allow outsourcing when we have 
insecurity with workers at St. Therese and other plants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The CAW has set a midnight Tuesday deadline to reach an  
agreement with GM. During 1996 contract talks, the CAW struck GM's 
Oshawa, Ontario, assembly plant, idling some U.S. parts and 
assembly plants. 
</P>
<P>
	A contract with GM is expected to closely model agreements  
already reached with Ford Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler AG. 
</P>
<P>
	Those call for a 3 percent wage increase in each year of a  
three-year package, a $1,000 (Canadian) signing bonus, an improved 
retirement package and other benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove said in July that the future of the St. Therese plant  
and GM plans to outsource work would be key issues in this year's 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowered demand for the Chevrolet Cameros and Pontiac Firebirds  
produced at St. Therese has raised speculation that the plant might 
be closed. GM has said it will cease production of the cars there 
in September 2002, and nothing is scheduled to replace that line, 
Hargrove said. 
</P>
<P>
	GM officials in Detroit and Ontario could not be immediately  
reached for comment Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Keeper Hill Wins Spinster Stakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- This year's Breeder's Cup Distaff was  
shaping up to be a showdown between three top fillies: 
Silverbulletday, Banshee Breeze and Beautiful Pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
	Add a fourth to the mix.  
</P>
<P>
	Keeper Hill, winless since the 1998 Kentucky Oaks, burst through  
the inside in the homestretch and posted a half-length victory over 
favored Banshee Breeze on Saturday in the $555,500 Grade I Three 
Chimneys Spinster Stakes at Keeneland. 
</P>
<P>
	Her time of 1:47/19 for 1 1/8 miles tied the stakes record and  
earned the 4-year-old daughter of Deputy Minister a trip to 
Gulfstream Park on Nov. 6 for the Distaff. 
</P>
<P>
	The win for the hard-luck filly, who had a nasty foot infection  
as late as a week ago, had trainer Robert Frankel near tears. 
</P>
<P>
	``This filly looked so good coming in, so good,'' he said. ``I  
had a feeling we had a great chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Banshee Breeze closed fast to overtake A Lady from Dixie by a  
nose for second. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had every opportunity in the world at the quarter pole and  
we just didn't get the job done,'' said Pat Day, who was aboard 
Banshee Breeze. ``Keeper Hill just kept on running and we really 
had to fight to stay second.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Keeper Hill won a hard-fought duel over Banshee Breeze in last  
year's Kentucky Oaks before finishing third in the 1998 Breeder's 
Cup Distaff behind Banshee Breeze and winner Escena. Banshee 
Breeze, who won this race last year by 12 lengths, and Keeper Hill 
have faced each other six times. Each has bested the other -- 
although not always the winner -- three times. 
</P>
<P>
	``My old adversary is back, that's all I can say,'' said Banshee  
Breeze's trainer Carl Nafzger. ``It was a fast track and the 
fillies hung in there a little better. Keeper Hill got a green trip 
on the inside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Keeper Hill, although consistently in the money, has not won in  
her last 10 starts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never seen her so `toey' as she was today,'' said jockey  
Kent Desormeaux. ``Usually, she falls out of it so badly. But 
today, she had her head up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Keeper Hill broke first but settled in seventh behind the  
leaders. Lines of Beauty set the pace until the final furlong, 
followed closely by Silent Eskimo and A Lady from Dixie until the 
stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	Keeper Hill, moved up gradually and was third at the top of the  
stretch. She then charged up the inside to take the lead right 
before the wire. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was kind of looking around for (Banshee Breeze),''  
Desormeaux said. ``But when the doors opened up, my filly was so 
full of run, I didn't think anybody could catch her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Keeper Hill returned $11.40 as the second betting choice in a  
field of nine. 
</P>
<P>
	The race sets up a strong field for the Distaff. Beautiful  
Pleasure defeated Silverbulletday on a sloppy track to take the 
Beldame Oct. 10 at Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
	In two other stakes on the card, Some Actor, ridden by Robby  
Albarado and trained by Thomas Amoss, won the Seattle Slew by 1 1/2 
lengths over Good Night. Chief Red Sky was third by a nose. 
</P>
<P>
	Richter Scale won the Phoenix Breeder's Cup by a neck over Bet  
On Sunshine. Vicar was third. Richter Scale is trained by Mary Jo 
Lohmeier and was ridden by Desormeaux.

<HEADLINE>  Quake Rocks Southern California </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JOSHUA TREE, Calif. (AP) -- A 7.0-magnitude earthquake in the  
Mojave Desert shook millions awake in three Western states early 
Saturday, derailing an Amtrak train, knocking out power to 
thousands, but causing no serious damage or injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The quake jolted gamblers out of bed in Las Vegas and shook  
buildings as far away as Phoenix and Tijuana, Mexico. Up to 90,000 
utility customers lost power, mobile homes were knocked off pilings 
in the desert community of Ludlow and a highway bridge was cracked. 
</P>
<P>
	With only a handful of injuries and no deaths, Californians  
credited location and luck for eluding catastrophe in the most 
powerful quake to hit the state since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thank God it took place in a remote area where there appears  
to be no tremendous damage or personal injuries,'' said Mayor 
Richard Riordan in Los Angeles, where the 6.7-magnitude Northridge 
quake killed 72 people and caused $25 billion in damage in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak's Southwest Chief, en route from Chicago to Los Angeles,  
derailed in near Ludlow, more than 125 miles northeast of Los 
Angeles. Four of the 155 passengers on the train suffered minor 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our saving grace was, we were following a freight train,''  
said Glenn Morton, the train's conductor. ``We were going 60 mph 
instead of the 80 mph we normally would do through here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All the homes in a nearby mobile home park were shoved off their  
foundations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody was running out. The dogs were howling. The cats  
were hiding. And the kids were freaking,'' said Barbara Houseworth, 
19, who fled her trailer with her 3-year-old child. ``When mobile 
homes rock, they really rock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A concrete bridge over Interstate 40 had large cracks, but the  
highway remained open. Merchandise flew off shelves and at least 
one supermarket was left with structural damage. Small brush fires 
were ignited by downed power lines in Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
	Light damage was also reported on the sprawling Marine Air  
Ground Combat Center south of Ludlow in Twentynine Palms, including 
broken water and gas lines. 
</P>
<P>
	The quake -- named ``Hector'' after the mineral mining site where  
it was centered -- began at 2:46 a.m. about 32 miles north of Joshua 
Tree in the Mojave Desert, according to the California Institute of 
Technology. Aftershocks followed by the hundreds, including strikes 
of 5.8, 5.3 and 5.0 magnitude. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands more aftershocks are expected, but there is only a 5  
percent chance that a quake bigger than the original will strike in 
the next week, said Lucy Jones, chief seismologist at the U.S. 
Geological Survey's office in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second huge earthquake in the region in only seven  
years. The magnitude-7.3 Landers earthquake in 1992 killed one 
person, injured 400 and caused nearly $100 million in damage. The 
Hector quake hit about 30 miles northeast of the Landers epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities in Las Vegas and the Los Angeles area said there  
were no reports of serious damage or injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shook everything pretty good, but that was about it,'' said  
Lt. Rich Paddock of the Orange County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
	A hotel near Disneyland evacuated guests as a precaution, and  
many gamblers in Las Vegas left their high-rise hotel rooms for the 
ground-level casinos. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole place was shaking like crazy,'' said Michelle  
Fabian, awakened on the 18th floor of the Mirage Hotel, 150 miles 
from the Hector area. 
</P>
<P>
	The effects of the earthquake were more pronounced near the  
epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Did you ever play a pinball machine and see the ball get stuck  
in there and go bam-bam-bam-bam-bam-bam? It just threw my body back 
and forth as I ran down the hallway,'' surf guitarist Dick Dale 
said from his home 30 miles from the epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
	But although the Joshua Tree Inn lost power, it had no  
significant damage, night manager Jacob Naylor said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Twelve guests, all definitely awake. A couple in from Holland,  
definitely shocked. A couple in from the U.K. asked me, `Is this 
normal?''' Naylor said. ``They're all taking it rather well, kind 
of excited. Vacationers, new experiences, what can I say?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seismologists say there is no connection among the large quakes  
that have occurred recently around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, a magnitude-7.2 rocked Taiwan, killing more than  
2,300 people and causing an estimated $9.2 billion in damage. In 
August, a 7.4 quake killed at least 17,000 people in western 
Turkey, and in September, a 5.9 quake in Greece killed 143 people.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Russia May Alter Arms Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Clinton administration is offering to help  
Russia complete a large missile tracking radar if it agrees to 
renegotiate an arms control agreement so the United States could 
build a national missile defense system, The New York Times 
reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposal, the United States would help the Russians  
finish their radar near Irkutsk, Siberia, the paper said, citing 
unidentified Russian and American officials. 
</P>
<P>
	A nationwide defense system is prohibited by the 1972  
Antiballistic Missile Treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	Moscow has so far refused to alter it, and announced on Friday  
that it would work with China to seek broad support at the United 
Nations against American efforts to alter the accord. 
</P>
<P>
	Senior American officials insist that the Clinton administration  
is not aiming to nullify the 1972 pact. Rather the goal is to 
update the accord so the United States can defend itself against 
new missile threats while at the same time avoiding a new arms race 
with Russia and China, the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States believes nations like North Korea and Iran  
were developing the means to manufacture ballistic missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian officials insist that Washington has exaggerated the  
missile threat and say that weakening the treaty would be a 
reckless move. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are open to cooperation,'' Grigory V. Berdennikof, a senior  
arms control specialist at Russia's Foreign Ministry, told the 
Times. ``But if our cooperation means changing the ABM treaty our 
answer is 'thanks but no thanks.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen for the White House and the State Department did not  
return calls seeking comment from The Associated Press Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior administration official told The Washington Post for  
Sunday's editions, ``We don't see this as anything against Russia, 
and we're willing to look at a whole range of cooperative measures 
that would address the same rogue threat we're concerned about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A decision on whether to proceed with antimissile defenses is to  
be made by next summer. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Soviet Union built a radar in the 1980s at Krasnoyarsk,  
Siberia, the United States argued successfully that it was a 
violation of the treaty and pressed the Russians to dismantle it. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, however, President Clinton sent Russian President  
Boris N. Yeltsin a letter asking Russia to renegotiate the treaty 
to permit a limited system of defenses, the Times reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott has held a series of  
high-level meetings with the Russians, including a session this 
week in Helsinki, Finland, the Times said 
</P>
<P>
	By outlining their plans, the Americans are seeking to reassure  
the Russians that the proposed missile defense is not aimed at 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Russian and American officials familiar with the  
talks, the first phase of the American antimissile system is to be 
completed by 2005. It involves building a powerful new radar in 
Alaska and deploying up to 100 antimissile interceptors there. 
American early warning radars in Greenland and Britain and in the 
United States would also be upgraded. 
</P>
<P>
	The second phase is to be completed by 2010, and could involve  
construction of a similar radar at Grand Forks, N.D., and 
deployment of 100 interceptors there. 
</P>
<P>
	An offer to help the cash-strapped Russians complete a large  
radar at Mischelevka, 60 miles northwest of Irkutsk could cost 
millions. Oriented to the southeast, the radar covers North Korea, 
among other Asian nations. 
</P>
<P>
	American officials have also suggested that Washington might  
upgrade a Russian-controlled radar at Lyaki in Azerbaijan, which 
covers Iran and other Middle Eastern nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian visits to American early warning radar stations and,  
perhaps, access to their data and joint computer simulations of 
antimissile systems were among other proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not at the point where we have substantial feedback from  
the Russians that any of these proposals might bear fruit,'' a U.S. 
officials told the Post.

<HEADLINE> Ramsey Case May Get New Prosecutor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- Gov. Bill Owens will meet with Boulder  
District Attorney Alex Hunter Monday night to discuss the 
possibility of appointing a special prosecutor for the JonBenet 
Ramsey case, one of Hunter's advisors said. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury investigation of the Ramsey case, launched by  
Hunter Sept. 15, 1998, ended Wednesday without any indictments. 
</P>
<P>
	Owens announced Wednesday that he would consider appointing a  
special prosecutor to review the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Adams County District Attorney Bob Grant, who is part of  
Hunter's team of advisors on the Ramsey case, said of the meeting: 
``The only person I'm sure will be there is me, since I haven't 
talked to anyone else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grant said he expects Hunter's grand jury team of Michael Kane,  
Bruce Levin, Mitch Morrissey and Denver-area prosecutors Bill 
Ritter, Dave Thomas and Jim Peters to be present at the meeting as 
well. Ritter, Thomas and Peters are from Denver, Jefferson County 
and Arapahoe County, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Amy Sampson, Owen's acting press secretary, declined to reveal  
the time or location of the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that they are planning a meeting soon, but they are  
still working out the details,'' Sampson said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said earlier that JonBenet's parents, John and Patsy  
Ramsey, remain under an ``umbrella of suspicion'' in the December 
1996 slaying of JonBenet, 6, at their Boulder home. Hunter said 
Thursday that they have not been eliminated from the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ramseys have said all along they are innocent.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Arrests Outlawed Muslims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Egyptian police have arrested 20 senior  
members of the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood and accused them of 
various anti-government activities, security officials said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrests took place Thursday in Cairo's southern neighborhood  
of Maadi, where 16 members were meeting at an office of the 
Engineers' Union, said the officials who spoke on customary 
condition of anonymity. Four others were brought from their homes, 
the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Formed in 1928, the Muslim Brotherhood was banned in 1954, but  
was tolerated by the government until 1995, when authorities 
arrested at least 200 brotherhood members. Since then, the 
government has cracked down on the group, accusing its members of 
supporting the Islamic insurgency that broke out in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	The Muslim Brotherhood maintains that it does not support  
violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those detained was Mukhtar Nouh, a well-known lawyer who  
defends Muslim fundamentalists. Nouh is the treasurer of the 
Lawyers' Union and is a former member of the Egyptian parliament. 
He is also a member of the brotherhood's consultative council. 
</P>
<P>
	Nouh's wife, Kholoud, said she has not been in touch with her  
husband since he was arrested midday Thursday, adding that security 
agents searched their house on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Police officials said state security prosecutors have ordered  
that the 20 men be imprisoned 15 days for interrogation. 
</P>
<P>
	The men have been accused of joining an illegal organization  
trying to overthrow the government, holding illegal meetings in 
order to revive the brotherhood, infiltrating unions to make their 
members carry out anti-government activities and having 
anti-government printed material, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrests came after the Court of Cassation on Sunday upheld a  
1996 ruling by a Cairo appeals court that called for 
government-appointed custodians to take control of the Lawyers' 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
	The government apparently is attempting to prevent the  
brotherhood from taking control of the union, which counts up to 
20,000 members. 
</P>
<P>
	Maamoun Hodeibi, the brotherhood's spokesman, told The  
Associated Press that the meeting in Maadi had nothing to do with 
the brotherhood. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is it a crime to be concerned about the people?'' Hodeibi  
asked. ``People talking about their unions -- where is the crime in 
that?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among those arrested were Mohammed Abdel-Badie,  
secretary-general of the Veterinarians' Union; Mohammed Ali Bishr, 
secretary-general of the Lawyers' Union; and Saad Zaghloul, 
secretary-general of Cairo's Doctors' Union.

<HEADLINE> N.C. A&AMP;T Defeats Morgan State 30-6 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE, Md. (AP) --North Carolina A&AMP;T defeated Morgan State,  
30-6, Saturday in a game that had coach Stanley Mitchell 
questioning the abilities of his players. 
</P>
<P>
	Armand Walters in the first quarter raced past Turnell Purkett  
on a deep post to catch Willie McGirt's pass and wade into the end 
zone to give Morgan State a 6-0 lead with 12:25 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	The play made up more than a third of the offensive yardage the  
team would gain in the 26:47 that it held the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	The running attack, found in last week's victory over Towson,  
would get lost again with less than 2 yards per carry. And the 
defense would give up more than 400 yards for the third consecutive 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	After watching his team penalized for almost as many yards (171)  
as his team gained (173), Mitchell was left to consider some harsh 
truths. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have ball players who aren't ball players, that's the truth  
of the matter,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Freshman Marque Brown got Morgan in field-goal position, but a  
bad snap on a 30-yard field goal attempt was followed by a pass by 
K.C. Vasquez. Brown then got a concussion at the end of the half 
and gave way to T.J. Stallings, a kick returner with limited 
quarterback experience. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell then briefly went to receiver Marc Lester who threw an  
interception in his only attempt, returned 27 yards to the Morgan 
State 4 by A&AMP;T's Daryl Klugh, setting up a 4-yard touchdown run by 
Adrian Parks that made the final score with 14:56 left to play.

<HEADLINE> School Officials Defend Gun Raffle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HALIFAX, N.C. (AP) -- A private school plans to raffle off guns,  
provoking criticism that the fund-raiser shows insensitivity to 
acts of school violence. 
</P>
<P>
	John Hardison, headmaster of the Hobgood Academy, said the  
raffle will go on despite the complaints, adding that the prizes -- 
five hunting rifles and shotguns -- reflect the important place 
hunting occupies in the community's culture and heritage. 
</P>
<P>
	The academy, a kindergarten through 12th-grade campus that has  
operated for 30 years, said it bought the guns from a reputable 
dealer and will require the winners to undergo background checks 
and meet other legal requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	Money raised through the raffle will support the Future Farmers  
of America class for high school students. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're sorry it's been blown so much out of proportion,''  
Hardison said. ``We're certainly not insensitive to the issue of 
guns and violence in schools. It's just that in our area, we never 
dreamed it would an issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even though gun raffles are common in eastern North Carolina,  
this one raised eyebrows among advocates for school safety and gun 
control. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not saying that adults and supervised juveniles should  
not have access to guns, but promoting guns at school seems like 
the wrong issue,'' said Lisa Price, executive director of North 
Carolinians Against Gun Violence.

 *Donald D. Dahl    	
</P>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Donald D. Dahl, who spent 28 years with  
The Albuquerque Tribune before retiring in 1982 as news editor, 
died Friday. He was 79. 
</P>
<P>
	Dahl began his career at The Tribune in 1954 as a copy editor.  
He later was a telegraph editor before becoming news editor. 
</P>
<P>
	He was born in Savage, Mont., but moved to Rhame, N.D., when he  
was a year old. He helped his mother publish the weekly Rhame 
Review. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was setting type by the time I was 15 years old,'' Dahl used  
to say. 
</P>
<P>
	He received a journalism degree from the University of North  
Dakota in 1941, then served in the Navy during World War II. After 
the war, he earned a master's degree from the Columbia University 
School of Journalism. 
</P>
<P>
	Dahl also worked as managing editor of the Navy News, a daily  
newspaper published by the Navy in Manila. He also worked for The 
Providence Journal-Bulletin of Rhode Island and for United Press.

 *Donald Riddle    	
</P>
<P>
	NEWTOWN, Pa. (AP) -- Donald H. Riddle, the former president of  
the John Jay College of Criminal Justice of the City University of 
New York, died Monday after a long illness. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
	Riddle was credited for changing the college's curriculum to  
produce more highly educated law enforcement officers by 
introducing required courses in language and the humanities. Before 
his tenure, from 1968 to 1975, police were commonly trained as 
little more than gun-carrying security officers. 
</P>
<P>
	``When people asked President Riddle how to educate the police,  
he famously replied, 'Like everybody else,''' said Gerald W. Lynch, 
the college's president. 
</P>
<P>
	Riddle also gained national attention in 1970 for standing up to  
then-FBI head J. Edgar Hoover on a matter of academic freedom.

<P>
	LISBON, Portugal (AP) -- Luis Sa, a leading member of the  
Portuguese Communist Party and former member of the European 
Parliament, died Friday of a heart attack. He was 47. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in the former Portuguese colony Angola, Sa joined the  
Communist party in 1974, after the April 25 Carnation Revolution 
that toppled a 41-year-long rightist dictatorship. 
</P>
<P>
	A law graduate, he was first elected to the Republican Assembly,  
Portugal's Parliament, in 1991 and was recently re-elected as No. 2 
in the party's list for the general elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Sa also was a member of the European Parliament for a few months  
in 1994.

 *Jean Shepherd    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jean Shepherd, the prolific radio raconteur  
whose easy storytelling style earned comparisons to fellow 
Midwesterner Mark Twain, died Saturday. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
	Shepherd, once described by media critic Marshall McLuhan as  
``the first radio novelist,'' died in a hospital near his home in 
Sanibel Island, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Shepherd spent 21 years on WOR-AM in New York City, attracting a  
large, loyal following along the Eastern seaboard. He worked 
without a script, conjuring tales based on his Indiana upbringing, 
creating characters like his alter-ego, Ralph Parker, and his 
neighbors, the Bumpuses. 
</P>
<P>
	In a move that likely inspired the climactic scene in the movie  
``Network,'' Shepherd would tell his listeners to crank up the 
volume on their radios and scream along with him. ``Drop the tools, 
we've got you covered!'' was one of Shepherd's favorite shout-along 
phrases. 
</P>
<P>
	Shepherd, while best known for his radio work, excelled as a  
multimedia performer. His films included the 1983 classic ``A 
Christmas Story,'' a sardonic look at the holiday that he wrote and 
narrated. He had hoped to call it ``Satan's Revenge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His writing appeared in a vast assortment of publications, from  
The New York Times to National Lampoon. He wrote several books, 
including 1966's ``In God We Trust'' and the 1971 story collection, 
``Wanda Hickey's Night of Golden Memories and Other Disasters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shepherd did a pair of syndicated PBS TV programs, ``Jean  
Shepherd's America'' and ``Shepherd's Pie,'' and often sold out 
Carnegie Hall for his live shows.

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Irving Siders, a producer who took Broadway  
shows on the road across the nation, died Wednesday. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
	For 20 years, Siders organized national tours of Broadway  
productions, from serious drama like Athol Fugard's ``Master Harold 
... and the Boys,'' to rollicking musicals like ``Ain't 
Misbehavin.''' In 1987 he brought a tour back to New York, staging 
a revival of Michael Bennett's ``Dreamgirls,'' which received a 
Tony nomination for best revival. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the course of his career, Siders worked with many of the  
major stars and star makers of the American theater. 
</P>
<P>
	At 16, Siders first took to the road when he left Boston to work  
as a band boy for pianist Fats Waller. Working the city-a-day job 
introduced him to the gritty and seductive world of jazz, clubs and 
show people. 
</P>
<P>
	After World War II, Siders developed a career as a talent  
manager and booking agent for performers including Ella Fitzgerald 
and the Count Basie Band. He later joined the jazz label Verve as a 
manager, and worked briefly as entertainment director for Playboy 
Clubs.

<HEADLINE> John Wilkes Booth Birthplace Sold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The childhood home of John Wilkes Booth, the  
assassin who shot President Lincoln, was sold at auction Saturday 
to a local couple who plan to make it their residence. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert and Elizabeth Baker made the winning $415,000 bid for  
Tudor Hall in the Baltimore suburb of Bel Air. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides being the home of one of the most notorious figures in  
U.S. history, Tudor Hall also is regarded as the birthplace of 
Shakespearean theater in America. It is listed on the National 
Register of Historic Places. 
</P>
<P>
	A local school, Harford Community College, sought to preserve  
the house as a museum and center for theater lovers, but the 
bidding quickly surpassed the school's limit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're disappointed that the Shakespearean history programs  
cannot be built at the home site,'' college President Claudia 
Chiesi said after the auction. 
</P>
<P>
	A nonprofit group called the Preservation Association for Tudor  
Hall Inc. has among its members actors Hal Holbrook and Stacy 
Keach, who both had pledged to restore the property if the college 
bought it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm disappointed, naturally,'' Keach said Saturday from Los  
Angeles. ``Hopefully, this wonderful couple will have an interest 
in preserving the legacy of the Booth family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Gothic-style house was built in 1847 by Junius Brutus Booth,  
a famous Shakespearean actor who moved to Maryland from his native 
England and bought 100 acres in Harford County, about 40 miles 
north of Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwin and John Wilkes Booth accompanied their father on his  
theater trips across the country. Edwin Booth was considered one of 
this country's greatest Shakespearean actors. 
</P>
<P>
	After John Wilkes Booth, also a well-known actor, assassinated  
Abraham Lincoln in 1865, Junius Booth lost the property. 
</P>
<P>
	Ownership changed hands over the years. In 1968, the house was  
bought by Howard and Dorothy Fox, who lived in the home, hosted 
small theatrical productions and converted it to a museum. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Foxes died within weeks of each other earlier this  
year, each without a will, their heirs decided to sell Tudor Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bakers said they want to make the house their home and are  
open to allowing some limited tours. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think anybody who wants to live in a historic home feels  
there's an obligation there to keep everything intact as well as 
you possibly can,'' said Mrs. Baker.

<HEADLINE> Budroyale Wins Goodwood Handicap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARCADIA, Calif. (AP) -- Left out of an early speed duel between  
Old Trieste and Hollycombe, Budroyale made up ground at the top of 
the stretch and went on to a neck victory in Saturday's $500,000 
Goodwood Breeders' Cup Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Garrett Gomez, Budroyale covered 1 1/8 miles in 1:48 1-5  
and paid $20, $4.40 and $2.10 
</P>
<P>
	General Challenge, coming off a victory in the Pacific Classic  
at Del Mar two months ago, finished second under David Flores and 
returned $2.60 and $2.10. Old Trieste and Chris McCarron was 
another three lengths back in third and paid $2.10 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I had him coming to the three-eighths pole,'' Flores  
said of the winner. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried to put pressure on him and get away from him. But I  
could see Budroyale was coming in with me,'' he said. ``In the 
stretch, my horse dug in, and he was just trying so hard. But the 
other one, he didn't stop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Budroyale inserted himself into the picture for next month's  
Breeders' Cup Classic at Gulfstream. The 6-year-old is already 
eligible. 
</P>
<P>
	``He beat two of the best horses in the world in Old Trieste and  
General Challenge, and the others were no slouches either,'' 
trainer Ted West Jr. said. ``The fact that he can look those horses 
in the eye and run them down like that, I think we have to consider 
the Breeders' Cup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	General Challenge, who carried co-high weight of 120 pounds with  
Old Trieste, ran fourth before moving up on the stretch turn. The 
3-year-old trailed by seven lengths when Old Trieste and Hollycombe 
hooked up in the early stages. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't his kind of race,'' trainer Bob Baffert said. ``All  
of a sudden, he was seven lengths back and that's not good. He's 
not a horse that can quicken, he's got to run them into the ground 
early.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trainer Mike Puype had just the opposite problem. He didn't like  
seeing Old Trieste lured into a speed duel. 
</P>
<P>
	``He breaks to run and he was instantly hooked and the other  
horse (Hollycombe) was just running off with him,'' Puype said. 
``Chris took him back, but it's not his style to sit back and 
reverse. He's a free-running frontrunner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	West wasn't worried when Budroyale lagged behind.  
</P>
<P>
	``If this horse gets his head in front or somebody doesn't pass  
him at the top of the stretch, he's almost impossible to pass,'' he 
said. ``Garrett said the other horses just get sick of fighting 
because he just doesn't stop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert had called General Challenge the most talented horse  
he's ever trained. He said owner John Mabee would have to decide 
whether to run the 3-year-old in the Breeders' Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just hope he's not discouraged after seeing him get beat  
like that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert said the victory, along with River Keen's upset of the  
East Coast's top horses in last week's Jockey Club Gold Cup at 
Belmont, further muddled the year-end picture. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no standout,'' he said. ``It's wide open.''  
</P>
<P>
	In the $250,000 Oak Tree Breeders' Cup Mile, Silic defeated  
Bouccaneer by one length under Corey Nakatani. Silic covered one 
mile on the turf in 1:33 3-5 and paid $6.40, $4.20 and $3.20. 
</P>
<P>
	Bouccaneer, a French-bred like the winner, returned $8.40 and  
$4.40, while British-bred Brave Act was another length back in 
third and paid $2.60 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Silic and Brave Act are pointing toward the Breeders' Cup  
Mile.

<HEADLINE> Tiny Town Tries To Dodge Rising Lake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHURCHS FERRY, N.D. (AP) -- Paul Christenson has no idea yet what  
kind of offer he might get to move from his home. He doesn't care 
either. 
</P>
<P>
	The 41-year-old mechanic and life-long resident of Churchs Ferry  
made up his mind long ago -- before Devils Lake began threatening 
the town -- that this is home. 
</P>
<P>
	Money won't change that.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not moving,'' Christenson says, his grease-caked hands and  
forearms wrestling with a broken farm truck transmission in his 
repair shop. ``I've been here my whole life. I built my house from 
nothing, I built my shop, my business from nothing. I'm not willing 
to give that up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is a decision being faced by every one of the 113 residents  
of this tiny farming town in north-central North Dakota. Devils 
Lake, whose shoreline was miles away from the town only a few years 
ago, has methodically crept up to its doorstep and is knocking. 
</P>
<P>
	Water threatens the town's largest business, the local grain  
elevator, as well as the city's sewer system. Officials believe it 
is only a matter of time before the 42 occupied homes and handful 
of other businesses are in danger too. 
</P>
<P>
	A wet cycle in the Upper Plains has caused Devils Lake to rise  
nearly 25 feet since 1992. With no outlet and in flat country such 
as this, it means the water has spread over tens of thousands of 
acres and more than doubled in total size. Year by year, it 
swallows more land. 
</P>
<P>
	This month, state and federal agencies announced a controversial  
plan to dredge a permanent outlet from Devils Lake into the nearby 
Sheyenne River to help stabilize the lake level. But construction 
could take two years or more, which many believe will be too long 
to save Churchs Ferry. 
</P>
<P>
	So the Federal Emergency Management Agency plans to use about $2  
million to buy out the homes in Churchs Ferry and move the 
residents away before the water soaks in. 
</P>
<P>
	But to move is a difficult, almost unconscionable, proposition  
for some. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarvis Haugeberg is manager of the BTR Farmers Cooperative grain  
elevator and a resident for 10 years. He understands the 
apprehension, but believes the town may have no choice but move. 
</P>
<P>
	``To sit here and see the lake rise and begin to wreak havoc on  
my business, on my customers and friends who I care about is very 
traumatic,'' Haugeberg says. ``But with that said, I see the 
potential of this buyout program bringing this to a closure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is an understatement to say this is a close-knit town.  
Everyone knows everybody else. Many have lived here their entire 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
	The buyout plan has been about the only topic of conversation in  
recent weeks. It is debated constantly in living rooms, at the 
grain elevator and at the only bar in town, The Water Hole, which 
shares a building with the all-volunteer fire department. There are 
just three stop signs and no paved streets. The cost of living here 
is very low and most people own their homes outright. 
</P>
<P>
	Longtime resident Jim Savaloja, his voice quivering and tears  
filling his eyes, tried desperately to describe his anxiety and 
apprehension at a recent town meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``The town of Churchs Ferry,'' he said, clutching his shirt  
above his heart, ``is contemplating an act that can cause its own 
demise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of us fully intended to live out our lives here,'' he  
added, ``knowing that neighbors would keep an eye on each other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, neighbors await as officials prepare appraisals of each of  
the homes. The government eventually will make buyout offers on 
each piece of property, which homeowners can accept or reject. 
Since the buyout program is voluntary, no one will be forced to 
move. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think people realize that we're not fighting the government  
here,'' says Kyle Nelson, a bank vice president in nearby Leeds, 
who moved to town three years ago with his wife. ``It's David vs. 
Goliath, but it's important to realize that Goliath isn't the 
government, it's Mother Nature.''	   But what worries many are the consequences if half the town's 
residents or more accept the offers. Will there be enough of a tax 
base to continue providing services to those who remain? And what 
will happen if the waters do invade town? 
</P>
<P>
	Churchs Ferry already has suffered its share of disappointments.  
Founded in 1886, the town once thrived when the farm economy was 
healthy. But the population has dwindled in recent decades. 
Businesses have closed. The school was forced to shut its doors in 
1988 and was turned into a community center. Half the homeowners 
are over the age of 62. Many are on fixed incomes. 
</P>
<P>
	For those who are considering the buyout, the concern is whether  
the ``market price'' government officials have promised will be 
enough to buy a comparable home in a new community. 
</P>
<P>
	Government officials say they will pressure no one to move and  
will help those who stay behind. But they are still urging 
homeowners to give serious consideration to the buyout offers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are safe places to go,'' says Maj. Gen. Keith Bjerke,  
the head of the North Dakota National Guard, one of the agencies 
involved in the buyout program. ``There are people, communities, 
begging for people just like you to be their neighbors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Christenson likes the neighbors he has. His repair shop is next  
to his boyhood home. He, his wife and two children live in a home 
they built themselves. It's complete with a large deck and 
above-ground swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
	Christenson believes the threat posed by Devils Lake has been  
exaggerated and hopes residents will turn down the buyout offers 
and stay. 
</P>
<P>
	``The water is a long ways away, as far as I'm concerned,'' he  
says. ``It's not that the buyout is a bad deal, it isn't. I just 
think it's not time yet. I hope people will stick around.''

<HEADLINE> Justice Warns of European Courts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STANFORD, Calif. (AP) -- U.S. Supreme Court Justice Anthony  
Kennedy warned Saturday that European courts were gaining too much 
power. 
</P>
<P>
	``European nations are surrendering their sovereignty on a scale  
never seen before,'' said Kennedy, who shared a Stanford University 
podium with fellow alumni Sandra Day O'Connor and Stephen Breyer. 
``They've committed a tremendous amount of confidence, a tremendous 
amount of power ... I think, too much, to the judiciary. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of the weight of developing this (democratic) consensus is  
being put on the courts, and this is dangerous for courts. You 
cannot overload a judicial structure with basic economic and social 
decisions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He did not mention any rulings, such as the Sept. 27 decision by  
the European Court of Human Rights overturning Britain's ban on 
homosexuals in the military as a privacy violation, an argument 
Kennedy rejected when he was a federal appeals court judge. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kennedy said he would like to be a justice for a day on the  
separate European Court of Justice, the powerful Luxembourg-based 
body that oversees European economic treaties, so he could advise 
its members on the need for judicial restraint. 
</P>
<P>
	``Remember, you are in a democratic society,'' he said he would  
tell them, ``and if you take on yourself all the important 
decisions in your society, ultimately you will cause a loss of 
respect for your court, a loss of respect for judicial independence 
and a loss of respect for the law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Breyer, a 1994 appointee of President Clinton, normally votes  
more liberally than Kennedy and O'Connor, both appointees of 
President Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
	But he was cautious when asked by the panel moderator, Stanford  
Law Dean Kathleen Sullivan, about the effect of foreign courts' 
gradual assertion of the power to review legislation, pioneered by 
the U.S. Supreme Court in 1803. 
</P>
<P>
	``You hope courts will deal with the power this gives them  
circumspectly ... to protect basic human liberty,'' Breyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Americans seem to be ``reasonably satisfied'' with their  
courts' use of its review power, ``but not all people and not 
completely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor, a member of the same 1952 Stanford Law School class as  
Chief Justice William Rehnquist, drew applause when she said the 
United States should not be complacent about its own legal system. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a good many citizens in this country who think that  
justice is for just us, the privileged few at Stanford, the upper 
class, but not for them,'' she told an audience of law students and 
alumni, including at least two former Cabinet members and numerous 
judges. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many African-American citizens think the system operates  
unfairly. ... We have some work to do.''

<HEADLINE> Fenway Friendly for BoSox Hitters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Is it the fans, the field or fate?  
</P>
<P>
	The Boston Red Sox don't know why they hit so well at Fenway  
Park. And they really don't care. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to explain why we score so many runs,'' Trot Nixon  
said. ``I hope it continues. I'm sure it will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox cut the New York Yankees lead in the AL Championship  
Series to 2-1 Saturday with a 21-hit attack in a 13-1 win. It was 
somewhat of a slump at home since they won their previous game 
there 23-7 with 24 hits against Cleveland six days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	They play their next two games Sunday and Monday nights before  
cranked-up fans in the coziest ballpark in the majors where they 
have a total of 45 runs in the last 20 innings. They have scored in 
16 of them. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is our home field, our own fans,'' said Jason Varitek,  
who somehow managed to go hitless in four at-bats. ``I don't know 
if it helps, but it can't hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Every other Red Sox starter had at least one hit as the team's  
batting average soared to .448 in three home playoff games, all 
victories. 
</P>
<P>
	And get this: their slugging percentage in those games is .824  
compared to .459 at home during the regular season. Of their 56 
playoff hits at Fenway, 27 went for extra bases, including nine 
homers. 
</P>
<P>
	Compare that to their road problems where they're 1-4 with a  
.225 batting average and four homers in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, they set LCS records with 38 total bases and 10  
extra-base hits. They set ALCS records with 21 hits and a 12-run 
victory margin and tied the ALCS mark with 13 runs. 
</P>
<P>
	And the 21 hits were the most ever against the Yankees in their  
254 postseason games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've played well here at Fenway all year, especially in the  
playoffs,'' said Brian Daubach, who went 2-for-4 with a homer after 
going 1-for-10 in the first two games in New York. ``I think the 
crowd has a lot to do with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, the Red Sox scored six runs over the first three  
innings, one more than their total for the first two games at 
Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The targets at Fenway are inviting. There's the Green Monster in  
left field and Pesky's Pole, the yellow foul pole down the short 
right-field line. 
</P>
<P>
	The fans are invigorating -- cheering every liner and roaring as  
Red Sox runners use the basepaths like a youngster uses a carousel 
that he doesn't want to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always nice to play in your own park,'' said Mike  
Stanley, who went 2-for-4. ``They're not yelling at you so much in 
the on-deck circle. You have the comforts of your own clubhouse. 
It's more relaxing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the regular season, the Red Sox hit .291 at home and .265 on  
the road. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a ballpark that's tailored for offense,'' said Darren  
Lewis. ``I think this team really feeds off the fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boston had lost the first two games of the AL division series in  
Cleveland 3-2 and 11-1. Then they came home to take the next two 
games 9-3 and 23-7. 
</P>
<P>
	Hitting had become such a habit that, for the only time in this  
year's playoffs, it carried over to the road as the Red Sox won the 
clinching fifth game 12-8. 
</P>
<P>
	The road woes resurfaced in Yankee Stadium where Boston lost the  
first two games of the ALCS 4-3 and 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
	John Valentin has been Boston's most valuable hitter at home in  
the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox, facing the embarrassment of being swept by  
Cleveland, were tied 2-2 before Valentin's solo homer in the bottom 
of the sixth of Game 3. The Indians tied it again in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
	But Valentin's two-run double gave the Red Sox the lead for good  
in a six-run seventh. In the next game, he had two homers and seven 
RBIs as the Red Sox tied the series 2-2. They won it the next night 
in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston opened the ALCS in New York, and Valentin went 1-for-8 in  
the two losses. But on Saturday, he set the offensive tone with a 
two-run homer on Roger Clemens' seventh pitch of the game as his 
hyped duel never materialized with Pedro Martinez, who allowed two 
hits and two walks and struck out 12 in seven scoreless innings. 
</P>
<P>
	There were other offensive stars. Nomar Garciaparra went 4-for-5  
and he, Valentin and Daubach homered, while Jose Offerman and Nixon 
each had three hits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't be concerned with how many or how little we score,''  
said Bret Saberhagen, Boston's probable starter in Game 4. ``My job 
is to get them out and give our team a chance to hit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then watch what happens.

<HEADLINE> Canada GM Plant Denounces Outsourcing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Plans by General Motors of Canada Ltd. to end  
production at the St. Therese, Quebec, assembly plant and outsource 
other work could lead to a walk-out by Canadian Auto Workers, union 
president Buzz Hargrove said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The outsourcing positions they have on the table will cause a  
strike,'' Hargrove said at a Toronto news conference. ``Under no 
circumstances are we going to allow outsourcing when we have 
insecurity with workers at St. Therese and other plants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The CAW has set a midnight Tuesday deadline to reach an  
agreement with GM. During 1996 contract talks, the CAW struck GM's 
Oshawa, Ontario, assembly plant, idling some U.S. parts and 
assembly plants. 
</P>
<P>
	A contract with GM is expected to closely model agreements  
already reached with Ford Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler AG. 
</P>
<P>
	Those call for a 3 percent wage increase in each year of a  
three-year package, a $1,000 (Canadian) signing bonus, an improved 
retirement package and other benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove said in July that the future of the St. Therese plant  
and GM plans to outsource work would be key issues in this year's 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowered demand for the Chevrolet Cameros and Pontiac Firebirds  
produced at St. Therese has raised speculation that the plant might 
be closed. GM has said it will cease production of the cars there 
in September 2002, and nothing is scheduled to replace that line, 
Hargrove said. 
</P>
<P>
	GM officials in Detroit and Ontario could not be immediately  
reached for comment Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Timberwolves' Garrett Out 3-5 Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Minnesota Timberwolves center Dean Garrett  
will be out three to five weeks after knee surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Garrett, a four-year veteran, is expected to return in November.  
The Timberwolves begin the season Nov. 5 against the Sacramento 
Kings in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	``That definitely makes us thinner,'' coach Flip Saunders said  
Friday, the day Garrett had surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie Radoslav Nesterovic, a 7-footer who signed with Minnesota  
two games before the end of last season and has just 30 minutes of 
regular-season NBA experience, will replace Garrett in the starting 
lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	Trevor Winter, who played in one game for five minutes last  
season, will be the backup. 
</P>
<P>
	Saunders said he expects forward Tom Hammonds to miss three to  
five weeks with sore and swollen ankles from stress reactions in 
his heels. Sam Mitchell (knee) and Joe Smith (left foot) are also 
banged up. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'll see some funky lineups over the next three weeks,  
that's for sure,'' Saunders said.

<HEADLINE> Iran Rejects U.S. Dialogue Request </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Iran on Saturday rejected Washington's  
latest request for dialogue, saying friendly words were not enough 
to make up for past insults. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk on Thursday  
renewed an offer for Iran and the United States to hold talks ``on 
the basis of equality and mutual respect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The aim, Indyk said, was to encourage Iran to support Mideast  
peacemaking and to stop supporting terrorism by halting the 
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	But Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Hamidreza Asefi, said  
America's ``hostile measures against the Islamic Republic of Iran 
cannot be corrected or compensated for with words,'' according to 
Iranian television. 
</P>
<P>
	``Indyk speaks of equality and mutual respect, but at the same  
time repeats baseless accusations expressed by Washington about 
Iran's nuclear activities and other issues,'' Asefi was quoted as 
saying. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of 28 U.S. senators urged U.S. Secretary of State  
Madeleine Albright on Friday to take a tough line toward Iran, 
saying it showed no change in its stance toward the rest of the 
world two years after President Mohammad Khatami's election. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to Albright, the senators criticized the State  
Department's inclusion of Mujahedeen Khalq, an Iranian opposition 
group, on a list of terrorist groups as an effort to appease ``the 
criminal mullahs'' who rule Iran. 
</P>
<P>
	Asefi struck back Saturday, saying: ``It would be better for  
American officials to refrain from simple-minded statements about 
the Islamic Republic of Iran, and instead, look at the existing 
realities in the Islamic Republic of Iran, which have been achieved 
by a popular and independent revolution.''

<HEADLINE> Irish Arrest Five in Crackdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) -- Police arrested five men under Ireland's  
anti-terrorism laws and seized two rifles Saturday in their 
crackdown on suspected Irish Republican Army dissidents opposed to 
the group's cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
	The men were arrested early Saturday at their homes in Dublin,  
said a police spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrests are the latest in an Irish police clampdown on IRA  
dissidents over recent weeks. Under Ireland's anti-terrorism laws, 
they can be held for up to 72 hours before being charged or 
released. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRA has maintained a cease-fire since July 1997, but  
violence has continued and has been blamed on renegades opposed to 
the Northern Ireland peace process. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, a stash of guns, ammunition and Semtex  
explosives was uncovered in southwest Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	In other news, six men who were arrested Thursday and were being  
questioned about a suspected IRA transatlantic gun-smuggling 
operation were released without charge, police said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Another six people who had been arrested Tuesday and questioned  
about the plot have also been released. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, the IRA denied it had authorized any arms-smuggling  
efforts after four people were arrested in Florida and Pennsylvania 
and charged in connection with the discovery of weapons being 
mailed to Ireland.

<HEADLINE> NAACP OKs Tourism Boycott of S.C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LINTHICUM, Md. (AP) -- The NAACP's national board on Saturday  
approved a tourism boycott of South Carolina until the state 
removes the Confederate battle flag from the Statehouse dome. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ratification officially mobilizes all of our chapters and  
members to not visit or spend dollars in South Carolina until the 
flag is removed,'' said NAACP spokeswoman Sheila Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  
has 2,200 branches with about 500,000 members nationwide, Ms. 
Douglas said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NAACP's national leaders say they are working to make sure  
South Carolina will feel economic pain from the national boycott, 
which would begin Jan. 1. More than $280 million a year that black 
travelers spend in South Carolina could be at stake. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know that economic sanctions work. When talking fails, when  
diplomacy fails, when appeals to the moral conscience of these 
individuals fails, you can always appeal to the economic side,'' 
said Lonnie Randolph Jr., chairman of the NAACP's programs and 
research committee. 
</P>
<P>
	State legislators have refused to remove the flag. Supporters  
say it represents Southern heritage and honors South Carolinians 
who died in the Civil War. But the NAACP says it is a symbol of 
racism. 
</P>
<P>
	Several groups from across the nation have already canceled  
plans to hold meetings and conventions in South Carolina since the 
NAACP called for the boycott. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, the Seventh-day Adventist Church canceled a  
meeting that would have brought 7,000 people to Columbia for four 
days in March. Officials said the event would have brought $500,000 
worth of tourism business. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the state NAACP office in Columbia said 42 state  
and national groups have now joined the boycott, either canceling 
meetings or holding them out of state. 
</P>
<P>
	The flag controversy has embroiled South Carolina for several  
years. The state is the only one in the nation to fly the 
Confederate flag over its Statehouse, although Georgia and 
Mississippi incorporate part of the design into their state flags.

<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Roger Clemens spent the first 13 years of his  
career in a Boston Red Sox uniform, and he thinks some of his 
former teammates might be taking advantage of his friendship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I know a couple of guys over there in the opposing  
dugout too well,'' he said Saturday after taking the loss in 
Boston's 13-1 victory over the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a couple of them are too comfortable, to be honest  
with you, against me,'' said Clemens, who allowed five runs and six 
hits in two-plus innings Saturday. ``I have to make some changes 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens has always said he won't hesitate to pitch inside, and  
that's just what he did when he hit Red Sox rookie Wilton Veras on 
Sept. 12 at Yankee Stadium. Clemens also plunked Mo Vaughn, perhaps 
his closest friend from their Boston days, on his first trip to 
Fenway Park as an opponent, in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just think I need to expand,'' Clemens said. ``I just think  
some guys are too comfortable and it is not a great feeling to 
have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens would start Game 7 of the AL Championship Series against  
Boston, if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SWITCH IN NINE WORKS FINE:* Red Sox manager Jimy Williams made  
one change in the lineup he used in Games 1 and 2: He swapped 
designated hitter Brian Daubach from third to seventh and moved 
catcher Jason Varitek up. 
</P>
<P>
	The move had mixed results.  
</P>
<P>
	Varitek went 0-for-4 with a walk from the No. 7 spot.  
</P>
<P>
	Daubach had been 5-for-26 in the playoffs, with just one hit  
against the Yankees before hitting a two-run homer and a double in 
Game 3. He scored twice and also hit a fly ball to the Green 
Monster that left fielder Ricky Ledee misplayed for a two-base 
error. 
</P>
<P>
	``He responded well,'' Williams said. ``The young man had a  
tremendous year with our club. He helped us in that Cleveland 
series. Didn't get a lot of hits but got some big hits and 
certainly got a couple of big ones tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *COUNT ME IN:* There was such a buzz about Saturday's pitching  
matchup between Roger Clemens and Pedro Martinez that even some of 
the players were caught up in the excitement. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I didn't have a ticket, I'd probably sneak in,'' said Red  
Sox pitcher Bret Saberhagen, who is scheduled to start Game 4 on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Saberhagen knows a little bit about excitement, having started  
and won Games 3 and 7 of the 1985 World Series for the Kansas City 
Royals, becoming the youngest player to be named Series MVP. 
</P>
<P>
	He went 20-6 with a 2.87 ERA that year to win the first of two  
Cy Young Awards. He won his second in 1989 after leading the league 
with 23 wins, a 2.16 ERA, 12 complete games and 262 1-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	So, how does a young Saberhagen compare with Martinez and  
Clemens? 
</P>
<P>
	``Not even close,'' he said. ``I was good, but I was never that  
good.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL:* Yankees manager Joe Torre, who was fired  
from three previous managerial jobs, said Saturday he empathized 
with Mike Hargrove, who was fired by the Cleveland Indians on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you fire somebody, and I am speaking from experience, I  
wish the people would say we are going to make a change we are 
going to try something different, blah, blah, blah,'' Torre said 
before Game 3 of the AL championship series against Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just make a change. It is just a little insulting when some of  
the reasoning comes out that we are going to the next level. I 
mean, if you are going to make a move, I mean, eight or nine years 
is a time to wait and then use that as reasoning? That is the only 
thing that bothers me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove led the Indians to five consecutive AL Central titles.  
They reached the World Series twice, but lost both times, s to 
Atlanta in 1995 and Florida in '97. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was the disastrous first-round loss to the Red Sox that  
did him in. Cleveland won the first two games before allowing 44 
runs in three consecutive losses to Boston for an early exit from 
the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mike keeps going to the postseason, and sometimes you get a  
little spoiled by that, and a little impatient with not going as 
far as you'd like to,'' Torre said. ``... But when you get into 
that three out of five or four out of seven, anything is liable to 
happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *THE THIRD TIME'S A CHARM:* Torre said he is enjoying himself  
more now than he did last year in the playoffs, when the Yankees 
steamrolled their way to a second World Series title in three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem: After winning 114 games in the 1998 regular season,  
anything less than a world championship would have been considered 
a failure. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, this is more fun,'' Torre said. ``Last year, you sort of  
felt obligated to go to the World Series and win the World Series 
otherwise people would have downplayed what you accomplished.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Mrs. Clinton Offered Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In the spirit of fairness, the talk-radio  
station that gives Mayor Rudolph Giuliani a weekly show is offering 
Hillary Rodham Clinton her own chance to take calls from New 
Yorkers, the Daily News reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	``She wants to do her listening tour. What better way to  
listen?'' said Phil Boyce, program director for WABC-AM. ``And she 
would be able to talk to 150,000 people at a time. She would be 
able to get her message out faster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aides to the potential Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate  
from New York said the idea hadn't been ruled out. Howard Wolfson, 
a spokesman for her Senate exploratory campaign, said he looked 
forward to talking with Boyce. 
</P>
<P>
	Should she accept the show, Mrs. Clinton would join a largely  
conservative program lineup, including Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, 
Matt Drudge and Curtis Sliwa. Also on WABC is Giuliani, who will 
likely pursue the Republican nomination for the seat being vacated 
next year by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan. 
</P>
<P>
	The hour-long call-in program would be run the same way as the  
mayor's Friday morning show, with calls screened by WABC staffers, 
said Boyce. 
</P>
<P>
	The slot is being offered now because it is the fair thing to  
do, he added. Federal law does not require the station to offer 
Mrs. Clinton equal airtime until both she and Giuliani become the 
official nominees of their parties, which would not happen until 
the Democratic primary in September.

<HEADLINE> Irene Blamed for Seven Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Hurricane Irene began a slow march  
up the East Coast today, slipping out of Florida after dumping 
heavy rain and knocking out power to more than a million people. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm blamed for at least seven deaths was expected to hug  
the East Coast as it moved north and forecasters feared it could 
gain strength and dump several inches of rain on the flood-weary 
Carolinas through the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	A hurricane watch issued today stretched north to Cape Hatteras,  
N.C. The storm was packing winds of 80 mph, though its most 
dangerous winds were directed toward the sea. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, Irene is blamed for killing two people in Cuba and five  
more near Fort Lauderdale who were electrocuted by downed power 
lines. As much as 18 inches of wind-driven rain caused scattered 
flooding over hundreds of miles, from Key West to West Palm Beach, 
where streets were nearly empty early today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're lucky we have power,'' said Tom Sullivan, owner of the  
El Cid bar, where about a dozen people were on hand as the storm 
swirled outside. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Bury, who turned 38 on Friday, refused to let Irene spoil  
the party. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's only a crime they're not playing Frank Sinatra,'' said  
Bury, a chef. ``Other than that, I can live with the storm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 a.m. EDT today, the center of the storm was about 40 miles  
east-southeast of Cape Canaveral and moving north at 8 mph. A 
tropical storm warning remained in effect from north of Jupiter 
Inlet to Edisto Beach, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Bridges from the mainland to Brevard County's barrier islands  
were closed. But John Davis was among those sitting on a scenic 
overlook, watching whitecaps on the Intracoastal Waterway. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had so many storms this year that I'm just going to get  
a couple of six packs and watch this one,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the rural Jupiter Farms area of Palm Beach County, fish from  
overflowing canals swam in the streets. Residents used canoes and 
flat-bottomed boats to get around. 
</P>
<P>
	A man's body was found floating near a vehicle in a flooded  
Coral Springs canal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know if this person maybe drove into the canal,  
thinking it was the street or a parking lot,'' said police Sgt. 
Rich Nicorvo. 
</P>
<P>
	After drenching Cuba's tobacco fields and collapsing buildings  
in Havana, Irene rolled ashore Friday afternoon near Cape Sable, 75 
miles southwest of Miami, and headed north through the Everglades. 
Florida Power &AMP; Light said today it had restored power to 700,000 
people, but more than 1.5 million remained without service in seven 
counties from Miami to Melbourne. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Hurricane Center in Miami had to switch over to  
backup generators when the power went out for about 30 seconds. It 
took about 90 minutes to reboot all the computers, during which 
forecasters were able to get data from elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Most airlines suspended service to south Florida and the Miami  
International Airport was shut down for 3 1/2 hours Friday. The 
University of Miami closed its campus. High school football games 
were postponed, as were two $400,000 thoroughbred races scheduled 
for today at Calder Race Course. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton declared a state of emergency for Florida,  
authorizing the Federal Emergency Management Administration to 
coordinate disaster relief efforts with state officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The emergency declaration covered 28 counties from Key West to  
central Florida. In Miami, police said more than 60 streets were 
under at least 6 inches of water. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is ridiculous,'' Michael LaCombe said after pushing his  
car out of shin-deep water. ``I should have called in sick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	West of Fort Lauderdale, a 48-year-old woman, her 11-year-old  
twin sons and their 14-year-old friend were electrocuted late 
Friday at an intersection in Weston by a downed power line. Minutes 
later, a teen-ager was electrocuted 10 miles away, Broward County 
Fire Rescue spokesman Todd LeDuc said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been given out the message all day that you need to stay  
inside,'' LeDuc said. ``This is not the time to do damage 
assessment. We have lines down throughout the county.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irene's top sustained winds dropped from 85 mph to 75 mph before  
midnight Friday. But winds strengthened to 80 mph late this 
morning, and Max Mayfield, deputy director of the hurricane center, 
said he was worried the storm could grow more powerful before 
threatening the Carolinas tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	That feeling was shared farther north.  
</P>
<P>
	``Anytime somebody mentions rain, I worry,'' said Reginald Lee,  
the assistant manager of Lenoir County, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly it's too early to panic,'' said Tom Hegele of the  
North Carolina emergency management agency. ``If we need to change 
our focus from recovery to preparation and response for another 
event, that's what we'll do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane Floyd dumped 20 inches of rain on eastern North  
Carolina last month, killing at least 49 people and causing 
billions of dollars in damage in the state's costliest natural 
disaster.

<HEADLINE> Yo-Yo Ma Forgets Cello in Cab </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It was the day the music almost disappeared.  
</P>
<P>
	Musician Yo-Yo Ma forgot his $2.5-million, 266-year-old cello in  
the trunk of a taxi on Saturday, but police tracked it down at a 
garage in Queens in time for his evening concert. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did something really stupid,'' Ma said sheepishly after he  
got the instrument back. ``I was in such a rush, I was so 
exhausted, I'd given a concert at Carnegie Hall last night. I just 
forgot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grinning with relief, he explained that police used the taxi  
receipt to find the driver within hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somehow magic happened, and I have my cello,'' said Ma. ``The  
instrument is my voice. So I need it. ... I would be crying right 
now'' if it hadn't been recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	Ma, who lives in Cambridge, Mass., put his cello in the taxi's  
trunk as he rode from Central Park West to the Peninsula Hotel on 
Fifth Avenue to prepare for a Saturday night concert at the 
Anchorage in Brooklyn, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the cab pulled away at 1:20 p.m., he realized he'd  
forgotten the cello, which was made in Venice in 1733. He declined 
to estimate the value of the instrument, but a police source said 
it was worth between $2 million and $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	He notified Peninsula security and they called police, said  
Inspector Thomas Purtell, commanding officer of the Midtown North 
precinct. 
</P>
<P>
	Police, working with officers from the Taxi and Limousine  
Commission, found the taxi's medallion number and discovered it was 
based at a garage in Queens. 
</P>
<P>
	Police had the cello back to Ma by 5:15 p.m., just in time for  
him to make it to his show beneath the Brooklyn Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
	``Luckily, luckily I had the receipt, so all of you, take the  
receipt,'' Ma said.

<HEADLINE> Another Rape Charge, 30 Years Later </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) -- Three decades ago, Lawny Harden was  
acquitted by reason of insanity in the murder-rape of a 73-year-old 
woman weeks after he was released from a psychiatric hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, he's been charged with raping another victim of the same  
age. 
</P>
<P>
	Harden, 53, was held Friday on $25,000 bail. A grand jury  
indicted him Wednesday on a charge of aggravated rape and breaking 
into a home. 
</P>
<P>
	Harden is accused of attacking the woman at her apartment in  
August. After the assault, she escaped and found help from two 
passers-by, according to state police. The victim gave a 
description of the attacker, and it fit Harden. No weapon was used, 
court papers said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1966, Harden was charged with raping and stabbing to death  
Julia Sullivan in her apartment. Prosecutors said he used a kitchen 
knife. 
</P>
<P>
	He was acquitted by reason of insanity in 1969 and committed to  
Bridgewater State Hospital for psychiatric treatment. It is not 
clear how long he stayed there. Medical records are confidential, 
and there is no longer any public information on Harden at the 
state's Criminal History Systems Board. 
</P>
<P>
	In June 1982, Harden was charged with threatening to kill his  
mother and other relatives. A judge committed him to Northampton 
State Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	He was accused of assault with a dangerous weapon in May 1993. A  
judge dropped that case without a finding, according to records of 
Springfield District Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Victor Gagnon, a public defender who represents Harden, said his  
client suffers from schizophrenia, a mental illness that can cause 
delusions. 
</P>
<P>
	Gagnon had no details on Harden's hospitalizations. But he said  
Harden had been legally released from his last commitment and was 
receiving mental health treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	When someone is acquitted by reason of insanity, he is generally  
committed to a psychiatric hospital for treatment. Periodic reviews 
must be carried out, and the patient must be released when he is no 
longer considered a danger to himself or others. 
</P>
<P>
	John Perman, the jury foreman for the 1969 murder trial, said  
Friday the jurors believed they were, in effect, committing Harden 
for life. 
</P>
<P>
	``We kind of were given the impression ... that this would be  
for the rest of his life, because we didn't see how anyone in this 
condition could be turned around and released,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> NAACP OKs Tourism Boycott of S.C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LINTHICUM, Md. (AP) -- The NAACP's national board on Saturday  
approved a tourism boycott of South Carolina until the state 
removes the Confederate battle flag from the Statehouse dome. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ratification officially mobilizes all of our chapters and  
members to not visit or spend dollars in South Carolina until the 
flag is removed,'' said NAACP spokeswoman Sheila Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  
has 2,200 branches with about 500,000 members nationwide, Ms. 
Douglas said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NAACP's national leaders say they are working to make sure  
South Carolina will feel economic pain from the national boycott, 
which would begin Jan. 1. More than $280 million a year that black 
travelers spend in South Carolina could be at stake. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know that economic sanctions work. When talking fails, when  
diplomacy fails, when appeals to the moral conscience of these 
individuals fails, you can always appeal to the economic side,'' 
said Lonnie Randolph Jr., chairman of the NAACP's programs and 
research committee. 
</P>
<P>
	State legislators have refused to remove the flag. Supporters  
say it represents Southern heritage and honors South Carolinians 
who died in the Civil War. But the NAACP says it is a symbol of 
racism. 
</P>
<P>
	Several groups from across the nation have already canceled  
plans to hold meetings and conventions in South Carolina since the 
NAACP called for the boycott. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, the Seventh-day Adventist Church canceled a  
meeting that would have brought 7,000 people to Columbia for four 
days in March. Officials said the event would have brought $500,000 
worth of tourism business. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the state NAACP office in Columbia said 42 state  
and national groups have now joined the boycott, either canceling 
meetings or holding them out of state. 
</P>
<P>
	The flag controversy has embroiled South Carolina for several  
years. The state is the only one in the nation to fly the 
Confederate flag over its Statehouse, although Georgia and 
Mississippi incorporate part of the design into their state flags.

<HEADLINE> Pakistani Islamic Groups Warn U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Pakistan's hard-line Islamic groups  
vowed today to protect suspected terrorist Osama bin Laden and 
warned both the United States and United Nations that sanctions 
against Afghanistan would anger Muslims worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the U. N. Security Council gave Afghanistan's Taliban  
rulers one month to hand over bin Laden for trial in connection 
with the U.S. Embassy bombings in Africa or face limited sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	Reacting a day later, the Sipah-e-Sahaba -- a militant Sunni  
Muslim group blamed for the deaths of hundreds of Pakistan's 
minority Shiite Muslims -- said the United Nations was acting at the 
behest of the United States and warned that Muslims worldwide would 
react. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is hatred for the United States among Muslims,'' said  
Zia-ul Qasmi, a spokesman for the radical group. ``The time will 
come when Muslims will strongly react and this will be bad for 
Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We support Osama because he is a great fighter who is  
continuing his jihad (holy war) in Afghanistan,'' Qasmi said. 
</P>
<P>
	There has been no official reaction from Afghanistan's Taliban  
religious army, which rules about 90 percent of their war-battered 
homeland. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview today in Kabul, Afghan Commerce Minister Faizl  
Mohammed Faizan said sanctions will not hurt the Taliban 
government, only Afghanistan's people. He refused to say whether 
sanctions would prompt the Taliban to reconsider their protection 
of bin Laden.

	The Taliban have refused to hand over bin Laden, saying they  
have no extradition treaty with the United States or proof of the 
exiled Saudi's involvement in terrorist activities. They also say 
bin Laden is an honored guest in Afghanistan and will be protected 
by the Taliban because protection of guests is deeply rooted in 
Afghan culture and tradition. 
</P>
<P>
	In its ultimatum Friday, the United Nations said it would freeze  
the Taliban's assets and ban flights owned, leased or operated by 
the Taliban's Ariana airlines or landing internationally unless bin 
Laden is handed over. 
</P>
<P>
	Islamic groups in Pakistan, many of whom are believed to get  
training in Afghanistan, say the U.N. ultimatum reflects 
Washington's control over the global body. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan's right-wing Jamaat-e-Islami group, one of the  
best-organized religious parties in Pakistan, said bin Laden is a 
symbol to mujahedeen, or Islamic freedom fighters battling 
pro-secular regimes throughout the region. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bin Laden is not just a name, but a phenomena that embodies  
the jihads being fought throughout this region from Central Asia to 
Kashmir,'' said Munawar Hassan, a Jamaat-e-Islami spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Baylor Mulls Taking Brewers Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Atlanta Braves hitting coach Don Baylor said he  
has spoken with Milwaukee general manager Dean Taylor several times 
in recent weeks about becoming the Brewers' manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've talked about the organization itself, the type of  
players they have, what they're trying to do,'' Baylor said Friday. 
``We never talked about a contract, so we haven't gotten that 
far.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baylor, in an interview with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel,  
said he had a three-hour talk with Taylor in Atlanta soon after 
Taylor was named general manager Sept. 21 and has spoken with him 
six or seven times since. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor has also talked with Cincinnati coach Ken Griffey Sr.,  
planned to meet today with San Diego coach Davey Lopes and Monday 
with Arizona coach Carlos Tosca. 
</P>
<P>
	Baylor, who managed the Colorado Rockies for six years, denied  
reports of an oral agreement to manage the Chicago Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no agreement,'' he said. ``We made some progress. We  
have not talked about length of contract or a dollar figure 
whatsoever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also denied having no interest in Milwaukee because of what  
he felt was an insincere interview by Brewers general manager Sal 
Bando in 1991. Bando then hired Phil Garner. Both were fired a few 
weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sal is no longer there so that's not a factor,'' Baylor said.  
``I had a bad experience, but that's not going to be the deciding 
factor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Dean and I have gotten along great.''  
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta general manager John Schuerholz, Taylor's former boss,  
said he would not give permission to another team to hire Baylor 
while the Braves are in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the significance of Taylor's telephone calls to him,  
Baylor said: ``I'd say there is a pursuit going on.''

<HEADLINE> Families Grieve for Texas Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PLEASANTON, Texas (AP) -- Grieving relatives and police on  
Saturday remembered two of the three officers killed in last week's 
trailer park ambush. 
</P>
<P>
	Atascosa County Sheriff's Deputy Thomas Monse and Texas  
Department of Public Safety Trooper Terry Miller were buried. 
</P>
<P>
	Monse's widow, Mary Alice Monse, joked at the service that her  
husband sometimes called her ``a crybaby'' because she worried 
about him being hurt on the job. Monse, 31, was the first of the 
three officers to die from gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
	``The night I found this out, I said, 'I promise you I will be  
the strongest person you have ever seen,''' Mrs. Monse told 400 
mourners at St. Andrews Roman Catholic Church. ``'I will show you I 
can say goodbye to you, the way I want to say goodbye.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Monse recalled the couple's good and bad times, then spoke  
of her loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel so robbed,'' she said. ``This should not have ended  
this way. We should have died together when we were old. You should 
have walked your daughter down the aisle and been a grandfather.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a nearby cemetery, Monse was laid to rest in a gray metal  
casket among the hackberries and mesquites in a ceremony brimming 
with pageantry. 
</P>
<P>
	Later that day in Jourdanton, a few miles away, a crowd spilled  
into the parking lot of St. John's Lutheran Church to honor the 
37-year-old Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	In a eulogy for the slain trooper, Pastor Alston Kirk said  
Miller's last act of getting into his car and backing away from the 
scene may have saved other lawmen. 
</P>
<P>
	``In death, Terry gave life,'' Kirk told the crowd, which  
included about 400 uniformed officers from around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The shootings leave nine children fatherless, families shattered  
and police stunned. 
</P>
<P>
	``The loss of a lawman anywhere affects all of us because of our  
brotherhood,'' said Sgt. Mike Bonin of the Arizona Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller and Monse were among the officers lured to a trailer park  
in Pleasanton, 25 miles south of San Antonio, by a bogus 911 call 
Tuesday night. When they arrived, 21-year-old Jeremiah Engleton 
fatally shot them and wounded two other officers before killing 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
	The funeral for the third officer, 32-year-old Atascosa County  
Sheriff's Deputy Mark Stephenson, was Friday.

<HEADLINE> Mount Union Gets 48th Straight Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALLIANCE, Ohio (AP) -- Mount Union's record 48th consecutive  
victory wasn't a whole lot different from the 47 that preceded it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Purple Raiders (6-0) relied on their cutting-edge offense to  
beat Otterbein 44-20 Saturday and surpass Oklahoma's 42-year-old 
all-division record of 47 consecutive victories. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Smeck completed only 10 passes in the first half but they  
went for 205 yards and two touchdowns as the three-time defending 
Division III national champions built a 28-7 lead. Smeck, leading 
an offense that has only four seniors listed among its top 22 
players, set the tone by hitting Adam Marino on a 39-yard bomb on 
the Raiders' first play. 
</P>
<P>
	Using the pass to set up the run, the Purple Raiders also got a  
big day from Chuck Moore, who rushed for 180 yards and scored four 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	The game was played before a record crowd of 7,132 in Mount  
Union Stadium, capacity 5,000. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Purple Raiders keep the streak going and win their fourth  
straight Division III title, they might have to enlarge their 
stadium. They have a national championship banner on each of the 
four light poles. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the life of the streak -- stretching back to a 20-17 loss to  
Wisconsin-LaCrosse in the 1995 national semifinals -- Mount Union 
had averaged 514 yards per game, mostly through the air. 
</P>
<P>
	Their quarterbacks have thrown a touchdown pass in 107 straight  
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Mount Union, a 2,000-student school midway between Canton and  
Youngstown in northeastern Ohio, has won 70 of its last 71 games 
and has won 45 straight in the Ohio Athletic Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no pep rally, bonfire or parade for the players during  
the week as coach Larry Kehres attempted to keep the focus on the 
game. There probably wouldn't have been much interest from the 
student body, since few of the students had ever seen the Purple 
Raiders lose. 
</P>
<P>
	Only the fans and media seemed to get emotionally involved with  
the historic implications of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	The general admission areas of the small stadium were packed 90  
minutes before game time. With the kickoff still 45 minutes away, 
the public address announcer asked those without a seat to stand 
behind the chainlink fence circling the field. They stood three and 
four deep until the final gun. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd included the usual assortment of fans to be found at a  
nationally televised game between Division I-A powers. There were 
coeds with hair dyed purple, students with the letters M-O-U-N-T 
painted on their scrawny, hairless chests and aging alumni who sat 
quietly amidst the din. 
</P>
<P>
	There was purple everywhere, from the Purple Raiders' all-purple  
uniforms and the lettering on the field to the large purple 
scoreboard and almost every shirt and hat in the stands. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a rare step into the spotlight for Mount Union, despite  
its four national titles and 114-6-1 record this decade. More than 
100 media credentials were handed out -- roughly four times the 
number for a typical home game. In addition to the Alliance Review 
and the Salem News, there were reporters in the tiny pressbox 
representing USA Today, The New York Times, Washington Post, L.A. 
Times, ESPN and CNN. 
</P>
<P>
	Smeck, who completed 15-of-26 passes for 282 yards, had  
touchdown passes of 18 yards to Marino, 5 yards to Adam Irgang and 
27 yards to Moore. Moore also scored on runs of 6, 65 and 7 yards. 
Marino had nine catches for 209 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Otterbein's Matt D'Orazio tried to steal a page from the Purple  
Raiders' play book, passing for 325 yards and three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	A game ball and program was presented to the College Football  
Hall of Fame after the game.

<HEADLINE> Woodstock CD To Benefit Rape Hotline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME, N.Y. (AP) -- Some proceeds from a compact disc and a video  
of the Woodstock '99 concert -- which ended with reports of rapes 
and other sexual asaults -- will go toward a national rape hot line. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt we had to do something to make sure this never happens  
again,'' co-promoter John Scher said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the donation, every copy of the Woodstock '99 CD and  
home video will include information about the hot line. Rape Abuse 
and Incest National Network spokesman Scott Berkowitz said the 
money also will be used to expand the group's outreach and 
educational programs. 
</P>
<P>
	During the final act of the concert, which was held in July at a  
former Air Force base and attracted an audience of 225,000, a small 
group of concertgoers set fire to 12 tractor-trailers, a small bus 
and several portable toilets. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight alleged rapes and other sexual assaults during the concert  
were reported to police, but crisis intervention workers said many 
more went unreported.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Revives Health Care Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE PLACID, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton stood in front  
of 500 nurses and reminded them of a debacle in her public life, 
the 1994 defeat of the health care reform initiative she directed. 
</P>
<P>
	Weird campaign strategy? Not so, advisers to her Senate campaign  
committee and others maintain. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee Miringoff, head of Marist College's Institute for Public  
Opinion, said that with education and health care ranking as big 
issues with voters, the strategy may make perfect sense. 
</P>
<P>
	Miringoff said the Clinton camp seems to believe that she  
matches up well on those issues against her likely Republican 
opponent in next year's election, New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are looking for contrasting issues,'' Miringoff said.  
</P>
<P>
	In fact, a majority of Mrs. Clinton's summertime ``listening  
tour'' events across New York state were held at health care 
facilities or educational institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Health care is an important issue for New Yorkers, and it will  
be an important issue in this campaign,'' Howard Wolfson, spokesman 
for Mrs. Clinton's political committee, said Friday, the day after 
her address to the New York State Nurses Association in Lake 
Placid. ``New Yorkers know that Hillary Clinton cares about 
improving health care, and they know that Rudy Giuliani doesn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, that's the crass politics of it. The first lady  
offers a somewhat more uplifting explanation of why she still cares 
about health care reform despite her congressional drubbing five 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the results of that effort, there are probably many who  
find it hard to understand why I would keep talking about health 
care,'' she said Thursday. ``The answer is simple. It's something 
I've been talking about and working on my entire adult life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Giuliani camp believes Mrs. Clinton is vulnerable on health  
care. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a legitimate issue,'' Giuliani political spokesman Bruce  
Teitelbaum said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Her record, if I can use that word, is going to be scrutinized  
very carefully -- not just what she says in speeches, but as it 
relates to ... what her position has been and what she's done,'' 
the Giuliani adviser said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton was widely criticized for her handling of health  
care reform in 1994; some said she was pushing socialized medicine 
on America. On top of that, federal budget-balancing cuts approved 
in 1997 by Congress and her husband, President Clinton, hurt the 
state's health care facilities. Those are issues that could be used 
by the Giuliani camp against her. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's there, so she doesn't have much choice but to go out  
front on it,'' Miringoff said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton said Thursday the 1997 budget cuts went too far.  
</P>
<P>
	``These cuts ... have caused too much pain and are cutting into  
too much muscle and bone,'' the first lady said. 
</P>
<P>
	The effort appeared designed, in part, to inoculate her against  
attacks on that front, even if it was her husband and the GOP-led 
Congress that ordered the cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	The state -- and perhaps the first lady's campaign -- got a boost  
Friday when the federal government decided New York hospitals 
serving the poorest residents will not have to reimburse Washington 
nearly $1 billion in overpayments. 
</P>
<P>
	Miringoff thinks there are two other factors prompting Mrs.  
Clinton's embrace of changes in the health care system as a New 
York campaign issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, they can't focus on her roots in New York, so they  
have to shift the dialogue over to other things,'' he said. Mrs. 
Clinton has never lived or worked in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	And, according to the independent pollster, ``her strategy is  
going to be to nationalize the debate as much as possible'' in an 
attempt to tie Giuliani to Congress' conservative Republican 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, the Clinton camp has attacked Giuliani for not taking a  
public position on the current debate in Congress over giving 
patients more rights in dealing with their HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are still 13 months away from the election,'' Teitelbaum  
said Friday.

<HEADLINE> One Dead in Mo. Hayride Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EUREKA, Mo. (AP) -- A wagon carrying members of a Girl Scout  
troop on a hayride careened down a hill and overturned Friday 
night, killing a 12-year-old passenger and injuring 21 other 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	The injured girls were among 24 thrown from the wagon at the  
Rocking J Ranch, about 10 miles north of Eureka in eastern 
Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tractor, the trailer, everything went down the hill  
together,'' Jefferson County Sheriff's Lt. Mark Tulgetske said. 
``It went down into a grove of trees and just pinballed around in 
the trees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rachel McManemy died of head and chest injuries, Tulgetske said.  
</P>
<P>
	According to the sheriff's department, something went wrong with  
the tractor pulling the wagon. The driver told investigators it 
went out of gear while he was driving it, but authorities were 
checking other potential causes, including whether the brakes were 
faulty. 
</P>
<P>
	The wagon was the last of three carrying 72 scouts from the St.  
Raphael School in St. Louis. They were members of Brownie, Daisy 
and Junior troops at the school. 
</P>
<P>
	High Ridge Fire Chief Steve Davis said one of the injured girls  
was in critical condition and two were in serious condition. An 
adult, 30, was also among the injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Rocking J Ranch has offered hayrides for at  
least six years.

<HEADLINE> Quake Rocks Southern California </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JOSHUA TREE, Calif. (AP) -- A 7.0-magnitude earthquake in the  
Mojave Desert shook millions awake in three Western states early 
Saturday, derailing an Amtrak train, knocking out power to 
thousands, but causing no serious damage or injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The quake jolted gamblers out of bed in Las Vegas and shook  
buildings as far away as Phoenix and Tijuana, Mexico. Up to 90,000 
utility customers lost power, mobile homes were knocked off pilings 
in the desert community of Ludlow and a highway bridge was cracked. 
</P>
<P>
	With only a handful of injuries and no deaths, Californians  
credited location and luck for eluding catastrophe in the most 
powerful quake to hit the state since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thank God it took place in a remote area where there appears  
to be no tremendous damage or personal injuries,'' said Mayor 
Richard Riordan in Los Angeles, where the 6.7-magnitude Northridge 
quake killed 72 people and caused $25 billion in damage in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak's Southwest Chief, en route from Chicago to Los Angeles,  
derailed in near Ludlow, more than 125 miles northeast of Los 
Angeles. Four of the 155 passengers on the train suffered minor 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our saving grace was, we were following a freight train,''  
said Glenn Morton, the train's conductor. ``We were going 60 mph 
instead of the 80 mph we normally would do through here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All the homes in a nearby mobile home park were shoved off their  
foundations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody was running out. The dogs were howling. The cats  
were hiding. And the kids were freaking,'' said Barbara Houseworth, 
19, who fled her trailer with her 3-year-old child. ``When mobile 
homes rock, they really rock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A concrete bridge over Interstate 40 had large cracks, but the  
highway remained open. Merchandise flew off shelves and at least 
one supermarket was left with structural damage. Small brush fires 
were ignited by downed power lines in Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
	Light damage was also reported on the sprawling Marine Air  
Ground Combat Center south of Ludlow in Twentynine Palms, including 
broken water and gas lines. 
</P>
<P>
	The quake -- named ``Hector'' after the mineral mining site where  
it was centered -- began at 2:46 a.m. about 32 miles north of Joshua 
Tree in the Mojave Desert, according to the California Institute of 
Technology. Aftershocks followed by the hundreds, including strikes 
of 5.8, 5.3 and 5.0 magnitude. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands more aftershocks are expected, but there is only a 5  
percent chance that a quake bigger than the original will strike in 
the next week, said Lucy Jones, chief seismologist at the U.S. 
Geological Survey's office in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second huge earthquake in the region in only seven  
years. The magnitude-7.3 Landers earthquake in 1992 killed one 
person, injured 400 and caused nearly $100 million in damage. The 
Hector quake hit about 30 miles northeast of the Landers epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities in Las Vegas and the Los Angeles area said there  
were no reports of serious damage or injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shook everything pretty good, but that was about it,'' said  
Lt. Rich Paddock of the Orange County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
	A hotel near Disneyland evacuated guests as a precaution, and  
many gamblers in Las Vegas left their high-rise hotel rooms for the 
ground-level casinos. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole place was shaking like crazy,'' said Michelle  
Fabian, awakened on the 18th floor of the Mirage Hotel, 150 miles 
from the Hector area. 
</P>
<P>
	The effects of the earthquake were more pronounced near the  
epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Did you ever play a pinball machine and see the ball get stuck  
in there and go bam-bam-bam-bam-bam-bam? It just threw my body back 
and forth as I ran down the hallway,'' surf guitarist Dick Dale 
said from his home 30 miles from the epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
	But although the Joshua Tree Inn lost power, it had no  
significant damage, night manager Jacob Naylor said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Twelve guests, all definitely awake. A couple in from Holland,  
definitely shocked. A couple in from the U.K. asked me, `Is this 
normal?''' Naylor said. ``They're all taking it rather well, kind 
of excited. Vacationers, new experiences, what can I say?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seismologists say there is no connection among the large quakes  
that have occurred recently around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, a magnitude-7.2 rocked Taiwan, killing more than  
2,300 people and causing an estimated $9.2 billion in damage. In 
August, a 7.4 quake killed at least 17,000 people in western 
Turkey, and in September, a 5.9 quake in Greece killed 143 people.

<HEADLINE> Canada GM Plant Denounces Outsourcing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Plans by General Motors of Canada Ltd. to end  
production at the St. Therese, Quebec, assembly plant and outsource 
other work could lead to a walk-out by Canadian Auto Workers, union 
president Buzz Hargrove said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The outsourcing positions they have on the table will cause a  
strike,'' Hargrove said at a Toronto news conference. ``Under no 
circumstances are we going to allow outsourcing when we have 
insecurity with workers at St. Therese and other plants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The CAW has set a midnight Tuesday deadline to reach an  
agreement with GM. During 1996 contract talks, the CAW struck GM's 
Oshawa, Ontario, assembly plant, idling some U.S. parts and 
assembly plants. 
</P>
<P>
	A contract with GM is expected to closely model agreements  
already reached with Ford Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler AG. 
</P>
<P>
	Those call for a 3 percent wage increase in each year of a  
three-year package, a $1,000 (Canadian) signing bonus, an improved 
retirement package and other benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove said in July that the future of the St. Therese plant  
and GM plans to outsource work would be key issues in this year's 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowered demand for the Chevrolet Cameros and Pontiac Firebirds  
produced at St. Therese has raised speculation that the plant might 
be closed. GM has said it will cease production of the cars there 
in September 2002, and nothing is scheduled to replace that line, 
Hargrove said. 
</P>
<P>
	GM officials in Detroit and Ontario could not be immediately  
reached for comment Saturday.

<HEADLINE> EU Moves for Closer Cop Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPERE, Finland (AP) -- Looking for more weapons to fight crime  
in the new, borderless Europe, European Union leaders set out new 
objectives Saturday for closer police and judicial cooperation 
between countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Ending their two-day summit in this lakeside Finnish city, EU  
leaders agreed to develop a broad range of measures that would 
allow better cooperation among police forces, ease extradition of 
criminals, recognize judicial decisions made in other member 
countries, and crack down on money laundering and trafficking in 
people and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	The objectives are also aimed at getting a better handle on  
immigrants and asylum seekers. There are almost no border controls 
between the 15 nations in the European Union. 
</P>
<P>
	EU leaders also agreed to establish a European asylum system  
that would include common standards for procedures, conditions for 
reception of asylum seekers and rules on refugee status. 
</P>
<P>
	The leaders also reached a consensus on starting membership  
negotiations with six additional countries next year, possibly 
enlarging the European Union as early as 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	They backed away, however, from establishing a special fund of  
$265 million to assist member states facing a mass influx of 
refugees. They also shied away from any hint of making their laws 
and systems uniform. 
</P>
<P>
	An early draft of the summit's concluding document contained  
much more ambitious wording about bringing laws and procedures in 
EU countries into ``approximation.'' As in many areas of EU 
cooperation, when it comes down to the crunch for surrendering 
sovereignty or national individuality, nations hesitate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are dealing with another part of the European integration  
policy,'' said German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder. ``We will only 
be able to build it step by step.'' 
</P>
<P>
	French Premier Lionel Jospin said: ``France is against a single  
system but for a common approach that respects the sovereignty of 
nations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The organization started membership negotiations last year with  
Cyprus, Estonia, Slovenia, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. 
This week the EU Commission recommended that negotiations start 
next year with Bulgaria, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia and 
Malta. 
</P>
<P>
	A final decision on widening the negotiations will not be made  
until the next EU summit, which is scheduled for Dec. 11-12 in 
Helsinki, but there seemed little doubt after discussions here that 
the idea would get the green light. That leaves Turkey as the only 
aspirant country seen as unfit to begin membership talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkey, officials said, still has a lot of progress to make on  
human rights, one of the main criteria for EU membership. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, EU leaders said Saturday they deeply regret the  
U.S. Senate's vote not to ratify the nuclear test ban treaty 
because ``this sends the wrong signal to would-be nuclear 
proliferators.''

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Cancels Football Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Hurricane Irene probably won't force  
the Jacksonville Jaguars to postpone their game Sunday against the 
Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	But team vice president Michael Huyghue said the NFL was  
monitoring the weather in North Florida, and had contingency plans 
to move the game to later in the afternoon, or to Monday night, if 
extreme conditions existed. 
</P>
<P>
	The weather forced the Browns to travel to Jacksonville late  
Friday, instead of Saturday, which is their normal travel day. The 
storm was just off the east coast of Florida, about 200 miles south 
of Jacksonville, at midday Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the winds should be clear of Jacksonville by the  
scheduled 1 p.m., EDT kickoff Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Two college football games, one involving No. 24 Miami, and two  
major thoroughbred races were postponed Friday because of the 
weather. 
</P>
<P>
	The Miami Hurricanes rescheduled Saturday's game with Temple  
because the Owls had trouble getting a flight to South Florida. The 
game will be played Dec. 4. 
</P>
<P>
	Bethune-Cookman College postponed its game against South  
Carolina State in Daytona Beach. The game, scheduled for Saturday 
night, will be played Thursday night.

<HEADLINE> Cops Probe Injury of Disabled Man </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Police are investigating allegations that  
officers injured a mentally retarded Ukrainian immigrant after 
mistaking him for a burglary suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	The department's internal affairs division opened the probe  
Friday, said Detective Sgt. Cheryl Kanzler. 
</P>
<P>
	Pavel Guzenko, 36, was carting firewood to his relatives Tuesday  
night when officers investigating a report of a stolen wheelbarrow 
attempted to question him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Two female officers responded, stopped a man they saw with a  
wheelbarrow, and that's when things went bad,'' Ms. Kanzler said. 
She did not identify the officers. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers issued several orders to Guzenko, who does not  
understand English. Witnesses said the officers then jumped 
Guzenko, leaving the right side of his face badly scraped. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told me he was trying to tell them in Russian, `I'm  
sorry,''' said his sister-in-law, Tanya Guzenko. 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives later took Guzenko to an emergency room. Blood was  
found in his urine, suggesting he might have suffered internal 
injuries, said the family's lawyer, Gary Lau.

	Calif. Quake Damage Limited  
</P>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- The quake that jolted the Southwest  
early today had an intimidating magnitude of 7.0, but thanks to the 
remote location of its epicenter, major injuries and damage were 
avoided. The quake -- the most powerful in California since 1992 -- 
struck in the Mojave Desert, about 120 miles east of Los Angeles, 
and was felt in Las Vegas and as far away as Phoenix. Last month, a 
magnitude-7.2 quake rocked Taiwan, killing more than 2,300 people. 
In August, a 7.4 quake killed at least 17,000 people in Turkey.

<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- The opening of a land link between the West  
Bank and Gaza Strip is being delayed for a second time in two weeks 
because of disagreements over how to operate it, Palestinian and 
Israeli officials said Saturday. The passage was to have opened 
Sunday, allowing Palestinians for the first time to move relatively 
freely between the two Palestinian areas that lie on either side of 
Israel. However, the Israelis and Palestinians were unable to agree 
on the location of an office in the Gaza Strip that would hand out 
travel permits for the Palestinians.

	Irene Threatening Carolinas  
</P>
<P>
	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Hurricane Irene began a slow march  
up the East Coast today, slipping out of Florida after dumping 
heavy rain and knocking out power to more than a million people. 
The storm blamed for at least seven deaths was expected to hug the 
East Coast as it moved north and forecasters feared it could gain 
strength and dump several inches of rain on the flood-weary 
Carolinas through the weekend. A hurricane watch issued today 
stretched north to Cape Hatteras, N.C. The storm was packing winds 
of 80 mph.

	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Pakistani army chief Pervaiz  
Musharraf canceled a promised television address Saturday that was 
expected to outline an interim government. Meanwhile, Pakistani 
army officers combed bank records and questioned travelers at 
airports after the new military regime made economic revival and 
the hunt for looted wealth its top priorities. The search for 
illicit assets was the first act of the regime, which ousted the 
elected government Tuesday, announced emergency rule and proclaimed 
Musharraf as the supreme leader.

a U.N. ultimatum to surrender suspected terrorist Osama bin Laden 
and castigated the world body today for threatening sanctions. ``We 
will never give up Osama at any price,'' the Taliban's Foreign 
Minister Mullah Mohammed Hassan Akhund said in a statement. The 
U.N. Security Council yesterday decided to impose limited economic 
sanctions on the Taliban if it does not hand bin Laden over by Nov. 
14. ``No proof came from anyone, especially America, that Osama was 
involved in terrorist activities,'' Akhund said.

	CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand (AP) -- Researchers bid an American  
doctor with breast cancer symptoms goodbye Saturday as a plane 
rescued her from their South Pole research station. The temperature 
was a relatively balmy 58 degrees below zero. Dr. Jerri Nielsen was 
inspected by physicians after the flight from the pole to McMurdo 
base on Antarctica's coast. Nielsen discovered a lump in her breast 
in June after the ultra-cold temperatures of the Antarctic winter 
had closed in, sealing off the research station and its inhabitants 
to the outside world.

	LINTHICUM, Md. (AP) -- The NAACP's national board today approved  
a tourism boycott of South Carolina until the state removes the 
Confederate battle flag from the Statehouse dome. ``The 
ratification officially mobilizes all of our chapters and members 
to not visit or spend dollars in South Carolina until the flag is 
removed,'' said NAACP spokeswoman Sheila Douglas. More than $280 
million a year that black travelers spend in South Carolina could 
be at stake.

	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Ron Dayne ran for 167 of Wisconsin's  
school-record 705 yards of total offense as No. 17 Wisconsin 
steamrolled Indiana 59-0 today. Dayne, who had just 17 carries and 
sat out the entire second half, became the fourth player in 
Division I history to record four 1,000-yard rushing seasons. 
Wisconsin (5-2, 3-1) led 38-0 at halftime, didn't punt in the game 
and failed to score on just two drives. Indiana (3-4, 2-2) twice 
couldn't score inside Wisconsin's 20.

<HEADLINE> N.C. Braces for Hurricane Irene </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, N.C. (AP) -- Hurricane Irene rumbled up the East  
Coast on Saturday, taking aim at flood-weary North Carolina, where 
residents began all-too-familiar preparations for another 
onslaught. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Jim Hunt declared a state of emergency. Officials  
considered evacuations and warned that it wouldn't take much rain 
to push rivers in the eastern part of the state back above flood 
stages. Irene's winds also could threaten camper villages populated 
by people left homeless by floods from Hurricane Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Buday, whose government-provided camper is parked in his  
soggy yard, wore rubber gloves and boots Saturday as he hauled 
sodden carpeting and furniture to the street. Hurricane Floyd left 
water 16 inches deep in his brick home across the street from the 
Neuse River near Goldsboro, but Buday wasn't fretting about Irene 
just yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now it doesn't worry me, but I don't know what I'll feel  
like tomorrow,'' Buday said. ``The river's down. I don't think 
we'll have a problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the storm has been blamed for at least seven deaths --  
two in Cuba and five people near Fort Lauderdale, Fla., who were 
electrocuted by downed power lines. After drenching Cuba's tobacco 
fields and collapsing buildings in Havana, Irene rolled ashore 
Friday afternoon 75 miles southwest of Miami and headed north 
through the Everglades. 
</P>
<P>
	At its worst, the storm knocked out power to more than 1.5  
million customers, according to Florida Power &AMP; Light, the state's 
largest utility. Electricity was restored to about half of them by 
midday Saturday. As much as 18 inches of wind-driven rain caused 
scattered flooding over hundreds of miles, from Key West to West 
Palm Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could not give you a damage assessment (of crops). ... I  
would not be surprised if it were $100 million,'' said Miami-Dade 
Mayor Alex Penelas. ``It seems about every piece of farm land is 
literally under water.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irene intensified slightly as it headed north. Its 75 mph  
sustained winds were just above the threshold for a hurricane. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 p.m. Saturday, the center of the storm was about 210 miles  
south of Charleston, S.C., and moving north near 10 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Projections from the National Hurricane Center put the ragged  
eye of the storm near Cape Romain, just northeast of Charleston, by 
Sunday afternoon -- and it was expected to make landfall near the 
North Carolina-South Carolina state line late Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	It was exactly a month ago Saturday that thousands of coastal  
residents returned home after fleeing Hurricane Floyd, which 
destroyed than 6,000 buildings and damaged 9,000 others. At least 
49 deaths and damage expected to exceed Hurricane Fran's record $6 
billion in 1996 were blamed on the huge storm. Piles of soggy 
furniture and ruined toys and appliances still line roads 
throughout the region. 
</P>
<P>
	By Saturday night, less than an inch of rain had fallen on  
southeastern North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no place for this rainfall to go, so any little bit of  
rain that we get from this hurricane could immediately cause 
flooding,'' said Laura Furgione, a meteorologist at the National 
Weather Service office in Newport on the central North Carolina 
coast. 
</P>
<P>
	A hurricane warning was in effect from Savannah, Ga., to Cape  
Hatteras, N.C., and a hurricane watch was posted for north of Cape 
Hatteras to the Virginia border. A tropical storm warning remained 
in effect north of Vero Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Emergency management officials discussed possible evacuations in  
Brunswick and New Hanover counties, where the hurricane warnings 
were in effect, and visitors were ordered off the Cape Lookout 
National Seashore. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials opened shelters to evacuate hundreds of residents who  
had moved to campers set up as temporary housing for people whose 
homes were ruined by Floyd's floods. In Pitt County, the evacuees 
were being offered space in the Pitt County Jail's gymnasium and in 
the county courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
	The state was mobilizing 300 National Guard troops Saturday to  
prepare for the recovery effort, and Eric Tolbert, North Carolina's 
emergency management director, said many supplies are already in 
place because of the recovery effort from Hurricane Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a little concerned about personnel resources being  
strained,'' Tolbert said. ``Our personnel are obviously tired.''

<HEADLINE> Uganda Army Faces Congo Mining Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni has  
reportedly ordered his troops in Congo to steer clear of mining 
deals, a move apparently aimed at easing rifts between forces 
trying to unseat Congo's president. 
</P>
<P>
	Tensions among rival rebel groups and between their backers,  
Rwanda and Uganda, have stemmed from the battle for control of 
Congo's rich resources, said rebel leader Ernest Wamba dia Wamba. 
His comments were broadcast Friday on state-run Radio Uganda. 
</P>
<P>
	Wamba, who was ousted in May as leader of the main rebel  
movement, the Rwandan-backed Congolese Rally for Democracy, said he 
was concerned that Rwandan authorities have not taken similar 
steps. 
</P>
<P>
	Rwanda denies its soldiers are involved in mineral deals or any  
other business in Congo. 
</P>
<P>
	Ugandan authorities could not be immediately reached for  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebellion that began in August 1998 to oust President  
Laurent Kabila swept through the eastern third of Congo before a 
peace accord went into effect on Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	But infighting over rebel leadership and disputes between Rwanda  
and Uganda over how to end the war and for control of Congo's 
lucrative natural resources have strained relations between the two 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, Rwandan and Ugandan politicians have been  
meeting to patch up their damaged relations and have reportedly 
reached agreement to unite Congolese rebels into a single group, 
the Ugandan government-owned New Vision newspaper said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ugandans also back a third rebel group, the Movement for  
Congolese Liberation, headed by Jean-Pierre Bemba. His father, 
Bemba Saolona, is Kabila's minister of economy and industry.

<HEADLINE> Brush Fires Break Out in California </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELLA VISTA, Calif. (AP) -- Residents living near this rural  
Northern California town were hastily evacuated Saturday because of 
a fast-moving brush fire that grew from 3,000 to 15,000 acres in a 
single afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty to 70 homes and other structures had been consumed by the  
blaze, which broke out about 4:15 a.m. Saturday, in an area that 
experienced a similar brush fire just weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have nothing left in this town,'' said California  
Department of Forestry spokeswoman Rose Wyckoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents in the town of Millville, Jones Valley and Palo Cedro  
had also been evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Wyckoff said the exact number of evacuees was not available.  
</P>
<P>
	The fire was consuming heavy timber in some areas and lighter  
grassy brush in others. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 500 firefighters were working the blaze, which was  
made more intense by warm temperatures and gusty winds over 25 mph. 
The cause of the fire was not known and there was no estimate of a 
time for containment. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're praying for rain,'' said Ms. Wyckoff.  
</P>
<P>
	An evacuation center was set up at Anderson High School.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Wearing a faded Lakers T-shirt and a bright  
grin, 16-year-old Nick Astrinakis walked outside after a brief tour 
Saturday of the new $375 million Staples Center pumping his arms in 
the air. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was great,'' said the diehard Lakers fan. ``It's huge, real  
state-of-the-art. I've never seen anything like it, I'm really 
excited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His enthusiasm was shared by politicians and clergy who  
officially opened the downtown sports and entertainment center with 
a multi-denominational blessing, public tour and all-day, all-night 
street festival ending at 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Roman Catholic Cardinal Roger Mahony led the blessing ceremony,  
which mirrored the city's ethnic and religious diversity by 
including representatives from major faiths. 
</P>
<P>
	``By giving us rest and healthy recreation you refresh our weary  
bodies and minds,'' Mahony said during the blessing and 
ribbon-cutting ceremony. ``May it contribute to the enrichment of 
companionship and lead to new friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Richard Riordan said the privately funded center should be  
seen as a symbol of downtown revitalization efforts and a new era 
for the city. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today we're sending a loud and clear message to the rest of  
the world,'' Riordan said. ``Los Angeles is still No. 1.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The venue will be the new home of the NBA's Lakers and Clippers,  
the NHL's Kings, and the Avengers, a new Arena Football League 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the Staples Center will feature concerts. It will  
host the 42nd Grammy Awards in February and the 2000 Democratic 
National Convention in August. 
</P>
<P>
	State Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa said the new center  
was a good first step in rejuvenating downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's an understanding that we have to make downtown  
attractive,'' Villaraigosa said. ``I think today is important for 
that reason.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Randon Caceres of Downey, brought his children to opening day to  
show his support for the home teams and for sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is something they should experience,'' Caceres said.  
``Plus, I might not get another chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Going to a game could be a struggle for the average sports fan.  
Single game regular admission prices for the Kings and Clippers 
range from $10 to $300, while tickets for the city's beloved Lakers 
range from $21 to $150. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be going to Lakers games,'' Caceres said. ``But I have a  
wife and kid, so I just go by myself.''

<HEADLINE> Ohio St.'s Awful Stretch Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) -- John Cooper was only half right when  
he said Ohio State couldn't beat this Penn State team at its best. 
</P>
<P>
	His punchless Buckeyes couldn't stop Penn State at its most  
inconsistent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nittany Lions sputtered time and again inside the 20, threw  
an interception, fumbled at their 1 and had two field goals 
blocked. Yet Ohio State still couldn't avoid a 23-10 defeat and the 
worst seven-game record in more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you can't block and you can't tackle, then you're not going  
to beat a good football team,'' Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State (4-3 overall, 1-2 Big Ten) has lost three games for  
the first time since 1988, Cooper's first season. That year, the 
Buckeyes were 2-4 on the way to finishing 4-6-1. 
</P>
<P>
	And road games against nationally ranked Michigan and Michigan  
State still await. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Ohio State gave up 211 rushing yards to Eric McCoo,  
the first time a back had more than 200 yards since Curtis Enis' 
211 in Penn State's 31-27 victory in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State gave up 246 rushing yards, the most since Penn State  
ran for 316 that day two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State hadn't scored so few points since losing to Michigan  
13-9 in 1996 -- and the offense managed only a field goal. The 
defense turned Penn State's fumble into a TD. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shouldn't be that the defense scores more than the  
offense,'' linebacker Na'il Diggs said. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Bellisari ran for 38 yards and threw for 78. Reggie  
Germany caught three passes for 45 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Otherwise, the Ohio State offense was a no-show. Tailback  
Michael Wiley ran for just 18 yards on 10 carries. Ken-Yon Rambo 
had one catch for 5 yards. A team averaging 399 yards a game 
managed a measly 143. Bellisari was sacked eight times. 
</P>
<P>
	Offensive lineman Tyson Walter said the Buckeyes were just  
confused. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just did everything wrong,'' Walter said. ``It was just an  
atrocious game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Buckeyes can blame youth after losing its quarterback, its  
No. 2 runner, two wideouts and three defensive stars to graduation 
from last year's 11-1 team. 
</P>
<P>
	``That football team has a lot of talent,'' Penn State's Joe  
Paterno said. ``The only thing this Ohio State team doesn't have 
that they had last year is experience.''

<HEADLINE> Talk Back Wins at Woodbine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Talk Back might have earned a ticket to the  
Breeders' Cup with a 6 1/2-length victory in Saturday's $161,850 
Princess Elizabeth Stakes at Woodbine Race Track, but owner David 
Willmot called it ``an empty victory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hello Seattle, the impressive two-time winner and Talk Back's  
chief rival in the 1 1-16-mile race for 2-year-old fillies, 
sustained a serious leg injury about a half-mile into the race and 
was pulled up. 
</P>
<P>
	Hello Seattle ``suffered a condylar fracture of the right fore  
leg,'' said Dr. Greg Taylor, Woodbine's attending veterinarian. 
``It was not a compound fracture. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dr. (Robert) McMartin is taking X-rays and at this point, the  
injury is not life-threatening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jockey Robert Landry said Hello Seattle, owned by Sam-Son Farm,  
took a bad step. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was galloping along and just took one bad step,'' Landry  
said. ``You hate to see that happen. You hate to see that happen to 
any horse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Princess Elizabeth, the top Canadian 2-year-old filly race,  
was to decide whether one or both of the highly touted pair would 
go on to face the world's best in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile 
Fillies at Gulfstream Park on Nov. 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Kinghaven Farms' Talk Back, a daughter of Talkin Man, appeared  
to answer any questions about her own ability by drawing off in 
mid-stretch from Prado Star to win in 1:44.80. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's a nice filly,'' jockey David Clark said of the  
Ontario-bred. ``She kind of bobbled leaving the gate, fell a little 
bit but she's pretty athletic and recovered quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were right where we wanted to be going down the backside.  
She finished really well and galloped out well. She is still 
learning and she would have run on better if a horse was beside her 
but that will come in time. At this point she is one of the best 
fillies I've been on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trainer Robert Tiller said a decision on the Breeders' Cup will  
be made later. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would have loved to have hooked her (Hello Seattle),''  
Tiller said. ``Our filly is undefeated and we'll see how she comes 
out of this race and talk to (Willmot) about the Breeders' Cup and 
we'll make a decision. Right now we're going to enjoy the moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Willmot was far from euphoric about the win.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's an empty victory,'' he said. ``Everybody was looking  
forward to this race. To presume one was better than the other 
before this race was a reach. It's unfortunate, and I feel terrible 
for Mr. (Ernie) Samuel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Talk Back, now a three-time winner, collected $111,677 and  
boosted her career earnings to $144,697.

<HEADLINE>  Russian Troops Near Chechan Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Russian artillery and tanks dug in atop a  
hill just outside the Chechen capital Grozny on Saturday in 
preparation for what Moscow said was the next phase in its campaign 
to wipe out insurgents. 
</P>
<P>
	After their deepest push yet into the breakaway republic,  
Russian troops were digging in on heights overlooking the city, 
which was now well within range of Russian artillery. There were no 
indications whether Russian commanders would try to push in to 
Grozny, which is heavily defended by Chechen forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Col. Gen. Viktor Kazantsev said that his troops had finished  
creating a security zone to seal off the militants, and that a 
second phase was underway to wipe out the bases of the insurgents. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will not launch strikes against peaceful villages,'' he  
told The Associated Press on Saturday. ``We will destroy the 
bandits on the territory of Chechnya.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the Russian troops dug in near Grozny, Chechen militants  
led by a prominent warlord struck back with a nighttime raid, 
crossing the Terek River and taking back a small village, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shamil Basayev, who led two separate raids on villages in  
neighboring Dagestan this fall, told The Associated Press his men 
had killed 26 Russian troops in the attack Saturday on the village 
of Shchedrinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	``This war has proved once more that the Russians don't learn  
anything,'' Basayev said. ``They're not a serious opponent. We have 
beat them before and will beat them again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russian forces were badly defeated in a 1994-96 war in the  
republic, eventually withdrawing and giving Chechnya de facto 
independence. But Russia's military commanders say they can defeat 
the insurgents this time. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian side said it was making extensive progress with few  
losses. A military spokesman on Saturday said units of Russia's 
58th Army had taken control of the highway linking Grozny with 
Nazran, the capital of Chechnya's western neighbor Ingushetia, the 
ITAR-Tass news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The spokesman also said that the Chechen guerrillas suffered  
``serious losses'' from Russian artillery and air raids on several 
villages on Friday and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Before its push toward the Chechen capital, Russia had overrun  
Chechnya's northern plains, halting their operations for a while 
along the line of the Terek River. The militants have been 
reluctant to hit north of the river, where the plains favor the 
Russian tanks and big guns. 
</P>
<P>
	But the latest movements and claims from both sides indicated  
that they were gearing up for heavy fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	Kazantsev, at a news conference Friday, said Russian troops in  
Chechnya suffered 47 people killed and 33 wounded since Sept. 25. 
They also lost one tank, five armored personnel carriers and two 
other combat vehicles to enemy fire. At least 1,500 rebels have 
been killed, Kazantsev claimed. 
</P>
<P>
	Chechen officials have said that hundreds of Russian soldiers  
have been killed, and put their own losses at just a few dozen. 
Neither side's claims could be independently confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the 1994-96 war, the current campaign has widespread  
public support among most Russians. Four September apartment bomb 
blasts that killed 300 people have been blamed on Chechen 
militants, and many say they should be destroyed at all costs.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pushes Diversity Acceptance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Of all the challenges the United States will  
face in the next century, by far the most important is building 
``one America out of this crazy quilt of all of us who live here,'' 
President Clinton told an Italian-American audience Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Too many people at home and abroad will enter the next  
millennium caught ``in a conflict between modern possibilities and 
primitive hatred,'' unable to grasp the fact they share ``a common 
humanity,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Solve the problem of prejudice and group hatred, Clinton said,  
``and we'll find a way to deal with all the rest of our problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton addressed the 24th annual black-tie dinner of the  
National Italian American Foundation, offering praise and thanks 
for the organization's support of his administration's ``One 
America'' initiative, which seeks to build unity out of the 
nation's rapidly increasing ethnic diversity. 
</P>
<P>
	The foundation is the major Washington advocate for nearly 15  
million Italian Americans, the nation's fifth largest ethnic group. 
</P>
<P>
	It is a group, Clinton said, that has suffered from prejudice  
and discrimination in the past and is still troubled by flawed and 
faulty ethnic stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have to do for the 21st century is to grow one country  
out of our diversity,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	And it is that very diversity, he added, ``which makes America a  
very interesting place to live in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was joined on the dais by first lady Hillary Rodham  
Clinton, who spoke of her interest in the issues of children. She 
did not mention her probable Senate race in New York state, where 
Italian-Americans are a politically potent ethnic group. 
</P>
<P>
	Guests at the bipartisan dinner included Italian Foreign  
Minister Lamberto Dini; singer Vic Damone; Supreme Court Justice 
Antonin Scalia; White House chief of staff John Podesta; and the 
actor-model known as Fabio.

<HEADLINE> Website Logs Earthquake Anecdotes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In case of earthquake: duck, cover and log  
on. 
</P>
<P>
	Within a few hours of Saturday's magnitude-7.0 quake in the  
Southern California desert, more than 10,000 people ventured into 
cyberspace to register their experiences on a new Website 
(www-socal.wr.usgs.gov) run by the U.S. Geological Survey. 
</P>
<P>
	``Did you feel it?'' the site asks.  
</P>
<P>
	Scientists will use the thousands of anecdotal reports to  
determine whether they were right about the regions expected to 
suffer the worst shaking, USGS seismologist Mary Lou Zoback said. 
Though not conclusive, the results offer another way to gauge 
research on the mysterious mechanics of earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
	The online participants answer a host of questions, including:  
Were they inside or outside when the quake hit? Was it difficult to 
stand or walk? And what type of damage did their home sustain? 
</P>
<P>
	The responses are categorized by ZIP code. All other  
identification is voluntary, Ms. Zoback said. 
</P>
<P>
	A common assumption is that earthquake tremors radiate outward  
like ripples in a pool of water. In fact, the conditions of the 
ground can focus shock waves and bounce them around below the 
surface, hitting some areas harder than others, Ms. Zoback said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2-month-old Internet site, known as the Community Internet  
Intensity Map, uses the experiences of residents to place ZIP codes 
in a 12-level ranking system, which ranges from ``Not Felt'' to 
``Extreme.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers will use the stories to augment scientific data  
about areas that may require stronger structures and roadways to 
prepare for future quakes, Ms. Zoback said.

<HEADLINE> Hindus Allege Forced Conversions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- A Hindu fundamentalist group said  
Saturday that Pope John Paul II should use his visit to India next 
month to remove apprehensions about what it called forced 
conversions by Christian missionaries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mass conversion with a set date before them is incompatible  
with any spiritual motive,'' Ashok Singhal, international working 
president of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, or the World Hindu Council, 
told reporters in New Delhi. 
</P>
<P>
	Singhal claimed that more than 100,000 Christian missionaries  
working in India were forcing poor Hindu villagers to convert. His 
group is organizing a 940-mile protest march by Hindu nationalists 
that will start from Goa in southwestern India next week and reach 
New Delhi on Nov. 4, the eve of the pope's arrival. 
</P>
<P>
	During his Nov. 5-8 visit to New Delhi, the pope will  
participate in a congregation of Asian bishops, meet Indian secular 
and religious leaders and celebrate a Mass at Nehru Stadium in the 
Indian capital. 
</P>
<P>
	The Roman Catholic archbishop of New Delhi, Alan de Lastic, has  
rejected Hindu fundamentalists' charges of forced conversions, 
saying they have never produced any proof. 
</P>
<P>
	Christians comprise about 2.3 percent of India's nearly one  
billion people. 
</P>
<P>
	The governing Bharatiya Janata Party and its religious  
affiliates, including the VHP, say that Christian missionaries who 
have set up schools, dispensaries and old age homes across India 
are forcing poor Hindu villagers to convert. 
</P>
<P>
	Church leaders deny the charge and say their community has been  
the target of more than 100 attacks during the past year. 
Australian missionary Graham Staines and his two young sons were 
burned to death in a jeep, and Roman Catholic priest Rev. Arul Doss 
was shot with arrows and beaten to death this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In another incident, a nun was abducted, stripped and forced to  
drink urine by two men who objected to her religion. Several church 
buildings and Christian homes also were targeted by Hindu 
fundamentalists. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government says all the attacks on Christians have  
been investigated, and many of them were linked to local land and 
property disputes.

<HEADLINE> No. 17 Wisconsin 59, Indiana 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Ron Dayne ran for 167 of Wisconsin's  
school-record 705 yards of total offense as No. 17 Wisconsin 
steamrolled Indiana 59-0 Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dayne, who had just 17 carries and sat out the entire second  
half, became the fourth player in Division I history to record four 
1,000-yard rushing seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	He ran for two touchdowns, including a 57-yard rumble late in  
the second quarter that put Wisconsin (5-2, 3-1 Big Ten) up 38-0 at 
halftime in its homecoming game. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana's depleted defense was helpless against Wisconsin's  
strong ground attack, and freshman quarterback Brooks Bollinger was 
9-of-10 for 162 yards and a touchdown before leaving the game with 
a minor hip bruise in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hoosiers (3-4, 2-2) lost star defensive end Adewale Ogunleye  
for the season last week with a knee injury, but he might not have 
made much difference as Wisconsin's mammoth offensive line pushed 
Indiana around. Wisconsin had 461 rushing yards and 31 first downs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Badgers didn't punt in the game and failed to score on just  
two drives, both in the second half. Wisconsin was up 45-0 early in 
the third, and Indiana twice couldn't score inside Wisconsin's 20. 
The Badgers outgained Indiana 401-112 in the first half alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana quarterback Antwaan Randle El had a horrible day against  
the Badgers' smothering defense. He was held to 28 rushing yards -- 
72 below his average -- and was 10-of-25 passing, with most of his 
deep throws missing their targets by several yards. 
</P>
<P>
	With coach Barry Alvarez watching from the press box, the  
Badgers had three rushes longer than 50 yards, including backup 
tailback Michael Bennett's 73-yard TD run in the third quarter that 
made it 45-0. Bennett ran for 114 yards and two touchdowns on just 
six carries. 
</P>
<P>
	Alvarez underwent knee surgery two weeks ago and watched last  
week's game against Minnesota from his hospital bed. With his 65th 
career win, Alvarez tied Phil King as Wisconsin's winningest coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Dayne, who has 1,020 yards on the year, joined Amos Lawrence of  
North Carolina, Tony Dorsett of Pittsburgh and Denvis Manns of New 
Mexico State as the only players with four 1,000-yard rushing 
seasons. But the blowout further hurt Dayne's chances to catch 
Ricky Williams for the major-college rushing record. 
</P>
<P>
	Dayne now needs 697 yards in Wisconsin's final four games, or  
174.3 per game, to break Williams' record. The Badgers finish the 
year against Michigan State, Northwestern, Purdue and Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Bollinger was hurt in the second quarter and left with Wisconsin  
up 24-0, but Dayne ran 69 yards on the Badgers' next play from 
scrimmage, and Chad Kuhns scored on a 5-yard run on the next. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin continued to pour it on in the fourth quarter,  
converting on a fourth-and-7 from midfield that led to a touchdown 
run by Marcus Carpenter. 
</P>
<P>
	Even when things went right for the Hoosiers, they went wrong.  
Indiana's Joslin Goodman intercepted backup quarterback Scott 
Kavanagh in Wisconsin territory in the final minute of the first 
half, but the play was wiped out on a defensive offsides call.

<HEADLINE> Website Logs Earthquake Anecdotes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In case of earthquake: duck, cover and log  
on. 
</P>
<P>
	Within a few hours of Saturday's magnitude-7.0 quake in the  
Southern California desert, more than 10,000 people ventured into 
cyberspace to register their experiences on a new Website 
(www-socal.wr.usgs.gov) run by the U.S. Geological Survey. 
</P>
<P>
	``Did you feel it?'' the site asks.  
</P>
<P>
	Scientists will use the thousands of anecdotal reports to  
determine whether they were right about the regions expected to 
suffer the worst shaking, USGS seismologist Mary Lou Zoback said. 
Though not conclusive, the results offer another way to gauge 
research on the mysterious mechanics of earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
	The online participants answer a host of questions, including:  
Were they inside or outside when the quake hit? Was it difficult to 
stand or walk? And what type of damage did their home sustain? 
</P>
<P>
	The responses are categorized by ZIP code. All other  
identification is voluntary, Ms. Zoback said. 
</P>
<P>
	A common assumption is that earthquake tremors radiate outward  
like ripples in a pool of water. In fact, the conditions of the 
ground can focus shock waves and bounce them around below the 
surface, hitting some areas harder than others, Ms. Zoback said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2-month-old Internet site, known as the Community Internet  
Intensity Map, uses the experiences of residents to place ZIP codes 
in a 12-level ranking system, which ranges from ``Not Felt'' to 
``Extreme.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers will use the stories to augment scientific data  
about areas that may require stronger structures and roadways to 
prepare for future quakes, Ms. Zoback said.

<HEADLINE> NAACP OKs Tourism Boycott of S.C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LINTHICUM, Md. (AP) -- The NAACP's national board on Saturday  
unanimously approved a tourism boycott of South Carolina until the 
state stops flying the Confederate flag from its Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  
also asked the U.S. Justice Department to investigate whether 
official display of the symbol infringed on the civil rights of 
blacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The aim of the boycott is to use the full force of the nation's  
oldest civil rights organization, with 500,000 members in 2,200 
branches, to pressure the South Carolina Legislature to lower the 
flag or risk losing the estimated $280 million that black travelers 
spend in the state each year. 
</P>
<P>
	The NAACP's tourism boycott will officially begin Jan. 1, 2000.  
The South Carolina branch of the organization first sought the 
boycott in July, and the controversy has already prompted 42 state 
and national organizations to cancel meetings or conventions in the 
state, NAACP officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The text of the NAACP resolution calls the flag ``an unspoken  
symbol of resistance to the battle for civil rights and equality,'' 
the main symbol for numerous groups advocating white supremacy and 
an ``affront to the sensibilities and dignity'' of the state's 
blacks. Blacks account for more than a third of South Carolina's 
population. 
</P>
<P>
	``For people of African ancestry in this country, the flying of  
the Confederate flag and the symbolism of it represents one of the 
most reprehensible aspects of our country's history,'' said NAACP 
President Kweisi Mfume. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters say the flag represents Southern heritage and honors  
South Carolinians who died in the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
	The resolution also called on the U.S. Justice Department's  
Division of Civil Rights to investigate whether flying what many 
blacks view as a symbol of oppression from the Statehouse dome 
violated federal civil rights law. 
</P>
<P>
	The NAACP board voted 53-0 to approve the recommendation, with  
11 members not present. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know that economic sanctions work,'' said Lonnie Randolph  
Jr., President of the Columbia, S.C., NAACP chapter. 
</P>
<P>
	South Carolina, the only state to fly the Confederate battle  
flag over its Statehouse, first raised the flag in 1962 to 
commemorate the Civil War's centennial. Legislators, who have the 
sole power to remove it, have quashed past attempts to remove the 
flag, including a lawsuit by business leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Nina Brook, a spokeswoman for South Carolina Gov. Jim Hodges,  
said the boycott decision will make it harder to resolve the issue. 
Hodges is talking to legislators, ministers, business leaders and 
others in an attempt to find a compromise, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	But she also criticized the House, and Republican Speaker David  
Wilkins. 
</P>
<P>
	``A very real obstacle remains, a majority in the House who say  
they will not vote for a compromise, and the speaker of the House 
who says he will not vote for a compromise,'' Ms. Brook said. 
</P>
<P>
	The House rejected a proposal to move the flag to a Confederate  
monument on the Statehouse grounds several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have not seen a significant change or shift in the House's  
position on that,'' Wilkins said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Columbus NHL Dispute Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- The Columbus Blue Jackets will begin play  
in the National Hockey League next year without Lamar Hunt as an 
owner. 
</P>
<P>
	A tentative agreement was reached that ended Hunt's attempt for  
a share of the team and handed the franchise to the ownership group 
headed by steel magnate John McConnell and his partner, Wolfe 
Enterprises Inc., The Columbus Dispatch reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawsuits each side filed to win control of the team will be  
dropped and Hunt, owner of the NFL's Kansas City Chiefs and the 
Columbus Crew of Major League Soccer, will not receive damages for 
being excluded from McConnell's ownership group, attorneys for both 
sides told the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, both sides are going to go on their way,'' said  
Anthony Celebrezze Jr., Hunt's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	John Zeiger, an attorney for McConnell's group, confirmed that  
an agreement was reached, but said the document had not been 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe it would be premature to comment before each of the  
parties have executed the agreement,'' Zeiger said. 
</P>
<P>
	Messages seeking comment Saturday were left at the offices of  
both attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunt, McConnell and Wolfe Enterprises were part of the original  
group of investors who formed Columbus Hockey Ltd. in 1996 to 
pursue an NHL expansion franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	A rift developed in the group after voters rejected a sales-tax  
issue in May 1997 that would have financed a downtown arena and a 
soccer stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	McConnell and his partners reached a deal with Nationwide to  
build an arena for the franchise after Hunt turned down a contract 
with Nationwide. They sued Hunt to validate the group's ownership 
claim without him. 
</P>
<P>
	On Aug. 31, the 10th District Court of Appeals upheld a Common  
Pleas Court ruling that said the McConnell group did nothing wrong 
when it acquired the franchise without Hunt. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court, however, reversed the lower court when it  
ruled Hunt did not have to pay McConnell's group $920,000 in legal 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunt, of Dallas, accused the NHL and Nationwide of bad-faith  
bargaining and breach of contract. He countersued in a New York 
court, seeking to have the franchise taken away from Columbus and 
asking for $50 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Both suits will be dropped in the agreement.  
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is, both sides will walk away with where they  
were at the appeals court,'' Celebrezze said. ``Neither side is 
going to file an appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Jackets will begin play next October in Nationwide  
Arena, which is being built downtown.

<HEADLINE> Rome Remembers Nazi Deportations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Rome's Jewish community on Saturday remembered the  
night in 1943 when Nazi Germans sent 1,060 men, women and children 
to die in concentration camps. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking back 56 years, thousands of Rome's Jews and Catholics  
marched silently by candlelight to the heart of the old ghetto, the 
longest-surviving Jewish community of the Western world. 
</P>
<P>
	On Oct. 16, 1943, open army trucks carrying SS officers with  
submachine guns rolled into the narrow cobblestone streets of the 
ghetto and began rounding up people on orders from Gestapo chief 
Adolf Eichmann. 
</P>
<P>
	Mario Limentani, 76, is one of only three known remaining  
survivors of the 1943 deportation. ``I was very lucky,'' Limentani 
said, holding a banner listing the camps in which Italian Jews 
died. 
</P>
<P>
	The deportation, which was followed by waves of arrests, sent  
2,000 of Rome's 7,000 Jews to Nazi extermination camps. 
</P>
<P>
	When the roundup began, Catholics hid Jews in their homes,  
churches and convents. Survivors recalled Rome's tram drivers 
speeding away that night with fleeing Jews as their only 
passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	But historians differ on how much -- if at all -- then-Pope Pius  
XII helped in saving Rome's Jews. The pope's predecessors had 
protected and persecuted Jews over the centuries, confining them 
within the ghetto from the 16th century to the 19th century. 
</P>
<P>
	Rome's Catholic Community of Sant'Egidio sponsored Saturday's  
march and vigil. 
</P>
<P>
	``The challenge is this: To transmit to everybody, especially  
the young generation, a heritage of harmony and peace,'' Sandro 
Zuccari of Sant'Egidio told the marchers. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is why we're here -- to not forget.''

<HEADLINE> Blissfull Hall Wins Messenger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEADOW LANDS, Pa. (AP) -- Blissfull Hall became the ninth triple  
crown winner in pacing history, winning the first elimination heat 
and the final of the Messenger Stakes on Saturday night at The 
Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
	The last pacer to win the Cane Pace, the Little Brown Jug and  
the Messenger was Western Dreamer in 1997. The last winner before 
that was Ralph Hanover in 1983. Shady Character had a chance to win 
the triple crown last year but was beaten by Fit For Life in the 
Messenger. 
</P>
<P>
	Driven by Ron Pierce, Blissfull Hall cruised in the opening  
elimination in 1:51:1, one-tenth of second off the stakes record. 
Grinfromeartoear was second and Looking For Art third. 
</P>
<P>
	Art's Conquest, driven by Eric Ledford, won the second  
elimination in 1:52:4 and was followed by Sadies Dreamboat and 
Union Square. 
</P>
<P>
	In the final, it was all Blissfull Hall as he was clocked in  
1:51.2, missing the world record for a two-heat race by 
three-fifths of a second. He was in fifth place between the quarter 
and half poles before pulling away to the win. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just stepped on the gas,'' Pierce said. ``He was just  
brilliant. He was flying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Looking For Art was second in the final, followed by  
Grinfromeartoear and Island Fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
	Blissfull earned $391,230 for winning the two heats and picked  
up the $250,000 bonus put up the three tracks that stage the triple 
crown. 
</P>
<P>
	The other pacing triple crown winners were Adios Butler (1959),  
Bret Hanover (1965), Romeo Hanover (1966), Rum Customer (1968), 
Most Happy Fella (1970) and Niatross (1980).

<HEADLINE>  Accounts of ETimor Killing Chilling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, East Timor (AP) -- Maria Bianco can't shake the terror of  
the militiaman's bullet shattering her leg or the memory of her 
5-year-old daughter shrieking after being wounded in the neck. 
</P>
<P>
	But three weeks later, her most chilling memory of that day is  
the face of the uniformed gunman. She knew him. He was a neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
	``His name was Paolino,'' Bianco, 25 years old and five months  
pregnant, recalled Friday in a halting whisper at a French military 
hospital where she and her daughter are recovering. ``We never 
thought he would shoot us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As international peacekeepers gradually assert control in the  
mountainous hinterlands of East Timor, villagers are coming forward 
with accounts of the violent rampage by anti-secessionist 
militiamen after the territory's people voted overwhelmingly for 
independence from Indonesia in an Aug. 30 referendum. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign of intimidation forced hundreds of thousands of  
people to flee into the forest or to refugee camps in neighboring 
West Timor. Enormous property damage -- mainly burned homes and 
businesses -- can be seen in towns and cities throughout the 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus far, hard evidence of large-scale, systematic killings has  
not emerged, despite initial fears that the death toll could reach 
into the thousands or even tens of thousands. By the weekend, U.N. 
officials had counted about 100 bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	More typical are accounts of scattered atrocities like the  
shootings described by the Biancos, who lived on the outskirts of 
the town of Ainaro, about 95 miles south of Dili, the East Timor 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
	The family said that on Sept. 23 -- three days after the first  
peacekeepers arrived in Dili, but before they began fanning out 
into the countryside -- about a dozen armed militiamen arrived at 
the village and ordered them and their neighbors to leave for West 
Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	The Biancos refused and tried to flee into the forest. With  
that, they said, the militiamen opened fire, killing a dozen people 
and wounding six, including Maria Bianco, 5-year-old Zeferina and 
Maria's sister, Isadora Araujo, who also is pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
	Their account could not be independently verified. But Dr.  
Jean-Dominique Singland, the French army surgeon who treated their 
gunshot wounds, said the Ainaro villagers had provided vivid and 
consistent descriptions of the day's events. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were very lucky, because they were found fairly soon  
after and brought here, where we were able to treat them,'' he 
said. ``Also, their wounds are in their extremities. In these 
(tropical) conditions, those who are shot in the abdomen would be 
much more likely to get infections and die without immediate 
help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since it was set up three weeks ago, the French field hospital  
has treated about 30 gunshot victims, many of them brought from the 
countryside by relief workers, Singland said. 
</P>
<P>
	The villagers of Ainaro suggested they might have been targeted  
by local members of the Mahidi militia because their area had long 
been a stronghold of the pro-independence Falintil rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	The regional Falintil chief, known as Commander Cobra, said in  
an interview that the villagers probably were right. ``In other 
places, they (the militias) drove people out and burned down their 
houses, but didn't shoot them,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite speculation that corpses may have been buried en masse  
or dumped into the sea, only about 100 bodies of apparent victims 
of militia violence have been found in East Timor, said Michel 
Barton of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian 
Activities, a U.N. agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Maj. Gen. Peter Cosgrove, the peacekeeper commander, said no  
mass grave -- a half-dozen bodies or more in a single site -- had 
been found, but promised to aggressively investigate reports of 
any. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators and human rights groups including Amnesty  
International say that proof of wholesale executions may yet come 
to light as peacekeepers expand their reach and more evidence is 
gathered. 
</P>
<P>
	The timing is highly sensitive, however. Rights investigators  
privately worry that any allegations of mass killings by militias -- 
especially if they involve collusion by the Indonesian army -- could 
jeopardize the 200,000 East Timorese refugees who are still 
awaiting repatriation. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Ainaro attack, victims said the militiamen wore uniforms  
like those of Indonesian soldiers and that some of the men's rifles 
appeared to be Indonesian army issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Villagers' accounts of incidents like those described by the  
Biancos -- neighbor pitted against neighbor -- also illustrate the 
internecine nature of the conflict, which presages a long and 
difficult mission for the international peacekeeping force. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia's parliament is expected to vote soon on whether to  
endorse East Timor's independence vote. Opponents of independence 
for the territory say its secession could set off a Yugoslav-style 
disintegration of Indonesia, whose thousands of islands are a 
patchwork of ethnic and tribal groups.

	Quake Rocks Southern California  
</P>
<P>
	JOSHUA TREE, Calif. (AP) -- A 7.0-magnitude earthquake in the  
Mojave Desert shook millions awake in three Western states early 
today, derailing an Amtrak train, knocking out power to thousands, 
but causing no serious damage or injuries. The quake jolted 
gamblers out of bed in Las Vegas and shook buildings as far away as 
Phoenix and Tijuana, Mexico. Up to 90,000 utility customers lost 
power, mobile homes were knocked off pilings in the desert 
community of Ludlow and a highway bridge was cracked. With only a 
handful of injuries and no deaths, Californians credited location 
and luck for eluding catastrophe in the most powerful quake to hit 
the state since 1992.

	Ramsey Case May Get New Prosecutor  
</P>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- Gov. Bill Owens will meet with Boulder  
District Attorney Alex Hunter Monday night to discuss the 
possibility of appointing a special prosecutor for the JonBenet 
Ramsey case, on of Hunter's advisors said. The grand jury 
investigation of the Ramsey case, launched by Hunter Sept. 15, 
1998, ended Wednesday without any indictments. Owens announced 
Wednesday that he would consider appointing a special prosecutor to 
review the case. A spokeswoman for Owens declined to reveal the 
time or location of the meeting.

	Washington Fund Raising Event Sets Record

<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Republican presidential front-runner George W.  
Bush helped raise more than $400,000 in Washington State today at a 
GOP fund raising event staged in America's newest and most 
expensive ballpark, Safeco Field. The sum is the largest single 
fund-raising event in the state's history. Bush lent his starpower 
and fund raising prowess to Sen. Slade Gorton, the state GOP, and 
the National Republican Senatorial Committee. The move is part of a 
new Bush strategy to cement his relations with congressional 
incumbents and organizations in key battleground states, Bush 
senior advisers said.

evacuations and warned that it wouldn't take much rain to push 
rivers in the eastern part of the state back above flood stages. 
Irene's 80-mph winds also could threaten camper villages populated

News poll found that 16 percent of those questioned nationwide 
earlier this month gave Giuliani, New York City's Republican mayor, 
an ``unfavorable'' rating. Six percent found him unfavorable in a 
March 1998 poll. As for Mrs. Clinton, 36 percent of those polled 
this month had unfavorable impressions of her, up from 20 percent

<HEADLINE> Quake Damage Limited by Location </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- The quake that jolted the Southwest  
early Saturday had an intimidating magnitude of 7.0. But, thanks to 
the remote location of its epicenter, it wasn't even close to being 
a disaster like Turkey, Taiwan or Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
	The quake -- the most powerful in California since 1992 -- struck  
in the Mojave Desert, about 120 miles east of Los Angeles, and was 
felt in Las Vegas and as far away as Phoenix. There were no reports 
of major injuries or damage. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ground shaking was very strong at the epicenter and along  
the fault rupture,'' said Kate Hutton, a seismologist at the 
California Institute of Technology. ``If it had been in a populated 
area, it could have caused significant damage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the largest quake to rock California since 1992, when a  
magnitude-7.3 tremor struck in the same desert near Landers. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, a magnitude-7.2 quake rocked Taiwan, killing more  
than 2,300 people and causing an estimated $9.2 billion in damage. 
In August, a 7.4 quake killed at least 17,000 people in Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1994 Northridge quake in Los Angeles registered 6.7, killed  
72 people and caused $25 billion in damage. 
</P>
<P>
	In those cases, the faults ruptured either directly under or  
near populated areas. Saturday's most intense shaking occurred in 
open desert where there are more Joshua trees and tortoises than 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	``The level of shaking is comparable to what was experienced in  
Northridge,'' said Lucy Jones, scientist-in-charge of the U.S. 
Geological Survey office in Pasadena. ``The good news is that there 
are fewer people out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earthquakes are caused by the sudden release of pressure that  
builds up when sections of the Earth lock together deep beneath the 
surface. From the fault rupture, where the rock snaps, sound-like 
waves speed through the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Layers of sediment and rock below the surface can amplify or  
mute the destructive waves. That is why pockets of heavy damage are 
sometimes surrounded by areas with relatively little in large 
quakes near metropolitan areas. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Loma Prieta earthquake that struck 10 years ago Sunday,  
Oakland sustained heavy shaking and damage even though the 
epicenter was located about 60 miles south. 
</P>
<P>
	But in Saturday's quake, the distance muted the violent shaking  
felt by the few people who live near the epicenter, seismologists 
said. In west Los Angeles -- nearly 150 miles from the epicenter -- 
the shaking was a sickening slow roll not unlike riding in a boat 
on the ocean surf. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the waves are lost as it gets farther away,'' Hutton  
said. ``The quake gets weaker. It becomes more of rolling 
earthquake with the greater distance. A person sitting on top of 
the fault probably felt a much sharper motion than what we felt in 
L.A.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the shaking also seems to last longer for people who live  
farther away from the epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not all waves travel at the same speed -- some waves are slower  
than others,'' she said. ``Because of the variation in speed, it 
feels long.''

<HEADLINE> Calif. Water Districts Reach Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Ending years of negotiations, Southern  
California water districts have reached a landmark deal to divide 
water from the Colorado River to ensure that they no longer take 
more than their fair share. 
</P>
<P>
	The tentative plan struck Friday will be voted on next week.  
</P>
<P>
	The six other Western states that draw from the river had  
pressured Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt to do something about 
California continually taking more than its share. In response, he 
set a Friday deadline for the districts to agree on a way to stay 
within their allotment or risk immediate loss of their surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives of the Metropolitan Water District, the Imperial  
Irrigation District and the Coachella Valley Water District 
wouldn't discuss the specific terms of the agreement, but confirmed 
that an accord should be signed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``All sides appear to be happy,'' Coachella spokesman Dennis  
Mahr said. ``Hopefully, there's a settlement, but the lawyers are 
still going over the language'' in the more than 50-page document. 
</P>
<P>
	Imperial board president Bruce Kuhn said he was optimistic that  
all the boards would approve the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``After all these months of intense negotiations, that would be  
the icing on the cake,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The districts, along with the San Diego County Water Authority,  
spent the past three days in marathon sessions to reach an 
agreement rather than face intervention from Gov. Gray Davis or 
Babbitt. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a 1922 agreement, California is assured 4.4 million  
acre-feet of water a year from the Colorado River. However, only 
550,000 acre-feet is budgeted for the heavily populated coastal 
strip and inland regions. 
</P>
<P>
	An acre-foot is about 326,000 gallons, or enough water for a  
family of four for a year. 
</P>
<P>
	For the past few years, Metropolitan, which owns the aqueduct  
that supplies water to 16 million people in Southern California, 
has been taking as much 5.2 million acre-feet to meet demand. 
</P>
<P>
	To reduce the region's reliance on the surpluses, the districts  
had to agree on how to share the allotment, meaning some districts 
had to give water to others; who would retain the rights; how much 
each district would pay for the water and conservation programs; 
and how the districts would share costs of an environmental impact 
review for the Imperial-San Diego water transfer.

<HEADLINE> Rocket Rocketed Out of Fenway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Can't win the big one, that's what they say here  
about Roger Clemens. 
</P>
<P>
	Couldn't win it during 11 seasons with the Boston Red Sox, can't  
win it now with the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	He has five Cy Young Awards, more than any other man, alive or  
dead. But no World Series rings, the only gem he says he ever 
really wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	From Clemens' very first batter Saturday, it was a party at  
Fenway Park, and he was the pinata as Red Sox fans celebrated a 
13-1 victory that pulled them to 2-1 in the AL Championship Series. 
</P>
<P>
	They booed when he warmed up in the bullpen, a passionate angry  
roar directed toward one of their own who had defected and joined 
their enemy. 
</P>
<P>
	They booed again when he walked out to the mound, already deep  
in shadows as brilliant autumn sunshine lighted up the old 
grandstands, filled with fans longing for their team's first World 
Series title since 1918. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rog-ger, Rog-er'' they sang again and again, a slow singsong  
designed to make sure he appreciated the magnitude of their 
disdain. 
</P>
<P>
	Just two pitches in, the booing abruptly ended, replaced by  
cheers as Jose Offerman's leadoff drive sailed over the head of 
Paul O'Neill in right, caroming off the low fence and back toward 
the infield as Offerman sped to third. 
</P>
<P>
	Five pitches later, John Valentin lofted the ball toward the  
Green Monster and out it went, over the 37-foot fence and into the 
23-foot screen, even deeper than Bucky Dent's famous drive 21 years 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Some fans were still walking in, and already Clemens was behind  
2-0. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rog-ger, Rog-er,'' they kept singing as he finally retired the  
side. 
</P>
<P>
	Then in the second came a double by Trot Nixon, a single by  
Offerman, an RBI grounder by Valentin and a run-scoring double by 
Nomar Garciaparra. By then, Hideki Irabu was starting to warm up in 
the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Stanley started the third with a single, and Clemens threw  
a first-pitch strike to Brian Daubach, his 61st pitch of the 
afternoon. It turned out to be his last. 
</P>
<P>
	As Clemens gave manager Joe Torre the ball and walked off the  
mound, back to the Yankees' dugout on the third-base side, the fans 
started booing, wanting to leave him with the sound of their hate 
in his ears. 
</P>
<P>
	To them, the 247-134 regular-season record and 3,316 strikeouts  
don't matter. They remember that he went 1-2 in nine postseason 
starts for Boston, and that new hero Pedro Martinez, who struck out 
12 and allowed just two hits in seven shutout innings Saturday, 
already is 3-0 in his career during the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, what had happened suddenly struck them. They started  
cheering for Boston, a loud release that reverberated out to 
Kenmore Square and on to the Back Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens' line read: five runs, six hits, just two innings  
pitched. By the seventh inning, when the score reached 13-0, the 
chant had changed to, ``Where is Roger?'' 
</P>
<P>
	For once, Red Sox fans dreamed the dream and it came true.

<HEADLINE> Canada GM Plant Denounces Outscoring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Plans by General Motors of Canada Ltd. to end  
production at the St. Therese, Quebec, assembly plant and outsource 
other work could lead to a walk-out by Canadian Auto Workers, union 
president Buzz Hargrove said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The outsourcing positions they have on the table will cause a  
strike,'' Hargrove said at a Toronto news conference. ``Under no 
circumstances are we going to allow outsourcing when we have 
insecurity with workers at St. Therese and other plants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The CAW has set a midnight Tuesday deadline to reach an  
agreement with GM. During 1996 contract talks, the CAW struck GM's 
Oshawa, Ontario, assembly plant, idling some U.S. parts and 
assembly plants. 
</P>
<P>
	A contract with GM is expected to closely model agreements  
already reached with Ford Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler AG. 
</P>
<P>
	Those call for a 3 percent wage increase in each year of a  
three-year package, a $1,000 (Canadian) signing bonus, an improved 
retirement package and other benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove said in July that the future of the St. Therese plant  
and GM plans to outsource work would be key issues in this year's 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowered demand for the Chevrolet Cameros and Pontiac Firebirds  
produced at St. Therese has raised speculation that the plant might 
be closed. GM has said it will cease production of the cars there 
in September 2002, and nothing is scheduled to replace that line, 
Hargrove said. 
</P>
<P>
	GM officials in Detroit and Ontario could not be immediately  
reached for comment Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Treaty a Political Football </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With President Clinton accusing Senate  
Republicans of reckless, blatant partisanship, Democrats are trying 
to stir the rejection of the nuclear test ban treaty into a 2000 
campaign issue. 
</P>
<P>
	But even Clinton had to acknowledge that it may not work. He had  
said earlier that the test ban would not be a huge issue either 
way, and the polls indicate that probably is so. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the end of the Cold War, foreign policy concerns have  
slipped down the list of voter priorities, dominated by issues at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the Senate ``clearly disregarded the views of the  
American people who have consistently and strongly supported this 
treaty ever since it was first pursued by Presidents Eisenhower and 
Kennedy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eisenhower proposed a nuclear test ban in 1958, in a different  
world, challenging the old Soviet Union to agree to stop testing. 
Kennedy signed, and the Senate approved, a limited test ban treaty 
in 1963, barring all but underground nuclear tests by the United 
States and the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty Clinton signed in 1996 and lost in the Senate would  
extend an international ban on atmospheric tests to underground 
testing. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican opponents said the ban couldn't be enforced, and was  
dangerous to future U.S. security. They voted it down 51 to 48 on 
Wednesday, with four Republicans in favor. Ratification would have 
required a two-thirds majority, 67 votes, and Clinton never was 
close to that strength. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a political deal and I hope it will get the treatment  
from the American people it richly deserves,'' the president said 
after the vote he knew he would lose. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also said that the treaty will ultimately be ratified.  
But it obviously won't happen on his watch, with Republicans in 
55-to-45 Senate control through 2000, and therefore in command of 
what is brought up for action. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Democrats tried to challenge that GOP prerogative, and  
delay action on the treaty, they lost, on straight party lines. 
</P>
<P>
	That doesn't kill the treaty outright. Vice President Al Gore  
said rejection was ``an act of almost breathtaking 
irresponsibility.'' He then made it the subject of his first 
campaign television commercial. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe in my heart this vote does not speak for the  
American people,'' the vice president says in the ad. ``So why 
don't we do something about it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	He asked voters for their support in his campaign, and for a  
mandate to send the treaty back to the Senate in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Rival Democrat Bill Bradley also favors the treaty.  
</P>
<P>
	Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican front-runner for 2000, is  
opposed, as are the other GOP candidates. But Bush says he would 
continue the voluntary moratorium on U.S. testing that has been in 
effect since 1992. Britain, France, Russia and, since 1996, China 
also are refraining from testing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Never before has a serious treaty involving nuclear weapons  
been handled in such a reckless and ultimately partisan way,'' 
Clinton said. ``This issue should be beyond politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But campaign politics is the only arena in which the Democrats  
can pursue it now. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., who started the  
process that led to rejection and then couldn't control it, said he 
doubts they can make a winning campaign issue of the treaty because 
Americans know it is flawed. 
</P>
<P>
	Public opinion polls do show overwhelming support for a treaty  
prohibiting nuclear weapons test explosions worldwide -- 82 percent, 
according to a 1999 survey the Democrats cite. But in issue 
surveys, foreign policy in general is cited by only about 5 percent 
of potential voters as a top priority, and the issue of nuclear 
weapons ranks even lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said at his news conference on Thursday that he never  
wanted the treaty to be a political issue, but it might become one 
now that the Republicans have blocked it. 
</P>
<P>
	But he also acknowledged that Americans aren't worried about the  
nuclear threat as they were in the Cold War era. So he said it may 
or may not have an impact on the campaign. He wants it to, although 
he minimized the prospect earlier when he was trying to get the 
Senate vote delayed, to avoid the defeat he knew was coming. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not going to be a huge issue in the election one way  
or the other,'' Clinton said on Oct. 8. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> 3 Japan Insurance Cos. To Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Three major Japanese insurance companies have  
agreed to bring their operations together by 2001, a major Japanese 
business daily reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a single holding company, Mitsui Marine and Fire Insurance  
Co., Nippon Fire and Marine Insurance Co. and Koa Fire and Marine 
Insurance Co. will tie up their damage investigation divisions and 
computer information systems, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun said. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance will produce the biggest Japanese non-life  
insurance group in terms of assets, overtaking Tokio Marine and 
Fire Insurance Co, the report said. Mitsui is the third largest, 
while Nippon is fifth and Koa eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance will fall short of a full-fledged merger, but the  
companies will cooperate in underwriting insurance policies as well 
as in asset management, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	As competition increases, non-life insurers are likely to be  
pressed to cut premiums. The three insurers hope to move ahead with 
cost-cutting by joining forces, the Nihon Keizai said.

	In the Loma Prieta earthquake that struck 10 years ago Sunday,

L.A.''

<HEADLINE>  Quake Damage Limited by Location </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- The quake that jolted the Southwest  
early Saturday had an intimidating magnitude of 7.0. But, thanks to 
the remote location of its epicenter, it wasn't even close to being 
a disaster like Turkey, Taiwan or Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
	The quake -- the most powerful in California since 1992 -- struck  
in the Mojave Desert, about 120 miles east of Los Angeles, and was 
felt in Las Vegas and as far away as Phoenix. There were no reports 
of major injuries or damage. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ground shaking was very strong at the epicenter and along  
the fault rupture,'' said Kate Hutton, a seismologist at the 
California Institute of Technology. ``If it had been in a populated 
area, it could have caused significant damage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the largest quake to rock California since 1992, when a  
magnitude-7.3 tremor struck in the same desert near Landers. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, a magnitude-7.2 quake rocked Taiwan, killing more  
than 2,300 people and causing an estimated $9.2 billion in damage. 
In August, a 7.4 quake killed at least 17,000 people in Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1994 Northridge quake in Los Angeles registered 6.7, killed  
72 people and caused $25 billion in damage. 
</P>
<P>
	In those cases, the faults ruptured either directly under or  
near populated areas. Saturday's most intense shaking occurred in 
open desert where there are more Joshua trees and tortoises than 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	``The level of shaking is comparable to what was experienced in  
Northridge,'' said Lucy Jones, scientist-in-charge of the U.S. 
Geological Survey office in Pasadena. ``The good news is that there 
are fewer people out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earthquakes are caused by the sudden release of pressure that  
builds up when sections of the Earth lock together deep beneath the 
surface. From the fault rupture, where the rock snaps, sound-like 
waves speed through the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Layers of sediment and rock below the surface can amplify or  
mute the destructive waves. That is why pockets of heavy damage are 
sometimes surrounded by areas with relatively little in large 
quakes near metropolitan areas. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Loma Prieta earthquake that struck 10 years ago Sunday,  
Oakland sustained heavy shaking and damage even though the 
epicenter was located about 60 miles south. 
</P>
<P>
	But in Saturday's quake, the distance muted the violent shaking

<HEADLINE> Lou Holtz Returns to Arkansas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Lou Holtz was back on the sidelines at  
War Memorial Stadium on Saturday night, only he was on the east 
side -- the visitors' side. 
</P>
<P>
	During his seven years (1977-83) as Arkansas' head coach, the  
Razorbacks were 21-3 in Little Rock. This time around, he was 
coaching winless South Carolina, which lost again 48-14. 
</P>
<P>
	The fans had little reaction to his return. Maybe they  
remembered the magic he worked in 1977, or maybe it was a touch of 
compassion for a former ally who inherited a Gamecocks program with 
a losing streak that dated to Sept. 12, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	A sign on a truck pronounced, ``Cock-A-Doodle Lou.''  
</P>
<P>
	``The people here were fine,'' Holtz said after the game. ``I  
have no problem with that. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got beat by a fine football team,'' he said. ``It doesn't  
matter where it was, here or anywhere else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About a half-hour before the game, Holtz and Arkansas coach  
Houston Nutt met on the Arkansas side of the field, embracing at 
the 50-yard line. Nutt was a graduate assistant under Holtz at 
Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	When Holtz arrived at Arkansas, he was a wispy, wisecracking  
coach disillusioned with the NFL who replaced Frank Broyles and his 
Georgia drawl. In Broyles' final five years, only once did Arkansas 
win more than six games. In 1976, the Razorbacks were 5-5-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Holtz's first team won 10 and earned a spot in the prestigious  
Orange Bowl against Oklahoma. The Sooners were unbeaten and ranked 
No. 2, and Arkansas was a 17-point underdog until Holtz suspended 
three players. After that, the game was off the boards in Las 
Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	Holtz spotted a problem with Oklahoma's nose guard, and his game  
plan made running back Roland Sales look like an All-American as 
Arkansas won 31-6. 
</P>
<P>
	A few days ago, Holtz said he remembered virtually every play of  
that game but added, ``Thank goodness, it wasn't a best of seven.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holtz also said he wouldn't be emotional about his return to  
Arkansas, but that the walk through at War Memorial would trigger 
some memories -- including 34-0 over Houston in 1977 and 17-14 over 
Texas two years later. 
</P>
<P>
	After Friday's trip to the stadium, Holtz said Arkansas still  
``has the best police escorts in the country'' 
</P>
<P>
	A couple of former players talked with him at the stadium and  
1979 quarterback Kevin Scanlon said his stomach did a couple of 
flips when he heard Holtz holler at one of his South Carolina 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	Holtz took Arkansas to six straight bowl games -- the first time  
that happened in school history. His humor landed him a guest spot 
on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson, but he was also gracious 
enough to feed media members at his home after Fayetteville games. 
</P>
<P>
	He left Arkansas in December 1983 and there are myriad theories  
about why, including recruiting shortcomings and his failure to put 
together a top-notch staff. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end, the school said he was ``burned out'' on football.  
Less than a week later, he was hired on as head coach at Minnesota.

<HEADLINE> Basketball Coach Sued for Yelling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Three former University of Massachusetts women's  
basketball players filed a lawsuit against the school because they 
say their coach's yelling, insults and obscenities made their 
personal lives unbearable. 
</P>
<P>
	Kara Trent of Sandwich, Nicole Vallieres of Adams and Tory Grant  
of Somerville, N.J., filed suit Friday in U.S. District Court in 
Boston, claiming coach Joanie O'Brien's coaching style left them 
humiliated and anguished. 
</P>
<P>
	They also contend the behavior defies the principles of the  
NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kara Trent came to the point where she dreaded and became  
fearful of playing and came to hate the game of basketball, which 
she had loved and played since her third grade of elementary 
school,'' attorney Brian Woolf, who represents the three families, 
wrote in the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	The women, teammates during the 1997-98 season, are seeking a  
total of $45 million in damages, the Cape Cod Times reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't comment on legal matters,'' university spokeswoman  
Kay Scanlan said Saturday. O'Brien did not immediately respond to a 
message left at her office. 
</P>
<P>
	The 20-year-old Trent, a junior studying sports management, is  
the only plaintiff still attending the university. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a hostile environment and the university didn't do a  
thing about it,'' Woolf told The Boston Globe. 
</P>
<P>
	Trent told her lawyer that O'Brien, 35, who is entering her  
ninth season with UMass, would violently grab her by the neck of 
her jersey and pull her into place on the court, and shout in her 
face. 
</P>
<P>
	Grant also said she was the victim of sexual discrimination  
because the coach thought she was gay, and says she was unfairly 
thrown off the team in October 1998 after she was caught smoking 
marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs argue that other players also smoked the drug,  
but were not removed from the team because they were favorites of 
O'Brien's.

<HEADLINE> Kennewick Man May Have Asian Roots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YAKIMA, Wash. (AP) -- Kennewick Man, one of the oldest and most  
complete human skeletons ever found in North America, does not 
appear to have links to American Indian tribes or to Europeans and 
may have had Asian or Polynesian roots, scientists reported. 
</P>
<P>
	But Joseph Powell, one of the scientists who studied the bones  
for the U.S. Interior Department, said Friday that many questions 
remain to be answered. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's similar to what we're seeing with other ancient skeletons  
in both North and South America -- there's some difference between 
them and any modern people anywhere in the world,'' said Powell, a 
professor of anthropology at the University of New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	In the report, Powell and scientist Jerome Rose found that  
Kennewick Man ``appears to have the strongest ... affinities with 
populations from Polynesia and southern Asia, and not with American 
Indians or Europeans in the reference samples.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But to say that Kennewick Man might be most closely linked to  
the people of Polynesia or even the ancient Ainu of Japan, 
``doesn't totally convey what we found,'' Powell said. The older 
the bones, the more difficult it can be to neatly link them to 
specific populations, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also noted that ancient skeletons found in Europe or Asia,  
for example, don't necessarily look like modern-day Europeans or 
Asians. Any number of factors could have influenced the degree of 
variation among humans then and now. 
</P>
<P>
	The bones, found in the shallows of the Columbia River in 1996,  
are believed to be more than 9,000 years old. Results of new carbon 
dating tests are expected to be available next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Five Northwest Indian tribes have claimed Kennewick Man as an  
ancestor, as has the Asatru Folk Assembly, an old Norse pagan 
group. Representatives of the tribes and of the Asatru did not 
immediately return calls seeking comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The disposition of the bones has been hotly contested ever since  
the first anthropologist to examine Kennewick Man noted that the 
skull bore little resemblance to today's Indian people. 
</P>
<P>
	The Interior Department will look at the archaeology, geography,  
ethnography, biology and history of tribes near the confluence of 
the Snake and Columbia rivers as part of the process to determine 
``cultural affiliation'' of Kennewick Man, who is named for a town 
near his discovery site.

<HEADLINE> Yankees Deny Hiring Permission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The Baltimore Orioles can forget about trying to  
hire New York Yankees executive Gordon Blakeley as their next 
general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees owner George Steinbrenner has denied permission for the  
Orioles to interview Blakeley, team sources told The Associated 
Press on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Blakeley is the director of international and professional  
scouting for the Yankees, and his speciality is Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	Blakeley was instrumental in bringing pitcher Orlando ``El  
Duque'' Hernandez and top infield prospect Alfonso Soriano to the 
World Series champions. He also helped in the pursuit of pitcher 
Hideki Irabu. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles fired GM Frank Wren on Oct. 7, after his first  
season with the team. Earlier this week, Wren was hired by Atlanta 
as an assistant general manager. Baltimore also dismissed manager 
Ray Miller the same day after a disappointing 78-84 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Blakeley is based at the Yankees' complex in Tampa, Fla., and is  
part of team's inner circle in decisions involving talent. He is in 
the middle of a multiyear contract. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, Steinbrenner has occasionally blocked other teams  
from talking to his executives when jobs became available. Sources 
said the Orioles sought permission to speak with Blakeley this week 
and were turned down. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbrenner was in Boston on Saturday, watching the Yankees  
lose to Boston 13-1 in Game 3 of the AL championship series. 
Despite the most lopsided loss in their postseason history, the 
Yankees lead 2-1 in the best-of-7 matchup. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the Yankees promoted Mark Newman to director of  
baseball operations. That move, which elevated to a position 
ranking ahead of general manager Brian Cashman, came amid 
speculation that other teams wanted to interview him for general 
manager vacancies. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbrenner, sources said, let it be known that he did not  
intend for Newman or Blakeley to go work for another team while 
under contract to the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles, who have interviewed third base coach Sam Perlozzo  
for the managing job, have not yet talked to any candidates for the 
GM spot. 
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore is said to want to set up a front office system much  
like the one used by the Yankees, with several people playing key 
parts in the decision-making process, and thought Blakeley would be 
a good person to head it.

<HEADLINE> Basque Novelist Honored in Spain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BARCELONA, Spain (AP) -- A 25-year-old Basque author has been  
awarded Spain's highest literary award for the story of a woman 
searching for her roots after her family moves to a new town, 
organizers said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Laura Espido Freire was awarded the Planeta publishing house  
prize Friday for her third novel, ``Frozen Peaches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Espido Freire's work was chosen from 377 works and will be  
published by Planeta. 
</P>
<P>
	Her two previous novels, ``Ireland'' and ``Where It's Always  
October,'' were both highly praised by literary critics in Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	The 48th annual Planeta prize included a cash award equaling  
$312,500. 
</P>
<P>
	Previous winners of the Planeta prize include Uruguayan writer  
Carmen Posadas in 1998 with ``Minor Disgraces,'' and Spanish Nobel 
prize winner Camilo Jose Cela in 1994 for his work ``Saint Andrew's 
Cross.''
