<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Doctor Invents Artificial Human Bones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 6 (Xinhua) -- A Kuwaiti doctor has invented
artificial bones, which he claimed could replace human bones and
extend the bone length of short and disabled people.
</P>
<P>
Doctor Yousuf Ali Al-Bader said he created a kind of substance
which has the same features of human bones, the Kuwait News Agency
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The substance can be used as a substitute to human bones
because it can easily heal, grow and be part of the human body,
said the doctor.
</P>
<P>
"It has no side effects and does not need adhesive materials
or nails to fix with natural bones because it is very flexible to
merge and allows the growth of huge new cells and by time will
become part of the bones," Bader added.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti doctor, who carried out four years of research in
Britain, the United States and France, has also found that his
invention could help treat fractures among the elderly.
</P>
<P>
"This way will have good effects in helping prolong the short
and disabled people at a certain age," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bader, based on his invention, also rejected a common belief
that milk was the only means to strengthen bones.
</P>
<P>
Following a study on reasons behind bone diseases, the doctor
found that diseases like pains of joints, rheumatism,
osteomyelitis and reduction of vertebrae resulted from the
consumption of milk and its by-products.
</P>
<P>
He said that people depend on milk to get the necessary
calcium to strengthen bones, but milk also causes problems in
human's digesting system and colon due to its fermentation.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Economic Growth Seen to Outperform Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's economy could
outperform the government's current official forecast of zero to 2
percent for 1999, Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Lee told the parliament that the government will review its
current forecast in August as there are signs that the economy has
been recovering faster than expected.
</P>
<P>
"The economy has been recovering well this year," Lee said.
"Recent data suggest the economy might outperform the government's
current forecast."
</P>
<P>
He attributed the unexpectedly strong recovery to a growth in
global electronics demand and the region's overall rebound from
the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said the manufacturing sector, which grew by 8.2 percent in
the first five months of this year, led Singapore's economic
recovery.
</P>
<P>
Indicators from other sectors of the economy showed that the
recovery was becoming broad-based although not every sector was
doing well, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said the government may restore part of the 10
percentage point cut in the Central Provident Fund (CPF) for
employees next year if the economic recovery continues to gain
momentum.
</P>
<P>
A decision will be made by the government at the end of this
year when this year's economic performance and the outlook for
next year are known, he added.
</P>
<P>
The employers' CPF contribution was cut for a period of two
years from January this year as part of a package to reduce
business costs.
</P>
<P>
"Of all the measures we took, the CPF cut had the most impact
on our business costs and contributed significantly to the current
recovery," he said.
</P>
<P>
If wage settlements are allowed to go up too quickly now, said
Lee, the effects of the CPF cuts will be negated, making it more
difficult to restore CPF contribution rates later on.
</P>
<P>
"However we recognize that in a strong recovery, wage pressures
are unavoidable," said the deputy prime minister.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore if the recovery continues to gain momentum, it will
be better to manage these pressures, by beginning to restore the
employers' CPF contribution earlier, while continuing to exercise
restraint in wage settlements," he said.
</P>
<P>
As for the other cuts in government rates, rentals and taxes
and rebates, the stipulated periods will remain and be reviewed
later, said Lee.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore economy grew by a modest 1.2 percent in the first
quarter of this year, largely on the back of a strong performance
in the manufacturing sector.
</P>
<P>
From April to May, shares transacted grew 270 percent in value
and 390 percent in volume.
</P>
<P>
Visitor arrivals also grew 7.2 percent from January to May,
compared with double-digit drops last year.

<HEADLINE> Greece Hopes EU Not to Change Decision on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Greece on Tuesday expressed the hope
that the European Union (EU) would not change its decision to base
its agency for the Balkan reconstruction in the northern Greek
city of Thessaloniki.
</P>
<P>
The decision taken by the 15 EU members in Rio De Janeiro,
Brazil, would not be changed, Greek government spokesman Dimitris
Reppas said at a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
On the sidelines of the EU and Latin American summit which took
place in Rio De Janeiro, Brazil, later June, EU leaders decided to
base its agency for the Balkan reconstruction in Thessaloniki.
Greece has voiced its satisfaction with the EU decision, saying
that such a decision has proved that Greece could play a role in
economic and peaceful development in the Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
While confirming that there were "circles in the EU" trying to
move the agency to Pristina, capital of the Yugoslav province of
Kosovo, Reppas stressed that Greece would respond in a convincing
manner to those opposed to the choice of Thessaloniki.
</P>
<P>
Since the end of the war in Yugoslavia triggered by the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Greece has tried hard to play
a major role in regional reconstruction, and suggested that
Thessaloniki, the largest city in northern Greece, be chosen as a
center for EU services for reconstruction in the Balkans.

BANGKOK, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The sales of personal computers in
Thailand are estimated to increase by 32 percent in volume this
year compared with 1998, according to a report of the research

<P>
TEHRAN, July 6 (Xinhua) -- A group of Iranian students on
Tuesday gathered in front of the French embassy to protest against
the support of French Parliament Speaker Laurent Fabius for the
13 Iranian Jews arrested on espionage charges.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to French President Jacques Chirac, the
demonstrators called on Fabius to officially apologize to Iran,
the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
In the letter submitted to the French ambassador to Tehran,
the students stated that Iran would not accept any foreign
interference in its internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
They also underlined that the 13 Iranian Jews had been
arrested on espionage charges, not for their religious faith,
IRNA said. But it did not mention the number of the protesters.
</P>
<P>
Fabius told the French National Assembly last Wednesday that the
Iranian Jews were arrested for being Jews and would face the
death penalty by hanging "on unfounded charges."
</P>
<P>
One hundred and forty-three French parliamentarians recently
also voiced their support for the Iranian Jews and urged the
French government to reconsider its relations with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Majlis (parliament) Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri on
Sunday also dismissed the stance of Western countries on the issue
as "a blatant interference and meddling" in Iran's internal
affairs.
</P>
<P>
No one is being prosecuted in Iran for advocating certain
belief or religion, said the speaker.

<HEADLINE> Economists Call for Common Stock Market in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Participants attending the
World Economic Forum's southern African summit in Durban Tuesday
called for a common stock market and a single currency for the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) region.
</P>
<P>
Russell Loubser, President of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange,
said that a common trading platform is necessary for the region,
similar to the one that already existed between Namibia and South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
"Regional markets must continue to develop but not at the
expense of liquidity. Global and sectoral industries will assume
more importance," Loubser said in a statement available here.
</P>
<P>
Both Loubser and Jacko Maree, Managing Director of Standard
Bank of South Africa, called for projects aimed at developing a
core of professionals in the financial markets.
</P>
<P>
The call was echoed by South African Finance Director-General
Maria Ramos, who said the architecture of capital markets needed
to be considered.
</P>
<P>
"Capacity is not just about developing existing capacity, but
broadening capacity," Ramos told the summit. She said the issue
of "dead management" needed to be addressed pro-actively.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot keep chasing the same group of people. We need to
broaden that skills group," she said
</P>
<P>
"As a seeker of capital, southern African markets cannot make a
good impression once. We have to continually work on the
relationship with the investors," she said.
</P>
<P>
Loubser and Egas Mussanhane, Chairman of the Economic
Associations Commission of Mozambique, told a workshop that the
region must succeed in securing local investment and domestic
savings.
</P>
<P>
Loubser added that exchange controls needed to go and that
industrial relations harmony and a sound and fair regulatory
environment were important to attract foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Rocco Rossow, Managing Director of the African Banking Group,
said universal adoption of international accounting standards in
the region, a common currency and consolidated supervision for the
financial services sector are necessary.
</P>
<P>
Also necessary is the harmonization between fiscal and monetary
policies.
</P>
<P>
But former South African Finance Minister Chris Liebenberg
opposed the concept of a common currency at this stage.
</P>
<P>
"If one looks at the European Union, you first had the free
movement of goods, capital and currency before a common currency
was developed," he said.
</P>
<P>
Current Finance Minister Trevor Manuel shared the sentiment,
saying that a common currency was less important at present than
minimizing costs was.
</P>
<P>
He said there is insufficient economic convergence to have a
common currency and that over-extension in this regard could be
counter-productive.
</P>
<P>
Governor of the Botswanan central bank, Baledzi Gaolathe, also
said he believed that in the short term the reduction of financial
transaction costs is more important than a common currency.
</P>
<P>
SADC executive Kaire Mbuenda said he was convinced that a
single currency for the region would be established, but also felt
that other issues were more important before regional trade
integration could become a reality.
</P>
<P>
Manuel told a news conference Tuesday that whereas politics had
 dominated previous summits, this year's summit has largely
focused on investment and sustainable economic growth in the
region.

JOHANNESBURG, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The South African city of
Durban will again host next year's annual World Economic Forum
southern African summit, organizers announced Tuesday.

NAIROBI, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The Eritrean Foreign Ministry said
Tuesday that 1,410 Eritrean civilians repatriated from Ethiopia
arrived at Eritrea' s Red Sea port city of Assab early Monday
morning.
</P>
<P>
The Eritreans and the Ethiopians of Eritrean origin came

The release said Monday's arrival of Eritreans was thought to
be only the first batch of some 15,000 Eritreans who remain
destitute in Ethiopia and will be repatriated in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
So far, Eritrea have received 60,000 Eritreans repatriated from

<HEADLINE> Barak Vows to Reach Comprehensive Peace with Arab </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Incoming Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak Tuesday pledged to work to achieve a comprehensive
peace with all of Israel's Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
"I called on all regional leaders to take our outstretched
hand and to make a peace of the brave in the area," Barak said
before presenting his coalition to the Knesset, or parliament,
for approval.
</P>
<P>
Winning the May election on a platform to revive the peace
process on all tracks, Barak reiterated that peace will be the top
priority of his new government.
</P>
<P>
In an apparent bid to ease fears of the Palestinians and
Syrians that they might be played against each other while Barak
resumed the stalled peace talks with them, the ex-army chief said
peace with Arab neighbors are "equally vital" to Israel.
</P>
<P>
"The reaching of a permanent agreement with the Palestinians
and the achieving of peace with Syria and Lebanon are equally
vital and urgent in my eyes," he said.
</P>
<P>
After winning the May elections, Barak and Syrian President
Hafez al-Assad have, through indirect channels, exchanged messages
of mutual trust and intentions to revive the peace talks, which
broke off three years ago.
</P>
<P>
These signs, together with Barak's promise to pull Israeli
troops from south Lebanon within a year, raised concerns among the
Palestinians that they might be left behind.
</P>
<P>
In his speech to the parliament, Barak said he understands not
only the suffering of the Israeli people but also that of the
Palestinians and would work for peace with them.
</P>
<P>
"I want to work with the elected Palestinian leadership headed
by Yasser Arafat in a friendship and partnership in order to
achieve a proper co-existence," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the Syrian track, Barak appealed to Assad to move quickly
to forge peace with his new government.
</P>
<P>
"The new government of Israel is determined to advance
negotiations as quickly as possible to achieve a full bilateral
agreement on peace and security based on (U.N.) Security Council
resolutions 242 and 338," he said.
</P>
<P>
The two resolutions call for Israel to withdraw from Arab
lands occupied in the 1967 Middle East war, including the Syrian
territory of the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
"We have been very determined force in the battle of
peace...it is about time to come to achieve open and courageous
peace to make sure the future and security of ourselves, our
children and our grandchildren," he said.
</P>
<P>
"No force will prevent us from achieving our goal of peace,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Legislative Council Speaker Ahmed Qureia welcomed
Barak's remarks, saying that the Palestinians are "cautiously
optimistic that this government will work toward advancing the
peace process."
</P>
<P>
After more than six weeks of grueling talks, Barak put
together a coalition comprising of seven parties in the
15-faction Knesset, securing a majority of 75 seats, the largest
majority in the 120-member Knesset in Israel in years.
</P>
<P>
With most of his coalition partners favoring or holding
neutral attitude toward peace, confidence has grown among the
Arab world that Barak might be able to move forward the
peace process quickly.

<HEADLINE> Two Lebanese Banks Merged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's Banque Libanaise pour le
Commerce (BLC) and the United Bank of Lebanon (UBL) Tuesday signed
a merger agreement, Lebanon's independent Central News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
BLC will buy out UBL's assets to form a new bank with the name
of UBL, said a joint statement issued by Chairman of BLC Felix
Jean Aboujaoude and his UBL counterpart Safi Harb at a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
"The merger will create a new financial power in the banking
sector which enjoys high potential for development locally and
regionally," Aboujaoude said.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, UBL's capital will be raised to about 250
million U.S. dollars from 60 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Total assets of the amalgamated banks will be more than 1.5
billion dollars, making UBL among the country's five top banks.
</P>
<P>
The new bank's branches will also rise to 47 with four in the
United Arab Emirates and one in France.
</P>
<P>
Shares of BLC, which is the first bank in Lebanon to be listed
on the Beirut Stock Exchange, will continue to be traded, the
statement said, adding that the merger will have to be approved
by the central bank.
</P>
<P>
There are nearly 80 banks in Lebanon, most of them are small
and family-run businesses.
</P>
<P>
The central bank has been offering incentives to facilitate
takeovers in the banking sector, which analysts say is too
crowded, but only a handful of banks have taken advantages of the
break.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Greece on Tuesday continued its
nationwide crackdown on illegal immigrants with the aim of
combating crime as well as providing a clear picture of how many
foreigners were legally in the country.
</P>
<P>
The crackdown on illegal immigrants comes after a meeting of
the Greek government Council on Foreign Affairs and Defense on
Friday, which decided to hire more than 2,500 more police officers
and border guards in a bid to curb illegal immigration in Greece.
</P>
<P>
In Attica province, Greek police detained about 500 suspected
illegal immigrants, mostly Albanians, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Police said that those found to have legitimate residence
permits would be released while those who are found to be in
Greece illegally would be deported.
</P>
<P>
50,000 illegal immigrants have been deported from Greece since
the beginning of this year, according to official data issued by
Greece's Public Order Ministry.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Imposes Sanctions on Afghanistan's Taliban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton has
signed an executive order imposing financial sanctions against
Afghanistan's Taliban in retaliation for its support of Osama bin
Laden, a senior administration official said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Bin Laden, who the United States alleged was responsible for
the bombing of its two embassies in African, was placed on the
FBI's "Ten Most Wanted List" last month with a 5 million U.S.
dolllars reward offered for information leading to his arrest.
</P>
<P>
The senior official said the president's action sends a clear
message that the United States would not tolerate those who
support bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
The United States demands that the Taliban expel bin Laden to
the United States for trial or to a third country where he would
face justice for alleged bombing.
</P>
<P>
Taliban leaders have insisted they do not know where bin Laden
is.
</P>
<P>
The president's executive order freezes any property of the
Taliban within U.S. jurisdiction. It also prohibits transactions
and trade with the Taliban or in territory controlled by the
Taliban, preventing any U.S. investment. U.S. trade with
Afghanistan totaled 24 dollars million in 1998.

<HEADLINE> 23 Countries Sign on New Act to Protect Industrial Designs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- 23 countries signed here Tuesday on
a new act to broaden the geographical scope of international
industrial design protection adopted by consensus on July 2 at the
end of the diplomatic conference of the World Intellectual
Property Organization (WIPO).
</P>
<P>
According to a WIPO press release, the delegations signed the
Geneva Act of the Hague Agreement Concerning the International
Registration of Industrial Designs are Algeria, Belgium, Bulgaria,
Chad, Croatia, Cuba, Denmark, Estonia, France, Greece, Hungary,
Italy, Latvia, the Netherlands, Portugal, Moldova, Romania,
Russia, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the
United States of America.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, 43 delegations signed the final act of the
diplomatic conference for the adoption of the Geneva act. They are
Algeria, Argentina, Belgium, Bulgaria, Chad, China, Cote d"Ivoire,
Croatia, Cuba, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Ecuador, Estonia,
Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan,
Kenya, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Panama,
Portugal, Moldova, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain,
Swaziland, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Uganda, the United
Kingdom, the United States, and the European Community.
</P>
<P>
The new act, expected to enter into force after six
ratifications of over 80 contracting parties, introduces a number
of important changes to the Hague system for the registration of
industrial designs, according to WIPO.
</P>
<P>
The Geneva act enhances the existing system for the
international registration of industrial designs by making it more
compatible with the registration systems in countries such as the
United States and Japan where protection of industrial designs is
contingent on examination determine the acceptability of an
application.
</P>
<P>
One of the main advantages of using the Hague system is that it
allows users to include up to as many as 100 designs in each
international application that is made. In 1998, WIPO registered
about 4,000 international deposits each covering on average 11
countries. This represented a 40 percent increase on the number
deposited 10 years previously.

<HEADLINE> Africa's 2nd Anti-Malaria Project to Cost $2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (WHO)
regional office for Africa said here Tuesday that the second Roll
Back Malaria (RBM) project in Africa will cost two billion U.S.
dollars to implement over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The office said in a report released in Harare Tuesday that
there is an absolute shortage of funds for health on the
continent.
</P>
<P>
The cost for the 2nd anti-malaria project was established by
the project partnership meeting held in Harare last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Roll Back Malaria project is a broad network of national
governments, international and bilateral organizations,
non-governmental organizations, the private sector and others
contributing resources and skills to reduce the malaria burden
across the globe.
</P>
<P>
It was launched in New York in October 1998 by the WHO, the
United Nations Children's Education Fund, the U.N. Development
Fund and the World Bank, but was formally established in Geneva
two months later.
</P>
<P>
The anti-malaria project partnership meeting in Harare stressed
the need for both short-term and long-term mobilization strategies
and for governments and donors to jointly develop flexible,
transparent funding mechanisms and reporting systems.
</P>
<P>
On the progress made in rolling back malaria in Africa, the
report said activities undertaken included the development of a
draft strategy, work plan, advocacy materials and a framework for
monitoring progress.
</P>
<P>
Programs set for implementation over the next two years include
the development of a framework for country-level implementation of
the Roll Back Malaria project, identification of country needs and
provision of appropriate resources and the institution of
functional partnerships at national and local levels in
malaria-endemic countries.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Britain Accused of Blocking Iraqi Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Iraq Tuesday accused the U.S. and
British envoys with the U.N. Sanctions Committee of blocking the
approval of the contracts of its communications sector under the
oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Murtadha, Minister of Transport and Communications, told
the Iraqi News Agency that the Sanctions Committee is still
holding the contracts his ministry signed with foreign companies
eight months ago.
</P>
<P>
The minister did not say how many contracts are on hold or how
much they are worth.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.N. had earlier allocated 150 million
U.S. dollars to meet the needs of the communications sector, but
later reduced the amount on the ground that it would affect other
basic needs of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
Murtadha argued that services of his sector are needed by
the food distribution centers all over the country, as they are
needed by hospitals to treat patients.
</P>
<P>
During the 1991 Gulf War, most of Iraq's communications
systems were destroyed by the U.S.-led western allies.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food program, Iraq is allowed to export
limited amount of oil in every six months to buy food, medicine
and other humanitarian supplies for its nearly 24 million people
reeling under the U.N. sanctions imposed following its invasion of
Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Under relevant U.N. resolutions, all contracts signed by the
Iraqi government with foreign companies must get the approval of
the U.N. Sanctions Committee before shipment can be made.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has long complained that U.S. and British envoys with
the Sanctions Committee deliberately impede the approval of its
contracts.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Urges Rebuilding of Confidence in Peace Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
Tuesday called for efforts to rebuild confidence in the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Moussa made the call when he was speaking to reporters after a
meeting between Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat. Arafat left Cairo after the meeting, ending
a brief visit.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian foreign minister lashed out at the outgoing
Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, for shattering the
confidence due to his hardline policy toward the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"The most important step to rebuild confidence is to implement
the agreements" signed between the Palestinians and Israel, Moussa
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The foremost of the agreements that should be honored is the
Wye accord of October 1998, he said, adding that the Israeli
settlement policy, confiscation and demolition of Palestinian
houses should be stopped.
</P>
<P>
Under the interim peace accord, Israel should withdraw from
another 13 percent of the West Bank. But the Netanyahu government
halted troop pullback in December. It also supported the building
of Jewish settlements on Palestinian land.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu was defeated by moderate leader of the Israeli Labor
Party Ehud Barak in the country's May 17 elections. Barak's
victory has increased hopes for the revival of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Moussa's caution, however, was believed to be prompted by a
euphoria maintained by both Israeli and Arab peace activists.
</P>
<P>
Consultations among Arab parties concerned with the peace
process "are essential at this stage" to draw up a political line
that should be followed, Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
"As a new government is about to be formed, it is important for
us to know what line that government will take regarding the peace
process," he said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean FM Optimistic at Draft Cease-fire Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Foreign Minister Stan
Mudenge said in Lusaka Tuesday he hoped that the ministers would
finalize by the end of the day the draft cease-fire document to
end the war in Congo (K).
</P>
<P>
The minister said this in an interview with the Zimbabwe News
Agency Ziana before the relevant African ministers met for their
last plenary session Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The African ministers had by Saturday evening adopted the peace
accord to end the war, disclosed Mudenge.
</P>
<P>
However, Uganda and Rwanda were reportedly now introducing new
demands, which the Southern African Development Community (SADC)
allies have rejected.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda do not want the Organization of African Unity
and the United Nations to police the peace-keeping process, said
the Zimbabwean foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda, accused of aiding the Congolese rebels alongside
Uganda, had wanted Zimbabwe to take responsibility of the Hutu
militia in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and disarm them.
</P>
<P>
The major players in the Congo (K) war saw it fit to have an
international peace-keeping force either from the U.N. or the OAU
to enforce any truce in the third largest African country.
</P>
<P>
Mudenge said the talks would end Tuesday evening even if they
do not conclude the discussions.
</P>
<P>
"We are going for last minute private consultations. Within an
hour, we are going to report to the plenary session. It is at
this last session that we will know if we have agreed or not," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Even if we do not, we are all going back to our
individual countries and continue consulting."
</P>
<P>
The ministers from the 14 SADC countries, from Rwanda and

<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- President of the Palestinian National
Authority Yasser Arafat said Tuesday that the Palestinians were
ready to build peace together with the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Arafat expressed the desire in response to the remarks by
Israeli Prime Minister-Elect Ehud Barak before the Knesset
(parliament) Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to bravely go together towards peace under the
signed accords with late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin," he
said upon his return from Egypt.
</P>
<P>
After six weeks of coalition talks, Barak submitted the list of
his nineteen-minister cabinet to the Knesset Tuesday for approval.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Israeli lawmakers, Barak said he was ready to
push forward the peace process on the Palestinian, Syrian and
Lebanese tracks in a bid to reach peace with the Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks on all tracks have been stalled under the outgoing
hardline Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, Arafat met Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
and discussed with him the latest developments of the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian leader briefed Arafat on the results of his recent
tours of Washington and Paris. The two sides also reviewed some
issues of common concern, on top of which are the situation in the
Arab world and the bilateral ties.

<HEADLINE> Ghana's Anti-Drug Program Lauded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Drug Control Program
(UNDCP) has lauded Ghana's anti-drug program as worthy of
emulation in the sub-region, the Ghana News Agency reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Kofi Quantson, Executive Secretary of the Ghanaian Narcotics
Control Board, said in Accra tuesday that the UNDCP, which
supports the board with logistics and funds, singled out Ghana's
anti-drug laws and law enforcement structure as an example for
other west African countries to emulate.
</P>
<P>
Quantson told the press that the track record of his board has
improved upon the country's previously dented image in the early
1990s when Ghana was regarded as a major transit point for
narcotic drugs.
</P>
<P>
"The UNDCP is assisting in providing vehicles and other
technical equipment," said Quantson.
</P>
<P>
He said that the European Union, under its African Anti-Drug
Program, also plans to give a face-lift to the Department of
Social Welfare's Rehabilitation Center to treat drug-related
patients discharged from the Psychiatric Hospital, which is the
only facility currently handling such cases in this west African
country.
</P>
<P>
The anti-drug official said the best way to win the war against
drugs is for everyone to approach it with equal responsibility.

<P>
KHARTOUM, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Sudan and the United Arab Emirates
(UAE) agreed to restore their diplomatic ties to ambassadorial
level, said Sudanese Foreign Minister Mustafa Osman Ismail.
</P>
<P>
And the two sides also agreed to promote their political and
economic ties, the Sudanese state-run television quoted the
minister as saying Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
On his ongoing visit to the UAE, Ismail said it was part of the
exchanges he initiated last year with a number of Arab Gulf states
with a view to enhancing Sudan's ties with the Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
The UAE tour aims to normalize the Sudanese-UAE ties that have
been strained because Sudan sided with Iraq during the Gulf war in
1991.

<HEADLINE> Mideast Peace Talks to Be Resumed Soon: Peres </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister-elect Ehud
Barak will resume peace talks with all Arab neighbors soon, former
Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Barak is a man who keeps his promises, Peres told a conference
on peace in Cairo. "It will not take too long before we shall see
the renewal of the Mideast peace process," he added.
</P>
<P>
Peres, who discussed the stalled peace process with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak earlier Tuesday, was attending a meeting
of the International Alliance for Arab-Israeli Peace that was set
up in Denmark in 1997. The three-day conference is sponsored by
Denmark and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Barak's government, which is expected to take office late in
the day, "will move swiftly to the way of peace on all tracks and
to all other alternatives to bring peace to our region," Peres
said.
</P>
<P>
Israel's peace talks with Syria and Lebanon have been stalled
since early 1996, while the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations
failed to make significant progress during the outgoing government
of hard-line Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Barak trounced Netanyahu in Israel's May 17 elections. Barak
has promised to advance negotiations with the Palestinians and
Syria, and to withdraw Israeli forces from Lebanon in 12 months.
</P>
<P>
A former Israeli education minister and well-known left-winger,
Shulamit Aloni, was equally optimistic about the prospects for the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Trust the people of Israel, they voted for peace and they are
fed up with wars," Aloni, a former leader of the moderate Meretz
Party, told the conference.
</P>
<P>
But Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, who did not attend
the conference, urged caution on Tuesday. Moussa said what is
needed at present are steps to rebuild confidence in the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a meeting between Mubarak and
visiting Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, Moussa called for the
implementation of the agreements signed between the Palestinians
and Israel, the foremost of which is the Wye accord.
</P>
<P>
He also urged an end to the construction of Jewish settlements,
the confiscation of Arab property and lands, and the demolition of
Arab houses.
</P>
<P>
The Netanyahu government had halted its military withdrawals
from the West Bank under the Wye accord of October 1998, and had
supported the building of Jewish settlements on Palestinian land.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi Tuesday called for continuation of the international
efforts for the release of the four Iranians who have missed for
17 years.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi made the appeal in his letters to the United Nations
Secretary General, head of the International Committee of the Red
Cross, rotating president of the European Union, Lebanese prime
minister and Syrian foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
He held Israel responsible for the fate of the Iranian
diplomats, who Iran believed to have been abducted by Israel from
Lebanon in 1982, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"The Zionist (Israeli) regime tries to forget the abduction
case," Kharrazi said, but evidences proved that the Iranian
diplomats are still alive and were transferred to Israel.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry Sunday also urged Israel to release
the missing Iranians and said that Israel should directly bear the
responsibility for the missing of the Iranians with the
consideration of evidences.
</P>
<P>
It also called on the Lebanese government to use all
possibilities to probe into the case and seek the release of the
Iranian diplomats and also urged international human rights
groups to help clarify the fate of the Iranians.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Israel entered a new round of tension following the
arrest of 13 Iranian Jews on charge of spying for Israel and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Both Israel and the U.S. have rejected the Iranian claims and
called on Tehran to release the Iranians immediately.
</P>
<P>
However, Iran has stated that the Iranian Jews would be tried
according to Iranian laws and they might be sentenced to death for
spying against the country's security.

TEHRAN, July 6 (Xinhua) -- An informed source at the Iranian
Foreign Ministry Tuesday categorically denied the claim by
U.S. civil rights leader Jesse Jackson that he had met Iranian
official recently in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
The London-based daily newspaper Al-Hayat recently quoted
Jackson as saying that he met Iranian officials on the sidelines

</P>
<P>
However, the Iranian source told the Islamic Republic News
Agency that none of the Iranian delegates who participated the

Jackson.
</P>
<P>
According to Al-Hayat, Jackson hoped to visit Iran to seek the
release of the 13 Iranian Jews arrested on espionage charges.
</P>
<P>
The arrest of the Iranian Jews has aroused grave concern of
western countries, including the U.S. and Israel, which have
denied any links between their intelligence services with the
Iranian Jews.
</P>
<P>
Iran has termed the stance taken by western countries as an
interference in Iran's internal affairs.

<HEADLINE> OAU Restructuring to Improve Efficiency: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, July 6 (Xinhua)-- The restructuring program of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU), which will cost 19 million
U.S. dollars, will make it a more efficient and influential
organization in the continent, an OAU official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 600-member organization will get thinner by at least 200
positions, Ibrahim Dagash, spokesman of the organization, said at
a news briefing on the discussion of African ambassadors meeting
here.
</P>
<P>
The 18-month-long restructuring program of the OAU, which is to
be carried out among both professionals and non-professionals, is
scheduled to complete by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
Dagash said that the restructuring will affect all members of
staff except the positions of secretary-general and his five
senior assistants.
</P>
<P>
The Addis Ababa-based organization has lately been criticized
for low efficiency and overstaff, making it difficult in the
crisis-ridden continent which demands an efficient and influential
continental body for peace and development, some critics say.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1963, the OAU has been devoted to the safeguarding
of independence, unity and promotion of development in the
continent.

<HEADLINE> Africa Should Have One Voice in Debt Negotiation: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Africa should have one voice in
negotiating relief on its 233 billion U.S. dollars foreign debt,
Spokesman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) Ibrahim
Dagash said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman made the remarks here when briefing journalists
on the ongoing African ambassadors' meeting.
</P>
<P>
The massive debt was pulling down Africa's development efforts
because needed resources were diverted to repay borrowed funds.
</P>
<P>
"The problem is the servicing of the debt which is killing
Africa," he said, adding that the OAU's objective was to talk to
Africa's creditors with one voice instead of waiting for the
creditors to approach individual debt-ridden states separately.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, he noted, the OAU has set up a five-member
contact group from Africa's five regions to spearhead the debt
relief talks with the creditors.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest figures released by the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP), more than half of African countries
are suffering from their external debt, which has undermined the
development of their respective economies.
</P>
<P>
The staggering external debt of African countries has hindered
the revitalization of Africa's relatively small and weak
economies.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-three of a total of the world's 48 poorest countries are
in Africa and nearly half of the African population are living
under the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
With the rapid growth of economies elsewhere, African economies
have been further marginalized in the global arena.
</P>
<P>
Africa's trade now accounts for only 1.2 percent of the world's
total, down from 3.1 percent 30 years ago.

<HEADLINE> Ghanaian VP Calls for Wider Social Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Ghanaian Vice-President John Evans
Atta Mills Tuesday called for a wider social security coverage in
the African continent, the Ghana News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Opening the 13th International Social Security Association
Africa Regional Conference in Accra, the vice-president said that
the time has come for Africa to rid its social security schemes of
dogmas that might have served a passing age.
</P>
<P>
Social security schemes in Africa cover below 30 percent of the
 working population as compared to 100 percent in the developed
world.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president told over 200 representatives from Africa
and personnel from the International Social Security Association
as well as other related world bodies that social security schemes
in Africa need to be re-engineered to be in tune with the
socio-cultural realities of the continent.
</P>
<P>
Mills said as the continent moves toward the new millennium
with hope, progress and security for its people, social protection
must be based on comprehensive and sustainable social security
programs.
</P>
<P>
Only a small fraction, mostly urbanized workers in most African
 countries, has been registered under social security schemes.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president challenged this conference to come out with
an Accra Declaration on social security for the 21st century
"which will address the fundamental needs we have identified."
</P>
<P>
Most existing social security schemes in Africa took off after
 independence to benefit government employees and others in the
formal sector.
</P>
<P>
The schemes operated on the selected needs of a minority of
workers without taking into account the wider social protection
needs of the entire population.
</P>
<P>
The conference, under a broad theme of "Social Security in
Africa: New Realities," will be an attempt to make the scheme
more appealing to the wider segment of the population not covered.

<HEADLINE> Congo (K) Peace Talks on Verge of Collapse: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Peace talks aimed at ending the
11-month conflict in Congo (K) fell in deadlock Tuesday after
Rwanda said it would not back down on a demand that exiled Hutu
militia be disarmed, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The officials attending the meeting here said that the talks,
which have been dragging on for close to two weeks in Zambian
capital Lusaka, were now on the verge of collapse.
</P>
<P>
They are accusing Rwanda, Uganda and Zimbabwe of delaying the
signing of a cease-fire agreement. The three countries have sent
their troops fighting in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
One of the officials who declined to be named said that the
last minute demands by Rwanda and Uganda are delaying the peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
He said the talks are deadlocked over the Interahamwe Hutu
militias. The key issue is who disarms them and how this should be
done.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda and Uganda want Zimbabwe to take responsibility for the
militia but Zimbabwe dismissed, said the official.
</P>
<P>
He said Zimbabwe told a consultative meeting of belligerents
that it did not have the resistances to carry out the operations
demanded by Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Zimbabwe said the task of disarming the Interahamwe be
lift to the United Nations as agreed upon in the primary session
at the beginning of the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Another official said unless the issue of the militia is
resolved, the Lusaka talks are bound to collapse, noting that the
Rwandans are not budging and neither are the Zimbabweans.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the belligerent parties are also
grappling over the issue of the deployment of a United Nations
peace-keeping force in the DRC with Uganda and Rwanda insisting on
a joint military council to oversee the implementation of a
cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
The issue would be tabled at the ministers' plenary session
expected to resume later for consideration, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Lusaka peace talks have been held under the guidance of
Zambian President Frederick Chiluba, who was mandated by the U.N.,
the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) to seek peace in the DRC.

KAMPALA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Uganda President Yoweri Museveni
said Tuesday that the Uganda People's Defense Forces will soon
deploy zonal forces in the west area of this east African country
to guard displaced people's camps.
</P>
<P>
According to a release from the presidential office, the
president made the announcement when he was touring Bundibugyo
district bordering the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Museveni explained to the local people that while zonal forces
guard the camps, mobile forces will hunt for the bandits.
</P>
<P>
The president assured the district leaders that the defense
forces will increase the number of soldiers in the area so that
the displaced people's camps are adequately and permanently
guarded.
</P>
<P>
Once the army has sufficient manpower in the area, he said, the
camps will be decentralized to the villages from their present
concentration so that the people can carry out agricultural
activities near their homes.
</P>
<P>
According to a memorandum of a local leader, rebel activities
in west Uganda have adversely affected the people's lives.
</P>
<P>
The local leader said that the numbers of the displaced people
in Bwamba county are big and the assistance to them is not
sufficient.
</P>
<P>
All development programs have been disrupted by insecurity, he
noted.

<HEADLINE> Turkish President Praises Romanian Efforts Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman Demirel
Tuesday expressed satisfaction over Romanian efforts to put an
end to the presence of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
Demirel thanked Romanian President Emil Constantinescu, who
arrived here on Tuesday for a two-day official visit, for
Romanian cooperation in Turkey's struggle against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"Romania has always supported Turkey in the struggle against
terrorism and organized crime. The Romanian security forces
operation against groups affiliated with the PKK on April 27,
1999, is the concrete proof of Romania's efforts," added Demirel.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Turkey, Romania and Bulgaria signed a trilateral
agreement on a joint struggle against terrorism and organized
crime.
</P>
<P>
Romanian authorities have recently intensified efforts to crack
down on the PKK and its affiliates in Romania, and have extradited
a number of PKK members to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Demirel also expressed his desire for accelarated economic
ties between Turkey and Romania.
</P>
<P>
"Romania is Turkey's biggest trade partner in the Balkans and
the Middle East. Turkey is the biggest foreign investor in
Romania with some 1.2 billion U.S. dollars," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish president pointed out that "our bilateral trade
volume has reached 813 million U.S. dollars last year and it is
expected to exceed 1 billion dollars in a short period of time."
</P>
<P>
Following the talks between Demirel and Constantinescus, the
two sides signed a consular agreement and a protocol on
cooperation in social security.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the two presidents are scheduled to address
a meeting of the Turco-Romanian Business Council in Istanbul,
the largest city of Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Deputy PM Blasts EU Stance on PKK Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's Deputy Prime Minister
Develet Bahceli Tuesday harshly criticized the European Union
(EU)'s position on the death sentence on the outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK) leader Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to his Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) in the
parliament, Bahceli also called on the EU to revise its policies
towards Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Western European countries, which are against the death
penalty, called on Turkey not to hang Ocalan after he was
sentenced to death last Tuesday on charges of treason and
separatism.
</P>
<P>
Bahceli said that "the hullabaloo created for the pardon of
the terrorist chieftain has displayed once again the EU's
hypocritical attitude on terrorism and towards Turkey."
</P>
<P>
He said that "our party believes that the EU must revise its
policies on Turkey and launch a process of self-criticism."
</P>
<P>
Bahceli lashed out at the EU for not taking adequate measures
to prevent PKK attacks on Turkish establishments in Europe.
</P>
<P>
He also singled out Italy and Greece as the spokesmen and
advocates of the PKK and accused them of having played an
important part in its development.
</P>
<P>
The Ocalan-led PKK has been fighting a war for an independent
Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey since 1984. Conflicts between
the Turkish security forces and the PKK militants have claimed
over 37,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was captured by Turkish special agents in Kenya in
mid-February and has ever since been detained on Imrali Island
in Marmara Sea near western Turkey's province of Bursa.

LAGOS, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Relevant African leaders have arrived
in Lome, Togo's capital, for a mini-summit, which is expected to
open on Tuesday night in a bid to bring peace to war-torn Sierra
Leone.
</P>
<P>
Among the African leaders to attend the summit are Nigerian
President Olusegun Obasanjo, Burkinabe President Blaise Compaore,
Liberian President Charles Taylor, Sierra Leonean President Ahmad
Tejan Kabbah, and their host President Gnassingbe Eyadema of Togo.
</P>
<P>
Information from Lome confirmed that only Nigerian President
Obasanjo and his Burkinabe counterpart arrived in the Togolese
capital before the originally designated starting time for the
summit, generating fears that the rebels might have changed their
mind at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah was the last to arrive after the flying-in of one of the
top field commanders of his rebel Revolutionary United Front
(RUF).
</P>
<P>
A Sierra Leonean government official who spoke on condition of
anonymity said the rebels had earlier expressed last-minute
worries about the details of a general amnesty plan.

<HEADLINE> Security Urged in East Timor Ahead of Ballot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Tuesday called on Indonesia to maintain peace and security in East
Timor as a ballot to determine the territory's future is
forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Council deplored the attack by armed militias on
a U.N. Mission convoy delivering humanitarian assistance on July
4, Council President Malaysia's Agam Hasmy told the press
following closed consultations.
</P>
<P>
The Council heard a briefing by U.N. Assistant
Secretary-General De Soto on the situation in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Agam said the Council demanded an immediate halt to the
practice of violence and intimidation by the militias.
</P>
<P>
"Members of the Council called upon the Indonesian authorities
to investigate the matter and to bring to justice those
responsible for the recent attacks on the U.N. Mission in East
Timor (UNAMET)," the presidential statement said.
</P>
<P>
The UNAMET was created by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to
organize and conduct the so-called popular consultation in East
Timor to see whether the majority of the 800,000 East Timorese
would choose special autonomy within Indonesia or independence.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, a Portuguese colony until 1975, was occupied by
Indonesia in the same year and annexed in 1976. Under the auspices
of the U.N. which calls it a non-self-governing territory,
Indonesia and Portugal reached an agreement on May 5 for a vote in
August.

<HEADLINE> Angola Urged to Release Russian Pilots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Embassy in Luanda said
Tuesday that the Russian government has called upon the Angolan
rebel movement UNITA to release the Russian crew members of the
two planes downed in northeastern Angola.
</P>
<P>
The embassy said in a press release that the Russian Foreign
Ministry issued a statement in Moscow Tuesday demanding that the
National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), and its
leader Jonas Savimbi in particular, to take necessary steps to
enable the pilots to return home.
</P>
<P>
The press release again denied that the Russian pilots were
involved in military operation in the war-ravaged southern African
country, claiming that they were just doing civilian transport.
</P>
<P>
An Antonov-26 and an Antonov-12 were shot down in Lunda-Norte
Province on May 12 and June 30 this year respectively. The
Russian pilots on the planes were detained by the UNITA troops.
</P>
<P>
The UNITA said in Portuguese capital Lisbon last Friday that
its troops captured four Russian pilots in Xa-Muteba city, 500 kms
west of Luanda. Another Russian pilot had died of serious burns
after the Antonov-12 crashed.
</P>
<P>
Three Russian pilots survived the May 12 crash, and they had
been taken to Andulo city, the UNITA's headquarters in the central
highlands.
</P>
<P>
The rebel group claimed that these Russian pilots had been
mercenaries fighting for the Angolan government army, saying that
they would be punished for what they had done.
</P>
<P>
However, both the Angolan government and the Russian government
have said again and again that these pilots were employed by the
local companies to transport food and mining machinery to the
northeastern part of the war-torn country.

<HEADLINE> UK Manufacturing Picks Up In May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 6 (Xinhua) -- British industrial production was
stronger than expected in May, suggesting that the long decline in
manufacturing may be at an end.
</P>
<P>
The upturn was taken as a sign that the UK economy is on track
for solid growth in the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
The Office for National Statistics monthly manufacturing
production figure rose 0.3 percent compared to April although it
was still down 0.8 percent on May last year.
</P>
<P>
Figures for the latest three months showed manufacturing
output, which accounts for about a fifth of the country's economic
activity, rose 0.5 percent from the previous three months -- the
strongest performance for nearly a year.
</P>
<P>
Signs that manufacturing may at last have turned the corner
suggest the government may be on target with its prediction of 1
percent economic growth this year after a flat first quarter of
1999.
</P>
<P>
Neil Parker, Royal Bank of Scotland economist, said, "The data
is very encouraging with regard to the prospects for the UK
economy going forward."

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON July 6 (Xinhua) - London's leading shares rose to record
high Tuesday on a boost from unexpectedly strong economic data and
a strengthening trend on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 closed up 28.6 points, or 0.43 percent, to finish
at a record 6620.6, as the market shrugged off the interest rate
implications of a surprise 0.2 percent rise in May manufacturing
output and focused on the rosier economic outlook.
</P>
<P>
The report was seen as removing hopes of a further interest
rate cut when the Bank of England's rate committee meets Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Technology stocks are highly concentrated in the wider FTSE 250
index, helping it add 35.8 points, or 0.6 percent, to 6010.8. That
was also a record closing high, beating the 5975 from earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
Strategists, impressed by the FTSE 100's showing this week,
said the performance over the next few days could determine the
market's success for the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, the Xetra Dax finished down 12.72 points at
5612.90, a loss of 0.23 percent. The market was unimpressed by a
smaller-than-expected rise in May unemployment.
</P>
<P>
French stocks were little changed on Tuesday after early
attempts at deeper consolidation were derailed by brisk trade in
oil stocks.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark CAC-40 ended down just 5.23, or 0.11 percent, at
4692.51, paring most of its earlier losses just before the close.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Follows Closely with China's Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President Benjamin
Mkapa said Tuesday that his country has followed closely with the
experiences of China's economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
During its reforms, China has made policies independently and
managed to maintain political and social stability, an example
which Tanzania should learn from, Mkapa said at his official
residence here while meeting the outgoing Chinese ambassador Zhang
Hongxi.
</P>
<P>
The president said China's achievements from its reforms
impressed him a lot while he visited the country last April.
</P>
<P>
To learn from China's experiences, Tanzania's Minister of
Industries and Commerce Iddi Simba will visit the economic
development zone in Shanghai soon, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Hongxi, who was bidding a farewell to the president, said
that China attaches great importance to its traditional friendship
with Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral relationship between the two nations has strengthened
during the past two years with exchanges of high-level government
officials, Mkapa said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese ambassador said the bilateral relationship has
turned a new chapter after China and Tanzania started to establish
joint ventures as a form of economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa expressed gratitude to China's long-term assistance and
said Tanzania wishes to set up more joint ventures with China.
</P>
<P>
He also said Tanzania will take measures to solve problems
facing the first joint venture between the two countries, the
Tanzania-China Friendship Textile Co. Ltd., which was launched in
April of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Tanzanian president stressed that the two
countries should carry out institutional cooperation involving the
private sector.

<HEADLINE> UK Launches Health Drive to Save Lives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 6 (Xinhua) -- UK Health Secretary Frank Dobson
Tuesday announced ambitious targets to save 300,000 lives over the
next 10 years by cutting deaths from cancer, heart disease,
accidents and suicide.
</P>
<P>
Launching a White Paper on public health in England, Dobson
said the government also aimed to reduce the health inequalities
between the rich and the poor. He accused the previous
Conservative government of exacerbating the problems with their
policies.
</P>
<P>
"We want to help make sure that the standard of health of the
people they (the Tories) represent in Surrey or Sutton Coldfield
is shared by the people we represent in Barnsley or Bethnal
Green," he said. "We want to end the divisions that mar our
society."
</P>
<P>
Dobson outlined four specific targets contained in the paper,
including the reduction of deaths from cancer among people under
75 by at least a fifth, deaths from coronary heart disease among
people under 75 by at least two-fifths, deaths by accidents by at
least a fifth and serious injury by at least a tenth, and suicides
by at least a fifth.
</P>
<P>
The targets, to be achieved by 2010, would be "backed by
action," he said, adding that "we will see a healthier nation as a
result of this White Paper."
</P>
<P>
There would be specific action to improve people's diet, and to
cut smoking, the biggest single preventable cause of death in the
UK. Also, the role of health visitors, community and school nurses
and midwives would be extended, according to the health secretary.
</P>
<P>
A Health Skills program will be launched to teach first aid
skills and health information to young people, and an Expert
Patients scheme will enable people with chronic conditions such as
asthma and diabetes to more effectively manage their own
conditions, according to the paper.

<HEADLINE> Oil Prices Hold over 18 Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Crude oil prices held above 18 U.S.
dollars a barrel on Tuesday despite shedding some early gains as
markets drew support from fresh evidence that OPEC tightened
supply in June.
</P>
<P>
World marker Brent blend crude for August delivery ended seven
cents lower at 18.11 U.S. dollars per barrel. The London market
had opened stronger but failed to hold the morning's gains as some
profit-taking kicked in.
</P>
<P>
IPE Brent jumped 51 cents on Monday to trade at its highest in
18 months, climbing into the bottom end of OPEC's target price
range between 18 and 20 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
OPEC producers, buoyed by a rally that has added 8 U.S. dollars
a barrel to the price from February's historic lows, improved
adherence with bespoke output cuts in place since April.
</P>
<P>
A Reuters survey of production by members of the Organisation
of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, excluding Iraq, showed a
compliance level of 89 percent in June, from 85 percent in May.
</P>
<P>
OPEC reduced output in June by 290,000 barrels a day (bpd) to
25.85 million, according to a survey of OPEC and industry
officials, analysts and consultants.
</P>
<P>
"OPEC is holding the line on production," Reuters quoted
Washington consultancy Petroleum Finance as saying, adding that
OPEC was on course to wipe out surplus inventories by the end of
the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
U.S. weekly oil stocks data, an important market indicator due
to be published on Wednesday, will provide further insight into
whether the supply curbs are helping to erode the oil stockpile in
the world's largest economy.

WASHINGTON, July 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Clinton is
offering a mix of public and private investment to spur economic
activity in some of the nation's poor communities, as he began his
four-day tour through the U.S. inner cities and rural areas from
Appalachia to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
"I want everybody in America to know that while our country has
been blessed with this economic recovery, not all Americans have
been blessed by it," Clinton told about 600 people gathered in a
tin-roofed warehouse in Clarksdale. He noted the poverty and
unemployment rates in the Mississippi Delta region far exceed the
national averages.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was announcing 64 million dollars in community
development grants Tuesday, including 15 million dollars for the
Delta region, before joining a Bank of America executive in East
St. Louis, to outline a new 500 million dollars capital investment
fund.
</P>
<P>
During the tour, a handful of corporate leaders are
accompanying President Clinton and several Cabinet secretaries and
politicians as they review local projects and deliver promises of
investment and technical assistance.
</P>
<P>
The president announced 60 million dollars in grants from the
Community Development Financial Institutions Fund to community
development organizations across the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cathy Bessant, a vice president of Bank of America,
committed 100 million dollars to the fund. Later in the day, with
Clinton by her side, she announced formation of a 500 million
capital investment fund targeted at often-overlooked communities.
</P>
<P>
"There is real money to be made in these markets," Bressant
said. "We think we can be even more successful when we create
markets that work in inner cities."

LONDON, July 6 (Xinhua) -- British coastguards say a teenager
is lucky to be alive after a miraculous escape when her car
plunged up to 200 ft down a cliff.
</P>
<P>
Three-quarters of the way down the 18-year-old was thrown from
the car and wedged by her right leg and hip between two rocks. She
was unconscious for about three hours, but when she came round,
she was able to call for help using her mobile phone.
</P>
<P>
Ambulance control staff had to ring the woman back, who was
disorientated and crying, six times because her phone kept cutting
out, according to the police.
</P>
<P>
Eventually the woman, named as Rebecca Richards from Torpoint,
Cornwall, the UK, was able to establish that she was in the area
of Whitsand Bay, near Freathy, in south-east Cornwall.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers then searched the area for 45 minutes before a Sea
King helicopter from RNAS Culdrose found her.
</P>

The driver was wedged between rocks after being thrown clear of
the car. A paramedic and an ambulance technician climbed up the
cliff to reach her from the beach below and fitted an intravenous
drip.
</P>
<P>
She was taken to Roborough Airport and from there to Derriford
Hospital in Plymouth with injuries to her right leg, neck and
face. She was also suffering from clinical shock and hypothermia,
but her injuries were not thought to be life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
Her car, a blue Vauxhall Nova, was found badly damaged on the
beach below.

<P>
Steve Twaits, watch manager at Brixham Coastguard, said, "It is
quite extraordinary that the woman was conscious after such a fall
and was able to dial 999 from her mobile phone."

<HEADLINE> Drumcree Parade Banned Again in N.Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The Northern Ireland Parades
Commission on Tuesday again refused to allow Portadown Orange
Lodge to march along the mainly nationalist Garvaghy Road on
Sunday, 11 July.
</P>
<P>
The lodge has been applying to parade on the road every Sunday
since last year's controversial Drumcree march was re-routed.
</P>
<P>
But Portadown Orangemen spokesman David Jones said he is
confident the parade will eventually take place.
</P>
<P>
"It must be borne in mind, this time last year, we had just
arrived on the hill," BBC quoted him as saying. "However, this
year we have already been out on the hill for 12 months so really
we are on day 367 and I think now they have got to realize that
the parade may go down in the future."
</P>
<P>
The Orange Order remains in touch with British Prime Minister
Tony Blair, but as yet has received no definite indication that
Portadown District will be allowed to parade.
</P>
<P>
Orangemen are still maintaining a protest at Drumcree following
a Parades Commission decision to ban them from marching down the
Garvaghy Road on 4 July.
</P>
<P>
Minor scuffles erupted on Monday night between loyalists and
the security forces with six policemen being injured. Two people
were arrested and a heavy security presence remains. However, the
Orange Order has said it remains happy about the way the protest
is being conducted.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday the commission issued determinations covering a
number of parades over the busiest period of the marching calendar
10-15 July. The vast majority of hundreds of parades will take
place exactly as notified by the organisers, but a few have had
conditions imposed.

<HEADLINE> IMF Praises Peru for Maintaining Macroeconomic Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) Tuesday commended the authorities of Peru for their efforts
to maintain macroeconomic stability and pursue reforms in the face
of the deteriorating external environment.
</P>
<P>
"Executive directors welcomed the authorities' overall strong
record of prudent economic management throughout this decade,
which had been reflected in the impressive strides made toward the
creation of conditions for sustained noninflationary growth and
current account viability, as well as progress in poverty
alleviation," the IMF said in its annual review of the Peruvian
economy.
</P>
<P>
However, over the last 12 to 18 months, a number of external
shocks, including the EI Nino weather phenomenon, had adversely
affected the country's economic performance. As a result, the real
gross domestic product (GDP) growth slowed to 0.7 percent in 1998,
and the fiscal position shifted from balance to a deficit of 0.5
percent of GDP as weak economic activity restrained tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
The government's economic program for 1999 assumes a 3 percent
growth in real GDP and envisages inflation during the year of 6
percent, a decline in the external current account deficit, and a
moderate accumulation of net international reserves that would
keep gross international reserves in the range of 11-12 months of
imports of goods and services.
</P>
<P>
The IMF welcomed the authorities's intention to give emphasis
to the government's structural reform agenda.
</P>
<P>
It also noted that the flexible exchange rate system had helped
the economy adjust to external shocks, and supported the
authorities' intention to continue with such a system.

<HEADLINE> British Prime Minister Aims for "Enterprise Culture" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 6 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
on Tuesday unveiled a 50m pounds fund to back budding
entrepreneurs, saying that "years of snobbery" in the UK against
those seeking to make money had to end if the economy was to
thrive in the future.
</P>
<P>
Both the Tory elite and the traditional Labour Party "showed a
certain snobbery towards people who had an idea, developed it and
went out and made money," Blair said. "Too often in Britain, if
people saw someone with money, they were jealous of them, whereas
in the US they wanted to emulate them."
</P>
<P>
"The left regarded them as anti-social. When we should have
been hugely proud of our successful entrepreneurs, we tended
simply to wait until they fell flat on their faces and if possible
helped them do it," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I want this government to be the champion of entrepreneurs,"
he said. "We need society as a whole to applaud you - you are the
front-line troops of Britain's new economy."
</P>
<P>
The 50m pounds funding would be spread among the regional
development agencies. Proposals are being invited for the design
and running of the funds which would invest money in businesses -
providing what is known as venture capital, according to a BBC
report.
</P>
<P>
By bringing in public finance, the aim is to encourage private
individuals or firms to invest some of their venture capital funds
in the sort of small, high-risk firms which they might otherwise
shun.
</P>
<P>
Blair said the fund had to build on, rather than duplicate,
existing sources of funding from banks and existing venture
capital funds.
</P>
<P>
In the speech to the British Venture Capital Association
conference in London, Blair promised that the next Budget would
include "new incentives for corporate venturing".
</P>
<P>
Also, he urged pension funds "to examine whether they and other
institutional investors are being too cautious when it comes to
venture capital and investing in early-stage companies".

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Middle East Peace Train Ready to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 6 (Xinhua) -- After three years of delay and
derailment, the Middle east peace process was ready to restart in
full gear Tuesday after Israeli new Prime Minister Ehud Barak
officially assumed office.
</P>
<P>
As expected, the Israeli Knesset (Parliament) voted 75-29,
with 11 abstention, to approve the Barak's government, which
controls 75 seats in the 120-member house. The 18 cabinet
ministers from the seven coalition parties were sworn in after
the parliamentary approval.
</P>
<P>
While presenting his cabinet to the Knesset, Barak pledged to
work for a comprehensive peace with all Arab neighbors of Israel
and to give same priorities to peace process on the Palestinian
and the Syrian tracks.
</P>
<P>
One of the most-decorated soldiers in Israel, Barak began his
speech by citing his 35 years of military career to explain his
motivation to make peace.
</P>
<P>
"I called on all regional leaders to take our outstretched
hand and to make a peace of the brave in the area," he said.
</P>
<P>
In an apparent bid to ease fears of the Palestinians and
Syrians that they might be played against each other while he
resumed the stalled peace talks, the ex-army chief said peace with
Syria and the Palestinians are "equally vital" to Israel.
</P>
<P>
"The reaching of a permanent agreement with the Palestinians
and the achieving of peace with Syria and Lebanon are equally
vital and urgent in my eyes," he said.
</P>
<P>
After winning the May election, Barak and Syrian President
Hafez al-Assad have heaped praise on each other and exchanged
messages of readiness through indirect channels to resume the
peace talks, which was frozen three years ago.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Barak said his government was determined to
advance negotiations with Syria quickly.
</P>
<P>
"The new government of Israel is determined to advance
negotiations as quickly as possible to achieve a full bilateral
agreement on peace and security based on (U.N.) Security Council
resolutions 242 and 338," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. resolutions called on Israel to withdraw from Arab
territories Israel seized in the 1967 Middle East war, including
the Golan Heights of Syria.
</P>
<P>
Israel never entered official negotiations with Syria during
the three years of government of former hard-line prime minister
Benjamin Netanyau because he opposes territorial concession over
the Golan.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians, who have expressed concern that Barak might
give priority to the Syrian talks and thus leave them behind, got
relieved when Barak said he would "give no priority" to any of
the two tracks.
</P>
<P>
"I want to work with the elected Palestinian leadership headed
by Yasser Arafat in a friendship and partnership in order to
achieve a proper co-existence," he said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat welcomed Barak's remarks in Gaza, saying he is ready to
work with Barak to achieve the "peace of the brave."
</P>
<P>
Observers said the goodwill of the Israeli and the Arab sides,
together with the fact that Barak will conduct talks
simultaneously with the Palestinians and the Syrians, will help
the peace process move quickly.
</P>
<P>
By setting a one-year time frame for an Israeli withdrawal from
south Lebanon, he actually set a timetable for the Israeli-Syrian
talks because no agreement could be reached without including a
deal with Damascus, the main power-broker in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and the Syrians might actually compete in the
running in order not to be left behind, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The United States, which is enthusiastic over the victory of
the moderate Barak, has promised to do everything it can to help
move forward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Barak talked with U.S. President Bill Clinton Monday night on
the phone and said Tuesday that he will visit Washington soon,
calling U.S. mediation role "vital" for the peacemaking.
</P>
<P>
This atmosphere, together with the fact that Barak has secured
one of the widest parliamentary majority in Israel in years, will
add fuel to the peace train.
</P>
<P>
Waiting anxiously for almost 50 days since Barak's election
victory, the Arab nations, as well as the international
community, are waiting to see the peace train start toward
bringing the Middle East into a peaceful 2lst century.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: S. Leone Peace Process, Finally at </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Five African presidents and still
more high- ranking officials Tuesday gathered and may stay up far
into the night in Togolese capital Lome to try to give the
marathon styled Sierra Leone peace process a finial push.
</P>
<P>
Among the presidents to attend the mini-summit on Sierra Leone
peace are Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, Burkinabe
President Blaise Compaore, Liberian President Charles Taylor,
Sierra Leonean President Tejan Kabbah and their host Togolese
President Gnassingbe Eyadema.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the Sierra Leone rebel leader Foday Sankoh, who has
already been in Lome for quite a long time for the peace talks,
one of the top commanders of the rebel troops also flew in Tuesday
to participate in the summit.
</P>
<P>
The summit was called upon by Eyadema, Togolese President and
current Chairman of the Economic Community of the West Africa
States (ECOWAS), at a critical moment of the Sierra Leone peace
Process.
</P>
<P>
After six week's negotiations, both sides have reached
agreement upon the framework of a peace plan, but remain
considerably different over many sticky points, which, if left
unresolved, might still ruin what has been hardly earned.
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough appeared in the talks last week when the
Sierra Leonean government accepted, though reluctantly, the
power-sharing demand of the rebels and offered four ministerial
posts in a four-year transitional government to them.
</P>
<P>
Though rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF) leader Sankoh
expressed his satisfaction at the first place, the People's War
Council, an organization of the rebels' field commanders rejected
the offer by demanding at least seven cabinet posts and a
vice-president position.
</P>
<P>
The rebels also made clear recently they are opposed to the
continued presence in Sierra Leone of the Nigeria-led ECOMOG
force, which has been fighting the rebels alongside the Kabbah
government.
</P>
<P>
The rebels also have doubts over the government's pledged
amnesty plan.
</P>
<P>
Recently many international human rights groups vehemently
accused them of systematically killing thousands of people, raping
and mutilating many others in the their decade-long war to gain
power.
</P>
<P>
These accusations have deepened the rebels' fears.
</P>
<P>
The mini-summit is geared to clear the hurdle, said Togolese
Foreign Minister Joseph Kokou Koffigoh, an active broker in the
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Asked if a peace pact could be signed at the summit, Koffigoh
said: "If things progress well, it's possible."
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leonean President Kabbah also expressed high hopes for
peace on the eve of his departure for Lome, though in an address
to the nation late Monday he admitted the talks with the rebels
had made him unpopular with some Sierra Leoneans.
</P>
<P>
"I am sure many of you believe that the government has given
the RUF far too much already and the RUF has given very little or
nothing at all," Kabbah said.
</P>
<P>
But he added: "I have no doubt you will agree with me after so
much pain and sufferings, after so much destruction of life and
property, we need to exercise patience and persevere in our search
for a lasting peace."
</P>
<P>
The RUF has fought successive governments in Sierra Leone since
1991. The rebels almost took capital Freetown in a devastating
attack in January, which was finally defeated by the west African
peace-keeping force ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
The chances of a deal in Lome have been boosted by the expected
presence of Liberian President Taylor and Burkinabe President
Compaore, both of whom have been accused in the region of backing
the rebels.
</P>
<P>
They deny any official assistance to the rebels but Taylor, a
former warlord in Liberia's seven-year conflict that ended in
1997, acknowledges past friendship with the RUF leadership.

<HEADLINE> Libya Demands Lifting of Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Libya Tuesday demanded the
United Nations lift its seven-year sanctions against the north
African nation, saying that it had surrendered the two Libyans
accused of the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am airliner over the Scottish
town of Lockerbie.
</P>
<P>
"The politicalization of this legal dispute, in whatever form
or by anyone, is not acceptable," Libyan permanent representative
to the United Nations Abuzed Omar Dorda said in his nine-page
letter to the 15-nation Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The letter came as the Security Council is to meet on a Friday
report by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who said that Libya
had complied with many demands set in the Security Council
resolution, but he was unable to make a recommendation on lifting
the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Dorda said Libya's assurance, taken in connection
with the handover and his country's renunciation of terrorism were
enough to justify the permanent lifting measures now.
</P>
<P>
Annan, in his report, said that Libya had pledged many times to
cooperate with the trial and pay compensation if the two suspects
were convicted, but acknowledged that he couldn't report on
Libya's actual compliance on those points because the trial had
not taken place.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.N. chief said that the United States needed more
evidence before it would agree to lift the sanctions, mainly
because the trial of the two suspects would not kick off before
February 2000.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions, which include an air and arms embargo and a ban
on some oil equipment, were suspended on April 5, when Tripoli
surrendered for trial before a Scottish court in the Netherlands
the two Libyan suspects, who were accused of the bombing of Pan Am
Flight 103 over Lockerbie. A total of 270 people were killed in
the explosion, and 189 of them were Americans.

<HEADLINE> Aircraft Carrier Roosevelt Back to Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen has ordered the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt to
take the place of the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk in the Persian
Gulf, the Pentagon said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Roosevelt is due to arrive in the Gulf by this weekend,
Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon said. The carrier has been in the
Mediterranean since April as part of the NATO force that staged
barbarous bombing against Yugoslavia for 11 weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Roosevelt and its battle group originally were assigned
to the Gulf but were diverted when the NATO air bombing broke
out.
</P>
<P>
The Kitty Hawk then rushed to the Gulf in April to fill the
gap left by the Roosevelt. The Kitty Hawk will be back in Asia
within a few weeks, officials here said.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Approves Loan to Turk Eximbank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank approved Tuesday
253.5 million U.S. dollars to finance an Export Financial
Intermediation Loan (EFIL) to the Turk Eximbank, backed by a
guarantee from the government of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turk Eximbank will on-lend the proceeds of this loan to private
exporters through eligible participating private banks, the World
Bank said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The EFIL will provide short- and medium-term working capital
and investment finance to private exporting enterprises to assist
the Turkish exporting sector, hurt by the recent global financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The loan will also enable a strategic dialogue and close
interaction with the major banks and the Bankers Association in
Turkey. This will be accomplished through setting up a stricter
and upgraded prudential eligibility criteria and banking standards
for capital adequacy, foreign exchange exposure, connected and
insider lending, and risk management systems, the World Bank said.
</P>
<P>
The loan will also further institutional development of the
Turk Eximbank itself as an efficient and professionally-run export
finance institution/export credit agency.
</P>
<P>
The loan has a maturity of seven years, including a three-year
grace period, at the bank's LIBOR-based single-currency rate for
U.S. dollars.

UNITED NATIONS, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council

<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees (UNHCR) will intensify demining work in Kosovo
beginning this week, the UNHCR office here said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Some experts who had experience in Cambodia and Mozambique,
including 30 Cambodians, are joining the teams that will fan out
in Kosovo as activities expand.
</P>
<P>
Priority areas include Pristina, Urosevac, Prizren, Suva Reka,
Djakovica, Pec, Podujevo, Gnjilane and Glogovac.
</P>
<P>
The Cambodians will head for Pec, a team of 30 Norwegian
experts will be sent to cover Prizen and Suva Reka, while Handicap
International is fielding two dog teams in Djakovica.
</P>
<P>
Seven clearance teams of Germany have been in Pristina,
Urosevac and Gnjilane, while other teams are preparing to move
out, depending on the results of the assessment survey.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. mine action program will be undertaken in three
phrases in support of the UNHCR's repatriation plan, which started
under a precondition that refugees are safe when they arrive in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
In the first phrase, called Preliminary Phase, key activities
include mine awareness training for refugees, a rapid assessment
of the mine threat, and the establishment of mine actions
coordination centers.
</P>
<P>
In the second phrase, called Emergency Phases, key activities
include verification and survey, mine clearance of houses and key
installations.
</P>
<P>
The third phrase is Consolidation Phase with key activities
focusing on re-evaluating objectives and activities.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR Monday said that 40 incidents involving landmines or
explosives had taken place last week when refugees traveled back
to Kosovo, causing some people wounded.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Threatens Russia Over Possible Arms Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The United States Tuesday
threatened Russia with suspension of American aid if Moscow should
sell more weapons to Syria.
</P>
<P>
The State Department made the point publicly as Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad visited Moscow for the first time since
the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Assad was seeking to renew ties with Russia and
acquire new weapons for Syria's defense.
</P>
<P>
"In terms of arms sales... we would be very concerned about any
new Russian arms sales to Syria," State Department deputy
spokesman James Foley said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that under U.S. law, Washington would stop any
assistance to Russia for its sale of weapons to Syria.
</P>
<P>
Despite the warning, Foley said Assad's visit could be a
"positive" event "if the aim is to try to build momentum for the
Middle East peace process."
</P>
<P>
The United States last April slapped sanctions on three Russian
companies for supplying anti-tank weapons to Syria.
</P>
<P>
Russian officials have argued that they consider Syria to be
the same as any other country and thus have a right to sell arms
to it.

<HEADLINE> Italy Gains Little Foreign Investment For Lack of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The lack of a modern, well-trained
workforce is the primary reason Italy lags behind other European
nations in attracting foreign investments, according to an Italian
Senate study released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
To attract foreign companies, Italy must open up its business
practices, liberalize its markets, but most of all, modernize its
workforce, the study said.
</P>
<P>
Leonardo Caponi, president of the Italian Senate's Industry
Committee, focused on the findings of the study, said Tuesday that
the high cost of labor is a problem, but "decisively more
important is the quality of the work force and the offer of
services for training and qualification."
</P>
<P>
Italian Industry Minister Pierluigi Bersani said that 1,600
branches of multi-national companies employing 500,000 Italians,
have produced 210 trillion lire (116 billion U.S. dollars) of
output, but added that Italy still lags behind Europe in
attracting foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
"We are behind in this field for the same reason we are behind
in the process of internationalization of our own companies,"
Bersani said.
</P>
<P>
"It's necessary to move ahead the process of liberalization and
privatization both to attract foreign capital and to see our
system of business grow," he said.

<HEADLINE> Russians Clean Sweep Women's Gymnastic Titles at Universiade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PALMA, Spain, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The Russian women gymnasts
headed by Olympic champion Svetlana Khorkina, made a clean sweep
of six gold medals at stake the gymnastic competitions concluded
at the 20th World University Games here Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
Khorkina, the all-around Olympic champion, entertained the
Palma audience and the judges with her elegant moves in a soft and
gentle music background to win the last event of the floor
exercise, scoring a title winning score of 9.775 points.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the women's team title and her ealier all-around
crown, the 1.68-meter Russian also triumphed in the uneven bars by
executing a wide-open flurent routine for a day-high 9.800 points.
</P>
<P>
"I am really happy to win the gold medals and it's surely out
of my expectation," said the sole four-time champion in the on-
going University Games, which are being smeared by insufficent
transportation and media services.
</P>
<P>
Her compatriot Elena Produnova struck gold in the other two
women's individual events by scoring 9.562 and 9.700 points from
the vault and beam respectively.
</P>
<P>
With 19-year-old Nikolai Krioukov took two golds out of six men
's apparatuses, the Russian gymnasts collected a lion's share of
eight gold medals out of the 14 gymnastic titles at stake.
</P>
<P>
Krioukov came out last in the hirozontal bar but scored the
best of 9.675 points after he triumphed first in the parallel bars
with 9.700 points.
</P>
<P>
Belarus took two men's individual golds through Vitali
Rudnitski in the floor exercise with 9.625 points and Ivan Ivankov
in the rings with 9.800.
</P>
<P>
While the other two gold medals were split by Romania and Cuba
as Marius Daniel Urzica choked up the first gold for Romania by
scoring 9.750 points from the pommel horse and Abel Driggs of Cuba
was awarded the crown in the vault with 9.625 points.
</P>
<P>
China, a gymnastic powerhouse but represented here with a
second-string squad, was denied its first gold medal as Dong Zhen
who scored 9.800 from the rings in the team competition, was only
awarded 9.750 points despite his clearly better performance, said
gymnastic expert Gao Jian, chef de mission of the Chinese sports
delegation.
</P>
<P>
"However, we don't want to complain anything and we have to
find the solution to the dire fact that the Chinese gymnasts,
especially the women, are unable to keep their forms for a longer
period whenever they are getting older," said Gao Jian.
</P>
<P>
"We're a little bit pity that our gymnasts failed to win any
single gold medal," said Chinese coach Pan Chenfei. "But it's
understandable for several reasons."
</P>
<P>
While other gymnasts powers have all sent in their best
athletes to Palma, China only fielded in its second-string squads
despite some namesakes of world titles, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Besides, the gymnastic competitions is usually prone to
mistakes and is also judged subjectively without clear criteria
which even allow a critical margin of some 0.400 points,"
explained coach Pan.
</P>
<P>
Liu Xuan, China's other bet for gold medal, dropped twice from
her speciality of the beam wherein she was crowned in the 1998
World Cup.
</P>
<P>
As the gymnasts are backing away from Palma, the Russians
collected eight golds, leaving only six to the others whereas
Belarussians took two, and Romania, Cuba, Japan and Ukraine had
one apiece.

PALMA, Spain, July 6 (Xinhua) -- A cramp on his calf failed to
hinder Wang Feng from capturing China's first gold when he
somersaulted to win the men's one-meter springboard title in the
20th World University Games here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Wang, 20, capped his performance with his final dive, a tucked
backward two and a half somersaults which earned him a field-high
score of 77.520 points.
</P>
<P>
Leading all the way, Wang finally garnered 402.60 points for
the gold, also the first of China in the Games.
</P>
<P>
Philippe Comtois of Canada won the silver with 377.88 points
and Dean Pullar of Australia was third in 358.86.
</P>
<P>
"The field was rather strong, and fortunately I brought out my
best," Wang said after the victory.
</P>
<P>
He grimaced in the semi-finals when his left calf suddenly
suffered from cramp. His coach Zhong Shaozhen massaged his
suffered leg and told him to concentrate on the competition.
</P>
<P>
"As the competition was held at night in the open air, the
temperature fall caused his cramp, and I just advised him to hold
on," Zhong said.
</P>
<P>
"At this juncture, we should try to win the gold at any cost,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
China's diving juggernauts just cranked up with his win, Wang
said. "We at least can win three other golds, in men's three-
meter springboard, women's platform and three-meter springboard,"

LONDON, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The organizers of Wimbledon may
decide to move the tournament to the first two weeks of July in
order to avoid rain delays, according to local newspaper The
Guardian on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The change could happen by 2002, with Chris Gorringe, chief
executive of the All England Club, quoted as saying the move would
allow a bigger gap between the French Open and Wimbledon, which
are only two weeks apart.
</P>
<P>
This year's Wimbledon fell 150 matches behind schedule because
of rain affected days and players such as India's Leander Paes had
to play three matches on the final Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A move would also mean that players could prepare for the
championship by playing an extra tournament during the build-up.
</P>
<P>
At present, the grasscourt season is restricted to events in
the two weeks preceding Wimbledon and then the two weeks of the
championship.

<HEADLINE> Chile Worries About Pinochet's Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Chilean Foreign Minister Juan
Gabriel Valdes said Tuesday the Chilean government has information
that shows the health of lifetime Senator Augusto Pinochet is
deteriorating on a daily basis.
</P>
<P>
After studying the results of the latest examinations, Valdes
did not rule out the possibility of requesting the release of
Pinochet on humanitarian grounds, since his health may deteriorate
to a dangerous level.
</P>
<P>
He said that President Eduardo Frei indicated on May 21 that he
would like the senator to return to Chile.
</P>
<P>
The 83-year-old Pinochet was arrested in October in London at
the request of Spanish judge Baltasar Garzon, who wants to try him
for human rights violations against Chilean Spaniards during 1973-
1990 when he was in office as president.
</P>
<P>
President Frei has tried to get Pinochet freed, arguing that
Garzon's request infringes upon Chile's sovereignty, for foreign
courts have no jurisdiction over Chilean ex-leaders.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Govt Steps up Anti-Corruption Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has step
up the anti-corruption campaign, uncovering more than 3,025 cases
of corruption involving 7.21 trillion rupiah (1.07 billion U.S.
dollars) in state funds during the 1998/1999 fiscal year ending
last March.
</P>
<P>
Coordinating Minister for Development Supervision and State
Administrative Reforms Hartarto said after a meeting with
President B.J. Habibie here on Tuesday that 594 corruption cases
were at the prosecution stage, while thousands of others were
still under investigation.
</P>
<P>
Hartarto, who leads the national drive against corruption,
nepotism and cronyism, Justice Minister/State Secretary Muladi and
acting Attorney General Ismudjoko and Minister of Information
Muhammad Yunus reported to Habibie on the progress of the
anti-corruption campaign.
</P>
<P>
They also briefed the president on the measures that have been
and would be taken to prevent and manage corruption in government
offices and state companies, according to national newspapers
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Elaborating on strategic efforts to combat corruption, Muladi
said Habibie enacted on Tuesday four government regulations and
one decree to guide the enforcement of Law No.28/1999 on Good
Governance. The law will come into effect on November 20.
</P>
<P>
"The Presidential decree will set up a commission in charge of
keeping the records of and auditing the assets of government
officials. The commission will start working on May 20, 2000,"
Muladi said.
</P>
<P>
From this date, all government officials would be required to
declare and report their personal assets to the commission and to
have their assets audited by the commission, he said.
</P>
<P>
Muladi said the law also encouraged public participation in the
drive against corruption by legally protecting people who reported
the conduct of officials.
</P>
<P>
On former president Soeharto corruption probe, acting Attorney
General Ismudjoko said his office was still investigating the case
and focusing on the misuse of state-owned funds by several charity
foundations once led by Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
"Another focus is the abuse of power by the former president.
For example the policy of exempting a certain industry from the
obligation to pay taxes according to existing regulations," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Under Soeharto, who was forced down in May last year, corrupt,
collusive and nepotistic practices flourished in the country, The
Indonesian Observer said.

<HEADLINE> Archeologists Discover Ancient Tomb in Jiangxi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Archeologists recently unearthed a
tomb dating to the Southern dynasties (420-589 A.D.) in Ganzhou,
east China's Jiangxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists surmise that the tomb, which is seven meters long
and 1.91 meters wide, was built for a wealthy businessman. The
tomb was constructed of 10,000 bricks with varying designs and the
structure's semi-spherical roof can easily bear the weight of an
automobile local source said.
</P>
<P>
Excavation work has led to the recovery of two bronze and
porcelain pieces.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists note that the tomb reflects the high standard of
construction skills and burial practices during the dynasty.

<HEADLINE> Kazakhstan Hopes to Further Develop Relations With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan treasures its close
relations with China and sees great potential in developing them
in the next century, Kazakh Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign
Minister Kasymzhomart Kemelevich Tokayev said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a written reply to questions by Xinhua correspondents,
Tokayev said he is scheduled to visit China on July 7-15 to
discuss with Chinese leaders ways to strengthen bilateral
cooperation in the short and long run, especially in the economic
and trade area, and to exchange views on regional and
international issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
He said his tour is in preparation of the autumn visit to China
by Kazakh President Nursultan Abishevich Nazarbayev, expressing
confidence that the president's visit is sure to give a new
impetus to the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Tokayev recalled frequent high-level meetings between the two
countries in the past few years as well as their active contacts
in various fields, which have strongly promoted bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China is Kazakhstan's biggest trading partner in
Asia with an annual trade volume of 500 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister praised Sino-Kazakh cooperation in
maintaining regional security, saying that the summit mechanism
between China, Kazakhstan, Russia, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan plays
an important role in maintaining the security and stability of
Asia and even the world.
</P>
<P>
The five countries signed an agreement on strengthening
military confidence in border areas in 1996 and another one on
reducing military forces in border areas in 1997. These documents,
Tokayev said, "are unprecedented" in international relations.
</P>
<P>
He said the agreement between Kazakhstan and China on their
border line has solved the most complicated problems in their
relations and set an example for other countries of resolving
border disputes in a civilized manner.

<HEADLINE> Nicaragua Cancels Central American Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The Nicaraguan government has
canceled the Central American Summit scheduled for next week, due
to tension with Costa Rica, local reports said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Nicaragua was to pass the pro tempore
presidency of the Central American Integration Secretariat to
Costa Rica in line with the six-month rotational presidency
agreement, whereby its five member countries share the presidency.
</P>
<P>
Nicaraguan President Arnoldo Aleman was quoted Tuesday by the
media here as saying that there still lack the correct conditions
for the summit, adding that his regional counterparts understand
the situation.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Nicaraguan Public Security Minister Juan Rafael
Lizano lodged strong protests against Costa Rica in a declaration
in which he said Aleman had threatened to kill any Costa Rican
police who carried arms on the San Juan River border.
</P>
<P>
The transit rights along the San Juan river are the most
contentious issue between the two countries. The present treaties
give Nicaragua sovereignty over the waterway, but also grant Costa
Rica the right of free transit.
</P>
<P>
However, the implementation of the right has become a
disputable political problem, as Nicaragua considers that this
right of free transit is given only for commercial purposes, and
not for the transit of armed guards.
</P>
<P>
The Costa Rican Foreign Ministry has maintained silent over
protests from Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Costa Rican police removed 300 families from the
Costa Rican capital, many of which were Nicaraguan immigrants, and
expelled 33 Nicaraguans.
</P>
<P>
The Costa Rican Foreign Ministry said it believes there are
some 600,000 Nicaraguans residing in Costa Rica, the majority of
whom are undocumented.

<HEADLINE> Slovakian Economic Growth Slows Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The growth of Slovakian economy has
apparently slowed down since the beginning of this year, giving
the country a very difficult time.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent report by the National Statistics Bureau,
Slovakia's gross domestic product (GDP) in the first three months
was 178.2 billion crown (about 4.1 billion U.S. dollars), a meager
1.8 percent hike over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Being the slowest growing period in five years, the target of
three percent GDP increase set for 1999 will surely not be
realized. Economists expect the figure to go below one percent.
</P>
<P>
The Slovakian economy enjoyed a high increase between 1995-97
when its GDP growth rate registered at least six percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the year 1998 witnessed a bad turn, with GDP growth
rate dropping to 4.4 percent. At the same time, the country began
facing big deficits in the national finance and foreign trade, as
well as high foreign debts, devaluation of crown and sliding of
the industrial and agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
Now the country has already taken measures to stop the economic
situation from worsening, such as giving up the seven-month-old
zero taxation system on June 1 and collecting seven percent tax to
all imports, with an aim of quick recovery.

<HEADLINE> Chief of U.N. Military Advisors Arrives in E. Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Chief of the United Nations
Military Advisors for the August direct vote in East Timor Brig.
Gen. Rezagul Haider arrived in Dili, capital of East Timor, on
Tuesday along with 15 other personnel.
</P>
<P>
"The military advisors will be deployed at the UNAMET (United
Nations Assistance Mission for East Timor) offices in 13
districts," UNAMET spokesman Ueki Yashuiro was quoted by Antara
News Agency Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Countries contributing military advisors to UNAMET include
Bangladesh, Australia, Malaysia, Denmark and Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Philippines Ambassador to Indonesia Leonides T. Caday who
recently visited East Timor said the Philippines government is
obliged to participate in UNAMET and assist Indonesia in the
popular consultation process.
</P>
<P>
A total of 16 Filipinos are now involved in UNAMET's operation,
including six with civilian police, while 10 are U.N. staff
members, mostly in charge of administrative matters.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed by Indonesia, Portugal and the U.N.
on May 5, the U.N. will send civilian police advisers from several
countries to assist Indonesian police in maintaining law and
order.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. is fielding a mission of 900, including 270 civilian
police, 50 military officers and hundreds of electoral officials
and administrators to East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's Foreign Minister Ali Alatas Tuesday stated that
according to the tripartite agreement in New York, there is no
plan to deploy U.N. troops to East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Speculation on the possibility of the U.N. deploying a
peacekeeping force to East Timor was raised following Sunday's
attack on U.N. staff and volunteers in the territory.
</P>
<P>
Although violence and attacks often take place in East Timor,
Alatas explained that the U.N. is yet to declare the territory as
insecure.
</P>
<P>
The government would continue to strive for a conducive climate
for the direct ballot in East Timor scheduled for August 22, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The ballot will allow the territory's people to choose whether
their homeland should become an autonomous region within Indonesia
or totally independent.
</P>
<P>
The former Portuguese colony of East Timor was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976 in a move never recognized by the U.N., which
still considers Portugal as the administering power of the
territory.

<HEADLINE> Asia to Be Awarded Half World Cup Berth, Says Blatter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Asia has been granted a play-off
slot against a European team that could see their contingent
boosted to five at the 2002 World Cup, Sepp Blatter, president of
soccer's world governing body FIFA, confirmed in Los Angeles on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Japan and South Korea, as co-hosts in the first World Cup to be
staged in Asia, automatically each qualify for a place but Asian
football chiefs had been dismal that only two more countries would
win a spot under the original plans.
</P>
<P>
Following two days of meetings of FIFA's Executive Committee,
Blatter said UEFA president Lennart Johansson agreed to have the
14th-placed team in European qualifiers play off with the fifth-
placed team in Asian qualifiers for the final berth in the World
Cup. The defending champions France will qualify automatically.
</P>
<P>
The move should avert a threatened boycott of qualifying by the
Asian Football Confederation (AFC).
</P>
<P>
But Johansson's offer needs to be approved by the UEFA
Executive Committee set for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"If Europe dose not agree, Asia will have to maintain its
current position to reconsider its participation in 2002 (
qualifying)," FIFA vice-president and South Korean Football
Association president Chung Moon-joon was quoted as saying. "It's
not easy to be optimistic."
</P>
<P>
AFC general secretary Peter Velappan expressed his happiness.
"I myself am personally satisfied with the magnanimous offer,"
Velappan was quoted as saying. "I have to take the word of the
FIFA president," he said.
</P>
<P>
The AFC also had to approve the deal and discuss the matter
with its 45 delegates on Thursday, one day prior to FIFA's
Extraordinary Congress, according to Velappan.
</P>
<P>
Last December, FIFA allocated the 32 berths for 2002 Finals
among the six regional confederations. Europe received the same
number of berths of 15 it had in 1998, and CONCACAF and Africa
were also awarded their same 1998 allocations of three and five.
</P>
<P>
South America had it reduced from five to 4 1-2, requiring it
to play the Oceania champion for a fifth berth. For 1998, the
Oceania champion was required to play the fourth-placed team from
Asia, which resulted in Iran beating Australia.
</P>
<P>
Asia's allotment went from 3 1-2 to four. But it's allocation
included the first-ever co-hosts, Japan and South Korea, leaving
Asia's 43 other members to fight it out for two remaining berths.
</P>
<P>
The AFC wishes to have three guaranteed places in addition to
automatic qualifiers Japan and South Korea, and threatened to
boycott qualifying, while allowing Japan and South Korea to
participate in the finals, if its demand was not met.
</P>
<P>
But Velappan later said it would accept a half berth.

on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, unveiled an reorganization plan
Tuesday to overhaul its property rights as well as business
portfolios by registering a new-face corporation which will
eventually take over the mother company, China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time a large non-state-owned high-tech company
clearly defined its operators' property rights, which used to be
totally under State ownership.
</P>
<P>
"The central goal of Stone's reorganization is to enable the
company's operators to truly play their role in offering high
level stimuli and exercising final control over growth," Duan
Yongji, president and CEO of Stone, was quoted by the newspaper as
saying.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to avoid disputes over the quantitative
distribution of the stock assets, the group has registered a new
entity, Beijing Stone Investment Corp, which distributed the group
's property rights to its 616 employees. Among them, Duan will
personally have the highest share, 7.2 percent, of the new company.
</P>
<P>
Stone Investment will raise funds and purchase the main
existing information technology businesses of the Stone Group,
including electronics, electrical engineering and system
integration.
</P>
<P>
"After buying over the mother company, Stone Investment will be
listed at home or abroad within two years," said Duan.
</P>
<P>
Duan and other founders of the Stone Group started from scratch
in 1984 with a loan of 20,000 yuan (about dlrs 2,410).
</P>
<P>
Fifteen years have passed and Stone has become one of the
country's largest IT company, emerging as a red chip company along
with China Telecom and Legend Group in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"It's urgent to initiate creative measures which can combine
the personal interests of managers and engineers with the company'
s performance in the IT industry, which focuses on talent
competition," Duan said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Expels 33 Athletes From SEA Squad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's National Sports Council
(KONI) has decided to expel 33 athletes from its original 448-
strong team for the 20th Southeast Asian (SEA) Games in Brunei
Darussalam next month, due to the athletes' poor show during pre-
Games training.
</P>
<P>
Mochammad Hindarto, a KONI official in charge of the athletes
development program, said 11 track and field athletes, four female
squash players and 18 female field hockey players had been
expelled after a discussion between KONI and sports organizations
concerned.
</P>
<P>
Hindarto said that the attendants of the discussion predicted
that that the 415-strong team was expected to win some 65 to 70
gold medals at the Games.
</P>
<P>
"But sports organizations' officials were low-keyed on their
targets and said they could win 58 golds at the most," he was
quoted by The Jakarta Post Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Hindarto said that 12 of the 20 sports were expected to strike
gold, including track and field, badminton, billiards and snooker,
boxing, cycling, karate, pencak silat, swimming, table tennis,
taekwondo, tennis and traditional boat racing.
</P>
<P>
Such other sports as basketball, bowling, golf, hockey,
shooting, soccer, sepak takraw and squash could hope for bronze
medals.
</P>
<P>
KONI also urged the Badminton Association of Indonesia (PBSI)
to include men's singles player Taufik Hidayat in the SEA Games
squad.
</P>
<P>
"We have difficulties earning gold in Brunei. If our shuttlers
can make a clean sweep of the seven golds, why should they only
target five?" Hindarto said.
</P>
<P>
Hindarto said if PBSI fielded Taufik, Indonesia would be
hopeful of a clean sweep, as the 19-year-old player stood a good
chance of winning the men's singles and contributing to men's team
victory.
</P>
<P>
PBSI official in charge of athletes development program
Mangombar Ferdinand Siregar said Taufik needed to take a break
after his poor performance in the Sudirman Cup and World
Championships. "Taufik is focusing on the Olympics, along with
Hendrawan and Budi Santoso. PBSI has a big responsibility to win
gold at the Olympics. We'll see how he manages to overcome his
psychological barrier after both major events in the Indonesia
Open in September in Bali," Siregar said.
</P>
<P>
He said despite a strong opposition, PBSI was looking forward
to a repetition of an Indonesian clean sweep of titles two years
ago. "But we shouldn't be careless, because we have priorities in
the Olympics and Thomas and Uber Cup championships," he added.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Myanmar to Improve Unfavorable Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar, an agro-based developing
country with agriculture accounting for 35 percent of its export
value, has of late taken a series of measures to reverse the
unfavorable situation in its foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Since the outbreak of the Asian financial crisis in mid-1997,
Myanmar's export sector, which is mainly based on the export of
primary products, suffered great losses in foreign exchange
earnings.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures released by the country's Central
Statistical Organization, Myanmar's foreign trade volume,
including its border trade, amounted to 3.9615 billion U.S.
dollars in 1998, of which the import was 2.824 billion dollars
while the export reached 1.1375 billion dollars. Its trade
deficit was as high as 1.6865 billion dollars, 470 million dollars
more than the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar government has taken a series of measures to reverse
this situation. First, it designates priority goods for import and
exempts customs duties on the import of agricultural implements to
promote agricultural development. These goods include agricultural
machinery, pesticide, fertilizer, and construction materials such
as cement, steel bar, pipe, ceramic tile, iron sheet, machinery
equipment, etc.
</P>
<P>
Second, the government has increased border trade points and
simplified trade-related formalities to promote border trade. Up
to now, Myanmar has opened 12 border trade points along its
borders with China, Thailand, India and Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it shortened the period of export and import
formalities from the previous one week or one month to two days.
From February last year, the country also cut border trade service
charges to 8 percent from 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Third, the government imposed restriction on the import of
luxury goods by raising their customs duties. From February 1998,
the government raised the rate of income tax on imported goods
from 1.5 percent to 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The government encourages more use of home-made products,
giving special privileges to exporters who fetch 2 million dollars
from export earnings or above.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the Myanmar government is planning to expand the range
of export goods, add non-traditional commodities such as natural
gas in its export and increase the export quota of processed and
manufactured goods to enable export goods value-added.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the country's export in 1998 increased by 235
million dollars as compared with that in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Mayon Volcano Causes Earthquake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Mayon Volcano in the central
Philippines caused one low frequency earthquake and one high
frequency volcanic tremor for the past 24 hours, Philippine
Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A report of Phivolcs issued at 8:00 a.m. said the volcano is
still in restive condition on Tuesday with instruments of Phivolcs
detected sulfur dioxide flux of about 4,660 tons and sustained
inflationary trend along the southeast slope.
</P>
<P>
For the past 24 hours, Mayon's activity was characterize by
weak to moderate steam emission of about 100 to 150 meters from
the peak of the volcano, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Alert level one is still in effect and volcanologist warned the
public to strictly observe the 6-km Permanent Danger Zone and the
one-kilometer safety buffer zone extension in the southeast slope.
</P>
<P>
Looming over half a dozen towns in Albay Province, Mayon
erupted on June 22 without warning, releasing cauliflower-like
clouds from its crater and forcing thousands of local residents to
flee from home.
</P>
<P>
The volcano has erupted 45 times in the past 360 years with the
deadliest in 1814 buried a whole town and killed 1,200 villagers.
At least 77 people were killed in its last major eruption in 1993.

<TEXT>
<P>
SNOW DRAGON SHIP, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Snow Dragon, an
expeditionary vessel which is carrying 124 Chinese scientists and
journalists to the North Pole, has encountered problems with a
pump used to produce fresh water.
</P>
<P>
The ship's daily fresh water production capacity has dropped
from 25 to 15 tons, according to Captain Yuan Shaohong.
</P>
<P>
The Snow Dragon departed Shanghai on July 1 and the estimated
daily consumption for the voyage was set at 28 tons.
</P>
<P>
"Maintenance personnel are currently attempting to repair the
pump," Yuan said.
</P>
<P>
The Snow Dragon, an icebreaker which has completed five voyages
to the South Pole, enjoyed calm waters as it passed through the
Sea of Japan and has traveled 1,115 nautical miles since last
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The ship treats sewage prior to release and burns waste paper
in an incinerator. Other waste materials, including glass, iron
and plastic, will be returned to Shanghai for treatment, said Yuan.
</P>
<P>
The expedition, China's first scientific investigation in the
Arctic region, will last 68 days. The Snow Dragon is expected to
enter the Arctic Ocean by the middle of this month.
</P>
<P>
The expedition has attracted wide attention both at home and
abroad, with team members receiving numerous e-mail message from
overseas Chinese.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Central Bank to Issue Bonds Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's central bank, Bank
Indonesia (BI) will issue bonds again in a bid to collect funds
for the economic development in the country, BI Deputy Governor
Miranda Gultom said.
</P>
<P>
Miranda did not say how much the bank will issue, but confirmed
here Tuesday that the bonds will be with a fixed interest rate of
12 percent for five years and 14 percent for ten years in 2000.
The variable rates will be issued in 16 series, the Business News
bulletin Wednesday quoted Miranda as saying Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
There will be wider option on the capital market next year with
BI's plan to issue bonds as one of the money market instruments
which are much demanded, she stressed.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Indonesian government has issued bonds worth about
18 trillion rupiah (2.6 billion U.S. dollars). The value is too
small to create the secondary market, according to Miranda.
</P>
<P>
Concerning bank recapitalization, she expressed the confidence
that the implementation of the recapitalization program will
completely overcome the banking problem by the end of 1999.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Slashes NATO Plotted "Joint Declaration" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia strongly condemned the
UNKFOR cooked "Joint Declaration" by "Serb representative" and KLA
leader, said a state declaration here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It said that the UNKFOR forces were here to protect all ethnic
groups in Kosovo, including the Serbs. It was ridiculous for them
to appoint any "Serb representative" to speak for the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
They directed such farce only to cover the crimes committed by
the NATO invasion and Albanian terrorists. It would lead to
instability in the region and worsen refugee problems, the
declaration went on.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that permanent peace in the region would come only
when legal representatives of all ethic groups negotiate
peacefully on the base of trust and equality.
</P>
<P>
Early Tanjug reports said that Sergio Vieira de Mello, special
emissary of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to Kosovo, had
appointed a Serb priest as the "Serb representative" to sign a "
Joint Declaration" with KLA leader Hashim Thaci in Pristina early
last week.

<P>
BELGRADE, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia will finish assessing
in six months the war damages it suffered during the savage NATO
bombings from March 24 to June 9, Development, Science and
Environment Minister Jagos Zelenovic announced here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Uniform assessment sheets will soon be distributed to all legal
persons in the country's two republics, which are required to hand
in the finished sheets in two months, said Zelenovic, also leader

</P>
<P>
Assessment committees of each republic should make a

after the country announced the end of the state of war on June 24,
Zelenovic added.
</P>
<P>
During its 78-day bombings, NATO flew more than 20,000 flights,
dropped 21,000 tons of bombs and launched 1,300 missiles against
Yugoslavia, a small country of 100,000 square kilometers and 11
million people.

<HEADLINE> hke070716 -Thai Industries Well Below Production Capacity: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's industries are still
operating far below their production capacities despite optimism
shared by government agencies that the country's economy has been
on the right track of recovery, an industry ministry survey
available here Wednesday said.
</P>
<P>
Some 13 major manufacturing industries will use only about 30
to 50 percent of their total production capacity in 1999, which is
about the same as last year, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
To break even or reach economies of scale in production, one
has to use up to 70 to 80 percent of available capacity.
</P>
<P>
Producers of steel, cement and glass in the construction sector
reportedly now use only 40 percent of their available capacity, of
which 30 percent is consumed domestically while the remaining 10
percent is exported.
</P>
<P>
Shifting more of their focus to export markets, producers of
electrical appliances manage to use about 45 to 60 percent of
their capacity, a level which barely allows them to survive.
</P>
<P>
Most heavily affected are producers of automobiles and
motorcycles as they use only 9.5 percent and 24 percent of their
capacities respectively.
</P>
<P>
However, producers of all types of dairy products manage to use
65 percent of their capacity while producers of plastic and paper
products reportedly use 75 to 85 percent as their products are in
high demand by exporters for their packaging.
</P>
<P>
The main reason why producers are not using their full capacity
this year is that exported products do not fetch good prices and
competitors in the international markets have lower production
costs, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
Very few producers is expected to make profits this year and
additional investments will be curtailed for years to come, the
survey said.
</P>
<P>
Production in the industrial sector accounts for about half of
the country's gross domestic product.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition to Stage Nationwide Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's opposition alliance will
stage a dawn-to-dusk hartal (strike) across the country on
Thursday in protest against the passage in parliament of what they
said an "anti-people" budget, soaring prices of essentials and
deteriorating law and order situation.
</P>
<P>
This will be the seventh nationwide shutdown sponsored by the
opposition alliance this year.
</P>
<P>
Opposition Leader Khaleda Zia said on Tuesday that the shutdown
was aimed at delivering the people from sufferings and
safeguarding the country's independence and sovereignty through
compelling the government to resign, handing over power to a
caretaker government, The Bangladesh Observer newspaper reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The opposition alliance, comprising the Bangladesh Nationalist
Party, the Jatiya Party, the Jamaat-e-Islami and the Islami Oikya
Jote, would enforce the strike to protest the "anti-people"
budget, "conspiracy" for gas export, providing corridor (to
India), she said.
</P>
<P>
The Central Liaison Committee of the four-party alliance,
meanwhile, has also announced a fresh program to gear up the
anti-government movement.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, the four parties will observe separate
demonstrations across the country under their respective party
banner on July 16, and stage road marches from the capital city
Dhaka to different parts of the country between July 25 and 27.
</P>
<P>
Hartal is a common political phenomenon in Bangladesh, where
opposition parties call hartals to oppose the ruling party while
the latter adopts anti-hartal activities, often resulting in
clashes and causing heavy economic losses.

<HEADLINE> Vitamin A Derivative Shows Potential in Treating Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Researchers here have found
that a synthetic vitamin A derivative may form the basis for an
entirely new type of chemotherapy to help fight cancers.
</P>
<P>
Understanding how the derivative, fenretinide, works will allow
doctors to more effectively use this promising drug, said a report
in the July 7 issue of the Journal of the National Cancer
Institute. The report was authored by researchers at the Children
Hospital Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
The researchers are currently leading a clinical trial to find
the appropriate dose of fenretinide in children. The National
Cancer Institute recently approved a nationwide clinical trial to
test the anti-tumor activity of fenretinide against the childhood
cancer neuroblastoma.
</P>
<P>
Studies were made of various levels of fenretinide on the tumor
cells, including measurements of a special molecule called
ceramide. Ceramide can kill tumor cells, but researchers have not
previously found any relatively non-toxic drug that can cause
large amounts of ceramide to be made in cancer cells.
</P>
<P>
The results showed that fenretinide markedly reduced the
survival of the cancer cells even under reduced oxygen conditions.
Furthermore, fenretinide caused ceramide levels to increase up to
10-fold. The greater the amount of fenretinide used, the greater
the rise in ceramide, and the greater the amount of tumor cell
killing.
</P>
<P>
The results also showed that fenretinide could kill tumor cells
that were resistant to many common anti-cancer drugs.
</P>
<P>
The researchers suggest that combining fenretinide with other
drugs, which can specifically enhance the anti-tumor action of
ceramide, might be a powerful new way to fight cancers.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Resumes Production of Maize Meal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean millers who shut down
their plants for over two weeks have resumed full production of
staple maize meal following negotiations with the government last
week.
</P>
<P>
Misheck Nyamupingidza, chairman of the Millers' Association of
Zimbabwe, confirmed Tuesday that maize milling had resumed while
negotiations continued, the daily Herald reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said millers were "nicely negotiating" with the government
and were now waiting for communication from the Ministry of
Industry and Commerce on the best way forward.
</P>
<P>
Millers stopped production on June 22, pressing for a 61.2
percent increase in the price of maize meal. The government had
approved a 20 percent increase effective last month and another 20
percent to be effective in September.
</P>
<P>
But the millers said they could no longer mill the product
profitably due to the 88 percent increase in the floor price of
maize.
</P>
<P>
Failure to break the deadlock between the two parties resulted
in the closure of the mills last month.
</P>
<P>
To maintain viability in the industry, millers and the
government have tentatively agreed that the price of maize meal
would go up by five percent every month until December.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Economic Recovery to Sustain: MAS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's fledging economic
recovery is expected to be sustained into next year, the Monetary
Authority of Singapore (MAS) announced in its annual report
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Prospects for a sustained economic recovery into the second
half of 1999 and beyond are good," said Koh Yong Guan, managing
director of MAS, at a press conference on the 1998/1999 report.
</P>
<P>
He said that the external environment is expected to be
favorable and the policy measures taken last year in response to
the economic slowdown are beginning to take effect.
</P>
<P>
Encouraging signs for the Singapore economy were the robustness
of the U.S. economy and expectations of a soft landing there, as
well as an increase in exports from many crisis-hit economies, Koh
said.
</P>
<P>
But he cautioned that despite the favorable outlook, Singapore
was not completely out of the woods yet.
</P>
<P>
"First, the recovery is not yet across the board," said Koh.
"Although the manufacturing sector expanded by 6.5 percent in the
first quarter, construction, commerce and most financial services
remained weak."
</P>
<P>
"Second, the positive outlook hinged on continued strength in
the industrial countries and a recovery in the region," he added.
</P>
<P>
There are risk factors to watch out for, particularly a sharp
correction in the U.S. stock market, a weakening of the Japanese
yen and rising protectionist pressures, according to the annual
report.
</P>
<P>
Singapore must remain watchful of business costs even as the
economy picks up, Koh said.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister and MAS Chairman Lee Hsien Loong
announced Tuesday that the government will reassess the economy at
the end of this year to decide whether to begin restoring the
employer's Central Provident Fund contribution rate one year in
advance.
</P>
<P>
Lee also stated that the government will review its growth
forecast for this year in August as the economy is picking up
faster than expected.
</P>
<P>
The current official forecast for this year's Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) is a growth of between zero and two percent.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Chemical Plant Increases Organic Silicon Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Xinghuo Chemical Plant in east
China's Jiangxi Province recently completed trials of a
domestically designed and manufactured processing facility with an
annual production capacity of 20,000 tons of organic silicon.
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough will substantially increase China's production
of organic silicon, a high-tech chemical material widely used in
the national defense, space and aviation, electronic,
petrochemical, pharmaceutical, textile and construction sectors.
</P>
<P>
The list of only a few countries capable of producing the high-
tech product includes the United States, Japan, France and Germany.
The new facility will eliminate China's heavy reliance on imported
organic silicon products.
</P>
<P>
Xinghuo Chemical Plant is a subsidiary of China National Blue
Star Chemical Cleaning Co. which is headquartered in Beijing.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Common Australia-New Zealand Currency to Be Studied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Australia-New Zealand
Business Council will set up a high-powered committee to determine
whether a common currency for Australia and New Zealand would be
good for business.
</P>
<P>
The Dominion Wednesday quoted Council Chairman David Truscott
as saying that the group may study other common currency
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, a number of business people and economists in
New Zealand have advocated a unified currency with Australia,
saying it would bring "important benefits" to the country.
</P>
<P>
Governor Don Brash of New Zealand Reserve Bank told the
Parliament's finance and expenditure select committee in March
that there are "some important benefits in a currency union" with
Australia.
</P>
<P>
"What I'm saying is let's discuss the pros and cons with all
the benefits and all the costs on the table," he told the
committee.
</P>
<P>
Although Prime Minister Jenny Shipley has said the issue is not
on the agenda of her government, some of her cabinet ministers
have come out in favor of a debate.
</P>
<P>
"We've decided we need to do it by stages ... a lot of people
are going to jump to the end and say we're going to be the seventh
state of Australia. We want to look at the currency issues and
issues that perhaps surround that, rather than get involved in
political issues like statehood," the Wellington-based newspaper
quoted Truscott as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the progressive study will involve the business
community and interested government departments, and critics of a
common currency will be invited to participate.
</P>
<P>
Truscott is also national president and Auckland president of
the Commerce Chamber of New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, a small Wellington-based working
party will meet next week to set a study framework.

study the interaction of ice, air and sea in the Arctic Ocean as a
part of China's first government-organized scientific
investigation of the North Pole.

<HEADLINE> Investigators Discover Cause Of Major Fire In Southern Chinese City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, July 7 (Xinhua) -- A major factory fire that killed
16 people and injured eight last month in the city of Shenzhen in
south China's Guangdong Province was caused by a rectifier on a
fluorescent lamp, a special investigation team announced today.
</P>
<P>
The team also said that faulty management practices were partly
to blame for the fatal fire that engulfed the Zhimao Electronics
Plant, a Taiwanese-funded firm in the city's Bao'an District, on
June 12.
</P>
<P>
The investigators interviewed eye witnesses and obtained a
great deal of evidence in their examination of the premises. They
said that the fluorescent light that was attached to a beam above
a pile of flammable paper in a distant part of a warehouse on the
first floor fell and the heat of the rectifier ignited the
flammable articles and the flames spread throughout the whole
factory.
</P>
<P>
The investigators also concluded that the accident was the
indirect result of the factory owners' disregard for safety
regulations and sloppy management.
</P>
<P>
The persons responsible for the disaster are being sought for
possible criminal involvement.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen held a city-wide general check of safety soon
afterwards on 28,915 enterprises, construction sites, restaurants,
markets, shops, and rental houses and found problems in 5,009
places.
</P>
<P>
It issued 3,574 citations to get people to deal with the
trouble spots, shut down 17 boilers that were found to have
serious problems, demolished 34,000 sq.m. of construction work
that violated regulations, and levied 400,000 yuan (48,309 U.S.
dollars) in fines.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Heightens Vigilance Along Border with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Five Kenyan navy ships, along with
three fast-attack craft, are keeping vigil along the Kenya-Somalia
marine border since last week.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that the Kenyan navy has been placed on
such alert, the Daily Nation newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The vessels left Kenya's Indian Ocean port Mombasa with orders
to intercept any hostile boats or ships from the Somali militia
and have been conducting "aggressive patrols" near the border,
said Nicholas Simani, spokesman for the Department of Defense,
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Although the conflict had been resolved, the (Kenyan) armed
forces were maintaining their state of preparedness along the
borders in the case of recurring hostilities," said Simani.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's combat vessels are equipped with a missle system that
has a range of 200 kilometers and the capacity of strike deep into
the heart of Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi gave Somali militia
an ultimatum to return stolen firearms and vehicles. They were
returned before Kenya's full retaliatory attacks could be
launched.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Food Prices Expected to Rise: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The minister told the parliament Tuesday that there was
likelihood of a poor food production as a result of the La Nina
weather phenomenon and the effects of army worms which ravaged
crops in most provinces in the country, media reports said here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A shortfall of 1.5 million bags (each bag weighs about 90
kilograms) is expected in grain production from the normal three
million bags, he said, adding that levels of food production would
depend on the performance of the rains between now and September.
</P>
<P>
"This shortfall is likely to exert pressure on food prices and
it may have to be met through imports," said Mudavadi.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that his ministry, in conjunction with the
Treasury, was strengthening the capacity to deal with such
disasters, and called for support to the agricultural sector,
especially against unfair competition.
</P>
<P>
The minister also asked the parliament to approve a total of
4.7 billion shillings (around 67 million U.S. dollars) for
recurrent and development expenditure up to June next year.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Import Oil Products from Yemen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania will import oil
products from Yemen to satisfy the demands of its own and the
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
The Dar es Salaam-based Tanganyika Oil Investment Co. will
import more than 20,000 tons of petrol, diesel and kerosene from
the wells of Marib and Masile in Yemen.
</P>
<P>
The firm has finished the procedures required to start
importing the products, and construction of a petrol station with
the capability to preserve 50,000 tons of oil is nearing
completion, the Financial Times reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Tanzania is not far from Yemen, and automatically transport
costs are reduced, giving an advantage in the pricing of the
product," Ally Balbahou, the company director, told the Tanzanian
weekly paper last week.
</P>
<P>
The director recently paid a five-day visit to Yemen to contact
 suppliers as well as concerned authorities.
</P>
<P>
Apart from selling oil locally, the company will sell any oil
in excess to neighboring countries, he said. Tanzania has eight
neighbors, six of which are landlocked countries.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's oil supplies mainly rely on imports. Several foreign
 companies are exploring offshore oil in Tanzania, so far without
any significant discoveries.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Police to Protect U.N. Personnel in East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian military pledged to
give direct protection to U.N. Mission personnel in East Timor, a
spokesman said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The assurance was made by Indonesian Defense Minister and Armed
Forces Chief General Wiranto when meeting with the chairman of the
U.N. Mission in East Timor (UNAMET), Ian Martin, here for talks
about the security situation in the troubled territory ahead of
the U.N.-administered direct ballot on autonomy in August.
</P>
<P>
"The security responsibility is fully handled by the Indonesian
police who will give protection to all parties, including the
UNAMET officials," military spokesman Brig. Gen. Sudrajat quoted
Wiranto as saying after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto also said that the Indonesian police contingent,
deployed to help create and maintain security in East Timor
before, during and after the ballot, will be provided with
motorcycles to enable them to give direct protection to the UNAMET
officials.
</P>
<P>
Martin said after the meeting that "he (Wiranto) will also be
making other security changes, including continuing the process of
replacing Indonesian military forces with Indonesian police."
</P>
<P>
In the near future, Indonesia will again deploy 1,200 police
officers to replace 10 military companies in the territory
covering 32,200 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
So far, Jakarta has sent 1,961 police officers to replace seven
military companies which were pulled out in two stages, namely, on
June 6 and June 25, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Martin said his presence here is to express to the highest
levels of the Indonesian government the United Nations' serious
concerns regarding the security situation in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, he said he touched on the stoning attack of
a UNAMET outpost in the Bobonaro district town of Maliana, and the
Sunday raid by a pro-integration group on a humanitarian convoy in
Liquica Last week.
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated the United Nations' desire to back up the
whole process of the August ballot which paves the way for the
East Timorese to determine their own future.
</P>
<P>
In January this year, Jakarta offered special status based on
wide ranging autonomy to the people of East Timor through the
popular consultation. If a majority of the East Timorese reject
the offer of autonomy, East Timor, which was integrated into
Indonesian in 1976, will peacefully separate from Indonesia.

<HEADLINE> DRC's Military Commission to Be Monitored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The belligerents in the conflict of
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) have set up a committee to
monitor the mandate of the Joint Military Commission and the
United Nations peacekeeping forces in the country after the
signing of the ceasefire agreement.
</P>
<P>
The committee was established Tuesday evening after the peace
talks in Lusaka took a new twist when Uganda, Rwanda and some of
the rebel groups of the DRC changed their demands and requested
for the exclusion of the United Nations peacekeeping forces once
the ceasefire agreement is signed, Zambian newspapers reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, parties attending the peace talks are deadlocked
over the thorny issue of disarming the Interahamwe militiamen
operating from bases inside the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Zimbabwe differed seriously on who should be given
the mandate to supervise the disarming of the ex-Rwandan soldiers
mainly Hutus who were responsible for the 1994 genocide.
</P>
<P>
Sources said Zimbabwe wanted the U.N. peacekeeping forces to be
sent to the DRC after signing the ceasefire, to be responsible for
enforcing peace.
</P>
<P>
But Uganda and some rebel factions have refused this, demanding
that the belligerents in the conflict should be the ones to disarm
the Interahamwe.
</P>
<P>
Many expressed fears that if the Interrahamwe were not properly
 demobilized they would still continue to wreak havoc.
</P>
<P>
By Tuesday evening, the impasse had not been resolved as
consultations continued. This continued to put on hold the
plenary meeting for ministers of defense, home and foreign
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day Zimbabwean and Ugandan officials were
engaged in a meeting trying to resolve the problem but with little
achievement.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the meeting said Rwandan and Ugandan delegates
 attending the peace talks are expected to leave Zambia Wednesday
for home to consult with their leaders concerning the ceasefire
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The ministerial meeting starting last Monday was attended by
defense, home and foreign affairs ministers from the 14 Southern
African Development Community (SADC) member states, as well as
Rwanda, Uganda and Libya.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the ceasefire agreement which was initially
scheduled for June 26 has been delayed due to a number of
differences.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Says U.N. Worker Involved in Sabotage Acts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has accused a U.N. employee
working in northern Iraq of being involved in acts of sabotage,
said Iraqi newspapers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
An authorized Iraqi Foreign Ministry source said Reed Ayan
Proteen, a New Zealander, attempted to spread agriculture pests in
northern Iraq, said the newspapers.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has summoned U.N. Coordinator in Iraq Hans Von
Sponeck and handed him a memorandum of protest calling for
ordering Proteen out of Iraq within 72 hours.
</P>
<P>
Proteen is a supervisor at the U.N. Office of Project Services
(UNOPS) which is entrusted with removing land mines in northern
Iraq's Suleimaniya province.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi source said Proteen entered Kalar subdistrict in
Suleimaniya in April this year, and buried several boxes of
suspicious material nearby.
</P>
<P>
The source said that residents in that area later dug out
those boxes and found that the boxes were containing eggs of
locusts.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government condemned the act and demanded
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan investigate it to reveal all the
parties involved, said the source, adding the Iraqi government
also demands that Proteen be put on trial.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has repeatedly accused United States and British
nationals working in northern Iraq, particularly those working
with non-governmental organizations, of spying on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Iraq asked the U.N. to replace U.S. and
British nationals working with U.N. agencies in central and
southern Iraq with staff of other nationalities.

SHIJIAZHUANG, July 7 (Xinhua) -- About 3.4 million graduating
high school students in China started the 3-day national college
entrance exams today.
</P>
<P>
Some 70 percent of them are from single-child families, whose
parents have great hopes for them.
</P>
<P>
The parents of one 18-year-old boy said they've made him do
everything he can on his own ever since he was still a child to
make him independent and able to adapt better in society.
</P>
<P>
Because of the family planning policy of the late 70s, parents
can provide their children with better living conditions and more
opportunities to develop, and this year, a large number of the
high school students are taking the literature, art, and physical
education exams.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Education has decided to increase enrollments
by 330,000, from the original 1.3 million, meaning that 50 percent
of those who take the exam in Guangdong Province will be able to
go to college, and in Hebei and Shandong it will be 40 percent. (

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Sharif Facing Uphill Task to Sell Deal on Kashmir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif is facing an uphill task to sell his deal with U.S.
President Bill Clinton to defuse tension with India over Kashmir
as their joint statement has drawn mixed responses at home over
the past few days.
</P>
<P>
Sharif flew to Washington in the wee hours of Sunday and held
extensive talks with the U.S. president on what was reported the
single agenda of the crisis in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Described by the media as a rather positive outcome of the
short visit, the two sides issued a joint statement which said,
"concrete steps will be taken for the restoration of the Line of
Control (LoC) in accordance with the Simla Agreement."
</P>
<P>
While explaining "concrete steps", Pakistan's Foreign Office
spokesman Tariq Altaf indicated that Pakistan would appeal to and
use its influence with the Kashmiri Mujahideen (freedom fighters)
to stop fighting in Kargil and vacate the areas under their
control.
</P>
<P>
This was the only "concrete step" Pakistan was expected to take
as envisaged in the joint statement after the three-hour talks
between Sharif and Clinton, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Altaf also said that Pakistan has agreed to do so as it
believed the Kashmiri "freedom fighters" had achieved their
objectives of internationalizing the Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
Altaf, however, disagreed with the U.S. interpretation that
Pakistan was supposed to withdraw its troops from Kargil. He
stressed that Pakistan had never crossed the LoC, and this kind of
interpretation is "mischievous".
</P>
<P>
Observers here are of the view that it is by any means a
welcome step that Pakistan, although it always held the Mujahideen
are not under its control, has agreed to persuade them to stop
fighting in Kargil.
</P>
<P>
It is conducive to defusing the continuing tension along the
LoC and creating an environment favorable for resumption of the
bilateral dialogue process with India which had once been on right
track after the signing of the Lahore Declaration in February this
year.
</P>
<P>
Fighting erupted along the LoC in early May when India accused
Pakistan of sending "infiltrators" across the LoC occupying some
strategic heights in Kargil.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, however, denied the accusation, saying that it had
never crossed the LoC and there was no question of sending its
troops into India-held Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
It held that the so-called infiltrators are Kashmiri freedom
fighters who are fighting for their right to self-determination as
bestowed to them by the relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The two rival neighbors have since been trading intense
artillery fire across the LoC, along with large-scale Indian
ground and air force operations against the Mujahideen in the
Kargil sector.
</P>
<P>
The tensions along the LoC remain high and the two armies are
engaged in a dangerous all-round confrontation as the diplomatic
efforts by Pakistan failed to achieve any substantial results
because of the sharp divergence of the two sides on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The "Sharif-Clinton deal", as Pakistan's media termed, has
surprisingly met with divided responses at home.
</P>
<P>
Government sources believe that Prime Minister Sharif has
succeeded in internationalizing the Kashmir issue, as Pakistan had
always desired.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the Sharif government has been
successful in convincing the international community that the
Kashmir issue is a potential threat to peace and security in South
Asia which cannot be ignored especially after the nuclearization
of the region.
</P>
<P>
Major opposition parties, who had supported the government on
the Kashmir conflict, are now very much critical of the latest
development. They believe that Sharif's Washington tour is a
"major setback" Pakistan has sustained.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some Kashmiri groups have rejected the joint
statement between Pakistan and the United States, vowing to
continue fighting against the Indian forces.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Nawaz Sharif, who is still touring overseas to
convince the world leaders on Pakistan's position on the Kashmir
issue, faces an uphill task at home to defend his deal with
Clinton.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Complete Siberian Tiger Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The number of natural habitats for Siberian tigers have shrank
from six to three since the early 1990s, with only two remaining
natural habitats for leopards which once roamed throughout the
mountain range.
</P>
<P>
"The survey attributes the shrinking population of tigers and
leopards, as well as the dramatic reduction in natural habitats,
to the increasing human population and logging activities,"
according to Yang Shihe, an official from the Jilin Wildlife
Protection Association.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP-funded survey covered 71,000 sq.km. in the Changbai
Mountains. The survey team used advanced technology to carry out
applied field research.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government plans to establish a system of nature
reserves to protect the remaining Siberian tigers and leopards.
</P>
<P>
Siberian tigers are on the list of the world's 10 most-
endangered species, with an estimated 300 animals surviving in
Russia, northeast China and the northern part of the Korean
Peninsula. A recent survey revealed that northeast China is
currently home to some 20-odd Siberian tigers.

<HEADLINE> Eastern Chinese Province Increasing Flood Fight Ability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, July 7 (Xinhua) -- All major highways have been
reopened and electricity and telecommunications basically restored
in China's Zhejiang Province, one of the provinces hit most by
this year's floods, thanks to the efforts of some five million
people.
</P>
<P>
Flood fighters are now busy repairing damaged water
conservation projects and reinforcing levees, while farmers are
trying to replant rice seedlings.
</P>
<P>
A source at the Zhejiang Flood Control and Drought Relief
Headquarters says that the province still faces a difficult task
since water levels in most rivers and lakes in the northern part
are still above the danger line and many people are still besieged
by floodwaters, even though the heavy rains have stopped.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang had had uninterrupted rainfall since the beginning of
the rainy season in early June and total rainfall in some areas
was as high as 806 mm, three times the normal amount for rainy
season.
</P>
<P>
Torrential rains caused heavy flooding in some 45 cities and
counties in northern Zhejiang, where water levels on all major
rivers and reservoirs hit all-time highs.
</P>
<P>
The floods have destroyed 18,000 houses, damaged 3,900
kilometers of levees, and inundated 478,000 hectares of farmland,
affecting the lives of 7.9 million of the 43 million local people.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Calls for Closer People-to-People Contacts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Sri Lankan President
Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga stressed here Wednesday the
need for closer people-to-people contacts in South Asia to promote
regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"I strongly feel that the countries of our region, with a
common cultural heritage, should be able to let our people
interact freely," she told a special session of the Federation of
Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga noted that the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation (SAARC) network so far has proved very helpful in
bringing its member countries together.
</P>
<P>
"In this regard, I must emphasize the need for our people to
get together more closely," she said. "It is difficult to promote
regional cooperation by mere agreement among political leaders,
bureaucrats and elite of our countries."
</P>
<P>
"We need to get our people to meet each other and come to
understand and respect each other. We can build togetherness and
camaraderie," she stressed.
</P>
<P>
She again called for full liberalization of travel among the
SAARC countries -- Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal,
Pakistan and Sri Lanka, especially by lifting needless
restrictions on travel visas and "totally incomprehensible
restrictions on inter-country transport facilities."
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan president held that free interaction among
peoples in the region will promote peace as well as "strengthen us
to face the challenges of globalization" by promoting meaningful
regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
She praised the work of the SAARC Chamber of Commerce and
Industry as very fruitful in this regard. She requested the
regional apex body to fully develop this cooperation and extend it
from the businesses to the people at large.
</P>
<P>
"You can also promote investment in our countries so that we
can exploit our complementarities to the benefit of our region,"
she said of the SAARC apex body.
</P>
<P>
SAARC leaders have always stressed the promotion of
people-to-people contact in the region to strengthen mutual
understanding and goodwill among the peoples.
</P>
<P>
A number of initiatives have been taken in this regard, which
include the SAARC scheme for promotion of organized tourism, SAARC
chairs, fellowships and scholarships scheme and SAARC visa
exemption scheme.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga arrived here Monday on a four-day state visit at
the invitation of King Birendra.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Condemns Turkish Troops Incursion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi Foreign Ministry on
Wednesday condemned fresh Turkish troops incursion of northern
Iraq, calling it "a serious defiance of the U.N. Charter and rules
of the international law."
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Ministry spokesman said that last Saturday some
10,000 Turkish troops, supported by tanks, armoured vehicles,
helicopters and warplanes, invaded Iraq's northern territories,
the Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"This invasion is part of repeated series carried out by
the Turkish forces against Iraq since 1991 and is coincided
with the feverish military aggression acts being perpetrated by
America and Britain against Iraq," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He called on the Turkish government to withdraw its troops
immediately and desist from repeating such aggressive acts which
are contrary to the U.N. Charter and principles of the
international law.
</P>
<P>
After the 1991 Gulf War, the Iraqi government lost its control
of the northern Kurdish autonomous region, and Turkish troops
often crossed the border into northern Iraq to chase rebels of the
outlawed Turkish Kurdish Workers' Party.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi spokesman warned Turkey against consequences of its
assistance to the U.S. and British warplanes which have been
carrying out raids on northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's parliament last month agreed to extend the presence of
U.S. and British air forces in a Turkish air base to patrol the
northern no-fly zone in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western allies imposed the no-fly zones in Iraq
following the Gulf War with a claimed aim of protecting the Kurds
in the north and Shiite Muslims in the south from possible
attacks by the Iraqi government troops.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi spokesman warned that "the Iraqi government retains
its full right to retaliate this aggressive act in proper time
and venue."

<P>
TOKYO, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices continued falling in
Tokyo Wednesday, dragged down by continued profit-taking following
recent gains, with the key Nikkei index closing below 18,000 for
the first time in three days.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, which lost 84.33 points
Tuesday,dropped 91.83 points, or 0.51 percent, to end at 17,958.90.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, went down 1.70 points or 0.11 percent to 1,
477.02.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section declined to 644.96 million shares
from Tuesday's 675.03 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Fuji Bank was the day's volume leader.
</P>
<P>
Export-oriented technology issues were generally higher,
supported by the U.S. dollar's strength against the yen, while
high-priced issues weakened on profit-taking, a dealer said.
</P>
<P>
Arbitrage-linked selling, stirred by a drop in index futures
prices, was another factor leading overall share prices lower,
traders said.
</P>
<P>
Of the issues listed on the First Section, losers narrowly
exceeded gainers 595 to 580, with 152 issues remaining unchanged.

Security Council resolutions.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Population Growth Still "Alarming," </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Iran's population growth rate is
still "alarming" despite its achievements in population control
during the past decade, a senior U.N. official said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"It is still alarming with the consideration of the young
status of the Iranian population," Mohammad Mosleh-Uddin,
representative of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in
Iran, told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
According to the Iranian Statistics Center, Iran's population
growth rate will jump to 1.7 percent by the end of 2001 from the
present 1.4 percent, as 52 percent of Iran's 63-million population
are below 20 and will be reaching in marriage and childbearing age
soon, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mosleh-Uddin praised the Iranian government for its success in
reducing the population growth rate from 3.2 percent in 1986 to
1.4 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The UNFPA has decided to allocate some 11 million U.S. dollars
to Iran in its third five-year plan to start in the year 2000,
with an aim to promoting the quality of family planning services
in Iran with strengthened cooperation between the UNFPA and Iran,
the representative said.
</P>
<P>
The UNFPA will also promote its activities in Iran's rural
areas since half of the Iranian population are living in these
provinces, he added.

<HEADLINE> Cabinet Reshuffle Nearly Completed: Thai PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The weeks-long drama of party power
struggle pending a cabinet reshuffle is expected to end shortly as
all coalition members except the Chart Pattana Party (CPP) have
already handed in their lists of proposal, Thai Prime Minister
Chuan Leekpai said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
As for CPP's quota in the government, Chuan said the Democrat
Party and CPP have reached agreement so that the reshuffle can be
completed within this week.
</P>
<P>
The reshuffle will not affect the government's administrative
operation of the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sanan Kachornprasart, secretary-general of the
Democrat, said he expected the list from CPP Thursday.
</P>
<P>
CPP leader Korn Dabbaransi denied that there is dispute within
the party over cabinet seats, saying the party is selecting
suitable candidates.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that CPP had asked for the seat of first
minister in science portfolio and a deputy in the interior
portfolio, but was rejected by the Democrat.
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sanctions, "Against Muslim People": Taliban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan ruling Taliban
Wednesday termed the U.S. sanctions an "attack against Muslim
people", according to a report reaching here from Kabul.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton signed an executive order Monday
imposing financial sanctions upon the Taliban militia in
retaliation for their support of suspected terrorist Osama bin
Laden.
</P>
<P>
The United States imposed sanctions because it "wants to attack
the Muslim people", said Taliban spokesman Maulvi Faizl Mohammed
Faizan, adding that "all of their accusations against the Islamic
Emirate of Afghanistan and against bin Laden is without reason and
without evidence."
</P>
<P>
"America does not want a Muslim government in Afghanistan,"
observed Faizan.
</P>
<P>
Last month Washington put Osama on the FBI's "Ten Most Wanted
list" and offered a 5 million dollars reward for information
leading to his arrest.
</P>
<P>
Washington accuses Osama of masterminding last year's bomb
attacks on U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
According to the Taliban, Osama, who left his home in
Afghanistan's southern Kandahar earlier this year, has disappeared
and his whereabouts is unknown.
</P>
<P>
But the United States recently claimed Osama is still in
Afghanistan and receiving support from the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
"It is surprising... we are in Afghanistan and we don't know
where Osama is. But Clinton who is thousands of miles away says he
knows where he is. Where is his proof?" Faizan questioned.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Calls for Free Trade in South Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Sri Lankan President
Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga stressed here Wednesday that
free trade will be beneficial to all the South Asian countries in
the age of globalization.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that developing nations like ours should act in
unison in facing the challenges of globalization. Hence, we have
been strongly advocating a preferential trade area in our SAARC
region," Kumaratunga told a special session of the Federation of
Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry.
</P>
<P>
"It will be very necessary for us to be together, if we're to
face the challenge of this new feature of globalization," she
said.
</P>
<P>
As proposed by Sri Lanka, a SAARC Preferential Trading
Arrangement (SAPTA) was formulated and entered into force in
December 1995. Three rounds of trade talks have been completed
under it, offering over 5,700 commodities for preferential
treatment in the SAARC member states -- Bangladesh, Bhutan, India,
the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga, who is the current SAARC chairperson, told a press
conference that it stands true that SAPTA is not completed yet but
"it is moving forward very slowly."
</P>
<P>
"It can move forward more positively and faster," she said.
</P>
<P>
The president said that Sri Lanka is the first country in South
Asia to have totally liberalized its tariffs unilaterally. "Our
unilateral trade liberalization has not led to a disruption of our
domestic economy," she said.
</P>
<P>
The fourth round of trade talks under SAPTA is scheduled to
start this month in the Kathmandu-based SAARC Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
SAARC leaders had preferred to set up a South Asian Free Trade
Area by 2001 but deferred it indefinitely at their Colombo summit
in July last year.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga came here Monday for a four-day state visit at the
invitation of King Birendra. She visited the SAARC Secretariat
Tuesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Share Prices continued tumbling
on the Singapore Stock Market Wednesday as the investors continued
dumping small cap stocks after many brokerage houses imposed
limits on buying.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) ended 30.98 points
lower to close at 2,144.53.
</P>
<P>
The volume totaled 1,139.93 million shares valued at 1,236.69
million Singapore dollars (727.06 million U.S. dollars). Losers
outnumbered gainers by 338 to 34 with 75 counters unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Hotung led the active chart of the day with 77.10 million
shares changing hands. It was followed by AFP that had 55.23
million units done. IPC was the next with 53.34 counters traded.

waning as concerns over an overheated market started taking over.
</P>
<P>
They said in the broad market all sector indices were lower and
initial support from property and bank shares diminished as more
selling orders poured in, pulling the key index lower.
</P>
<P>
Feeling that penny stocks had been overbought after the market
steamed ahead 54 percent higher this year, many investors began
panic-selling this week.

<HEADLINE> Lao Government Endeavors to Protect Wildlife </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 7 (Xinhua) -- To mark the National Wildlife
Conservation Day (July 13), the Lao Ministry of
Agriculture-Forestry (MAF) has issued an order banning hunting
wildlife.
</P>
<P>
Under the order, according to a report of Lao official news
agency KPL Wednesday, people are prohibited from hunting, selling
or buying any kind of wild animals from August 28 to October 25,
which is the mating season for many wildlife species in Laos.
</P>
<P>
"Sale in the markets of any product derived from animals killed
in the wild is prohibited," the order said.
</P>
<P>
During fish spawning season, the Lao government requires each
locality to take measures to ban people from catching fish and
from blocking the path of fish swimming upstream to lay their
eggs.
</P>
<P>
It is illegal to use bombs, poisons and any small-hole nets to
catch fish, said the order, adding that the law on animal
conservation would be brought to local people and explained to
them.
</P>
<P>
People will be encouraged to continue to hand over voluntarily
their hunting guns and other hunting equipment to local
authorities.
</P>
<P>
The Lao National Wildlife Conservation Day was established on
July 13, 1997 to protect wildlife and fish.
</P>
<P>
However, because of the increased awareness of the issue, most
agriculture officials admit that hunting in Laos has considerably
decreased over the last few years.

<HEADLINE> SADC Urged to Reduce Reliance on Outside World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano has highlighted the challenge facing the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) as how to reduce to the lowest level
its reliance on the outside world.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement to Mozambican reporters Tuesday in
Durban, South Africa, where he was attending the Southern Africa
Economic Summit.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the cooperation between SADC members, without
excluding cooperation with the outside world.!!
</P>
<P>
Another challenge, he said, is the lack of professionals in
most SADC countries. Moreover, the SADC should also enhance
cooperation in eliminating AIDS, malaria and other diseases.
</P>
<P>
A strict administrative mechanism on armed conflicts is another
issue of common concern.
</P>
<P>
"We are faced with a challenge of integration to resolve
unsettled issues," said Chissano who is deputy president of the
SADC.
</P>
<P>
Chissano referred to the Southern Africa Economic Summit in
Durban as " successful", saying the region is of much importance
to Africa, Europe and other regions of the world.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Launches Campaign to Halt Child Sex Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Cambodian Royal Government
has launched an ambitious five-year plan against sexual
exploitation of children, a newspaper report said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Opening a two-day national conference to mark the launch of the
plan Tuesday, Minister of Social Affairs Ith Sam Heng said the
government would strengthen laws, monitor international
trafficking networks, train law enforcement officials and educate
the public.
</P>
<P>
The minister said protection and rehabilitation services for
exploited children are not only an international obligation but
also "a process of social and economic development" for Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
The five-year plan is consistent with the goals of the United
Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the agenda for
action adopted at the 1996 world congress against sexual
exploitation of children, the Cambodia Daily said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the plan includes a public awareness campaign, the
creation of a documentation center and training to sensitize the
police, court officials and high-ranking officials on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Tougher prosecution was also proposed for traffickers, pimps
and customers who could be imprisoned for 10 to 20 years if the
victim is under 15 years old.

<HEADLINE> EU Delegation Visits Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- A European Union (EU) delegation is
currently paying a three-day visit here.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, which arrived here Tuesday, is scheduled to
meet leaders of both the government and the opposition National
League for Democracy (NLD) later Wednesday, according to sources
at the British Embassy here.
</P>
<P>
The EU delegation, on its first ever trip to Yangon since the
ruling military government came to power in late 1988, will make
consultations with the government on matters related to the
opposition party, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
The NLD won the general election in May 1990, sponsored by the
government. However, as there have been wide differences between
the government and the winning party over the drawing-up of a new
state constitution, the handing over of power remains unrealized
up to now.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, an envoy of the U.N. secretary-general, Alvaro de
Soto, himself an assistant U.N. secretary-general, visited Myanmar
in October 1998 and met with both government and NLD leaders for
the same consultations.

<HEADLINE> HK To Promote IT Entrepreneurship Among Youngsters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government,
together with local industrial community and academic institutions,
launched a new program here Wednesday to encourage Hong Kong's
young people to go in for the information technology industry.
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) attended the launching ceremony of the
Information Technology Entrepreneur Program (ITEP) Wednesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
ITEP is a one-year program designed for young and ambitious
individuals with sound business ideas, the right mindset and
adequate skills in information technology and service development.
</P>
<P>
The program is operated by the Information Technology
Entrepreneurs Association, a non-profit organization founded by
the Chinese University of Hong Kong, the Hong Kong University of
Science and Technology and the University of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
It is open to anyone who can work legally in Hong Kong,
although university graduates, particularly students from IT-
related fields, are expected to be a majority among the applicants.
</P>
<P>
A total funding of 25 million HK dollars (3.2 million U.S.
dollars) will be sought for the first five years of the program.
</P>
<P>
About one half of the funding is provided by the Industrial
Support Fund of the government and the remaining funding will rely
on industrial sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
So far, the program has obtained sponsorship and pledges of
over 5.3 million HK dollars (679,487 U.S. dollars) from industry
and academic institutions.
</P>
<P>
The program is launched in response to the report by the Chief
Executive's Commission on Innovation and Technology and the
Digital 21 IT strategy of the SAR government.

<HEADLINE> Britain, Ireland Deny Split over Northern Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The British and the Irish
governments moved quickly on Wednesday to dismiss media
suggestions of a split over Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The issue arose when Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern warned
on Tuesday against any side being thrown out of the British
province's peace process, apparently in response to earlier
remarks made by British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
Blair told parliament on Monday that Irish Republican Army's
political wing Sinn Fein would have to quit the British province's
planned all-party executive immediately if the IRA failed to start
disarming on schedule.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Blair and Mr. Ahern have been working closely together and
still are," Reuters quoted a British official as saying.
</P>
<P>
And an Irish government source was quoted as saying that "there
is no difference of opinion. They know exactly what they are doing.

<HEADLINE> Thai Candidate Agrees to Let Rival Serve WTO Term First </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 7 (Xinhua) - Thai Deputy Prime Minister and
Commerce Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi said here Wednesday that
he agreed to let his arch rival first serve as the WTO's
director-general if a term-sharing compromise could be reached.
</P>
<P>
Supachai said he would agree to serve the second term if he was
allowed a role in formulating policy beforehand.
</P>
<P>
Supachai and New Zealand's Mike Moore have been locked in a
bitter battle for the director-generalship of the WTO for more
than eight months.
</P>
<P>
An Australian plan to end the deadlock is now on the table and
if, accepted, would see Moore and Supachai take turns in the top
job.
</P>
<P>
As the Thai government is undergoing a cabinet reshuffle,
Supachai is being urged by the ruling Democrat party, of which he
is a member, to take any second term offered to him.
</P>
<P>
But he could make the decision only after a WTO general council
meeting, scheduled for Thursday, in which supporters of the rival
candidates are expected to come up with a compromise over the
shared term proposal.
</P>
<P>
Supachai also suggested that the two terms be longer than two
years -- half the normal four year term for a WTO leader.
</P>
<P>
Pressure to find a new WTO leader is building as crucial talks
are looming in November in Seattle which are intended to kick
start a new round of global trade negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Western nations including the United States and some European
countries are backing Moore but much of Asia has put its weight
behind Supachai, making consensus so far impossible among the
WTO's 134 members.
</P>
<P>
Thailand had proposed to end the deadlock by vote, which was
ruled out by the United States. But the United States has so far
not blocked a plan for sharing the post of director-general.
</P>
<P>
The WTO has been without a director general since Italy's
Renato Ruggiero stepped down at the end of April.

<HEADLINE> No Done Deal With Marcoses: Estrada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
maintained Wednesday there is no done deal for a compromise
settlement between the government and the heirs of the late
president Ferdinand Marcos over their alleged ill-gotten wealth.
</P>
<P>
In his weekly radio program, the president branded as lies and
misinformation reports claiming such a deal has been forged.
</P>
<P>
"The truth is that we have not reached any deal with the Marcos
family," Estrada assured the public, saying all negotiations
related to the recovery of the alleged money will be conducted
with full transparency.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that he will not keep the people in the dark about
developments pertaining to government efforts to repossess all
assets that rightfully belong to the country.
</P>
<P>
"We will not withhold any detail from the people. I am
committed to transparency and full disclosure in all government
negotiations. If there is a deal we will make it public," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Since last week Estrada and the Presidential Palace officials
have denied reports alleging that a compromise settlement is ready
to be inked with the Marcoses as early as October.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that both Executive Secretary Ronaldo
Zamora and the Presidential Commission on Good Government, which
takes charge of government efforts to trace and recover all
ill-gotten assets, have belied the existence of the reported deal.
</P>
<P>
However, former first lady Imelda Marcos insisted that a
compromise agreement between her family and the administration was
in the bag.
</P>
<P>
"It was just a matter of due process of the law. After that, it
is all finished," she told the country's Inquirer newspaper
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> First UK Troops Start Pullout From Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of British troops are to be
withdrawn from Kosovo as the first wave of reducing British forces
in the Yugoslav province, Defense Secretary George Robertson said
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a written answer to a parliamentary question, Robertson said
the pullout would start on Friday as now the province has been
secured.
</P>
<P>
He said logistics and support staff of the 5th Airborne Brigade
would start to pull out on Wednesday. They are to be followed by
some of the helicopter support force.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal of the 700 soldiers from the battered southern
Yugoslav province had always been planned, he said.
</P>
<P>
The troops were used as part of the initial advance into Kosovo
but are no longer needed by KFOR commanders, he said.
</P>
<P>
The KFOR force will still have 10,000 UK troops in its ranks,
and that could increase to 13,000 as more troops go in.
</P>
<P>
The multinational NATO-led Kosovo force, known as KFOR and
commanded by British General Mike Jackson, totals about 25,000 at
present and will stand at 50,000 when it is up to full strength.

<HEADLINE> Malawian President Urged Election Losers to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Malawian President Bakili Muluzi
has urged those who lost in the elections, which he described as
free and fair, to accept defeat and start helping him build the
nation.
</P>
<P>
The president, reacting to post-election violence, advised
Malawians to reject any individual who is against national unity
as an enemy of democracy and freedom.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot afford to entertain any ideas that cause division or
violence amongst our people," he cautioned at Chichiri Stadium on
the occasion of the commemoration of the 35th anniversary of
independence which falls on Tuesday, the Malawi News Agency
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We must work together as one people. We must be united," the
president told the huge crowd that came to witness the occasion.
</P>
<P>
As leader of the Malawian nation, he strongly condemned all
those "who stand for hatred or violence and are bent on dividing
us."
</P>
<P>
"You can count on me who will lead this country without regard
to what part of our country one comes from and without regard to
race, color, gender or disability," said Muluzi.
</P>
<P>
The president also thanked Malawians for expressing their
confidence and faith in him to lead the country for another five
years.
</P>
<P>
He advised those honored with responsibility to take their task
 seriously "otherwise we have no right to occupy these leadership
positions."
</P>
<P>
Malawians have a right to prosperity, development, education,
health care and protection from crime and violence, he observed.
</P>
<P>
"My re-election administration has a duty and obligation to
provide the kind of climate which will make it possible to meet
the needs of all our people," pledged the president.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Striker Pursues Premier League Dream </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Thai footballer Kiatisak Senamuang
is bidding to follow the Asian trail blazed by several Japanese
and Chinese stars to make a mark in European professional squads.
</P>
<P>
The striker, also skipper of the national team, has started a
two-week trial with English Premier League Middlesborough, which
is managed by Manchester United legend Bryan Robson.
</P>
<P>
Those Asian footballers who have forced their way into European
clubs include Japanese Hidetoshi Nakata of Italy's Perugia,
Chinese Fan Zhiyi and Sun Jihai of English first division Crystal
Palace and Yang Chen of Germany first division Frankfur.
</P>
<P>
"If I have the chance I would certainly go to play with other
foreign teams again," Kiatisak said before he left for England on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's national team coach, Peter Withe, a former Aston
Villa and England striker, said he believed Kiatisak had the
ability to make a mark in English football.
</P>
<P>
"His speed and tactical awareness are good enough for the
Premier League. His desire will help him to succeed." Withe was
quoted as saying in the local reports.
</P>
<P>
Kiatisak, 26, nicknamed "Zico" after the great Brazilian,
emerged to fame when he led Thailand to the gold medal at the
Southeast Asian Games in Singapore six years ago.
</P>
<P>
"Boro spotted Kiatisak on a pre-season tour of Thailand two
years ago." Robson was quoted as saying in the Thai press.
</P>
<P>
"We just thought we would have a look at him," said the coach.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Urges New Israeli Government to Resume Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has
urged the newly-formed Israeli government to implement the Wye
accord signed with the Palestinians and resume peace talks with
Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Hours after Israeli Labor leader Ehud Barak was sworn in as
prime minister Tuesday night, Mubarak said he hopes the new
Israeli government will soon take steps to break the deadlock in
the Arab-Israeli peace talks, Egypt's Middle East News Agency
reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian leader made the remarks in an interview with the
French Le Figaro newspaper, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israel signed in October, 1998 the Wye
accord, under which Israel should pull back from another 13
percent of the West Bank. But the former government of the
hardline Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu halted the military
withdrawals in December.
</P>
<P>
Barak has pledged to advance the peace talks with the
Palestinians, reactivate the negotiations with Syria, which have
been stalled since early 1996, and bring back Israeli troops from
Lebanon in a year.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak called for the rebuilding of confidence in the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
He praised Barak as a man who "has all qualifications necessary
to" make progress in the peace-making, expressing belief that the
peace process will move forward.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak underlined that the Palestinian issue is the core of
the Arab-Israeli conflict, dismissing concerns that the Syrian and
Lebanese tracks will outshine the Palestinian track.
</P>
<P>
Reaching a solution to the Palestinian issue will help solve
the problems on the other tracks of talks, the Egyptian leader
maintained.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Announces New Strategies to Boost Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Ministry of Commerce
announced new strategies on Wednesday to boost export of the
country's major agricultural products next year, the Thailand News
Agency (TNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The products include rice, tapioca, rubber and maize.
</P>
<P>
The TNA quoted a high-ranking official of the ministry as
saying the strategies include launching a contest of fragrant rice
strains nationwide to select the best strain of rice.
</P>
<P>
The strain would then be promoted and distributed among local
farmers to increase its production for exports next year.
</P>
<P>
The government recently projected that the overall exports of
Thai rice this year will reach 5.5 million tons, slightly over its
target of 5.3 million tons due to agreed orders, through
government-to-government contracts, of about 700,000 tons of Thai
rice.
</P>
<P>
For tapioca, the strategies would be focused on not only
promoting exports of the product to trading partners, but also
finding new markets.
</P>
<P>
Strategies for rubber included campaigns to promote Thai rubber
products worldwide.
</P>
<P>
As for maize, strategies would be emphasized on promoting the
production to meet the country's demand of about 5 million tons
next year and exporting the rest to foreign markets.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Prime Minister Launches Peace Initiatives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 7 (Xinhua) -- In a sign that he will move to
renew the peace process quickly as pledged, Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak Wednesday set meetings with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak and Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Chairman Yasser
Arafat soon.
</P>
<P>
Barak will travel to the Egyptian port city of Alexandria
Friday to meet Mubarak and hold a meeting with Arafat Sunday at
the Erez Crossing between Israel and the Palestinian-ruled Gaza
Strip, the Government Press Office said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
He will also meet King Abdullah Bin Hussein of Jordan next week
and intends to leave for the United States in 10 days for talks
with President Bill Clinton and other senior U.S. officials, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The initiatives came one day after Barak was sworn in as prime
minister in the Knesset (parliament), which approved his
seven-party coalition government formed following more than six
weeks of grueling talks.
</P>
<P>
While presenting his government for approval, Barak appealed
to Arab leaders to move quickly to reach peace with Israel and
promised to give same priorities to talks with the Palestinians
and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian and Syrian leaders have expressed their willingness
to resume peace talks with Israel, which were largely frozen in
the three-year tenure of the former hard-line Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Jordan, the two Arab neighbors which have signed
peace treaties with Israel, have pledged to play active roles in
helping advance the peace process.
</P>

Israeli President Ezer Weizman praised Barak's initiatives
Wednesday, calling it a development "in the right direction."

<HEADLINE> Japan Equestrian Officials Found to Receive Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The investigation has found that
three of Japanese equestrian officials received money from a rider
seeking to be on the 1992 Olympic team, according to reports on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese Equestrian Federation met at its headquarters in
Tokyo to discuss an in-house investigation into a report in the
Mainichi newspaper this week that Yoshinaga Sakurai paid three
federation members about 3.5 million yen (29,000 U.S. dollars) to
be selected for the team that went to the Barcelona Games.
</P>
<P>
Federation head Shozo Hara told reporters that the
investigation found that the three officials had received the cash
but that the gifts had no influence on picking the team.
</P>
<P>
The federation will decide on any penalties at a meeting of
senior officials Monday, Hara said.
</P>
<P>
Hara criticized the allegations as unfair.
</P>
<P>
According to the investigation, one official who had served as
Sakurai's coach received the money as a gift long after Sakurai
had already been selected on the team. The money that went to
another official went into expenses for setting up a base training
camp for Sakurai.
</P>
<P>
The third official, who has offered to resign from his post,
borrowed the money from Sakurai and is planning to pay it back,
the federation said.
</P>
<P>
Sakurai also denied the payments were meant to get him a berth
on the team, it said.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Launch Small Enterprise Capital Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- After several months of delay, the
Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) has finally decided to launch the
much-awaited small and medium enterprise (SME) capital market
later this year.
</P>
<P>
The SME capital market is a separate listing board established
within the PSE to allow small and medium-sized companies with high
growth potentials to raise capital by selling their shares to the
public.
</P>
<P>
Jose Fernando Alcantara, PSE vice president for the business
development and information group, told a meeting on Wednesday
that the PSE is now studying the behavior of the SMEs,
particularly how they do business in the market.
</P>
<P>
Alcantara said he believes that with the coming in of the SME
capital market, the PSE will be facing more challenges ahead
considering that SMEs will likely be prone to business-related
problems because they are still new in the market.
</P>
<P>
He noted that once the SME capital market is finally working,
the PSE management will have no choice but to put more minds and
eyes to monitor the activities of the listed SMEs.
</P>
<P>
So far, he said, the first batch of five SMEs, were initially
listed by the PSE's SME board. This batch was carefully chosen
from a total of 25 applications that the PSE received from the
various SMEs in the country.
</P>
<P>
PSE officials are optimistic that the new SME board will
contribute to the further development of the capital market
because it will be an inexpensive source of capital for the SMEs.
</P>
<P>
They said that through the PSE facilities, the SMEs may sell
their shares to the public by way of what is called an initial
public offering.

peace deal to end Sierra Leone's civil war may be imminent.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo left Lome last night but
promised to return Wednesday to re-join the talks, according to
information reaching here Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Presidents from Nigeria, Liberia, Burkina Faso and Togo held
separate talks with President Tejan Kabbah of Sierra Leone and
rebel leader Foday Sankoh Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Togolese foreign minister said Tuesday night, according to an
unconfirmed report, that the final documents might be produced
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The main difference between Kabbah-led government and
Sankoh-led Revolutionary United Front had been how to form a
four-year transitional government.
</P>
<P>
The rebels, especially some field commanders, think the Kabbah
government's offer of four cabinet seats was "not enough".
</P>
<P>
The People's War Council, a body representing them had been
asking at least seven ministerial posts and a vice presidency.
</P>
<P>
The rebels have also required an internationally guaranteed
amnesty for their alleged war crimes.
</P>
<P>
Despite the differences, Sankoh did not rule out that a
compromise agreement might be worked out "within the next few
days". "I'm not excluding anything," he said before the starting
of the summit.
</P>
<P>
The rebel commanders in the Sierra Leone bushes were consulted
last week by RUF negotiators, and a high-ranking representative of
the commanders jetted in to Lome Tuesday night to join the summit.
</P>
<P>
Whether the Nigeria-led west Africa Peacekeeping forces which
restored Kabbah to power in 1998 after an armed coup is also under
discussion in the summit between the relevant parties, information
reaching here said.

<HEADLINE> Top Legislature Condemns U.S. Anti-China Moves (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese National People's
Congress (NPC) today expressed its strong condemnation and
opposition to recent U.S. anti-China actions concerning the Taiwan
issue.
</P>
<P>
An official in charge of the NPC Foreign Affairs Committee made
the remarks when commenting on anti-China amendments to the U.S.
National Defense Appropriations Act and on the Taiwan Security
Enhancement Act proposed by the U.S. Congress.
</P>
<P>
A small group of members of the U.S. House of representatives
and Senate have continually attempted to stir anti-China sentiment
by strongly advocating increased arms sales to Taiwan under the
pretext of the so-called Chinese Communist military threat.
</P>
<P>
Jesse A. Helms, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee of
the U.S. Senate, tabled the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act on
March 24. He was followed by Benjamin A. Gilman, chairman of the
International Relations Committee of the U.S. House of
Representatives, and Thomas D. Delay, majority whip of the House,
who jointly initiated a similar move on May 18.
</P>
<P>
On June 8, the Senate passed an amendment to the National
Defense Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2000 proposed by Trent
Lott, majority leader of the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
This amendment openly claimed to "review and evaluate" all gaps
in relevant knowledge about the current and future military
balance between the Chinese Mainland and Taiwan, as well as the U.
S. Defense Department's implementation of relevant sections of the
Taiwan Relations Act.

<P>
It is known to all that the U.S. side has continued arms sales
to Taiwan in total disregard of the August 17th Communique issued
jointly by China and the U.S.
</P>
<P>
U.S. arms sales to Taiwan have, in fact, increased in terms of
both quantity and quality, including not only advanced early
warning and antimissile system, but also comprehensive military
equipment such as electron-antagonistic surveillance system and a
new type of transport aircraft which will upgrade overall combat
effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
In addition, some U.S. congressmen are advocating Taiwan's
inclusion in the Theater Missile Defense (TMD) System.
</P>
<P>
U.S. congressmen framed the Taiwan-related amendment to the
National Defense Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2000 and the
Taiwan Security Enhancement Act with the sole purpose of creating
a legal basis for selling advanced arms, including the TMD System,
to Taiwan and reinforcing military cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The goal of the move was to support and protect the separatist
activities of some political factions in Taiwan, create tension
and damage relations between the two sides across the Taiwan
Straits, and obstruct China's reunification cause.
</P>
<P>
The above actions totally violated the principles enshrined in
the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques, especially the August 17th
Communique in which the U.S. committed itself to gradually
reducing and finally halting arms sales to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The actions will not only pose severe threat to China's
security, but will also damage peace and stability of the Asia-
Pacific region as a whole.

<HEADLINE> Top Legislature Condemns U.S. Anti-China Moves (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan is part of China's territory and the Taiwan issue is
purely China's internal affair. Both of the aforementioned facts
are widely recognized by the international community, including
the United States.
</P>
<P>
The perverse moves of some U.S. legislators constitute a grave
provocation to Chinese sovereignty and gross interference in China
's internal affairs. The Foreign Affairs Committee members
strongly condemn and reject the actions.
</P>
<P>
Since China and the United States forged diplomatic ties, the
ups and downs in their relations have centered mainly on the issue
of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
A point well worth noting is that the principles set forth in
the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques have provided the political
foundation for the development of bilateral relations. The U.S.
Congress and government are obligated to strictly adhere to the
principles and faithfully carry out their promise to support the "
one China" policy.
</P>
<P>
Practice proves that whenever these principles are observed,
Sino-U.S. relations grow smoothly, and that whenever these
principles are infringed upon, Sino-U.S. relations witness twists
and turns, or stagnation, or even retrogression.
</P>
<P>
Any damage to bilateral relations runs counter to the
fundamental interests and aspirations of the people in both
nations.
</P>
<P>
The NPC strongly demands that the U.S. Congress take Sino-U.S.
relations into full account, abide by the principles enshrined in
the three joint communiques and take steps to stop the
aforementioned conspiracy that will damage bilateral relations,
and prevent further deterioration in Sino-U.S. relations which
have already encountered many trials and hardships.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Govt Cancels Oil leases, Causing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has cancelled
16 oil prospecting leases awarded to indigenous operators between
March and May this year, which marks the first casualty of
President Olusegun Obasanjo's contract probe drive.
</P>
<P>
A statement Tuesday from the office of the Presidential Adviser
on Petroleum and Energy announced the revocation of licences.
</P>
<P>
The cancelled leases on off-shore oil blocs were awarded by the
former administration of Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, said the
Guardian, a leading Nigerian Newspaper, Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's revocation, which took immediate effect, resulted
from an interim report by the panel reviewing past contracts,
licences awards and appointments raised last month by Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
It was also made ahead of the development of a new procedure
for bidding and allocation of licenses and acreages by the new
government.
</P>
<P>
The leases were accorded this March under the terms that the
benefiting companies were to pay a signature bonus or acceptance
fee of 20 million U.S. dollars (2 billion naira) on each of the
blocs, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Oziko Energy Resources Limited, Totex Oil Nigeria Limited,
Heritage Oil and Gas, Zebra Energy Nigeria Limited, Oil and Gas
Nigeria Limited, Amni International Petroleum Development Company
Limited and a couple of other companies were affected by the
cancellation.
</P>
<P>
The allocations had generated controversy -- largely on the
discretionary basis of award, and were against traditionally
recognized open competitive bidding, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, public opinion rose against the allocation because of
alleged substantial interest of some retired and serving military
officers in many of the beneficiary companies, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
But in a swift reaction Tuesday, some of the awardees protested
the cancellation of the allocations. They alleged that Obasanjo
had made up his mind earlier to cancel the contract, hence denying
them fair-hearing by the review panel.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive of one of the beneficiaries said: "We, at
least my company, submitted a memorandum to the panel. We are
expecting to testify at the panel, at least for the sake of fair
hearing. But nothing came from them. Besides, the work of the
committee is scheduled for completion in three months. Why is the
government being hasty about the decision?"
</P>
<P>
Gen. Abubakar, in a live phone-in interview on the British
Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) on the eve of his exit, was taken
to task by a questioner on the propriety of the award of licenses.
 The former head of state answered that he believed due process
was observed, said the paper.

<HEADLINE> First Flood Peak On Yangtze Passes Central Chinese City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The first flood peak on the Yangtze
River passed Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province, without mishap
from 8:00 p.m. yesterday to 2:00 this morning.
</P>
<P>
The Provincial Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters
said when the flood peak passed water levels at the Wuhanguan
Hydrology Station were recorded at 27.68 meters, 0.38 meters above
the danger line, with a flow of 65,000 cu.m. per second.
</P>
<P>
The rainy season on the river started June 15 and some areas of
Sichuan Province and more than 40 counties and cities in Hubei and
the Dongting Lake area were hit by heavy rainfall.
</P>
<P>
The increased water flow from the upper reaches of the Yangtze,
coupled with the outflow from Dongting Lake, forced the main
stream of the Yangtze to rise rapidly, forming the first flood
peak.
</P>
<P>
A team of local Party and government leaders from Wuhan
patrolled the city's 465 km. of embankments while the flood peak
passed to check on flood control materials and equipment at
different dangerous sections.
</P>
<P>
All gates to the Yangtze were closed and the most dangerous
section at Longwangmiao at Hankou, where the Hanjiang River joins
the main stream of the Yangtze, has been reinforced after more
than 8 months of work at a cost of 120 million yuan (14 million US
dollars), so no major danger was reported when the first flood
peak passed Wuhan.

<HEADLINE> India Says Watching Pakistan to Withdraw Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Indian caretaker Prime Minister
Atal Behari Vajpayee said Wednesday that India would watch for the
results of Pakistan's intention to withdraw from the Indian side
of the Line of Control (LOC) in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a conference of chief ministers here, Vajpayee said,
"We are informed that Pakistan has agreed to withdraw. We will
watch for results on the grounds. In the meantime our operations
shall continue unabated."
</P>
<P>
India launched a big military operation in early May to "flush
out Pakistan-backed infiltrators" from the Indian side of the LOC"
and the fighting is still going on in the Kargil sector of
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Media reports on Sunday said U.S. President Bill Clinton and
Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in their talks reached an
agreement and Pakistan promised to withdraw its troops.
</P>
<P>
The chief ministers were briefed on the current situation in
Kargil by the chiefs of the armed forces, Defense Minister George
Fernandes, Home Minister L. K. Advani and Finance Minister
Yashwant Sinha.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee allayed concerns expressed by political parties that
the government had accepted third-party mediation on Kargil,
saying India had made it clear that "there is no room for
third-party involvement, however well-intentioned."
</P>
<P>
He said India had been in close touch with the international
community to give diplomacy a chance to enable New Delhi to
achieve the objective of complete and unconditional withdrawal of
the Pakistan forces. This was not internalization of the Kashmir
question, he added.
</P>
<P>
After expressing satisfaction over the reaction of the
international community, Vajpayee said, "No outsider owes it to us
to reverse the present incursions. We alone are responsible for
safeguarding our security and protecting our interests. While we
are grateful for the support and understanding of the
international community, there will be no compromise on our
military operations."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Say Marriage Services Need A More Mature Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 7 (Xinhua)-- China's Social Economy Survey and
Research Center and the All-China Women's Federation plan to hold
a seminar on developing the marriage service business later this
month in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The Research Center's Xing Baojun says that more than 10
million Chinese have married every year in recent years and have
spent more than 100 billion yuan (12 billion US dollars) on candy,
photos, banquets, and ceremonies annually in the process.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a marriage anniversary culture is also taking
root in Chinese society, boosting spending in the marriage
business, Xing says, adding that many people are choosing to marry
this last year of the century, with the most popular date being
September 9, which, when combined with the year 1999, in Chinese
numerology signifies a long-lasting relationship.
</P>
<P>
However, Xing points out, there are no well-established
cigarette or wine brands, or souvenirs, garments, or other
products and services associated with the business, so the seminar
will invite companies and sociologists to jointly formulate a
strategy for developing the marriage service market in the next
century.

<P>
BEIJING, July 7 (Xinhua) -- At 9 o'clock this morning, 3.4
million Chinese high school students started the three-day
national college entrance examinations.
</P>
<P>
Half a month of continued high temperatures in Beijing had
worried parents and students about their performance on the exams,
but today's 25 degrees C in Beijing were better and China
Meteorology Bureau sources say that from July 7 to 9, most of
China will have moderate temperatures.
</P>
<P>
Some 50,000 Beijing high school students will take part in
today's exams. To provide a quiet and comfortable environment for
them, the Beijing municipal government has asked all building
sites to be quiet for the next three days, or suffer penalties.
</P>
<P>
At about half past nine, some parents who had accompanied their
children to the exam site at the middle school attached to the
Beijing Normal University were still hanging about, with hearts
reaching out to their beloved ones.
</P>
<P>
In fact, The Ministry of Education announced two increases in
college enrollment quotas this year. The ministry formerly set the
limit at 2.3 million, an increase of 230,000 over 1998's limit.
Then, last month, it announced that another 330,000 would be added,
meaning nearly 2.7 million people will be fortunate enough to
pursue further studies at college.

Parents say, however, that their children are still under great
pressure and that this change still does not guarantee that all
high school grads can have an opportunity to study in college.
</P>
<P>
China held a national conference on education last month, where
President Jiang Zemin asked government at all levels to give
priority to education and to push higher education reforms forward
and to improve quality.
</P>
<P>
Education specialists say that with the acceleration of higher
education reforms and the stress on quality, the 11 percent
college enrollment rate target set by the Ministry of Education is
expected to be reached ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
College freshmen will have to pay for tuition themselves this
year, but those who are unable to pay still have the possibility
of completing their college study. On September 1, the Chinese

BEIJING, July 7 (Xinhua)-- China's building materials industry

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Stresses Oil Exploration Under Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Oil exploration in Tanzania
is a union matter and the undertaking cannot be left in the hands
of the Zanzibar government alone, Tanzania's Deputy Minister for
Energy and Minerals Manju Msambya has said.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said here Wednesday that Msambya made the remarks
in the National Assembly, or parliament, in central town of Dodoma
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He was answering a question on whether it was the right time
for the government of Zanzibar to invite oil exploration companies
to do the job in the isles instead of having the task carried out
by the Union government.
</P>
<P>
"Oil exploration is a union matter, therefore it cannot be left
in the hands of the Zanzibar government alone to conduct it," the
Deputy Minister said.
</P>
<P>
A meeting aimed at reaching a consensus on the issue was held
in March last year between officials of the Union and Zanzibar
government ministries of energy and minerals, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting formed a 15-member committee to sort out
differences on the issue," Msambya said. "However, the committee
has so far not come up with any solution."
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that the Tanzania Investment Center and the
Zanzibar Investment Promotion Authority keep consulting each other
on investment opportunities in their areas through regular
meetings.
</P>
<P>
"The meetings also involve leaders of investment authorities in
Kenya and Uganda," he said. On the oil exploration in Tanzania,
Msambya said an Irish oil company had drilled two wells but no
sign of petroleum deposit could be traced.
</P>
<P>
The drilling was done by the Dublin International Petroleum
Limited of Ireland at Mandawa in southeastern Lindi Region from 26
November 1996 to 18 January 1997.
</P>
<P>
While the Irish company was continuing with the search for oil
within the same area, he said, a Canadian company, the Antrim
Resources of Canada expects to explore for petroleum on Zanzibar
islands.
</P>
<P>
"Though the Canadian firm has signed a contract with the
Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation in October 1997," the
Deputy Minister said, "Antrim Resources, now called Antrim Energy
Limited, is yet to be cleared by the Zanzibar government."
</P>
<P>
Tanganyika, or the Mainland, got independence from the British
colonial rule on December 9, 1961 while Zanzibar ended the
Sultanate rule on January 12, 1964 through a bloody revolution.
</P>
<P>
The two East African states merged on April 26, 1964 to form a
union - the United Republic of Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
According to the Constitution, the Union has a president and a
vice- president while Zanzibar is ruled by its own president.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Girls Twice Likely to Consider Suicide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Canadian girls are almost twice as
likely as boys to consider committing suicide, according to a
latest survey by Statistics Canada.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted for the first time last year, shows that
8.4 percent of the 12- and 13-year old girls had suicidal thoughts
in the year, as compared with 4.6 percent of boys.
</P>
<P>
The year also saw nearly 7 percent of children embarking on
their difficult teen years with serious ideas about killing
themselves.
</P>
<P>
Suicide researchers said the figures give statistical backing
to growing suspicions that young Canadians are plagued with
depression.
</P>
<P>
Gerry Harrington, Director of the Suicide Information and
Education Center in Calgary in western Canada, said that the rate
of death from suicide rose dramatically among very young children
over the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
From 1994 to 1996, the average rate of suicide for children
aged 10 to 14 in Canada was 2.2 for every 100,000, up from 1.2 per
100,000 a decade earlier.
</P>
<P>
The most important influence on suicidal thoughts is a child's
relationship with the parents, as illustrated by the survey data.
</P>
<P>
Children with a difficult relationship with their parents are 5.
5 times more likely than others to consider a suicidal plan.
</P>
<P>
But the survey also shows that 93 percent of the 12- and 13-
year-olds said they were happy with their way of life.

<HEADLINE> Reception Marks 38th Anniversary of Sino-DPRK Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese People's Association
for Friendship with Foreign Countries (CPAFFC) held a reception
this evening to mark the 38th anniversary of the signing of the
Sino-Korean Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual
Assistance.
</P>
<P>
CPAFFC President Qi Huaiyuan said at the occasion that China
and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) have observed
the spirit of the treaty by strengthening solidarity, promoting
friendship and cooperation and supporting each other since the
treaty was signed.
</P>
<P>
"This has not only promoted the full development of bilateral
ties, but also played an important role in safeguarding peace in
Asia and the world at large," Qi said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the June visit to China by Kim Yong Nam, the
president of the Presidium of the DPRK Supreme People's Assembly,
promoted friendship and cooperation, saying that under the current
international situation, the maintenance and promotion of Sino-
DPRK friendship and cooperation accords with the fundamental
interests of both peoples, and is also significant to peace and
stability in the Korean peninsula, northeast Asia and the world as
a whole.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK's ambassador to China, Chu Chang Jun, praised the
traditional friendship between the two countries, and said he
believes that the Sino-DPRK friendship, which was cemented by
blood, will continue to grow.

<HEADLINE> Iran Rejects Mediation over Disputed Islands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Wednesday rejected any
mediation by third parties between Iran and the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) to settle their territorial disputes over the
three islands in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
"We do not need any mediation by other parties to solve the
problem," Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi told
a press conference, adding the "misunderstanding" between Iran and
the UAE should be solved through bilateral and direct talks.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in a response to the recent formation of an
ad hoc committee by the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) to help
solve the Tehran-Abu Dhabi dispute over the islands of Abu Musa,
the Greater and the Lesser Tunbs.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi
Arabia and the UAE decided on Saturday to form a committee in
order to devise a mechanism to discuss the UAE-Iran dispute.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian spokesman underlined that UAE Foreign Minister
Rashid Abdullah al-Nuaimi should visit Tehran to answer the two
visits by his Iranian counterpart Kamal Kharrazi to Abu Dhabi.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the three islands of Abu Musa, the Greater
and Lesser Tunbs belong to Iran and are an integral part of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Iran and the UAE should remove the "misunderstanding" on the
basis of the letter of understanding signed between Iran and
Sharjah, one of the UAE's emirates, in 1971 to co-rule the Abu
Musa island, Asefi said.
</P>
<P>
Iran took over the islands in 1971 soon after the British
colonist forces withdrew from the region. However, both Tehran
and Abu Dhabi claimed full sovereignty over the islands.
</P>
<P>
Iran has repeatedly called for mutual talks to remove
"misunderstanding" between the two countries, but the UAE has
called for international arbitration to solve the dispute.
</P>
<P>
The GCC, which comprises Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Kuwait,
Bahrain, Oman and Kuwait, has announced its support for the UAE's
sovereignty over the islands and called for peaceful solution to
the Iran-UAE dispute.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia to Build 1st International Standard Jetty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's Sokimex Cambodian
Investment Co. Ltd. signed an investment deal Wednesday with
Japanese Marubeni Corporation on the construction of a jetty in
Sihanoukville, 230 kilometers from here.
</P>
<P>
"This cooperation project to be taken by the Sokimex Cambodia
Investment Co. Ltd. and Marubeni is the first large-scale joint
venture" between the two countries, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun
Sen noted.
</P>
<P>
"The construction of an international standard Sihanoukville
petroleum port will make great contribution to addressing the
infrastructure constraints facing our country in the new
millennium," he added.
</P>
<P>
The project is designed to accommodate a wide range of vessels,
from small coastal tankers of 5,000 tons to larger ones of 30,000
tons tankers with a length of more than 180 meters, according to
Sok Na, director general of Sokimex.
</P>
<P>
Sokimex is a local company established in 1991 for its
petroleum business in Cambodia. It has five petroleum depots with
a total capacity of 120,000 cubic meters to serve all its service
stations and industrial customers throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
The project requires a capital of 10 million U.S. dollars of
which 80.5 percent will be provided by Sokimex and 19.5 percent
by Marubeni. The construction is to commence this month and to be
completed by mid-2000.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Watersheds in Critical Condition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Around 90 percent of the watersheds
in the Philippines are by now categorized as hydrologically
critical due to their degraded ecological conditions, the
Department of Natural Resources and Environment (DENR) said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, DENR Secretary Antonio Cerilles identified at a
meeting 16 watershed areas that will be initially rehabilitated
and managed on the basis of the Watershed and Ecosystem Planning
and Management Framework approach.
</P>
<P>
Cerilles explained that the framework is a holistic,
multiple-use and sustainable management of all the resources
within a spatial unit known as a watershed.
</P>
<P>
"This framework provides for the management of all physical
assets found within a watershed including soil, water, timber and
non-timber products, as well as the people living in the area or
are affected therein, in a way that is environmentally sound,
economically viable and socially acceptable," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cerilles added that the framework is intended to arrest the
further degradation of the country's watersheds while enhancing
yield of high-quality water and restoring their other productive
and protection functions.
</P>
<P>
He said the DENR embarked on the framework "to prevent water
shortages, protect the country's food security by sustaining water
withdrawals of farmers through irrigation systems and to sustain
and increase the life span of the country's hydro-electric
projects."
</P>
<P>
Local annual water withdrawal has been estimated at 29.5 cubic
kilometers with agriculture accounting for 62 percent, industry 27
percent and domestic use 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
There are around 119 proclaimed watersheds in the Philippines
comprising some 419 river basins, which provide the major water
requirements of several irrigation systems, hydro-electric dams
and domestic and industrial water systems.

<HEADLINE> Membership Fee Arrears Affect OAU Operations: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The delay in payment of membership
fees has greatly affected the normal operations of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU), a senior official with the
continental organization said here Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, OAU spokesman Ibrahim
Gagash said the arrears have shot up to 49 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Nine member states now suffer from sanctions by the OAU
because they have not paid their fees for at least two years," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He urged these countries to pay their overdue membership fees
to help the organization out of the current financial difficulty.
</P>
<P>
"There are more countries more committed to the OAU, but the
financial problem is the prime impediment to the operations of the
departments within the 36-year-old African political bloc," Gagash
added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also said OAU's financial problem is high on the
agenda of the two-day ambassadorial meeting, which opened Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Driven by lack of fund and aspiration for high efficiency, the
organization is currently restructuring itself through an 18-month
program which is scheduled to complete by end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the restructuring project will not
affect the five deputy secretaries-generals of the OAU, because
they were elected and come from five different geographical
regions of the continent.
</P>
<P>
At present, a total of about 600 staff members, including 152
of the professional category recruited from over 41 member states
are in the service of the organization at the headquarters in
Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and other regional and sub-regional
offices.
</P>
<P>
The OAU was founded on June 25 of 1963 to promote unity and
solidarity among African states, to coordinate and intensify
cooperation, defend their sovereignty and to enhance international
cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Anelka to Seek Help from French Federation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 7 (Xinhua) -- French talented striker Nicolas Anelka
is mulling about turning to his national soccer federation for
help in his resolute bid to leave English Premier side Arsenal for
Italian club Lazio.
</P>
<P>
The Italian press said on Wednesday that Anelka has a legal
team working on the case and that they are prepared to ask the
French Football Federation for help in freeing the 20-year-old ace
from a contract with the Gunners which runs until 2003.
</P>
<P>
Anelka has said he would prefer to join Spanish first division
Real Madrid than Lazio but would rather play for the Rome side
than stay at Arsenal.
</P>
<P>
However, club bosses David Dein and Sergio Cragnotti have
failed to find common ground over the transfer price.
</P>
<P>
Italian news agency ANSA said the sticking point was a 12
billion lire (6.34 million U.S. dollars) discrepancy between
Arsenal's asking price and Lazio's offer.
</P>
<P>
English newspapers reported last month that Arsenal had sought
28 million pounds (44.60 million U.S.dollars) for Anelka in what
would be a world record for a straight cash transfer.
</P>
<P>
Anelka's lawyers would be willing to take the case to the
European Court, arguing that Arsenal were preventing the free
circulation of workers within the European Union, according to
local reports.

MANILA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- In anticipation of an eruption of
the Mayon volcano in the central Philippines, Agriculture
Secretary Edgardo Angara Wednesday announced the formation of a
task force that would focus on the plight of farmers who might be
displaced.
</P>
<P>
Angara said the task force has already begun listing farmers in
seven endangered villages where crops, livestock and
infrastructure are expected to be affected by an eruption of the
volcano in Albay Province.
</P>
<P>
He said the Agriculture Department has assigned a volunteer

<P>
According to Angara, the department will coordinate with the
local government units in case some farmers are relocated in areas
where they can start farming immediately.
</P>
<P>
"We are closely monitoring the developments in the volcano's
activity to further implement the disaster plans for our Albay
farmers who mainly depend on our agricultural resources," he said.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Get Aid for Power Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh has received a commitment
of 80 million U.S. dollars from Germany and Japan for the
improvement of its power sector, the national news agency BSS
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Of the committed 80 million dollars, the KFW, a donor agency in
Germany, will provide 72 million dollars for overhauling three
units of a power plant while the rest 8 million dollars will come
from the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund of Japan for another
two power plants, official sources were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government had sought 140 million dollars from
the donors for the rehabilitation of some of the existing old and
junk power plants to recover at least 300 megawatts of power.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank and the Asian Development Bank were asked to
provide the remaining 60 million dollars, but they put forward
certain conditions including incorporating the power stations and
handing over the transmission lines to the Power Grid Company
before committing the fund.
</P>
<P>
Extensive discussions are going on with the donors to get the
remaining portion of the fund for rehabilitating the power plants.
</P>
<P>
The government has also initiated discussions with Canada and
Italy for 15 million dollars for overhauling four other power
plants.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the overhauling work of the other existing power
plants is expected to recover 643 megawatts of power by June 2000.
</P>
<P>
At present, Bangladesh's existing 19 power plants are
generating 2,290 megawatts of power and 17 out of the 56 units of
these power plants remain closed due to a lack of repair.

South Africa's engagement with its southern African neighbors

Of South Africa's total trade, 35 percent was with Europe, and
that figure was growing, while only seven percent was with SADC

ISLAMABAD, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The supreme leader of the ruling

"Why didn't the Americans demand Osama from the previous Afghan
regimes," said the leader of the Taliban, which control 90 percent
of the war-torn Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Osama, a Saudi millionaire, had been in Afghanistan from the
late 1970s to the 1980s fighting against the Soviet invasion.
After being accused by the United States of masterminding the bomb
attacks on the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania last August,
Osama left his dwelling in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar in
February this year.
</P>
<P>
"The United States wants to show that it can do whatever it
wants as it is a mighty and powerful country and the entire world
is well aware of the injustice being done by the United States,"
Omar said.
</P>
<P>
He argued that he has no knowledge of Osama's whereabouts,
adding that the Taliban have not asked him to leave Afghanistan or
to stay.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that Osama is still in Afghanistan and receiving
support from the Taliban, U.S. President Bill Clinton Monday
signed an executive order imposing trade and economic sanctions on
the militia.
</P>
<P>
According to U.S. officials, the sanctions, however, will not
be applied on humanitarian aid and health services in
Afghanistan. The impacts of the sanctions will probably be modest
as U.S. trade with Afghanistan totaled a mere 24 million dollars
in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Foreign-Funded Firms Get More Access To Chinese Currency Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of China (PBOC)
has decided to make it easier for overseas-funded companies in
China to get renminbi loans.
</P>
<P>
According to an official at China's central bank, the new
policy will go into effect on July 15. It allows overseas-funded
firms to borrow runminbi loans from authorized local foreign
exchange banks in a simpler and easier way.
</P>
<P>
A foreign-funded company no longer needs to provide information
about its debts or security for the loans. Specific requirements
for ratings at a foreign bank who secures the loan will be
canceled and the Chinese foreign exchange bank will take its own
responsibility for assessing the risk of loans.
</P>
<P>
The new policy allows foreign-funded enterprises to have more
sources of security in foreign exchange such as borrowing as well
as capital and income under current accounts.
</P>
<P>
Under the new policy, the debtor is freer to spend the renminbi
loans because the only thing not permitted is purchasing foreign
exchange with the money. The term of the loans has also been
extended to as much as 5 years.
</P>
<P>
The PBOC hopes the new policy can help improve the investment
environment in China and spur overseas investment, the official
says.

NEW DELHI, July 7 (Xinhua) -- India Wednesday rejected

issue.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here from Islamabad, Pakistan's capital, said
Pakistan could appeal to the Mujahideen to withdraw from the

A spokesman of the Indian External Affairs Ministry said here

LOC, saying, "They would have to find their own way out."
</P>
<P>
Briefing reporters here, he said, "We reject this linkage
completely." The military operations would continue till every
inch of Indian territory was cleared of the intruders, he further
said.

Pakistan had conveyed to India any concrete steps to restore the

<HEADLINE> Roundup: EU Officials, Bankers Play Down Euro Weakness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The euro's weakness has dented
consumers' confidence in the 15 European Union (EU) countries as
shown in the latest EU poll while politicians and bankers have
been trying to play down the single currency's trouble, describing
it as "cyclical."
</P>
<P>
The European Central Bank (ECB) is due to hold a meeting on
Thursday to assess the decline in the value of the euro since its
launch at the beginning of this year. But EU officials have tried
hard to calm the fledgling single currency, according to a twice-
weekly report of the European Commission, the EU's executive body.
</P>
<P>
The report issued here Wednesday said Sirkka Haemaelaeinen, an
ECB board member, suggested last week that the euro's depreciation
was largely perceived to be a cyclical phenomenon and not a sign
of structural problems or of a lack of credibility.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD) argued in its latest report on "Financial
Market Trends" that investors retain their confidence in the euro
zone despite its current weakness.
</P>
<P>
But in its latest Eurobarometer poll published here on Tuesday,
the European Commission said 61 percent of the EU's population
were in favor of the currency while 28 percent were against during
spring this year. Last autumn, support was put at 64 percent and
opposition at 25 percent. In the euro zone, support for the euro
fell to 68 percent from 70 percent last October and November. The
survey showed the public support for the euro slightly dropped
after its launch.
</P>
<P>
Another ECB Board member, Eugenio Domingo, has suggested that
the depreciation of the euro dose not even pose a serious threat
of resurgent inflation in the euro zone.
</P>
<P>
The EU commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, Yves-
Thibault de Silguy, also reiterated his belief on June 29 that the
10 percent decline in the value of the euro since its launch is
because of growth differentials between the European bloc and the
United States, and the consequences of NATO's air war against
Yugoslavia. He also predicted that the euro has a "margin for
appreciation."
</P>
<P>
The new president of EU executive Commission, Romano Prodi,
warned last month that Italy's membership of the single currency
could be at risk if its domestic economic reform falters. He told
the Italian business circle that costs in Italy were still too
high. His comments had led to the euro dropping to a new low on
foreign exchange markets. However, the new EU head tried to talk
up the euro's value later, saying there was no danger of Italy
having to leave the single currency.
</P>
<P>
German central bank, the ECB's model of governance in monetary
policy, has also expressed optimism about the euro. Hans
Tietmeyer, the current head of the Bundesbank, said the currency
had enormous potential if it was politically convincing. His
successor, Ernst Welteke, echoed his view, saying the euro would
stabilize when the difference between interest rates in the United
States and Europe was reduced.
</P>
<P>
But the euro fell to a record low to the level of 1.02 against
the dollar last Thursday after the U.S. central bank raised its
interest key rate modestly.
</P>
<P>
Analysts in Europe believe that the euro's problem is the
contrasting position of the EU and U.S. economies. In addition to
signs of strong U.S. economic growth, they thought the euro was
also undermined by political pressure for lower rates and the
continuing inability of EU politicians to speak with common voice
on the new currency.
</P>
<P>
Actually, the European cental bankers are hoping the worst will
be over by the time the young and weak single currency reaches its
first anniversary next January since it shows no signs of a quick
recovery in a short period of time.

<HEADLINE> Iran Rejects Mediation over Disputed Islands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Wednesday rejected any
mediation by third parties between Iran and the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) to settle their territorial disputes over the
three islands in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
"We do not need any mediation by other parties to solve the
problem," Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi told
a press conference, adding the "misunderstanding" between Iran and
the UAE should be solved through bilateral and direct talks.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in a response to the recent formation of an
ad hoc committee by the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) to help
solve the Tehran-Abu Dhabi dispute over the islands of Abu Musa,
the Greater and the Lesser Tunbs.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi
Arabia and the UAE decided on Saturday to form a committee in
order to devise a mechanism to discuss the UAE-Iran dispute.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian spokesman underlined that UAE Foreign Minister
Rashid Abdullah al-Nuaimi should visit Tehran to answer the two
visits by his Iranian counterpart Kamal Kharrazi to Abu Dhabi.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the three islands of Abu Musa, the Greater
and Lesser Tunbs belong to Iran and are an integral part of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Iran and the UAE should remove the "misunderstanding" on the
basis of the letter of understanding signed between Iran and
Sharjah, one of the UAE's emirates, in 1971 to co-rule the Abu
Musa island, Asefi said.
</P>
<P>
Iran took over the islands in 1971 soon after the British
colonist forces withdrew from the region. However, both Tehran
and Abu Dhabi claimed full sovereignty over the islands.
</P>
<P>
Iran has repeatedly called for mutual talks to remove
"misunderstanding" between the two countries, but the UAE has
called for international arbitration to solve the dispute.
</P>
<P>
The GCC, which comprises Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Kuwait,
Bahrain, Oman and Kuwait, has announced its support for the UAE's
sovereignty over the islands and called for peaceful solution to
the Iran-UAE dispute.

<HEADLINE>   Wedding Invitation Row Causes Games' Boss Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Stratis Stratigis, president of the
2004 Athens Olympic Games organising committee (COJO), resigned
Tuesday due to a row over the invitation of him to the Royal
wedding, the Greek press reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Mr Stratigis was asked not to attend the wedding of the former
king's daughter by the prime minister himself. He insisted on
going and submitted his resignation which was accepted," one
official was quoted as saying by reports.
</P>
<P>
A personal friend of King Constantin, Stratigis was given an
ultimatum by the Greek government that he could only attend Friday
's wedding in London of the former sovereign's daughter Alexia if
he resigned, a COJO source said.
</P>
<P>
According to the government supporting daily newspaper Ta Nea,
Prime Minister Costas Simitis, who appointed Stratigis as COJO
chief eighteen months ago, did not want the Greek Republic to be
linked with the unpopular royalty which was overthrown in 1974.
</P>
<P>
Stratigis, who was appointed to the post in January 1998, on
Tuesday cited "personal reasons" for his decision to quit his post.
</P>
<P>
However, most newspapers here gave the royal wedding veto as an
excuse rather than reason for the resignation, particularly as
King Constantin is himself an International Olympic Committee (IOC)
member.
</P>
<P>
Athens 2004 and government officials have previously said
Stratigis has had disagreements with some COJO members, some of
whom have criticised his management style, described as forceful.
</P>
<P>
Quoting unidentified sources, The semi-offical ANA newsagency
ANA reported that Stratigis' resignation was precipitated by
government discontent at the pace of work on the Olympic effort
and a series of delays, notably in the choice of sites.
</P>
<P>
However, Jacques Rogge, president of the IOC organising
committee said that work was progressing satisfactory when he paid
an official visit to the Greek capital in May.
</P>
<P>
Stratigis' replacement is expected to be named in the next few
days with Yannis Manos, Greek Bank Union secretary, tipped as the
main contender.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Governor of West Siberia's Kemerovo
region, Aman Tuleyev, on Wednesday rejected the Order of Honor
award granted by President Boris Yeltsin in protest over "the low
quality of life of the population."
</P>
<P>
Tuleyev said his refusal to accept the award, bestowed Monday,
had been motivated by the fact that for many years he had
expressed "disagreement with the course of reforms that resulted
in the low quality of life of the population," the Itar-Tass news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot accept the award, when many people do not get their
earned wages, when more people die than are born in the country,
and when the brain of the nation -- its education and healthcare
system -- is paralyzed," Tuleyev said.
</P>
<P>
The governor was the second person to reject Yeltsin's awards
since last December, when Russian writer Alexander Solzhenitsin, a
Nobel Laureate, rejected Yeltsin's offer of an Order of St. Andrew
the First Summoned on the occasion of his 80th birthday.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot accept an award from the authorities that have
brought the country to its current disastrous position,"
Solzhenitsin said during the birthday party.
</P>
<P>
He also refused to accept the Nobel Prize in 1970, but later
changed his mind and picked up the prize in 1974.

<HEADLINE> UK Opposition Calls for Inquiry Into NATO Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- British opposition Conservatives
have called for an independent inquiry into evidence that NATO's
bombing campaign against Yugoslavia was far less effective than
the military alliance had claimed during the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Their demands was rejected by the British government on
Wednesday, a BBC report said.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Downing Street said the government has no
intention of holding an inquiry because the air campaign had
achieved its goals.
</P>
<P>
But he added that the Ministry of Defense would carry out its
own internal review of operations.
</P>
<P>
The Conservatives have cited reports that only 13 Yugoslav
tanks were destroyed during the conflict out of some 300 deployed
in Kosovo as evidence that many bombs missed their targets.
</P>
<P>
They claimed that the allied air campaign inflicted only light
damage on the Serbs' defenses.
</P>
<P>
The Serb forces withdrew "virtually unscathed" from Kosovo and
NATO to a large extent failed to achieve its goals of saving the
Albanian population, they said.
</P>
<P>
Their calls for an inquiry were backed by senior military
figures, including two former chiefs of defense staff.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, China, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Another four bodies of the
missing Japanese climbers from the Sino-Japan joint expedition
eight years ago has been discovered in Mount. Meili of Southwest
China's Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
The missing bodies and remains were initially found at the end
of June by local villagers who were grazing at the height of more
than 3,700 meters above sea level.
</P>
<P>
A eight-member searching team, which composed of experts from
Yunnan Physical Culture and Sports Bureau and Kyoto University of
Japan set off on June 30 to the scene where they gathered 100
kilograms of remained bones of bodies.
</P>
<P>
Judging from the remained bones, the searchers concluded that
they were the Japanese members of the joint expedition who missed
from an accident on January 3, 1991.
</P>
<P>
The 17-member climbing team, including 11 Japanese and six
Chinese, made an attempt at the virgin Mt. Meili but never came
back in a heavy snowfall in the 6,740-meter mountain.
</P>
<P>
Mt. Meili was yet to be scaled by any mountaineering
expeditions. The Sino-Japan expedition has tried three times in
1989, 1991, and 1996 but all came to no avail.

<P>
HARBIN, July 7 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese leader has advocated
charitable activities, saying that "helping the needy and
conducting charitable activities" should become a trend in China.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan, the Chairman of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC), made the remarks during a visit
to Heilongjiang Province July 2-7, where he said that displaying
the traditional morals of the Chinese people, promoting socialist
ethical and cultural progress, and continuing the government
policy to allow part of the people to become well-off first and to
achieve common riches at the end is very important.
</P>
<P>
Li, also a standing committee member of the political bureau of
the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, visited new houses
of some villagers who were made homeless by last year's summer
floods that devastated this northeastern province which damaged
820,000 houses and left 900,000 people homeless. A large amount of
donations came in from CPPCC members, private businesspeople, and
from overseas heeding a call by the CPPCC leader.

<HEADLINE> Military Maps Providing Evidence Of Japanese Invasion Of China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Six-two years ago on this day,
Japan started its war of aggression against China by attacking
Beijing across the Lugou Bridge in the southwestern suburbs.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-six military maps related to the incident were made
public today in Liaoning Province. Copies of the maps were
presented by an elderly collector who said he hopes this evidence
can make people more aware of the humiliating past.
</P>
<P>
Three of the maps are marked "Top Secret" and "Burn after Read",
while the rest all bear the word "Military Secret". Seals at the
back of each are for the "Japanese Land Force Officer Training
School".
</P>
<P>
The maps are drawn at a 500,000:1 scale and at the top right
bear the word "Manchuria", the Japanese designation for
northeastern China.
</P>
<P>
Two historians, Professor Xing Anchen from Liaoning University
and Professor Zhang Yipo from Liaoning Provincial Party School,
examined the original maps at the collector's home yesterday and
confirmed their authenticity. They were drawn in such explicit
detail that small paths through each village, and wells, temples
and rivers can be clearly seen.
</P>
<P>
The anonymous collector told the scholars that he bought them
from an old man in Hebei Province 15 years ago who introduced
himself as a former deputy regimental commander of the Kuomintang
(Nationalist Party) Army. The seller said that he got the maps
from an encounter with a small group of Japanese soldiers in Hebei
during the Japanese Aggression War (1937-1945).
</P>
<P>
The scholars said that the maps were made in 1932 and corrected
in 1936. They point out that the maps also substantiate the fact
that the war broke out on July 7 at Lugou Bridge and that this was
a long-premeditated act of aggression.

<HEADLINE> South Africa to Pursue Peace Agenda for Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 7 (Xinhua) -- South Africa will continue to
vigorously pursue the agenda for peace and conflict resolution on
the continent, Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Pahad said this before leaving for Algiers, where he will lead
the South African delegation to the 70th Ordinary Session of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) Council of Ministers this
week.
</P>
<P>
Pahad leads the South African delegation on behalf of Foreign
Minister Nkosazana Zuma, who is currently involved in the Lusaka
talks on Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
South Africa will submit a proposal on ways to curb the illicit
spread of small arms and light weapons to the Council of
Ministers, the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The illegal spread of these weapons not only fuels violence
and criminality but also impedes social upliftment and
democratization efforts on our continent", Pahad was quoted as
saying in the statement. The South African motion follows on the
successful campaign to ban anti-personnel land mines which the OAU
enthusiastically endorsed, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
South Africa also recently participated in the drafting of an
OAU convention to prevent and control terrorism in Africa and it
will seek to ensure that this draft text receives the necessary
attention during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, South Africa will table a draft text on the
development and protection of the coastal and marine environment.
The scourge of AIDS and joint partnerships to combat the epidemic
will also form part of the South African delegation's agenda, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the DRC conflict, the Council of Ministers will
also focus on the urgency of attempts to find a solution for the
conflicts on the continent including those in Angola, Burundi, the
Comoros, Guinea Bissau, Sierra Leone, Somalia and the signing and
implementation of the proposed OAU Framework Agreement with regard
to the escalating border dispute between Ethiopia and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
The Council of Ministers will also deal with structural reform
of the OAU and the possible review of the OAU Charter.
</P>
<P>
The Council of Ministers meeting from July 8 to 10 will be
followed by the 35th OAU summit of heads of state and government
from July 12 to 14, when South African President Thabo Mbeki will
speak on globalization and economic integration.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Ambassador: World Peace Key to Poverty Eradication </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- To safeguard world peace and
establish a favorable external environment is essential for
eradicating poverty and advancing the cause of women, said Chinese
Ambassador Qiao Zonghuai here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Warfare is the source of all evils. It not only causes
casualties, but also squanders considerable amount of money and
brings the society backward," Qiao said when delivering a speech
at the high-level segment of the 1999 substantive meeting of the
United Nations' Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC).
</P>
<P>
He said that the war staged not long ago in the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia is one typical example confirming that
women are usually the most direct victims of war and armed
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
"War makes them homeless, deprives them of their family members,
and more seriously, reduces them into poverty and their right to
subsistence," Qiao pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that a peaceful environment is the most fundamental
safeguard for advancing the cause of women and eradicating poverty.
Responsible nations or country blocs should never, with their
strong forces, bully the weaker, nor use or threaten to use forces
to destroy world peace.
</P>
<P>
"Only under such circumstances could favorable conditions be
established for the international efforts to advance women and
eradicate poverty," Qiao said.

ATHENS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Greece will deport an estimated 500,
000 illegal immigrants who have not applied for a green card to
work or who entered Greece illegally since the deadline for

immigrants who have not registered for a green card or have
entered the country illegally since November 30, 1997 would not be
allowed to remain in Greece legally.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are an estimated 700,000 illegal immigrants in
Greece. The deadline for submissions ended on June 1, 1998. In

<HEADLINE> Iran's Conservative Parliament Approves Tough </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Iran's conservative-dominated Majlis
(parliament) Wednesday approved the general outlines of the new
tough press law, threatening to put more strict rules and
pressure on the country's freedom-seeking press.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Republic News Agency reported that 125 out of the
215 lawmakers in the 270-seat Majlis voted in favor of the
amendment bill to the press law while 90 voted against it.
</P>
<P>
The conservative-sponsored bill was passed after about 200
minutes of deliberations in the Majlis and long-time debates
between the conservative and moderate factions as well as their
media.
</P>
<P>
The new law will force reporters to reveal their sources on any
controversial stories and provide the conservative-dominated
organs with more supervisory powers.
</P>
<P>
The moderates blamed the bill for imposing some restrictions
on the press in contradiction with certain principles of the
constitution, depriving journalists and writers of their social
rights, bringing into control and limit of press activities.
</P>
<P>
They also argued that the new law would lessen the role of the
minister of culture and Islamic guidance, disturb the country's
information dissemination system, harm international prestige of
the country and bring a special faction to rein over the press.
</P>
<P>
However, the conservatives maintained that the bill would help
defend the Islamic and revolutionary values by preventing
outsider's infiltration into the press.
</P>
<P>
Iran's conservative Majlis Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq Nouri in
favor of the new law called on the Iranian lawmakers to vote for
the bill in principle and to hold further discussion on the
details in the future.
</P>
<P>
Observers said that the new law was proposed by the
conservatives with the aim of undermining the political and social
reforms started with the election of President Mohammad Khatami
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
During the past two years, several pro-Khatami newspapers and
weeklies were closed down under the order of the Islamic
revolutionary court, which, in the view of the moderates, has no
right to intervene in press affairs.
</P>
<P>
Moderate pressmen warned that the restrictions imposed by the
new press law would cause more closures of newspapers in the
future.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese international defender Sun
Jihai received both applauds and boos for his powerful strike
which gave his English first-division club Crystal Palace a 2-1
win over China's Beijing Guo'an in a friendly Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Sun, who was transferred from China's Dalian Wanda to the
London club last summer, stroke the second goal of the visiting
side in the 56th minute.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Olympic player had a spectacular 60-minute
performance before walked out of the pitch in waves of applauds
and boos from the 10,000 fans in the Workers stadium.
</P>
<P>
"It feels good to score on Guo'an club's grass for the Crystal
Palace," Sun said. "I would be happier if I could score in Dalian.
"
</P>
<P>
Crystal Palace head coach Steve Copple was satisfied with
performances of Sun and Sun's country fellow Fan Zhiyi, a former
Shanghai Shenhua center back, who moved to England alongside with
Sun last season.
</P>
<P>
"They both played very well," Copple said. "Sun scored the goal,
and I was very pleased."
</P>
<P>
"This is our first game in eight weeks," he added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton Morrison opened the mark with a 33rd-minute header from
a Sun's cross, while Han Xu pulled one back for Guo'an five
minutes before the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
Crystal Palace will play Liaoning Fushun, another Chinese first-
division side, on Saturday.

KUNMING, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Tibet Week, a part of the World
Horticulture Exposition in the city of Kunming, capital of China's
Yunnan Province, opened today.
</P>
<P>
The Exposition, which started on May 1 and runs through October

horticultural traditions and products of the Tibetans.
</P>
<P>
Nyima Cering, a vice-chairman of the Tibet Autonomous Region
government, addressed the opening ceremony, where he described the
economic potential of Tibet and announced that the next century
will witness the economic take-off of the plateau.
</P>

He said that Tibet is an ideal place to grow grain, vegetables,
and other plants because it is like a greenhouse with its long
periods of daylight and great temperature difference between day
and night.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that, after decades of work, Tibet has built
up its infrastructure like roads, airports, and telecommunications
and he invited investors and tourists to visit Tibet.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Works to Attract Foreign Technopreneurs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Singapore has made changes to its
immigration rules to let foreign technopreneurs stay longer in the
city state to explore business opportunities, the Home Affairs and
Manpower Ministries announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign technopreneurs who are not yet employed but have a
feasible start-up plan can now stay in Singapore for up to six
months, according to the new rules on the Long-Term Social Visit
and Work Passes.
</P>
<P>
With support from the National Science and Technology Board
(NSTB), foreign technopreneurs could stay up to a year.
</P>
<P>
For technopreneurs who have moved on to start a new business,
the Employment Pass Department will issue Q1 work passes for them,
which have a two-year period and renewable for another three.
</P>
<P>
To qualify, the applicants need the NSTB's support and will be
assessed on their qualifications, funds available and experiences.
</P>
<P>
For a start-up in which a group of technopreneurs are involved,
the Ministry of Manpower can accept team applications for the work
passes.
</P>
<P>
These changes will take effect in September this year.
</P>
<P>
At present, work passes are issued to foreigners who have found
employment in Singapore.

<P>
LONDON, July 7 (Xinhua) - The United Kingdom is to resume full
diplomatic relations with Libya after a break of 15 years, Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook told the House of Commons on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Britain cut its ties with Libya in 1984 after the shooting of
policewoman Yvonne Fletcher outside the Libyan embassy in London
during a protest against Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi.
</P>
<P>
Cook said Libya had agreed general responsibility for her death
and would help police find her killers and to compensate Fletcher'
s family.
</P>
<P>
"The two agreements we have secured open the way for us to
resume diplomatic relations with Libya," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, officials from the foreign office had said that
British ambassador could be back in Tripoli, the capital of Libya,
by the autumn.

<HEADLINE> France Urges Israel to Implement Wye Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- France on Wednesday urged Israel to
implement the Wye agreements signed with the Palestinians and
hoped that the assumption of office of Prime Minister Ehud Barak
will re-open the perspective of peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"Thanks to the election of Ehud Barak, his speech made
yesterday at the Knesset, and his taking office with a very large
majority, a perspective of peace is re-opened for the Middle East,
" said French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret.
</P>
<P>
"The perspective of a global peace such as was sketched by Mr.
Barak implies the implementation of the Wye Plantation agreements,
which is very important for creating a new climate of confidence,"
she added.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman said France welcomed Barak's intention to seek
"a courageous peace" with all Arab countries, including the
Palestinians, Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"We know that the road will be difficult. We are ready to
bring the most useful help to the efforts which the Israeli
government will make," she said.
</P>
<P>
The Wye agreements, signed in October 1998, commit Israel to
withdraw its troops from 13.1 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
But they were only partially followed by Barak's predecessor
Benjamin Netanyahu, who ordered the pullout of troops from Naplus.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to See Tourism Boom in Near Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Turkey will spare no efforts in
further developing the country's booming tourism sector in a bid
to double tourism income within five years, said Turkish Tourism
Minister Erkan Mumcu here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, the 36-year-old minister
said that Turkey enjoys a lot of advantages both historically and
geographically in developing the tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
Turkey generated 8.3 billion U.S. dollars from tourism in 1998
with over 9.7 million foreign tourists visiting the country. The
tourism revenues were 300 million dollars in 1983, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government attaches great importance to the tourism
industry and has invested an estimated 35 billion dollars in the
sector.
</P>
<P>
High-quality service is crucial to attracting tourists, said
the minister, adding that Turkey has a total of over 317,000 beds
in the tourism sector, including 67 five-star hotels.
</P>
<P>
However, the global economic crisis and the Kosovo crisis have
exerted a negative impact on Turkish tourism, said Mumcu.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the capture of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party
(PKK) leader Abdullah Ocalan in mid-February had led to an
anti-Turkey propaganda campaign across Europe. And as a result
many western tourists had canceled their reservations.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has suffered a loss of 25 percent in tourism revenues in
the first five months of this year compared with the corresponding
period of 1998 due to the above reasons.
</P>
<P>
For the recovery of tourism, Turkey has been launching
promotion campaigns such as inviting foreign journalists to Turkey
which enjoys peace and stability and the move has achieved
positive results so far, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Mumcu added that "now more foreign tourists have been coming
to visit Turkey and the Turkish tourism will be improved in the
second half of this year."
</P>
<P>
In order to develop tourism in the Black Sea, Turkey is
planning to make some joint projects with the United States and
Australia, said the minister.

<HEADLINE> Russia, Belarus Expected to Sign Union Treaty Next Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Russia and Belarus may sign a treaty
next fall on the establishment of a union state between them,
Russian Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A program of steps to be taken in creating a union state must
be drafted simultaneously with the treaty in this month,
Stepashin told the Executive Council of the union of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The two sides do not essentially differ on the structure or
contents of the treaty, Stepashin said.
</P>
<P>
"Russia and Belarus are strategic allies. We will not change
this view," the Interfax news agency quoted Stepashin as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We are moving ever closer to becoming a unified state,"
Stepashin said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting followed Belarussian President Alexander
Lukashenko's complaint of Russia's slow pace in establishing the
union and threat to get closer to the West if Moscow does not
speed up.
</P>
<P>
The statements prompted a quick response from Moscow, with
Russian President Boris Yeltsin ordering the Stepashin cabinet to
do its best to enter the 21st century as a union state with
Belarus.
</P>
<P>
"The success of the union and the views we shared on events
surrounding Yugoslavia have forced quite a few people to take a
closer look at our plans," Stepashin said.
</P>
<P>
Both Russia and Belarus have condemned NATO's 78-day air
strikes against Yugoslavia and the military alliance's eastward
expansion.
</P>
<P>
Most people of both countries support the idea of a union, but
their faltering economies have been a major obstacle in the way of
a single state.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin said trade turnover between the two countries has
been dropping and bottlenecks have been appearing in defense
supplies, transport and energy cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"We must focus on important issues and put minor things aside,
" Stepashin said.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Deputy PM Says No Disputes Among GCC States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Deputy Premier Prince
Sultan Bin Abdul Aziz said here Wednesday that there are no
disputes among Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) member states and
they are all cooperating to realize their common aspirations.
</P>
<P>
Prince Sultan, who is also Saudi defense minister, made the
remarks when meeting President of the United Arab Emirates (UAE)
Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan.
</P>
<P>
The meeting dealt with fraternal ties between the UAE and
Saudi Arabia as well as issues of concern to the GCC countries,
said the official WAM news agency.
</P>
<P>
Prince Sultan's visit came after the defusing of a friction
between Abu Dhabi and Riyadh over the latter's efforts to improve
ties with Iran, which the UAE accuses of occupying its Gulf
islands of Abu Musa and Greater and Lesser Tunbs.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has always required its fellow GCC members, which also
include Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Bahrain, to help
solve the islands dispute first before warming up ties with Iran.
</P>
<P>
The prince, who arrived here Wednesday afternoon, also said
that his two-day visit was aimed at supporting the decision made
by the GCC to help solve the UAE-Iran islands issue.
</P>
<P>
GCC foreign ministers established a tripartite committee last
Saturday with members from Saudi Arabia, Oman and Qatar. The
committee will help work out a mechanism to start direct
negotiations with Iran over the islands.
</P>
<P>
The committee "is a practical step approved by the leaders of
the GCC countries," WAM quoted Prince Sultan as saying.
</P>
<P>
The prince also "expressed the hope that Iran, the friend and
sister country, would respond to the good and rational intention
in order to establish cooperation between Iran and Gulf states,"
WAM said.
</P>
<P>
Riyadh has stressed that the rapprochement with Iran will
continue, as it will benefit the whole region.
</P>
<P>
Iranian President Mohammed Khatami made landmark visits to
Riyadh and Doha in May. The visits opened a new page for Iran-GCC
relations.

<P>
Reports reaching here from Islamabad, Pakistan's capital, said
Pakistan could appeal to the Mujahideen to withdraw from the
Indian side of the Line of Control (LOC) if India promised to
solve the whole Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Indian External Affairs Ministry said here
that his country also ruled out any move on its part to facilitate
the withdrawal of the "infiltrators" from the Indian side of the
LOC, saying, "They would have to find their own way out."
</P>
<P>
Briefing reporters here, he said, "We reject this linkage
completely." The military operations would continue till every

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, July 7 (Xinhua) -- China's oldest special economic
zone today released a rosy foreign trade report for the first half
of the year with a year-on-year increase of 8.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The city had 22.3 billion U.S. dollars worth of foreign trade
for the period, with imports climbing up 3.9 percent to 12.3
billion dollars and exports up 15.6 percent to 9.96 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Li Zibin attributes the good growth to the combined
efforts of Customs officers and revenue departments and says that
they have helped reverse a continued fall in export for the first
four months.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen is one of China's most important exporters, with
exports that accounts for 14 percent of the country's total. It
also had 1.35 billion U.S. dollars worth of overseas investment in

<HEADLINE> EU to Strike Plans for WTO's New Round of Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The European Union (EU)'s executive body will on Thursday
detail the negotiating issues it hopes to be endorsed by the EU
trading partners, the July 7 issue of the European Report said.
</P>
<P>
The plans were prepared for the so-called "Millennium Round" of
multilateral trade talks, during which different trade issues like
agriculture, services, environment and public procurement will be
tackled in a single undertaking.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive body has proposed a policy document calling
for investment talks to start from scratch without transferring
the results of the aborted negotiations on the Multilateral
Agreement on Investment among members of the Organization of
Economic Cooperation and Development.
</P>
<P>
The Commission said the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP)
will come under fierce attack during the talks from the United
States and the Cairns Group of agricultural-exporting nations
campaigning against subsidies.
</P>
<P>
But the Commission said it will defend CAP, pointing to the
reforms already undertaken in the EU's Agenda 2000 reform package.
At the same time, the EU executive body also vowed to attack the
United States for its heavy use of 5.5 billion U.S. dollars a year
in export credits for American farmers.
</P>
<P>
The European Union's plans for the new round WTO trade talks
include placing investment, competition and environment on the
agenda of the Seattle negotiations, integrating developing
countries more fully into the open multilateral trading system,
and promoting dialogue with civil society in a bid to improve
understanding of the benefits of the world's trading system, the
European Report said.
