<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania is to take
eight major measures to face the challenges posed by
globalization in the next century, Prime Minister Frederick
Sumaye said.
</P>
<P>
Opening a symposium on "Tanzania at the Dawn of the 21st
Century" here Thursday, Sumaye listed the measures as pursuing
disciplined and coherent national policies, promoting stable
macro-policies and desirable structural changes in the economy
and improving co-ordination of monetary and fiscal policies.
</P>
<P>
Other measures include maintaining low inflation, harmonizing
national policies with policies within the east African region,
the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and Common
Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA).
</P>
<P>
Steps also include promoting expansion and modernization of
infrastructure, encouraging private sector participation in all
sectors of the economy on build-operate-transfer (BOT) basis and
creation of favorable environment to encourage domestic and
international investors.
</P>
<P>
"As a nation, we must be quick enough to transform our
regulated economy to a market-based and global economy," he was
quoted by The Guardian as saying.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said Tanzania must change its development
strategy and attract foreign capital and technology so as to get
integrated with other economies in the world in the process of
globalization.

<HEADLINE> Cassava Under Threat on Tanzania's Pemba Island </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania plans to adopt
biological methods to control cassava millburg, a pest which is
destroying the cassava food crop growing on the Pemba island, off
the east coast of the country's mainland.
</P>
<P>
Cassava millburg insects have destroyed hectares after
hectares of the crop in areas of Micheweni, Wete, Mkian and Chake
Chake on the island, the latest issue of The Express reported.
</P>
<P>
"The annual cassava crop yields have dropped to 51 percent due
to cassava millburg attack," said Mwinyi Haji Makame, principal
secretary in the Ministry of Agriculture Livestock and Natural
Resources.
</P>
<P>
Mwinyi told the paper that his ministry plans to disseminate
special pests (predator) to swallow millburg which threatens the
existence of the crop. Results of using the predator insects in
Unguja proved to be effective, he added.
</P>
<P>
Not that all the necessary preparations have been done, Mwinyi
said, they are waiting for a decrease in the current spring
rainfall.

<HEADLINE> One Fifth Americans Contact Police: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 22 (Xinhua) -- One out of five Americans,
about 45 million people, have some sort of face-to-face contact
with police officers each year, says a Justice Department survey
released Saturday.
</P>
<P>
People contact police mostly to report a crime or offer or seek
help, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
Very few of those people, less than one percent, said police
had used or threatened to use physical force, the survey found. If
force was used, respondents said it was usually because they
provoked the officers into becoming aggressive.
</P>
<P>
One-third of those having contact seek police help, a third
witness a crime or report a crime to police and a little less than
a third are approached by police for some reason.
</P>
<P>
The study finds about 1 percent of 6,421 responding to a
scientific survey say police used force or threatened force
against them.
</P>
<P>
A majority of that 1 percent say their own actions may have
provoked police.
</P>
<P>
The Police-Public-Contact Survey, part of the report, "Police
Use of Force," was jointly published by the department's Bureau of
Justice Statistics and the National Institute of Justice. It
covers a 12-month- period ending in mid-1996.
</P>
<P>
People in their 20s were the most likely to have such contact,
while those 60 or older were least likely.
</P>
<P>
The survey says the most common reason for contact between
police and public was to report a crime, followed closely by
traffic tickets.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Promotes National Education Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton said here today that the best way to give children the
world-class education in the next century is to set up high
standards of academic achievement.
</P>
<P>
"When we fail to encourage our children and expect a lot of
them, we, in fact, encourage them to fail," said Clinton in his
weekly radio address.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he is confident that voluntary national exams in
reading and math will become a reality. It was a vital measuring
tool to help parents, teachers and school officials demand
accountability and excellence, he added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton signed an education bill last week that supports the
high national standards and the development of the first ever
voluntary test of fourth graders in reading and eighth graders in
math.
</P>
<P>
A 25-member board, set up by Congress in 1988, was wrapping up
two days of meetings on developing the proposed tests, with a
pilot exam proposed for next fall.
</P>
<P>
The board was given control over the tests in a compromise this
month with congressional opponents, mostly Republicans.
</P>
<P>
Under the same bill, another independent body, the National
Academy of Sciences, must determine whether an array of existing
tests offered by states and commercial test publishers can be used
instead of newly created tests proposed by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"As we raise standards for our children, we'er also providing
them with the tools they need to meet the challenge and seize the
opportunities of the 21st century," said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Working together, Clinton said, "We'er lifting our children's
sights, raising their hopes and honoring our obligation to improve
education today so that they can meet the challenge of tomorrow."

<HEADLINE> New York Subway Crime Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Crime jumped 14 percent in
New York subways so far this year, the New York Time reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The last four months saw noticeable increases in crime cases,
with thefts rising 79 percent, assaults 44 percent and robberies
38 percent compared to the same period last year, the paper said,
quoting police figures released this week.
</P>
<P>
The situation is in contrast to a 15 percent decline in
citywide crime this year.
</P>
<P>
Lower levels of underground police supervising are partly
blamed for the subway crime jump.
</P>
<P>
Patrol staff in the city's 486 subway stations dropped from
2,900 in 1993 to 2,200 this year. A two percent growth in
ridership has also expanded police workload.
</P>
<P>
Some criminologists say more intense crackdown on street crime
may have driven offenders underground to the subway.

PARIS, November 22 (Xinhua) -- France is sending two million
francs (about 334,000 U.S. dollars) of humanitarian aid to the
victims of flood in Somalia and has offered two helicopters to
Ethiopia, which is also affected by flood caused by month-long
torrential rainfalls.

<HEADLINE> Waigel Re-elected as German CSU Party Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Munich, November 22 (Xinhua) -- German Finance Minister Theo
Waigel was re-elected today as leader of the Christian Social
Union (CSU), the Bavarian sister party of German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU).
</P>
<P>
Waigel's leadership was confirmed at the CSU party congress at
Munich, capital city of the Bavaria state. However, he only
managed to win about 85 percent of the votes, his poorest showing
since he first took the post nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that Waigel was still suffering from his party
members' anger over his controversial remarks made last Summer which
led to speculations that he was tired of being the top manager of
a German economy which is plagued with structural problems and
record-high unemployment.
</P>
<P>
In a keynote speech made to the congress today, Waigel voiced
determination to lead his party to achieve another victory in the
next general elections in September 1998 in alliance with Kohl's
CDU party.
</P>
<P>
CSU, CDU and their junior coalition partner, the Free
Democratic Party (FDP), has been in power in Bonn since 1982.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the CSU congress as guest speaker, Kohl today also
expressed confidence in the CDU-CSU alliance, pledging that the
two sister parties would remain the "decisive power in Germany"
after the general elections.

<HEADLINE> French Oil Group to Reduce Green House Gas Emission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The French oil group
Elf-Aquitaine will reduce the emission of green house gases by 15
percent by 2010 as compared with 1990, Agence France-Presse quoted
an Elf spokesman as saying today.
</P>
<P>
The measure is a follow-up of the recommendations by the
European Union and in expectation of the guidelines on
environmental protection to be adopted by the world conference on
global warming to be held in Kyoto, Japan, in December.
</P>
<P>
The voluntary engagement will affect all industrial sites of
Elf-Aquitaine around the world, as well as exploration and
production of the oil group.
</P>
<P>
The oil group will control the emission of three gases: carbon
dioxide (CO2), methane, and nitrous oxide, which is linked with
fertilizer production.
</P>
<P>
The emission of the three gases by Elf in 1990 amounted to an
equivalent of 42 million tons of CO2, which equal the national
volume of the emission of such gas in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Elf said that the most important measures will be taken in
exploration and production fields. Instead of letting them out
into the air, the gases will be taken back, contained and sold if
possible, or reinjected into the gas fields.

<HEADLINE> FSA Gives UK Banks EMU Warning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 22 (Xinhua) - British banks have been warned
against complacency about the increased competition likely to
follow European monetary union (EMU).
</P>
<P>
Howard Davies, chairman of the Financial Services Authority
(FSA), said EMU would bring extra cost pressures as banks faced
the expense of adapting their systems with few prospects for
offsetting revenue gains in the short term.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a conference on European economic and monetary
union at the week end, Davies said the single currency would
change the competitive playing field for European banks.
</P>
<P>
EMU would make it easier for foreign banks to challenge the
dominant national banks, increasing cross-border competition.
</P>
<P>
He warned that some banks appeared to believe sheer customer
inertia would enable them to survive this increased competition.
</P>
<P>
"I'm personally never very happy when I hear a bank say its
fundamental forward strategy is based on the innate conservatism
of its customers," he warned.
</P>
<P>
Countries with high interest rates would earn far less on their
customers' interest-free deposits as rates converge across the
euro area, Davies said.
</P>
<P>
Participants of the conference agreed that the euro is proving
an important catalyst to the restructuring of the financial
services industry in Europe.

<HEADLINE> Interior Minister: Egypt Checks Security Laxity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Interior Minister Habib
el-Adli said today steps have been taken to fill up the security
loopholes revealed by the deadliest attack in Egypt's five-year
Islamic militant insurgency.
</P>
<P>
"There is no going back or hesitation in... a decisive combat
of extremism and terrorism," said el-Adli in his first statement
before the People's Assembly on the Luxor massacre.
</P>
<P>
A total of 62 foreign tourists and Egyptians were killed and
dozens wounded when Islamic militants randomly opened fire in
front of the Hatshepsut Temple in Luxor, southern Egypt, on
Monday. Six gunmen were killed in a shoot-out with the police.
</P>
<P>
The newly-appointed minister said security measures have been
tightened at tourist sites and complete coordination has been
established among the agencies of the ministries of defense and
interior to secure mountaneous areas, which have been favorable
hideouts of the country's Islamic militants in the south.
</P>
<P>
The tourism and antiquities police have been joined together
under one administration to realize more coordination, he said. A
special committee has also been formed to give security strategy.
</P>
<P>
El-Adli, who replaced his predecessor Hassan Al Alfy after the
incident, said swift changes have also been made in leaderships in
the security sector.
</P>
<P>
"Those who were posted to protect the place but failed to do so
will be brought to account with the completion of investigations,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
El-Adli has already sacked or demoted many senior interior
officials appointed by Al Alfy to revamp security for tourists who
spend more than 3 billion U.S. dollars in Egypt annually.
</P>
<P>
Without elaborating, he said an effective system will be worked
out to execute and follow up the security plan as well as check
the performance of the security forces.
</P>
<P>
The plan includes more financing for security, specialized
anti-terrorist training for police, more sophisticated weaponry
and increased civilian participation, according to the Arabic
Al-Akhbar Al-Youm newspaper today.
</P>
<P>
El-Adli also blamed "outside quarters" for planning and
supporting the terrorist operations in Egypt and urged the
government to adopt a clear attitude towards those countries that
harbor extremists in exile.
</P>
<P>
The attack carried out by Islamic militants threatens to
devastate Egypt's tourism industry, the mainstay of its
economy. Thousands of tourists have canceled trips to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,300 people have been killed in the Islamic
rebellion since 1992, most of them militants and police.

<P>
MOSCOW, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
and U.S. President Bill Clinton discussed the situation in Iraq by
telephone today, the Interfax news service said.
</P>
<P>
In the 45-minute phone call Yeltsin expressed satisfaction with
the fact that vigorous efforts by Russia, the United States and
other permanent members of the U.N. Security Council have enabled
all members of the U.N. Special Commission on Iraq to return to
the arab country to resume disarmament inspections, the Kremlin
press service was quoted as saying.

reached by the U.N. Security Council permanent members in Geneva
on November 20, 1997 to continue joint efforts to make Iraq comply
with U.N. resolutions, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin stressed the need to make use of the positive
developments and focus on political and diplomatic steps to solve
the Iraq problem. For this, he said, the Russian and U.S.
representatives on the Security Council must continue joining
forces to make the Special Commission's work effective and rapid.
</P>
<P>
At the telephone conversation Yeltsin and Clinton also
discussed bilateral relations and international issues, including
the upcoming summit of the Asia-Pacific Cooperation forum to begin

<HEADLINE> UNSCOM Ends Emergency Session on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 22 (xinhua) -- The United Nations
Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of scraping Iraqi weapons of
mass destruction concluded its emergency session early today with
a series of recommendations on improving arms inspections in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The session, which began on Friday afternoon, was attended by
a UNSCOM advisory board of experts in arms control and government
officials.
</P>
<P>
In the session, the members of the Commission recalled that the
effectiveness and the speed with which the Commission may
accomplish its responsibilities is determined by the degree to
which the Government of Iraq cooperates in disclosing the full
extent and disposition of its proscribed program and in granting
the Commission unimpeded access to sites, documents and records
the Commission wishes to inspect and to individuals requires to
interview.
</P>
<P>
Expressed their satisfaction that 817 of the 819 proscribed
missiles imported by Iraq have been effectively accounted for, the
members of the Commission noted priority requirements in this
field: clarification of and accounting for Iraq's indigenous
production of proscribed missiles.
</P>
<P>
The members of the Commission recognized the significant
progress in the area of chemical weapons, saying considerable of
chemical weapons, their components and chemical weapons-related
equipment have been destroyed by Iraq and UNSCOM, in cooperation.
</P>
<P>
They noted the priorities in this area should be given to the
accounting for special warheads for the Al Hussein missiles, the
extent of Iraq's efforts to produce and weaponize the chemical
warfare agent VX and the material balance of chemical munitions
declared by Iraq as having been destroyed during the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The members of the Commission said the biological weapons is
the most serious and persistent area where Iraq has disregarded
its obligations to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The members of the Commission recommended Executive Chairman of
UNSCOM Richard Butler and the Government of Iraq undertake a
further review of the modalities for the notification and conduct
of air operation within Iraq, so as to simplity and expedite those
modalities.
</P>
<P>
They recommended the Security Council encourage Governments to
make experts available for monitoring missions so as to broaden
the multinational nature of inspection teams and improve the
efficiency of the inspections.
</P>
<P>
The members of the Commission also recommended the Executive
Chairman examine ways to rationalize and simplify the many
documents covering the monitoring regime.
</P>
<P>
The UNSCOM board, established under the resolution 687 (1991)
of the security council, normally comprises 21 members including
Executive and his deputy. They meet twice a year and had completed
its last session just as the current crisis with Iraq began.

<HEADLINE> Asia's Prospects Are "Very Good", Chretien </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VANCOUVER, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Asia's prospects are "very
good" despite the current financial crises in some Asian
countries, Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien said here today.
</P>
<P>
"As far as the longer-term prospects for the Asia Pacific are
concerned, let me be categorical: they are very good -- beyond
question," Chretien told the APEC CEO summit here.
</P>
<P>
Since July, some Asian economies such as Thailand, Indonesia,
the Philippines and Malaysia have been swept by a financial
turmoil, forcing some of them to seek support from the
International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
South Korea became the latest victim in this Asia malaise. On
Friday, the country said it will seek a 20 billion U.S. dollar
bailout from the IMF.
</P>
<P>
"The problems of today are no doubt serious, but they are by no
means unique to this region," Chretien said of the current crises.
</P>
<P>
Others have faced the same difficulties in the past and "have
more than successfully resolve them".
</P>
<P>
"I have no doubt at all that the same will be true for the
current situation," the prime minister noted.
</P>
<P>
While saying there are no "one-size fits all" solutions in the
global economy, Chretien offered some "fundamental principles that
do apply across the board."
</P>
<P>
"Two aspects of economic management deserve special emphasis:
maintenance of a stable macro-economic environment, and a
transparent and robust investment environment," Chretien said.
</P>
<P>
"These are the policies I will urge all APEC members to follow
in order to resolve the current problems in Asian economies and to
provide for strong growth in the future," he noted.

<HEADLINE> Rabbani Hopes OIC Summit to Solve Afghan Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Afghan President Burhanuddin
Rabbani expressed the hope here today that the upcoming summit of
the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), to be held here
on December 9-11, would help put an end to the current Afghan
civil war.
</P>
<P>
While meeting with Iranian Majlis (Islamic Consultative
Assembly) Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq Nouri, Rabbani said that
Afghanistan expects the OIC summit to launch a serious effort to
put an end to the civil war in the country, Iranian official news
agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Afghanistan is in very need of peace and tranquility, he said,
adding that his country appreciated Iran's peace efforts in this
respect.
</P>
<P>
Rabbani, currently in Iran for medical treatment, also blamed
foreign countries for intervening in Afghanistan, saying that the
foreign interference has led the country into the current dilemma.
</P>
<P>
Nouri also said Afghanistan can solve the problem by itself if
certain foreign countries do not meddle in the Afghan affairs.
</P>
<P>
He said Iran will not remain indifferent toward the Afghan
crisis and will not spare any effort to help it resolve the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Rabbani government was ousted from Afghan capital city of
Kabul by Muslim militant group Taliban in September 1996. Then
most of the Afghan groups formed a coalition front to fight
against the Taliban forces.
</P>
<P>
The anti-Taliban coalition forces announced recently to form a
"broad-based" national transition government within one month with
Rabbani, of which the posts of president and government will be
divided among various groups including the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
The new provisional government will rule the country only for
nine months until a permanent government was elected by the people.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that the coalition has invited the Taliban to
join the talks among the leaders of various Afghan groups aimed
at forming a government of national consensus.
</P>
<P>
However, no report was available about the response of the
Taliban forces towards the decision of forming provisional
government.

<HEADLINE> Father, Daughter Accuse Each Other in Belgian Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The horror of the multiple
murder in the Belgian capital may turn out more horrible as
accusations by the protestant priest and his daughter today may
lead up to more discoveries of murders committed by the duo.
</P>
<P>
In a cross-interrogation held today, Agnes Pandy, the eldest
daughter of the Hungarian-born pastor Andras Pandy, accused his
father of murdering five of his family members while confessing
that she herself murdered her own mother.
</P>
<P>
The daughter, arrested late Thursday on charges of committing
murder or aiding in murder, told prosecutors that two of the
murders were committed using hammers while the rest of the murders
were committed using fire arms.
</P>
<P>
The 39-year-old woman said that all the murders were committed
somewhere else but human remains could not be found in the place
in that the bodies of the dead had been moved away in bags.
</P>
<P>
The pastor was arrested a month and a half ago when repeated
reports by neighbors and a Dutch pastor led to the discovery of
human bones inside three of the pastor's houses in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
The priest was charged with murdering his two former wives and
four of his eight children. The six members of the pastor family
disappeared between 1986 and 1989.
</P>
<P>
But Andras said that the four sets of human bones found inside
his houses did not belong to those of his disappeared family
members.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the disappeared family members had gone back
to Hungary. Police is conducting investigations in the eastern
European country to confirm the explanation, according to local
television reports.

<P>
TEHRAN, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Turkmenistan and Iranian top
officials held talks here today on bilateral cooperation,
particularly on gas and oil export.
</P>
<P>
At their talks, Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi and
visiting Turkmen Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Boris
Shikhmuratov reviewed the bilateral wide-scale cooperation since
Turkmenistan's independence in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Common interests as well as cordial and amicable relations
between Tehran and Ashkhabad necessitate further promotion of

Iran has announced its readiness to be a bridge for the
relatively land-locked Central Asian republics to reach the
outside world and has signed several documents with those
countries to help them export oil and gas.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, oil ministers of Iran, Turkmenistan and
Kazakhstan reached an agreement on trilateral cooperation for the
transfer of Kazakh oil through Turkmenistan and Iran to the world
markets.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the document will be signed during the
forthcoming summit of the Organization of Islamic Conference
(OIC) due to be held here in December.

Last month, Iranian Foreign Minister Kharrazi announced that
Iran and Turkmenistan will form an international oil consortium
for oil and gas exploration in the Caspian Sea.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kharrazi said the two countries' geographical
proximity as well as the bonds of affinity and friendship have
been effective in consolidation of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
He said that the national will of Iran and Turkmenistan is
based on long-term bilateral relations, adding that Iran can
serve as the most suitable route for transfer of oil and gas from
the Commonwealth of Independent States to the world markets.

<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, November 22 (Xinhua) -- A French financial delegation
to Cameroun has reaffirmed the country's readiness to help
Cameroun implement its accord with the International Monetary
Fund, Radio Cameroun reported today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press after meeting with Cameroun's Premier
Peter Mafany Musonge here Friday, the leader of the French
delegation said French assistance will ensure that Cameroun
fulfill its financial obligations and enable it to adopt the
measures imposed by the IMF.
</P>
<P>
He expressed total satisfaction with Cameroun's economic
program and calls for the country's vigorous implementation
within the time prescribed in its accord with the IMF.
</P>
<P>
The head of the French delegation said he had discussed with
Musonge over wide range of issues including strategies to
increase tax revenue, ways to accelerate the privatization
process and the importance of regional integration.
</P>
<P>
The IMF signed the fifth standby accord of economic
cooperation with Cameroun in August this year. The agreement is a
financial aid mechanism, a loan scheme which seeks to prop
economic reforms programs.
</P>
<P>
Basing on a policy to promote a minimum annual economic growth
rate of 5 percent, to contain inflation between 2 and 3 percent
and reduce poverty in the country, the accord goes a long way to
re-establish Cameroun's credibility with international financial
institutions and places Cameroun in a better position to settle
its debts.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon can't achieve real and
comprehensive independence unless south Lebanon and western Bekka
Valley are liberated from Israeli occupation, Lebanese provincial
governors said today.
</P>
<P>
They made the remarks at seperate parties held on the occassion
of the country's 54th Independence anniversary.
</P>
<P>
Oumur Yasein, governor of the northern province of Baalbek,
said that the festival should be perceived as a call for the
Lebanese people to unite and serve for the liberation of south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The governor of South Lebanon province Faesur Saoeg said the
Lebanese stance over the simultaneous Lebanese-Israeli and
Syrian-Israeli peace talks is clear and unchangeable.
</P>
<P>
His remarks are directed against Israel's suggestion that the
Lebanon issue should be solved first while ignoring Syria's demand
for Israeli total withdrawal from the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Saoeg said the current Lebanese stance can defeat any Israeli
attempt to continously deprive Lebanese of their just rights as
citizens in south Lebanon and thus achieve full independence in
the whole country.
</P>
<P>
Saoeg's province is near the 1,100-square-kilometer "security
zone" set up by Israel in south Lebanon in 1985 to prevent
cross-border attack by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon also showed its military strength here this morning as
part of the activities to mark Lebanon's independence from
France's mandatory rule in 1943.
</P>

President Elias Hrawi, House Speaker Nabih Berri and Prime

<HEADLINE> More Children Die in UN-Sanctioned Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 23 (Xinhua) -- More than 4,000 Iraqi children
under the age of five died in October this year compared with 272
in the same month in 1989, statistics released today by the Iraqi
Ministry of Health showed.
</P>
<P>
These children mainly died of diarrhoea, pneumonia, and
malnutrition, according to the statistics.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 2,158 people aged over 50 died of hypertension,
diabetes, and malignant tumor in the country in October in
comparison with 214 in the same month in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Iraq is currently in urgent need of food, medicine and other
daily necessities due to the sanctions imposed by the U.N. for
its invasion of Kuwait in 1990. The sanctions barred Iraq from
exporting oil, its economic mainstay.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.N.-Iraqi oil-for-food deal which was launched last
December, Iraq is allowed to export 2 billion U.S. dollars worth
of oil over six months to buy food, medicine and other
humanitarian goods for its people.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has repeatedly accused the U.N. Sanctions Committee of
delaying the approval of its contracts signed with foreign
companies on the purchase of medical supplies under the
oil-for-food deal.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Africa to Focus on Education in Coming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of
African Unity (OAU) formally launched the Decade of Education in
Africa (1997-2006) Saturday in Addis Ababa in a bid to remove
obstacles to progress toward "education for all" and give impetus
to the education and socio-economic development in Africa.
</P>
<P>
African countries have attached much importance to developing
education in the past decades and have made remarkable
achievements in the area.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, education in Africa still lags far behind other
developing countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
"Africa has an illiteracy rate of 56 percent which is said to
be the highest in the world," according to OAU Secretary General
Salim Ahmed Salim.
</P>
<P>
About 26 million African girls are currently without access to
primary schools, compared with 18 million in the early 1990s, and
the figure will increase to 36 million by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
As developing countries in Asia and Latin America are making
remarkable achievements to enter the 21st century, Africa is
beset with an increasing number of absolutely illiterate adults
and a shortage of its own intellectuals and technicians.
</P>
<P>
Education in Africa has an important bearing on the
continent's development in the future. More and more wise
Africans now believe that education is the key to peace,
democracy and sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
African countries declared 1996 as the "Year of Education in
Africa." African leaders attending the Yaounde 32nd OAU summit
adopted a "resolution on the launching of the decade of education
in Africa (1997-2006)".
</P>
<P>
However, the rapid population growth in Africa, low rate of
enrollment, high illiteracy among African adults, disparities
between girls and boys in schools, the continuous intra and
inter-state wars and conflicts which have caused closure of
schools, colleges and universities, the heavy external debt with
its ramifications and the natural calamities of drought and
famine that have left most countries devastated were cited by OAU
as main factors contributing to a decline in the socio-economic
development of Africa in general and in the education sector in
particular.
</P>
<P>
What is more, this has been worsened by budget cuts in
education that has led to numerous problems including lack of
adequate classroom space, ill-equipped schools, insufficient
trained teachers and brain-drain.
</P>
<P>
For instance, public expenditure on education in the
sub-Saharan Africa was only 160 billion US Dollars in 1992, which
accounts for 28 percent and 26 percent of that in Latin America
and southern Asia respectively.
</P>
<P>
Now, African countries have put the education decade as
Africa's third major project together with the central organ and
the conflict management center (political) and the african
economic community (economic).
</P>
<P>
The education decade will put primary importance not only on
educating Africans on knowledge, skills and appropriate
orientation to cope with the rapidly changing technology in the
world, but also on nurturing concepts of tolerance, peace and
understanding amongst peoples of diverse cultural and ethnic
background.
</P>
<P>
To carry out the education decade successfully, African
countries have decided to hold a conference of African ministers
of education in Durban, south Africa on April 20 to 24, 1998.
</P>
<P>
A program of action will be formulated at the conference and
will be approved by the ministers council later. A summit
devoted to African education will be convened at the mid-term to
evaluate the education decade, OAU said.

<HEADLINE> Terms of IMF Bailout for South Korea Concerned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 23 (Xinhua) -- As South Korea is applying for
an International Monetary Fund (IMF) rescue loan, attention is
shifting toward what terms the IMF will impose on South Korea in
exchange for the bailout fund.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the Ministry of Finance and Economy (MOFE) said
the IMF will ask South Korea to implement stringent self-rescue
programs as a precondition for the rescue fund.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean government decided to apply for a bailout loan
of 20 billion U.S. dollars. However, the amount of the fund
remains to be determined during the negotiation which will last a
few weeks.
</P>
<P>
The first group of three IMF officials arrived here Saturday to
negotiate with South Korean officials.
</P>
<P>
Local industry experts said that the IMF's infusion of
emergency bailout money into South Korea would surely result in a
loss of economic sovereignty and seismic upheavals of the national
economy.
</P>
<P>
"This is like creditor banks demanding the submission of
self-rescue plans from insolvent companies in return for giving
them a grace period for bankruptcy protection," an MOFE official
said.
</P>
<P>
The official said the IMF makes it a rule to stop lending if
the recipients fail to implement self-rescue problems properly.
</P>
<P>
The IMF's strict principles have been tested when it provided
16.7 billion dollars and 18 billion dollars to Thailand and
Indonesia in rescue funds recently.
</P>
<P>
The IMF demanded that the two countries implement stringent
self-rescue programs in five areas: proper growth rates and lower
inflation, the minimum foreign reserves, the shutdown of poorly
managed financial firms, increased financial supervision and tax
hikes.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the IMF will strongly demand that South Korean
enterprises and financial institutions readjust their structure
and the country will face such problems as the back-to-back
bankruptcies of marginal firms and a drop in real estate prices.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, South Korea will be required to lower its growth
target, endure massive layoffs and suspend large investment
projects.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises' failure to secure enough business funds through
the sales of real estate will eventually lead to their
bankruptcies, while causing insolvencies of financial institutions
with heavy bad loans, they warned.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say, however, many of the IMF's demands will help the
country restructure its economy without being influenced by
political considerations. "For example, reform in the financial
industry will become broader and more far-reaching under the
guidance of the IMF," an analyst said.
</P>
<P>
The rescue program will eventually prove a good remedy for the
South Korean economy in the long run, they said.

<HEADLINE> 9 Civilians Killed in South Lebanon Clashes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 23 (Xinhua) -- A total of nine Lebanese
civilians were killed and 17 others wounded this morning in
south Lebanon during shellings.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Orient Radio reported that some shells, which killed
and wounded the villagers, dropped in Beita al-Leaf village in the
eastern sector of the Israeli-occupied zone in south Lebanon. But
it didn't say which side fired the shells.
</P>
<P>
In Sunday afternoon, Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God,
carried out series of attacks on the bases of Israeli troops, and
scored direct hits on them, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
It quoted Israeli radio as saying that Israeli military
sources had confirmed that two Israeli soliders were wounded in
the attack by Hezbollah's shelling.
</P>
<P>
The sources claimed that Hezbollah fired several Katyusha
rockets to the western sector of Galili area in northern Israel,
but they didn't target at residential districts, and thus caused
no casualties.
</P>
<P>
Israel established a 1,200 square kilometers security zone in
south Lebanon in 1985 to protect its northern border from
cross-border Lebanese guerrilla attack.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah is fighting a guerrilla war to try to oust Israel's
2,000 soldiers and the 2,500 pro-Israeli South Lebanese Army
militiamen, from south Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> China Prepares for Stamp Expo, Postal Congress in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Preparations for the 22nd
Congress of the Universal Postal Union (UPU) and the '99 World
Stamp Expo, are now smoothly under way, a government official said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Liu Jianhui, deputy secretary-general of the All-China Philatelic
Federation, told a press conference here today that the 22nd UPU
Congress and the grand stamp expo, scheduled in Beijing in August
of 1999, would be of great significance for stamp collectors all
over the world at the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
"A success in hosting these two major events reflects our
country's political stability, economic prosperity, greater
national strength and higher international status," he said.
</P>
<P>
The events also will promote cooperation and exchanges between
China and the rest of the world in postal services and stamp
collecting, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Liu, an organizing committee for the events was
established in July of 1996, with Chinese President Jiang Zemin as
its honorary chairman and vice premier Wu Bangguo as the chairman.
</P>
<P>
"President Jiang wrote calligraphy for the UPU congress, which
reads 'Develop a modernized post service to meet the need of the
society'," he said.
</P>
<P>
The organizers have chosen a white rabbit as the stamp expo's
mascot since 1999 will be the year of the rabbit on the Chinese
lunar calendar, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications of China and the
organizing committee for the stamp expo have sent invitations to
postal administrations in various UPU member countries and all
members of the International Philatelic Federation, he said.
</P>
<P>
The postal administration in Shanghai today issued a
commemorative envelope to publicize the 22nd UPU Congress and
the '99 World Stamp Expo.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1874, the UPU convenes a congress every five
years. China, a UPU member since 1914, will be the third Asian
country to host a UPU congress.

<HEADLINE> "Socialist Model Village" Sheds Its Label (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Inside a bright and spacious
garment workshop, 18-year old Li Wenyan skillfully operates a
power-driven sewing machine. In her competent hands, shirts of
varying designs are sewn with "Dazhai, China" trademarks.
</P>
<P>
Dazhai, in Xiyang County of north China's Shanxi Province,
is a small village in the Taihang Mountains with a population of
500.
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s Dazhai villagers built high-yield terraced
farmland on barren hills, a feat some called miraculous. The deed
was praised by Chairman Mao at that time, and the village became
China's no. 1 model village in the 1960s and 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Since the implementation of China's policy of reform and
opening up, however, Dazhai has embarked down a new road.
</P>
<P>
Dazhai Garment Manufacturing Company, where Li Wenyan works, is
the village's first joint venture, established in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Before that, most villagers dedicated themselves to farming,
with only a few of them engaged in transportation.
</P>
<P>
In today's Dazhai, passers-by hear the rumble of machines and
cries of peddlers.
</P>
<P>
Scattered on both sides of nearby Hutou Mountain are
overseas-funded firms, a garment-manufacturing company, a winery,
domestic animal breeding centers and coal mines run by Dazhai
villagers.

<P>
Last year, the village's total industrial and agricultural
output exceeded 32 million yuan (4 million U.S. dollars), with per
capita annual income rising to 2,100 yuan (260 U.S. dollars) from
700 yuan (87 U.S. dollars) five years ago.
</P>
<P>
During the past five years, Dazhai had also undertaken economic
cooperations with other present-day "model villages", such as
Huaxi Village in east China's Jiangsu Province, and Daqiuzhuang
village in Tianjin Municipality.
</P>
<P>
"It takes us ten years to learn from others," said village head
Jia Chunsheng, adding that unprecedented change has taken place in
the lives of Dazhai villagers.
</P>
<P>
The daughter-in-law of Liang Bianliang, a former model peasant,
runs a tourism shop. Dressed in fashionable clothes, the young
lady speaks standard Chinese fluently and simple English, which
enables her to communicate with tourists to the village.
</P>
<P>
She not only acts as a tourist guide, but also sells souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 100,000 tourists visit Dazhai annually.
</P>
<P>
Local elderly people, who can get 100 yuan in subsidies each
month, take pleasure in helping promote the development of the
village's public affairs.
</P>
<P>
Adults are mainly engaged in managing village-run firms. They

<P>
Farming, now mainly done by machines, has become a special job
for a small number of people. Coarse food grain is no longer
planted on the high-yield terraced farmland, replaced by cash
crops and medicinal material.
</P>
<P>
Young Dazhai villagers can hardly imagine how their ancestors
conquered nature with hoes and picks, as they now all have
positions in village-run firms.
</P>
<P>
Guo Fenglian, secretary of Dazhai Village Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC), puts it this way: "Whatever
happens in the future, Dazhai's spirit of hard work cannot be
discarded."
</P>
<P>
Visitors to Dazhai might well be surprised at how little the
village has invested in non-production programs and how much money
the village has spent on education and economic development.
</P>
<P>
Children in the village enjoy free education from kindergarten
through primary schools, and parents whose children continue their
study in higher schools are rewarded.
</P>
<P>
In the past several years, Dazhai has attracted 42 million yuan
(some five million U.S. dollars) in funding and nearly 100
professionals which helped develop a series of new products
bearing the "Dazhai, China" trademark.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Opens Museum on Ancient Nubian Civilization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
this morning inaugurated the first museum of Nubian heritage in
southern Egypt, in a move to contain damages caused from Monday's
terrorist attacks on foreign tourists in the very area.
</P>
<P>
The Museum in Aswan, about 800 kilometers south of Cairo, is
about 300 kilometers down from another archeological jewel Luxor,
which on Monday witnessed a bloodbath when Islamic militants
gunned down 62 people.
</P>
<P>
Nubia, a stretch of land covering southern Egypt and Sudan and
home to the aboriginals, is increasingly believed to be the origin
of civilization in the world.
</P>
<P>
Built in cooperation with the United Nations Educational,
Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the museum itself
showcases 3,000 rare pieces of Nubian antiquities, relief maps and
models as well as historical manuscripts and handicraft from the
stone age and until the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
Amid tight security, Mubarak, his ministers and a host of world
leaders were shown around the giant 60-million-pound (nearly
18-million-U.S.-dollar) museum, built on a rocky hilltop in Aswan,
the second largest archeological city of Egypt after Luxor.
</P>
<P>
They watched a 12-minute documentary on the work to save the
Nubian monuments, before the construction of the famous Aswan Dam
forced the Nile waters to rise and inundate where they stood.
</P>
<P>
A brainchild of the Supreme Council for Antiquities and a joint
effort many donors, the museum sprawling on a 7,000-cubic-meter
area is itself an architectural masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
The completion of the Nubian Museum project was delayed for
more than five years with extra costs due to bureaucratic
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
Egypt opened the museum less than a week after the savage
massacre in Luxor to show the government's resolve to revive
tourism, a 3-billion-dollar-per-year industry for the country's
economy.
</P>
<P>
Before the incident, Aswan and Luxor, the two most brilliant
archeological pearls in Upper Egypt, had been largely free from
Islamic militant insurgency to topple the secular government and
install rigorous religious rule. The campaign in the past five
years has claimed 1,300 lives.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, angered by the laxity of security at major tourist
sites, has sacked his interior minister. The new security chief
immediately revamped the security leaderships and vowed to
firewall terrorists across the country.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Regrets Netanyahu's Hostile Positions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
Chairman Yasser Arafat today regretted that Israeli government is
still going ahead with its intransigent stance in the Mideast
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat voiced his concern before leaving here for Gaza at the
end of a one-day visit to Egypt on his way back home from New
Dehli, India.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
government adopts a hostile stance to peace and to all signed
agreements with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"Israel is still taking measure to Judaize Jerusalem and to
besiege Palestinian cities. These blockage costs Palestinians a
10-million-dollar loss a day," he said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, a frequent visitor here, was seen off at the airport by
Egyptian Minister of Manpower and Immigration Ahmed Ahmed
Al-Amawi. He did not meet with other senior Egyptian officials.
</P>
<P>
President Hosni Mubarak had flown to the Upper Egyptian city of
Aswan, about 800 kilometers south of Cairo Saturday afternoon, to
inaugurate a new Nubian antiquities museum there this morning.
</P>
<P>
During a three-day official visit to New Dehli, Arafat sought
Indian investments in Palestinian self-rule areas and asked for
India's role in reviving the peace process bogged down by Israeli
government's hardline policy.
</P>
<P>
A close friend of the late Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, Arafat
often pays visit to India often. That was his second visit to the
country this year.

<P>
ABU DHABI, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Britain will start providing
Qatar with 40 Piranha armored personnel carriers from January,
the Qatari News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
It is part of an arms deal worth 500 million U.S. dollars
signed between the two countries last year, the visiting British
Minister of State for Defense Procurement Lord Gilbert said.
</P>
<P>
Other equipment will be supplied "as and when Qatar orders,"
Gilbert said.

Gilbert is on a Gulf tour which has taken him to the United
Arab Emirates, Oman and Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
Britain, one of the major arms suppliers of the Gulf Arab
countries, signed several contracts in 1996 to export 3.5 billion
dollars worth of weapons and equipment to the region.
</P>
<P>
It is currently vying with French and American companies for

<HEADLINE> Settlers Seize Palestinian House in East Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Jewish settlers took
over part of an Arab building in Bab Huttah quarter of the Old
City of East Jerusalem today, setting off angry reactions from the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
The occupied building belongs to the Palestinian families of
Adbeen, Al-Kurd and Sabellah, according to PNA officials and
local Arab residents.
</P>
<P>
The seizure of the building occurred this morning immediately
after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu toured the site of
Wednesday's shooting of a Jewish religious student in the Old city.
</P>
<P>
Meeting members of the Jewish group in the Old City, Netanyahu
has promised to grant them permission to control over 18
Palestinian homes in the Old City.
</P>
<P>
He also promised to erect two more police stations and support
Jewish housing constructions there.
</P>
<P>
The PNA reacted angrily and swiftly to the seizure and
Netanyahu's remarks. Faisal Husseini, PNA Minister of Jerusalem
Affairs and Executive Committee Member of the Palestinian
Liberation Organization, said those are very dangerous moves that
may drag Jerusalem into new waves of bloodbath.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish seminary student, Gavriel Hirschburg, was shot dead
Wednesday night by a gunman near the Damascus Gate of the Old
City. Following the incident, the Israeli government ordered police
forces to beef up security by opening a police station inside the
Moslem quarter in the Old City.
</P>
<P>
The PNA has strongly protested the opening of the police
station. PNA Information Minister Yasser Abed Rabbo charged on
Thursday that there would be severe repercussions.
</P>
<P>
Less than 72 hours after the Gavriel shooting, another Jewish
youth, Maimon Akiva, 20, was injured when a Palestinian youth
attacked him with a knife near the Damascus Gate Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
East Jerusalem is an old religious city and its majority
residents are Arab Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Chemical Packet to Purify Arsenic Polluted Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi scientists have
developed a chemical packet which can purify arsenic polluted
water and make it fit for human consumption, the national news
agency BSS reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The packet was developed by the scientists of the Bangladesh
Atomic Energy Commission (BAEC) in collaboration with the National
Institute of Preventive and Social Medicine, BSS quoted BAEC
Chairman MA Quaiyuum as saying.
</P>
<P>
Quaiyuum is the convenor of the Scientific Research Committee
of Arsenic Pollution formed by the Ministry of Health and Family
Welfare in October last year in order to find out the remedy.
</P>
<P>
One packet of the chemical used in powder form could purify 18
liters of arsenic polluted water within six hours while arsenic is
precipitated at the bottom of the container, Quaiyuum said, adding
that the chemicals are cheap and available in the local market.
</P>
<P>
He stated that 220,000 chemical packets have been already
distributed to the people in different arsenic-affected areas of
the country free of charge.
</P>
<P>
The BAEC has applied for patent of the arsenic remedy "chemical
packet", he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the reason for arsenic pollution, the BAEC
chairman said geological study by the scientific committee had
found that it was due to presence of arsenic bearing minerals in
the soil.
</P>
<P>
Scientific studies have found that ground water in different
areas of the country is polluted with arsenic posing a serious
threat to human health.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Returns Dual-Use Equipment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Most of the dual-use equipment
moved by the Iraqis to avoid possible military strike by the U.S.
has been returned to their original sites, the Iraqi News Agency
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations weapons inspectors said Saturday following
their first inspection tour in three weeks that the equipment is
being moved back.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that the inspectors have disproved the
allegations that Iraq has hidden lethal weapons-making equipment
in its standoff with the U.N..
</P>
<P>
The U.N. inspectors, including the Americans, verified that all
the cameras, accessories and other means of monitoring have not
been blocked or harmed, the agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, eight U.N. inspection teams, including one for air
surveillance with a helicopter, went on with their mission this
morning in nine locations that are under long-term monitoring,
said the agency.
</P>
<P>
The weapons experts braced for no troubles and difficulties in
their work, much the same as on Saturday when they inspected eight
sites without interference from the Iraqi authorities.
</P>
<P>
An Iraqi official who declined to be named told reporters this
morning that his country is satisfied with the work of the U.N.
inspection teams, calling on all the members to act objectively
and according to technical norms.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. weapons inspectors returned to Baghdad on Friday after
a three-week standoff that broke out following Iraq's decision to
kick out the Americans working on the inspection teams.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad accused the U.S. arms inspectors of spying and trying
to delay the lifting of U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq since its
invasion of Kuwait in 1990.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Netanyahu Wins Time to Defuse Likud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Communication
Minister Limor Livnat has denied that she considered resigning in
protest against the controversial Likud convention, a signal that
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has won valuable time to
defuse Likud crisis by proposing a party referendum on the
election primaries.
</P>
<P>
Today's local Hebrew newspaper Yediot Aharonot quoted Livnat's
spokeswoman as saying that "Livnat never told anyone she
considered quitting." The spokeswoman added that Netanyahu and
Livnat will meet again this week in an attempt to narrow the gap
between them over the dumped party primaries.
</P>
<P>
Livnat reportedly told Netanyahu at their two meetings last
week that she was "considering resigning." Netanyahu, according
to Likud sources, replied that he wants her "to stay and to
continue leading the revolution in Israeli communications."
</P>
<P>
The source noted that Netanyahu realized that Livnat was well
regarded by the media and could make or break the party internal
rebellion against him, which had been triggered by the rowdy Likud
convention on November 12.
</P>
<P>
Senior Likud officials launched a campaign against Netanyahu
last week in fear that they would be shunted aside as Netanyahu
moves to side-line potential challengers after the convention
scrapped the primaries and gave the power to select candidates for
the Knesset to a central committee stacked with Netanyahu's
loyalists.
</P>
<P>
In response, Netanyahu pushed forward a proposal Friday to
hold a referendum among Likud members on the primary system in a
bid to mollify Likud ministers and Knesset members and succeed in
protecting the party situation from further deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was roundly welcomed by the Likud high-ups, who
believe that if the referendum does take place, the primaries will
be restored. And just under the circumstances, Livnat rejected the
report about her resignation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to today's The Jerusalem Post, Tel Aviv
Mayor Ronni Milo, one of Netanyahu's most outspoken critics in
recent days, also played down the move to depose the prime
minister after Netanyahu's proposal on the referendum.
</P>
<P>
Milo denied press reports that he will register a new party
this week, saying that "if all efforts to cure the Likud of its
ills fail, and if there is no hope left to breathe new life into
the party, then I will in all likelihood embark on a new political
venture. This will happen in the not-too-distant future, if it
will happen at all, but not this week."
</P>
<P>
Although there is no precedent in the Likud for a party-wide
referendum and the mechanics of conducting one are far from clear,
Netanyahu has found a way to buy valuable time to maneuver between
the party central committee and Likud high-ups.
</P>
<P>
Even if his proposal never gets off the ground, Netanyahu is
ahead. He will appear to have offered to do the right thing, and
it won't be his fault if it can't be done.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Netanyahu did not take the legally problematic route
of unilaterally overturning the convention decision. Even though
he could do so, it would be crude and too humiliating. But
deferring to Likud rank and file by holding a referendum provided
him with a popular ladder on which to climb down.

<HEADLINE> Indian Speaker Expresses Concern Over Indiscipline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 23 (Xinhua)-- Indian Parliament Speaker
P.A. Sangma today expressed concern over the increasing
indiscipline in the House.
</P>
<P>
Talking to Press Trust of India (PTI) in Jaipur city, about 280
km southwest of New Delhi, he said that some parliament members
used the parliament to air their personal interest instead of
finding solutions to the vital problems which the country was
facing, .
</P>
<P>
The winter session of the Parliament began here on November 19.
But after the Jain Commission report, which linked the Dravida
Munnetra Kazagham (DMK) with the conspiracy of assassination of
former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1991, was tabled in
Parliament on November 20, the House was forced to be adjourned
time and again due to noisy scenes. Angry Congress MPs demanded
immediate ouster of the DMK ministers from the Gujral government.
This was strongly protested by DMK members in the House, who
shouted counter slogans rejecting the Congress charges.
</P>
<P>
Sangma called upon the parliament members to allow a smooth
conduct of business, adding that it would not be proper to waste
the time on the trivial issues.

<HEADLINE> HK to Be 5th Most Popular Tourist Attraction by 2020: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong, which returned to
its motherland on July 1, this year, is expected to become the
world's fifth most popular tourist attraction by 2020, receiving
possibly 60 million tourists a year, a study report has predicted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China as a whole could become the number one holiday
spot in the world, according to the latest projections issued by
the World Tourism Organization, an international group of global
tourism associations.
</P>
<P>
The study report available here today forecast that 59.3
million tourists a year would visit Hong Kong in 2020 -- more than
five times the 1996 figure of 11.7 million.
</P>
<P>
By then, China as a whole could be the world's most popular
tourism destination followed by the United States, France and
Spain.
</P>
<P>
The comprehensive study indicated that tourists in the 21st
century will travel much further on their holidays with the
percentage of long-haul trips increasing to 24 percent by 2020
from 18 percent in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Studies Confirm Computer-related Illness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, November 22 (Xinhua) -- At least two recent
studies have confirmed that computers may cause some illness to
the daily users.
</P>
<P>
A survey of 509 computer users this week at the Las Vegas
computer show, Comdex, found that 86 percent of the respondents
had experienced irritation, fatigue, difficulty in focusing, eye
dryness or headaches while working at a computer.
</P>
<P>
Almost all of them, 98 percent, said that they spend more than
two hours a day viewing computer monitors. The survey was
conducted by a Cincinnati company, Directions Research Inc.
</P>
<P>
Several vision experts agree that the problem is linking to the
eye's ability to stay lubricated through blinking. A person
normally blinks about five times per minute, and less-than-normal
lubrication from tears results.
</P>
<P>
Remedies pursued by manufacturers include specially tinted
lenses for computer users and anti-glare computer monitors that
are designed to make computer viewing easier on the eyes.
</P>
<P>
Like the more widely known computer-related illness -- computer
vision syndrome -- is a health concern that has grown
proportionally to the number of people who use computers daily,
care professionals and industry observers have said.
</P>
<P>
Another study by the National Institute of Occupational Health
and Safety of the United States also found that those who work
more than three hours daily on a computer have a 90 percent chance
of some sort of eye problems.
</P>
<P>
James Sheedy, a clinical professor at the University of
California-Berkeley School of Optometry, said that dry and
irritated eyes, eyestrain, headaches and backaches, blurred and
double vision -- many pre-existing conditions are exacerbated by
working long hours at a computer. "It's visually intense job," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He advised computer users to blink, saying that computer users
studied in control conditions blinked only a third as much as
those not on computers. "Blinking release oils and enzymes that
naturally lubricate the eye," he said.

<HEADLINE> Indian Speaker Urges to Form a National Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 23 (Xinhua)-- Indian Lower House of
Parliament Speaker P.A. Sangma today urged to form a national
government to help tide over the present political crisis.
</P>
<P>
"A national government would possibly be an answer to tide over
the fluid situation prevailing in the country as at the moment no
party is ready to face mid-term election," he told Press Trust of
India (PTI) in Jaipur city about 280 km southwest of New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
The Jain Commission report, tabled before Parliament here on
November 20, linked the Dravida Munnetra Kazagham (DMK), one of
the 14-party United Front (UF) constituents, with the conspiracy
of assassination of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1991.
The Congress, the main supporter of the UF, demanded the Gujral
government to sack three cabinet ministers of the DMK if it wanted
to continue to get support from the Congress. The core committee
of the UF, however, rejected Congress demand to dump the DMK. With
no fresh developments so far, the political impasse at the Center
continued while both the Congress and the UF sticked to their
respective stand on the issue of the DMK ministers in the Gujral
government.
</P>
<P>
Given the present political turmoil fresh elections were more
likely to produce a hung Parliament, Sangma said.
</P>
<P>
The political parties could come together and experiment with a
national government for the sake of stability, he added.

<HEADLINE> High Tech Becomes Second Largest Industry in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 22 (Xinhua) -- High technology has become
the second largest industry in the United States, accounting for
about six percent of the national economy last year, a new
industry-sponsored report said.
</P>
<P>
The study, titled "Cybernation," by the American Electronics
Association (AEA) and Nasdaq stock market, found that the sector,
fueled by explosive growth at software companies, was only behind
health care and ahead of such bulwarks as autos, construction,
oil, and chemicals.
</P>
<P>
The AEA will use the study as ammunition when lobbying
government officials for looser rules on export of encryption
software, freer immigration policies and other issues, said AEA
Chairman Dick Levy, who is executive vice president of Palo Alto,
California-based Varian Associates.
</P>
<P>
According to the study, the high-tech industries included
computers, consumer electronics, semi-conductors, software and
industrial electronics.
</P>
<P>
The high-tech companies employed slightly more than four
million people in 1996, compared with almost 11 million jobs in
health care, almost 10 million in education and more than five
million in construction, said the report.

<P>
JERUSALEM, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Public hospitals across
Israel continued their strike today to pressurize the government
to pay for additional manpower in the hospitals.
</P>
<P>
The strike, organized by the Israel Medical Association (IMA),
and entering its 11th week, so far has postponed nearly 18,000
non-emergency operations and forced great many patients to go to
private hospitals for treatment.
</P>
<P>
IMA Chairman Yoram Blachar told reporters today that he is
shocked that the Finance Ministry still refuses to carry out an
agreement that it had signed with the association last March to
pay for the additional 360 doctors in the public hospitals.
</P>
<P>
He accused the ministry of ignoring IMA's proposal for a
speed-up mediation process to find ways to finance the costs of
the additional manpower.
</P>
<P>
However, the Finance Ministry in charge of the budget of the
public hospitals demanded that the hospitals themselves solve the
problem.

<HEADLINE> Atlanta Internet Bank Grows Fast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Atlanta Internet Bank
(AIB), the world's only full-service bank to operate exclusively
through the Internet, said that it has experienced a fast growing
business since its establishment in October, 1996.
</P>
<P>
AIB has nearly 4,000 customers by November 21, which increased
by more than 30 percent from 3,000 in August, a report released by
the bank on its web site said.
</P>
<P>
The number of new accounts has increased by 10 percent since
the launching of a new web-based advertising at the beginning of
this month, said the report. Several thousand inquiries have been
received during the same period, asking for more information about
the bank.
</P>
<P>
"We are not altogether surprised at this exceptional response,"
said D. R. Crimes, chairman of executive officer of AIB.
</P>
<P>
"Our high-yield interest checking, money market accounts and
certificates of deposit have been very well received by
consumers," he added.
</P>
<P>
The bank so far has absorbed more than 45 million U.S. dollars
from customers of 20 countries, including the United States, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Crimes attributed the fast growth of business to the
convenience of the bank, low-cost banking via Internet and the
ability to earn great rates.
</P>
<P>
The bank also offers interest-bearing checking, electronic bill
payment services, seven-day and 24-hour banking, and ATM cards.
</P>
<P>
It expects to offer a full line of consumer products, including
consumer loans, credit card, mortgages and brokerage services
within a year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"The kind of growth AIB is experiencing proves that Internet
banking is the wave of the future," said Stephen Johnson,
president of an Atlanta-based bank consulting firm.

<HEADLINE> 50 People Trapped by Weed on Lake Victoria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 23 (Xinhua) -- About 50 traders, among them
Tanzanians and Ugandans, were reported to have stranded on Lake
Victoria without food for the past three days after their boats
were blocked by the water hyacinth near Kenya's port Kisumu.
</P>
<P>
Sources at Kisumu was quoted by today's local press as saying
that the traders were stuck in the thick weed about 10 kilometers
from the port on Thursday evening as they transported cargo from
Mwanza and Bukoba ports in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
"We have reliably established that 11 boats with a crew of
about 50 are stranded in the lake. The vessels are even visible
from the pier," Hezbon Onyango, a Kisumu-based marine
transporter, said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Since then, they have run out of food and other essential
commodities as their relatives in Mwanza said the food on board
could not last two days.
</P>
<P>
Onyango said the stranded boats may sink with the crew and
cargo due to the heavy rains, unless urgent measures are taken to
rescue them.
</P>
<P>
The only possible rescue method is to use bigger steamers at
the port to tow the boats, but so far the efforts to acquire a
wagon ferry from the Kenya Railways Corporation, which manages
the port, have ended in vain, he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the weed blocked the Kisumu port on Thursday,
rendering its piers unusable with several vessels stuck there.
</P>
<P>
"We have lost business worth millions of Shillings. It
is...very bad for the booming regional trade. We thought the weed
would be pushed away by the wind but it appears this will not
happen," a port official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Water hyacinth, one of the fastest-growing plants in the
world, posed a more and more serious threat to the world's
second-largest fresh lake, shared by Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania,
over recent years.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Curb Student Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Following countrywide
demonstrations by high school children which resulted in the
expulsion and suspension of some students and caused extensive
damage to school property, the Zimbabwe government is considering
plans to have parents sign individual contracts with school
authorities to guard against student violence.
</P>
<P>
Minister of education, sport and culture Gabriel Machinga said
yesterday the government had no choice but to impose stringent
measures to stop the riots.
</P>
<P>
"The government has no other alternative but impose
restrictions to those found breaking the law, as well as cover
any loopholes which might be used by students as a platform of
violent demonstrations," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said, "we cannot have an education system which
does not have morals and values, and with that in mind the issue
of discipline needs to be seriously looked into."
</P>
<P>
He added that he was disappointed to see that mission schools
were the worst hit by student demonstrations when in fact society
at large looked up to them to instil discipline and good morals.
</P>
<P>
He said the demonstrations could not have been started by
students alone, but with the help of some teachers who were bent
on destroying the education system in the country.
</P>
<P>
He stressed, "it is my fervent prayer that there was no hidden
hand of a teacher or teachers in these ugly events. If there
was, the person or persons involved should pray even harder not
to get caught."

<HEADLINE> Africa's Trouble Spots under Spotlight: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Africa's conflict ridden
trouble spots -- Burundi, the Comoros, Congo, Sierra Leone and
Somalia -- were the focus of attention by central organ of the
Organisation of African Unity (OAU), a senior Zimbabwean official
said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean Foreign Minister Stan Mudenge said the conflicts,
in which hundreds of thousands of people have been killed and
millions others displaced were part of the agenda during the two
day OAU session which ended in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mudenge, who is also chairman of the organ, told journalists
at the Harare International Airport Saturday that there was
urgent need to resume the Arusha (Tanzania) negotiation process
being facilitated by ex-Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere.
</P>
<P>
He said the OAU also expressed concern over the tension on
Burundi-Tanzania border, and appealed for restraint from both
parties.
</P>
<P>
He added that the OAU organ also reiterated its condemnation
of the coup in Sierra Leone and called for the reinstatement of
the legitimate government of President Tejan Kkabbah, now exiled.
</P>
<P>
"We requested OAU member states and the international
community at large to provide assistance to meet the resettlement
and rehabilitation needs of disarmed combatants," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In this connection the organ welcomed the financial
contribution of ECOMOG of 250,000 U.S. Dollars announced by the
secretary general of the OAU to mobilize financial assistance
from the international community in that regard," he said.
</P>
<P>
The organ also emphasised the need for Somali factions to
respect the principle of establishing a broad, all-inclusive and
all-embracing national reconciliation process as a pre-requisite
for achieving political settlement in that country, he said.
</P>
<P>
It also reiterated its commitment to the unity and territorial
integrity of the Comoros and reaffirmed its determination to do
everything to ensure that it did not disintergrate.
</P>
<P>
Mudenge added that the organ affirmed Africa's determination
to assume its responsibility for the peace, security and
stability of the continent, within the framework of the
provisions of the charters of the OAU and United Nations,
particularly recognizing the responsibility of the world body's
Security Council.

NAIROBI, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The Kenya Tourism Development
Corporation (KTDC) has announced in London it will invest four
billion Shillings to create more than 16 tourist resorts around
the country, a report reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
The proposed projects under the investment plan, unveiled

Since then, most tour operators in Europe have reduced their
flights by 60 percent and about half of the hotel workers in
Coastal Province have been sent on a forced leave or fired
altogether.

<HEADLINE> 120,000 Refugees affected by Flood in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 23 (Xinhua) -- United Nations agencies and
other relief organizations working in northeastern Kenya have
sent out an appeal for emergency aid to more than 120,000
refugees flooded in the Dadaab refugee camps, the Sunday Nation
reported today.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR), Peter Kessler, was quoted as saying Saturday
that disaster is brewing at the camps deep inside an area where
the Kenyan government recently declared a disaster zone after
nearly a month of heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the floods had pounded the traditionally
dry area and left more than 500 families in the camps homeless.
Ifo camp is the worst-hit and Hadgera camp has been cut off in
half by flood water, it added.
</P>
<P>
Over 50 deaths have been reported since the onset of the
unrelenting rains. Water-borne diseases and malaria are
anticipated as pit latrines in the area have been swept away,
according to the UNHCR head of the sub-office in Dadaab, Moshood
Olatokunbo.
</P>
<P>
Relief officers are struggling to relocate the refugees, who
were displaced by the flood, to higher ground, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Kessler told the paper that relief supplies at the camps
cannot last the next three weeks, adding that "the situation is
very ominous indeed, we are trying our best."
</P>
<P>
The heavy rains have caused floods in the area, washing away
sections of roads, submerging refugee shelters and sweeping away
pit latrines.
</P>
<P>
The area is inaccessible as virtually all the roads have been
reduced to stream flowing steadily into the nearby Tana River.
</P>
<P>
The Dadaab District Officer toured the area yesterday
afternoon and announced that he had invited the disaster
committee recently formed by the Kenyan government to visit the
area and draw up a program of action to bring the situation under
control.

<HEADLINE> New Curriculum Popular Among Pupils </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, November 23 (Xinhua) -- A pilot primary school
curriculum implemented in northwest China's Qinghai Province has
prompted more parents to send their daughters to school.
</P>
<P>
The new curriculum has special classes of sewing, embroidery,
cooking, spinning and weaving.
</P>
<P>
Starting last year, the curriculum has been practiced in some
1,000 primary schools in over 20 counties in the province's remote
and poorest areas and has involved over 10,000 girls.
</P>
<P>
Now 86 out of 100 girls in the province are studying at
school, 10 percentage points more than five years ago, according
to provincial education officials.
</P>
<P>
Qinghai is home to Tibetan, Mongolian, Hui, Sala and some other
ethic minority groups. Due to old tradition and the underdeveloped
local economy, the local people tend to keep girls at home helping
with househood chores.
</P>
<P>
To provide girls with proper education, the province set up
nine schools for girls in 1992 where a new curriculum was
introduced to help girl students master one or two practical
skills, besides teaching them to read and write.
</P>
<P>
The success of the experimental curriculum prompted provincial
education authorities to extend its use to other schools,
especially those in out of the way and poor areas.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Protect Mogao Grottoes From Shifting Sand (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, November 23 (Xinhua) -- A recent study conducted by
Chinese scientists has concluded that the Mogao Grottoes at
Dunhuang, one of the world's most-renowned art treasure house,
will not be buried by the encroaching sand dunes for at least
1,600 years.
</P>
<P>
Dug into cliffs between the mountain Sanwe and Mingsha in the
remote gobi regions of northwest China's Hexi corridor, Gansu
Province, the Dunhuang Grottoes have been constantly under the
threat of the Mingsha mountain sand dunes.
</P>
<P>
"The real danger facing the grottoes is the drifting sand
moving into the grotto areas, in stead of the worry that the
Mingsha mountain sand dunes may move and finally bury the
grottoes, " said Qu Jianjun, a research fellow of the Lanzhou
Desert Research Institute and the chief scientist of the research
project.
</P>
<P>
Known as the "Museum on the Gobi", the Mogao grottoes were
constructed from the 4th to 14th centuries. Eroded by wind and
drifting sand, only 494 caves now remain. They house a total of
45,000 square meters of murals and 2,000 colored figurines.
</P>
<P>
"Theoretical calculation and constant aviation monitoring are
appplied in the research, which found that the sand dunes are
moving northeast towards the grottoes at an annual speed of 0.99
to 0.29 meters." said Qu.
</P>
<P>
"Given the factor that the grottoes were built 1,600 years ago,
it should have been buried long ago, if the sand dunes had moved
at this speed," added he.

<TEXT>
<P>
Research revealed that the smooth terrain and the gobi have
acted as a natural protective screen for the grottoes. Whenever
sand dunes enter this area, the amount of sand is constantly
decreasing, because they are far away from the sand source and
much of the sand are blown away by stronger wind.
</P>
<P>
The size of the sand dunes become smaller on their way of
moving, finally they are reduced to such an extent that all of
them are drifted away.
</P>
<P>
"To protect the grottoes from sand attack, we need to stop the
moving of the sand dunes just closely in front of the Mingsha
mountain, it is dangerous to build any sand-obstruction facilities
in the smooth terrain and gobi areas," Qu Jianjun suggested.
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise, those drifting sand would be hindered and heaped
against those facilities. With their sizes becoming larger and
larger, they will be developed into a series of sand dunes
approaching the grotto areas, and finally bury them," he
warned.

<HEADLINE> 17 Albanian Emigrants Die in Sea Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Seventeen Albanians died in the
Italian Strait of Otranto in an attempt to illegally emigrate to
Italy.
</P>
<P>
The Italian authority informed the Albanian side Friday that an
Albanian motorboat was found in the water area about 22 nautical
miles from Brindisi, media reports said.
</P>
<P>
Five of the fourteen refugees discovered on the boat, including
a girl, already died.
</P>
<P>
Survivors said another 12 people fell into the sea and were
missing. They were believed to be dead.
</P>
<P>
The motorboat carrying 26 refugees reportedly left the Albanian
city of Durazzo days ago, but failed to reach Italy after two
days' voyage.
</P>
<P>
The Italian side, requested by Albania, sent warships and
helicopters for rescue search and finally located the damaged boat
after two days and two nights' efforts.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian government has decided to find out those
responsible for the incident and take steps to prevent the
reoccurrence of similar incidents, a government spokesman said
today.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian police have arrested a man in Durazzo for owning
boats such as the one used for the smuggling of illegal emigrants.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the government has also decided that all
boats should be inspected before going out to sea.
</P>
<P>
The past seven years have witnessed the death of hundreds of
illegal Albanian emigrants in the strait as they tried to flee the
country to Italy.
</P>
<P>
The biggest recent sea accident occurred on March 28 when a
boat carrying nearly 100 Albanian refugees bumped into an Italian
warship, leading to the death of more than 80 people.

<HEADLINE> More Foreigners Take Part in Chinese Proficiency Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 23 (Xinhua) -- "Commanding the Chinese
language is helpful to my career in China and in my country as
well," said Yuka Kadowake, a Japanese who is studying Chinese at
the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
He said that with rapid economic growth in China, Japan is
facing more business opportunities and more contacts with Chinese
residents at home and abroad. A Japanese who knows Chinese will be
easier to find a job.
</P>
<P>
Jung Eun Yee, a student from the Republic of Korea (ROK), said
that it is necessary for a Korean working in Beijing to have a
certificate for passing the Chinese proficiency test.
</P>
<P>
Jung, who got a certificate in July this year, said that ROK
enterprises now set it as a rule that all its non-Chinese
employees have to pass the HSK (Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi) which means
Chinese proficiency test.
</P>
<P>
Like Yuka Kadowake and Jung Eun Yee, more and more foreigners
are turning to learn Chinese and many of them have participated in
the proficiency test which is specially designated for non-Chinese
people.
</P>
<P>
According to Peng Hengli, an official of China's Language
Proficiency Test Office, 84,000 people from 115 countries and
regions in the world have passed the test so far.
</P>
<P>
This year, Peng said, more than 30,000 people participated in
the test, an increase of 25 percent over 1996.
</P>
<P>
Peng attributed this to the widening use of the Chinese
language with China's increasing opening to the outside world and
the growing of its comprehensive national strength.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, China's State Education Commission stipulated that all
those who applied to study Chinese in China's colleges have to
pass the test.
</P>
<P>
At present China's 18 cities have set up test centers and 16
countries including the ROK, Italy, Canada, Australia and Japan
also opened such centers.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Bad weather conditions with
violent downpours, gales and dense fogs hitting most of Italy have
caused two air crashes and killed at least 21 people over the past
two days.
</P>
<P>
Poor visibility caused by heavy rains and fog triggered massive
calamities across Italy and 15 people were killed in traffic
accidents today.
</P>
<P>
Four people were killed in a helicopter crash early Friday
afternoon in a mountainous region south of Naples under bad
weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
A doctor, a nurse and an elderly patient on board were killed
along with the pilot when the plane hit the side of a mountain and
burst into flames.
</P>
<P>
A recreational plane crashed at noon today near the city of
Chieti 10 minutes after take-off, killing the pilot and a tourist
on board.
</P>
<P>
The heavy rains have also hoisted the water level that halted
the train between Rome and Cassino for half an hour.
</P>
<P>
The recent capricious climate, such as continuous rain, fog and
chill, brought much inconvenience in the Apennino Peninsula. In
central Italy where earthquakes shook last month the situation is
particularly serious.

<HEADLINE> Le May Doan Sets two World Records at World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Canadian skater Catriona Le May
Doan shattered two world records in a double gold medal
performance at a World Cup speed skating tournament in Calgary on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Manabu Horii broke his own world mark in the men's
1,000 meters but had to share first place with Dutchman Jan Bos,
who matched the Japanese with a time of 1:10.63 as both men
bettered Horii's mark of 1:11.67 set in Calgary in 1996.
</P>
<P>
It was another heady day for the Canadian team, which won three
of the four races and seven medals in all. Last weekend Canadians
took eight medals and five of eight races at the World Cup opener.
</P>
<P>
Leading the way for Canada was Le May Doan who swept the
women's 500 and 1,000 in glorious fashion.
</P>
<P>
In the 500, Le May Doan, paired with teammate and runner-up
Susan Auch, eclipsed American Bonnie Blair's world mark of 38.69
set in 1995 by clocking 37.90.
</P>
<P>
Olympic silver medalist Auch clocked 38.67 followed by
Germany's Sabine Voker in 38.73.
</P>
<P>
In the 1,000, the 26-year-old Canadian posted a 1:16.07 to
demolish East Germany's Christa Rothenburger's record of 1:17.65
set at the 1988 Calgary Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Defending World Cup and world sprint champion Franziska Schenk
of Germany was second in 1:16.24, followed by American Chris Witty
in 1:16.38 as five skaters went under the old world mark.
</P>
<P>
In an extremely tight running of the men's 1,000, eight skaters
went under the old world mark.
</P>
<P>
Trailing Horii and Bos in third place was Canadian Kevin
Overland in 1:10.64, one-hundredth of a second behind.
</P>
<P>
In the men's 500, Canada's Jeremy Wotherspoon grabbed the gold
in 35.50. Bos was second in 35.77, with Canadian Mike Ireland and
Overland tied for third in 35.84.
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason for the outstanding times are the hinged
clap skates now being employed by almost all skaters on the
circuit. A hinge on the heel of the skate allows skaters to keep
the blade on the ice when taking a stride.
</P>
<P>
Competition continues Sunday with another set of 500 and 1,000
meter races for men and women.

<HEADLINE> APEC Ministers Commit to Economic, Technical Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VANCOUVER, Canada, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The foreign and
trade ministers of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
member economies promised here today to take further actions to
strengthen economic and technical cooperation, and free trade in
the region.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued at the end of the two-day APEC
ministerial meetings here, the ministers reaffirmed their
commitment to pursuing trade and investment liberalization, and
economic and technical cooperation, two pillars of the 18-member
group's mission.
</P>
<P>
They welcomed progress made in "continuing the liberalization
momentum through a mix of individual and collective actions as
well as through identification of sectors for early voluntary
liberalization," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
As part of the individual action plans for free and open trade
investment in the region, the ministers agreed on nine sectors for
early voluntary liberalization.
</P>
<P>
The nine sectors are environmental goods and services, fish and
fish products, forest products, medical equipment and instruments,
telecommunications, energy sector, toys, gems and jewelry and
chemicals.
</P>
<P>
However, "the process of early liberalization is conducted on
the basis of the APEC principle of voluntarism," according to the
document.
</P>
<P>
This means that each economy remains free to determine which
sectoral initiatives it will participate.
</P>
<P>
As to economic and technical cooperation, the ministers
"committed to further strengthen economic and technical
cooperation by fully implementing the Framework for Strengthening
Economic Cooperation and Development which was agreed to in 1996."
</P>
<P>
They also reaffirmed the importance of economic and technical
cooperation activities to strengthen economic fundamentals and
welcomed the efforts made this year in this regard.
</P>
<P>
To boost efforts in this field, they agreed to set up a SOM
(senior officials meeting) Subcommittee on Economic and Technical
Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The document noted that deepening the spirit of community in
accordance with the APEC approach is critical in exercising a
positive influence in the region and in the world.
</P>
<P>
"This vision of community requires that all sectors of society
develop a stake in the success of APEC," it said.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day meeting, the ministers thanked Malaysia, New
Zealand and Brunei Darussalam for preparing to hold APEC
ministerial meetings in the next three years.
</P>
<P>
"Ministers welcomed the announcement that the People's Republic
of China will host the 13th Meeting in the year 2001," the
document said.
</P>
<P>
APEC, initiated in 1989, now groups Australia, Brunei, Canada,
Chile, China, Hong Kong of China, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea,
Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines,
Singapore, Chinese Taipei, Thailand and the United States.

<HEADLINE> India's Congress May Decide UF's Fate Today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 23 (Xinhua) -- India's Congress Party may
decide on the fate of the 14-party United Front (UF) government
today as no solution has appeared to be in sight to the deadlock
between the two sides on the issue of the Dravida Munnetra
Kazagham (DMK).
</P>
<P>
The Jain Commission report, tabled before Parliament here on
November 20, linked the DMK with the conspiracy of assassination
of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Congress President Sitaram Kesri in his letter to Prime
Minister Inder Kumar Gujral on the same day asked him to choose
between the Congress and the DMK.
</P>
<P>
The letter said that the Congress cannot continue to support
the UF government if the government does not sack the DMK, one of
the UF constituents.
</P>
<P>
The core committee of the UF on the following day decided to
reject the Congress's demand to dump the DMK and authorized Gujral
to reply to the Congress.
</P>
<P>
Top political party leaders have said that despite their
reluctance to force fresh polls, chances of it were greater than a
solution acceptable to the Congress to exclude the DMK from the
government.
</P>
<P>
They did not, however, completely rule out a last-minute
solution.

<HEADLINE> Sensitive Index on BSE Stages Smart Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 23 (Xinhua) -- After breaking the 3,500
psychological level and hitting the week's low of 3,393.15 at
mid-week, speculatives staged a smart recovery on the Bombay Stock
Exchange (BSE) market in the past week on hectic bear covering and
selective purchases by financial institutions and foreign funds.
</P>
<P>
The late rally helped share prices to narrow down the losses
and even post moderate gains in a few heavy weighted index scrips.
</P>
<P>
Initially, the market remained very weak in the light of the
free fall in the rupee triggering heavy selling from foreign
funds.
</P>
<P>
Another factor weighing heavily on the sentiment was the
increasing instability on the political front.
</P>
<P>
The Congress threat to withdraw support to the United Front
government if the Dravida Munnetra Kazagham (DMK), one of the
constituents of the front, for its links in the conspiracy of
assassination of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1991, was
not dropped and the United Front's refusal to do so had led to
political uncertainty during week.
</P>
<P>
The BSE sensitive index recovered from the week's low of
3,393.15 to close the week at 3,523.44 as against last weekend's
close of 3,569.77, showing a loss of 46.33 points.
</P>
<P>
The national index also dipped by 18.81 points to end the week
at 1,525.22 from previous weekend close of 1,544.03.
</P>
<P>
The BSE-200 and the US dollar index were quoted down at 344.69
and 153.15 at the weekend compared with last weekend close of
347.16 and 157.36 respectively.
</P>
<P>
The volume of business improved moderately and the turnover was
remarkably up than last week.

<P>
BEIJING, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Europe will soon deliver its
first telecommunications satellite made for China, finally
breaking the US stranglehold on the Chinese satellite market,
today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Aerospatiale's Espace and Defence branch, a leading player in
Airbus Industrie, and Dornier Satellite Systeme (DDS), a
subsidiary of Daimler-Benz Aerospace (DASA), completed manufacture
of the Sinosat-1 telecommunications satellite for the Sino
Communications Satellite Company last month.
</P>
<P>
Sinosat-1, to be launched by a Long March 3B rocket at the
Xichang Satellite Launching Center in Sichuan Province, will go
into orbit in early 1998.
</P>
<P>
With a lifespan of 15 years, the Sinosat-1 has 24 C-band
transponders and 14 Ku-band transponders. The satellite will be
able to cover the whole of China and Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
According to Cyrille Gosset, Aerospatiale's satellite
representative in China, Aerospatiale's satellite technology
rivals its American competitors.
</P>
<P>
Gosset said Chinese technicians and experts were participating
in the general assembly and testing of the Sinosat-a satellite.
</P>
<P>
He said they are keeping contacts with other major Chinese
satellite operators, in the hope of opening up new possibilities
for satellite purchases.

SAN JOSE, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rica's foreign exchange
reserves fell 9 percent in October from the previous month to
996.9 million U.S. dollars, the Central Bank said today.
</P>

Central Bank Chairman Rodrigo Bolanos attributed the drop in
the reserves to a reduction of the dollar deposits maintained by
the commercial banks under the Central Bank, as well as to the
country's foreign debt payments.
</P>

Bolanos assured that the drop in the resevers would not affect

<HEADLINE> Balancing Local Economy to Lure more Foregin Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 23 (Xinhua) -- A senior official is proposing
to launch five economic belts to narrow the yawning gap between
Eastern and Western China in absorbing foreign capital, today's
china Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
China is traditionally divided into three parts in the economic
sense: east, central and west.
</P>
<P>
"While the east is racing forward in the fast lane, the west is
autarchic agricultural economy," said the trade officials.
</P>
<P>
But a geographic readjustment will improve the country's
economic flow between different regions, he said.
</P>
<P>
The five new economic belts would be: a Lancang-Mekong River
Zone, which encompasses Yunnan, Guizhou and Sichuan provinces, and
parts of Guangdong Province and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region; an Euro-Asia Continental Railway Zone stretching from
Jiangsu Province to Rotterdam in the Netherlands; a Northeast
Asian Zone based round the Tumen River Delta bordering China,
Russia and the Democratic Republic of Korea; a Bohai Sea Zone; and
a Coastal Zone.
</P>
<P>
The official said the new "demarcation" is waiting for final
State recognition, although they have already taken shape.
</P>
<P>
"We will focus on the development of the Lancang-Mekong and
Northeast Asian zones in the initial stage," he said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that an apparent advantage of the new geographic
pattern is that foreign investors in the Coastal Zone could easily
move north to the Northeast Asian Zone and south to the
Lancang-Mekong River Zone. And the Euro-Asia railway provides a
direct link to the west for investors.
</P>
<P>
What is heartening is that the United Nations, Japan, the
Republic of Korea and the European Union are interested in part of
all of these zones, holding out the possibility of providing huge
sums of money to stimulate their growth, he said.

<HEADLINE> Insurance Potential To Be Tapped For Financing Infrastructure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 23 (Xinhua) --- China expects to tap
insurance business potential as a stable source of funds for the
country's massive infrastructure construction.
</P>
<P>
An official with the State Planning Commission Yao Hong told
China Daily's Business Weekly that various forms of commercial
pension funds, or life-related insurance products, can be a major
long-term capital source for China's infrastructure projects in
the coming years.
</P>
<P>
Long term-fund sources have been a headache for China which is
eager to ease its infrastructure "bottlenecks".
</P>
<P>
Fiscal revenues are insufficient to meet all the demands, while
bank deposits, treasury bonds and other financial bonds are mostly
short-term sources of capital, Yao explained.
</P>
<P>
"Among insurance products, only life insurance is capable of
offering stable long-term funds of sufficient magnitude," he said.
</P>
<P>
But first, Chinese firms should learn from foreign companies'
business experience and the investment of insurance funds, Yao
said, pointing out that in many western countries, life insurance
plays an equal role in national economy as commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank estimates that China will need at least 700 to
800 billion US dollars to finance its infrastructure in the next
10 years.
</P>
<P>
It has become an urgent task to transform the pension funds
into long-term capital reservoirs by safe and effective investment
of insurance funds which is more stable than those from present
volatile securities market and real estate market, Yao
said.

<HEADLINE> APEC Ministers End Meeting, Agree to Set up Ecotech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VANCOUVER, Canada, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The 9th ministerial
meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum
closed here today with an agreement to establish a subcommittee on
economic and technical cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement issued following the meeting, the
ministers agreed to establish a subcommittee on economic and
technical cooperation "to better respond to the needs of member
economies."
</P>
<P>
"Ministers commit to further strengthen economic and technical
cooperation by fully implementing the Framework for Strengthening
Economic Cooperation and Development, which was agreed in 1996,"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Free trade will start in some of nine sectors as of January
1999, announced Canadian Trade Minister Sergio Marchi at a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
The nine sectors are environmental goods and services,
fisheries, wood product, medical equipment, telecommunication,
energy equipment, toys, gems and jewelry and chemicals.
</P>
<P>
However, the ministers will have to continue their negotiations
on when and how the selected trade sectors will be for
liberalization, said Marchi, whose country is chair of this year's
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the ministers stressed that the early sectoral
trade liberalization will be achieved only on the basis of
voluntarism and in accordance the timetable set up by APEC in 1994.
</P>
<P>
"We recommend that leaders endorse members beginning
immediately to complete the work on these proposals through
finalizing the scope of coverage, flexible phasing, measures
covered and implementation schedule...for each of these sectors,"
the statement reads.
</P>
<P>
Trade and investment liberalization, and technical and economic
cooperation (ECOTECH) are two pillars of APEC, which was initiated
in 1989. But developing member economies believed that ecotech is
far lagging behind.

<HEADLINE> National Assembly Elections in Srpska Orderly, Says Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The National Assembly
elections in the Republic of Srpska went on smoothly Saturday at
the 1,336 voting stations, the Tanjug news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Anto Nikolic, member of the Election Committee of Srpska,
declared in Pale the start of the voting process today from 8:00
a.m. in 1,107 voting stations in Srpska, 150 stations in the
Bosnian Muslim-Croat Federation and 79 stations in the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Registered voters, totaling 1.552 million, are to elect 81
members of the National Assembly from candidates nominated by 49
parties.
</P>
<P>
Voting will continue on Sunday. Monitors from the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) oversee the voting
operations at every station.
</P>
<P>
Robert Frowick, representative from the OSCE in charge of
Bosnian affairs expressed his satisfaction over the voting
atmosphere after his inspection in Pale.
</P>
<P>
He said he expected the election returns to come out on
December 10.
</P>
<P>
In late June, Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plasvic ran into
serious disputes with the National Assembly and the government
over some important issues.
</P>
<P>
The overt intervention by U.S.-led western countries led to an
escalation of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
A mediation by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic led to an
agreement reached on September 24, under which the conflicting
sides agreed to hold seperate elections for the Srpska National
Assembly, the president and the Serb member of the Bosnian
Presidency in November and December.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western countries, fearing Plasvic's possible
failure in the presidential election scheduled in December,
recently proposed postponing the election till next spring. But
the proposal was turned down.

<HEADLINE> China Predicts Booming Mobile Phone Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 23 (Xinhua) -- China will have a total of 13
million mobile phone subscribers by the end of this year. And the
figure will keep expanding by 8 million annually to reach 35
million by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
According to today's Business Weekly, China's mobile
communication business has been growing at a high rate of 150
percent on a year-to-year basis.
</P>
<P>
Many people see the mobile phone as luxury items and symbols of
wealth and it is specially true in the prosperous Guangdong
Province where the number of users will reach five million by year
2,000, the newspaper says.
</P>
<P>
Despite the massive expansion, the country's mobile phone
coverage stays at 0.92 percent, less than half the world's
average, the newspaper says.
</P>
<P>
But the low coverage offers business opportunities for major
international telecom companies which are competing each another
for the market share in China.
</P>
<P>
The cost of a mobile phone has dropped to some 5,000 yuan
(about 602 US dollars) from 20,000 yuan (2,410 US dollars) ten
years ago.

<HEADLINE> Construction Industry to Keep Steady Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 23 (Xinhua) -- China's construction industry
will forge ahead in the next decade both on the home and
international market, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
By 2010, the industry's annual domestic value-added output will
hit 100 billion yuan (12.05 billion US dollars), accounting for
more than six percent of the gross domestic product, according to
Nian Fuli, deputy director of the construction Industry Department
under the Ministry of Construction.
</P>
<P>
During the 1995-2000 period, the home-based industry will grow
at an annual rate of 13 percent, helping keep the annual growth
rate of the national economy at between eight and nine percent,
the deputy director said.
</P>
<P>
Construction now ranks third among production sectors in terms
of annual value-added output, behind manufacturing industry and
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Its value-added output last year stood at 456.8 billion yuan
(55.04 billion US dollars), up 8.6 percent from a year ago, Nian
said.
</P>
<P>
In the next decade, the industry will concentrate on the
construction of infrastructure, residential buildings, new cities
and the burgeoning rural market, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
Key infrastructure projects in the period include the Three
Gorges Project; the Xiaolangdi Project, the project to channel
water from the Yangtze River Valley to North China, the
construction of coal bases in north China, and some national
transportation programs, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 8.15 billion square meters of residential buildings
will be constructed and 2.9 billion square meters of housing will
have to be renovated.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 5.230 new cities and towns will come into being by
2000, creating a huge market for the construction industry. The
rural market's growth rate in the period will be much higher than
the national average, Nian said.
</P>
<P>
China's international construction industry, whose annual
revenue this year will exceed ten billion US dollars, also has
rosy prospects, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Besides their traditional markets in Asia and the Middle East,
Chinese contractors will try to expand their business in the
African and Latin American markets.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Businessmen Back Yen, Euro as Major Currencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Business leaders in the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are considering the
inclusion of the Japanese yen and euro as major currencies in
their currency exchange mechanisms to reduce the region's
dependence on the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
According to the Philippine Star newspaper today, the ASEAN
Business Forum's Executive Director Khoo Hock Aun said over the
weekend that for the longer term, "Southeast Asia should consider
reducing its dependence on the U.S. dollar and diversifying into
currencies that are a more objective and less volatile store of
value."
</P>
<P>
ASEAN should back the Japanese yen and euro as viable
alternatives to the dollar peg since the inclusion of these
currencies in the national foreign exchange reserves will
substantially reduce currency volatility, he said.
</P>
<P>
During the past four months, economies of Thailand, Indonesia,
Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines were all battered by a
wave of speculative attacks on their currencies -- all valued
against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
Currencies of the five ASEAN members have depreciated by 10 to
35 percent against the dollar since July.
</P>
<P>
Khoo said that mechanisms so far proposed to deal with the
currency turmoil include the surveillance of ASEAN members'
economic policies and pooling of financial resources in a
borrowing facility to stabilize currencies.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN Business Forum is reportedly to hold a meeting next
month to discuss a series of confidence-building measures for the
region's currency market.

<P>
PUNTA DEL ESTE, Uruguay, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The First

statement said.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed laws and standards related to mining
activities, and signed an agreement to intensify the search of
actions for a higher value added of the region's mining production.
</P>
<P>
The Mercosur member countries' legislators also decided to
create a permanent parliamentary group that will harmonize the
respective legislations in the mining area.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to hold such meetings once every two years and
accepted Argentina's proposal to meet the second time in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation agreements between the geological and mining
services of Argentina, Bolivia and Uruguay were signed. Argentina
and Bolivia also signed mining integration agreements with Chile.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Worldwatch: Policies Hold Promise for Climate Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Modest shift in policy can
significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and produce real
gains for the global economy, Worldwatch researchers announced
today.
</P>
<P>
"If all nations were to take up the most effective policies
already adopted one at a time by individual countries, global
emissions might already be falling," said a new Worldwatch report
released today.
</P>
<P>
Far from harming economies, as many officials fear, new
measures have already created billions of dollars of business in
solar energy, micro-power, and low-emissions vehicles, according
to the report, entitled "Rising Sun, Gathering Winds: Policies to
Stabilize the Climate and Strengthen Economies."
</P>
<P>
The industries in turn have raised incomes, lowered energy bill
and added new jobs, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It said several nations have adopted specific policies that
rapidly introduced new technologies and practices, and in a few
cases drove emissions down.
</P>
<P>
The researchers have found in their studies that in Britain, a
near-elimination of coal subsidies has helped the country to cut
coal burning dramatically and hold its carbon dioxide emissions
below 1990 levels in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In Germany, renewable energy incentives have allowed it to
surpass the United States as the world's leading generator of wind
power. In Japan, a program to promote the use of rooftop solar
power systems in homes has quickly made it the world's largest
market for solar-cells.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, in China, the cutting of coal and oil subsidies by
14 billion U.S. dollars since 1990, slowed carbon emissions growth
by 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report further noted that some European nations and Latin
American nations have begun to increase forest areas and
sequestering carbon. And some countries have worked out appliance
standards to save energy.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out, "Ironically, the longer the world waits
to begin reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the more difficult and
expensive the ultimate transition to a low-carbon energy system
will be."
</P>
<P>
The researchers urged industrialized nations to demonstrate
leadership in taking measures in cutting down emissions to show
the way forward for developing countries, where most of the new
growth in energy demand will be centered.

contributed to the maintenance of confidence in Hong Kong's role
as an international trading and financial center," Tung told the

fundamental change in policy as delinking would cause grave
uncertainty and disturbance which would weaken investment
sentiments," he warned.

Hong Kong's economic fundamentals are "strong", Tung said,
citing its prudent financial management, strong and highly
capitalized banking system and the third largest foreign exchange
reserve in the world.

Furthermore, the economy of the rest of China "which continues
to expand in an orderly manner will have a major positive impact
on us," he noted.

first to rebound" of all the countries and communities that have
been affected by the financial turmoil.

<HEADLINE> Leading Grain Producers Report Good Grain Harvests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Some grain growing areas in
China have reported record grain harvests despite this year's
drought and floods.
</P>
<P>
Southwest China's Sichuan Province, China's leading grain
producer, is expected to harvest 35.5 billion kg of grain this
year, a two percent rise of some 650 million kg on the record
output for 1996.
</P>
<P>
The province plans to increase its grain output by between 4.5
billion and five billion kg by the year 2000. Achieving the goal
will require the province to raise its per hectare output on
333,300 hectares of high-yield fields by 15,000 kilograms, Sichuan
will also have to increase multiple cropping coverage by applying
modern scientific techniques and investing 250 million yuan to
establish 25 grain bases.
</P>
<P>
Central China's Hubei Province has also set a grain production
record with the 1997 output of some 26.3 billion kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region expects to
record a record grain harvest of 2.5 billion kg. in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia harvested 900 million kg. of summer grain and expects
to record a five percent increase in its autumn grain output.
</P>
<P>
Northwest China's Gansu Province expects to have a good
harvest, despite the fact that total output will be slightly lower
than that in the peak year of 1996. Local grain departments
estimate the grain output will reach 7.5 billion kg. in spite of
an extended period of severe drought.

<HEADLINE> China Urges Actions on Economic Technical Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VANCOUVER, Canada, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier
and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen today urged the Asia Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum to set up a committee on
economic technical cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"A pressing task before us is to establish a corresponding
mechanism," Qian said on the second day of the 9th APEC
ministerial meeting underway here.
</P>
<P>
"We suggest that an Ecotech Committee be established at the
earliest possible date to facilitate the formulation of the
policies in this area and coordinate various activities," Qian
noted.
</P>
<P>
He noted that "what has been achieved lags far behind the goals
set by APEC leaders for Ecotech," although some progress has been
made in this area.
</P>
<P>
"Further actions should be taken to obtain substantive progress
in this field and change once and for all the situation in which
Ecotech has long lagged behind trade and investment
liberalization," Qian told the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"This is what we should do to conform to the community spirit
within APEC," Qian added.
</P>
<P>
Qian reminded the ministers that the precondition for APEC's
smooth development is to ensure that Ecotech and trade and
investment liberalization advance side by side and complement each
other.
</P>
<P>
High on the agenda of the two-day meeting are the early
sectoral voluntary liberalization, economic technical cooperation
and the financial turmoil in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The ministers and ministerial level officials from 18 APEC
economies are expected to issue a joint statement later today,
focusing on trade and investment liberalization an Ecotech.
</P>
<P>
Last year, APEC approved the Declaration on an APEC Framework
for Strengthening Economic Cooperation and Development. The
document, Qian said, is "an important milestone in APEC Ecotech."
</P>
<P>
"To increase cooperation in infrastructure and encourage an
inflow of investment and technologies into this area will help
diversify sources of investment and improve the quality of
infrastructure," Qian stressed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Qian said that China supports Malaysia, the next
year's host, in giving priority to the strengthening of scientific
and technical cooperation and the promotion of development in next
year's APEC work.
</P>
<P>
"We stand ready to work together with other members for
fruitful cooperation in the field," Qian affirmed.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Qian announced that China will in 2001 host the APEC
meetings, which comprises meetings of senior officials, ministers
and leaders from the 18 APEC economies.
</P>
<P>
APEC, initiated in 1989, now groups Australia, Brunei, Canada,
Chile, China, Hong Kong of China, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea,
Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Philippines,
Singapore, Chinese Taipei, Thailand and the United States.

<HEADLINE> Pierce Enters Final at the Chase Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The former Australian Open
champion Mary Pierce of France beat compatriot Nathalie Tauziat
6-2, 5-7, 6-4, to enter the final of the WTA Chase Championships
here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Pierce, the seventh seed, claimed the honor of becoming the
first Frenchwoman to reach the final of the prestigious season
finale, where she will face either second seed Jana Novotna or
eighth seed Irina Spirlea.
</P>
<P>
But it was no cakewalk with Tauziat, who had reached the final
in two of her last three events, refusing to go away and Pierce
nearly letting victory slip through her fingers.
</P>
<P>
As she had against world number one Martina Hingis, whom she
beat at the quarter-finals, Pierce got off to a terrific start,
belting winners with power and precision from both wings.
</P>
<P>
After saving a break point in the first game, Pierce lost a
total of just two points on her next three service games, using
her delivery as a weapon rather than merely a way to get the point
started.
</P>
<P>
She also forced the issue on Tauziat's serve, coming up with an
early break for 3-1 with the help of a brilliant running backhand
pass followed by a big service return.
</P>
<P>
Pierce broke again for the set at love and appeared on her way
to swift victory.
</P>
<P>
But the ever attacking Tauziat was able to put more pressure on
Pierce's big serve in the second set and the seventh seed was
forced to save two break points in each of the first and third
games.
</P>
<P>
Tauziat squandered two more break points in the fifth game,
screaming at herself in frustration. But an overhit forehand by
Pierce gave Tauziat a third break point, which she converted this
time when the Australian Open runner-up sailed a forehand long to
drop her serve for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Pierce managed to get the break back in the eighth game. But
Tauziat scored another break for 6-5, raced out to a 40-0 lead
with two of her nine aces, and captured the set when Pierce hit a
backhand return long.
</P>
<P>
In the final set Pierce came up with a key break in the sixth
game and consolidated it by holding serve for a 5-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
That left her serving for the match after Tauziat held.
</P>
<P>
But Tauziat, who had never been past the first round in her
four previous appearances in the 16-player event, broke a nervous
Pierce at love, drilling a forehand down the line for 0-40 and
forcing Pierce to hit a lame pop-up long to stay alive in the
match.
</P>
<P>
Just when it looked like Pierce might fall apart, as she has
often enough in the past, the tall blonde applied the pressure in
a tense 13-point finale.
</P>
<P>
Tauziat survived one match point and twice reached game points
with aces.
</P>
<P>
But Pierce delivered a stinging forehand down the line to reach
her second match point and Tauziat belted a forehand into the net
to hand Pierce victory.

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Saturday condemned the bus stop shooting death earlier this week
of a black man and the wounding of a woman who tried to help him
in Denver, Colorado.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was making a stop-over in Denver en route to the Asian
Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Canada.
</P>
<P>
Two suspected skinheads are being held in Denver on first
degree murder charges related to the attack.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said today that acts like those, which are driven by
hatred, will not tolerated in Denver or anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
"We must not, and I know the people of Denver will not,
tolerate acts of violence that are fed by hate against people of
another color, and we must not tolerate violence and hatred
targeted against police officers -- the people who put their lives
on the line for us everyday," United Press International quoted
the president as saying.
</P>
<P>
African immigrant Omar Dia was gunned down in the attack, while
Jean Vanvelkinburg, a 36-year-old single mother of two boys, was
shot in the back when she tried to help Dia, and is now paralyzed
for life.
</P>
<P>
In another accident last week a police officer was killed
during a shootout with a white skinhead, according to news
reports. The suspect then committed suicide with the slain
officer's gun.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said, "We must honor and support the efforts of our
fellow Americans, like the courageous woman here in Denver, who
act to prevent or mitigate such violence."

<HEADLINE> Syrian Vice President Meets Aziz on Iraq's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Vice President
Abdul-Halim Khaddam today met the visiting Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz on the current situation in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders examined the recent Iraq-U.N. crisis between
and the efforts being made to get over it, as well as inter-Arab
relations, according to Syrian television this evening.
</P>
<P>
The two sides underlined the importance of implementing all
the relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Aziz described his meeting with Khaddam as "positive," adding
that he briefed Khaddam on Iraq's standpoint on the recent events
and the outcome of contacts aimed at ending the standoff, resulted
from Iraq's expulsion of U.S. arms inspectors on November 4. All
the arms inspectors withdrew from Iraq later.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, all the U.N. arms inspectors returned to Iraq after
a Russian mediation.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question on whether his talks with Khaddam can
be considered a prelude to the restoration of diplomatic
relations between the two countries, Aziz said "the relations
between the two countries are developing, and we hope they will go
in this direction in the future."
</P>
<P>
Aziz said that both parties are interested in readjusting
inter-Arab relations, preparatory to make a better Arab stand to
meet all challenges to the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
Aziz arrived in Damascus Friday evening from Cairo, on the
first visit by an Iraqi leader to Syria since the two countries
severed diplomatic relations in 1980 over the beginning of the
Iran-Iraq war.
</P>
<P>
Aziz's current visit to Syria comes within a tour to a number
of Arab countries.

<HEADLINE> Aziz in Amman to Brief King on Current Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz arrived here Saturday evening to meet King Hussein on
the current situation in Iraq and the temporarily-calmed
Iraqi-U.N. crisis.
</P>
<P>
He will brief King Hussein on his recent efforts to defuse the
tension rising after Iraq's expulsion of the United States arms
inspectors, said Aziz upon his arrival in Amman from Syria.
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled to meet the king and Jordanian Prime Minister
Abdul Salam Majali Saturday morning. Then he will return home,
concluding his week-long global tour which includes the U.N. and
Russia.
</P>
<P>
His stopover in Jordan comes after all the U.N. arms
inspectors, including the Americans, were allowed to return to
Baghdad to their monitoring work Friday.
</P>
<P>
Iraq appreciates Hussein's efforts to help fix the situation in
Iraq during his recent stay in New York and Washington, said Aziz.
</P>
<P>
The king, while staying in New York, made a telephone call to
Aziz and asked about the situation.
</P>
<P>
Iraq appreciates Jordan's support for Iraq during the crisis
and its opposition to new sanctions and military action against
Iraq, Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq also appreciates the efforts of Russia and some other
members of the U.N. Security Council to help fix the situation, he
added.
</P>
<P>
About the current situation, he said that the "situation
becomes clearer now," adding that the crisis with the U.N. has not
ended yet as the seven-year-old economic sanctions, which bar Iraq
from exporting its oil, have not been lifted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iraq hopes that the arms inspectors will do a good
and just work in the coming days, he said, adding that Iraq is
still cooperative and serious with the U.N.
</P>
<P>
Jordan sided with Iraq during the 1990 Gulf Crisis.
