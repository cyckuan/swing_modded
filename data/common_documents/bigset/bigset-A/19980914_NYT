HBO, `FRASIER' AND HELEN HUNT WIN EMMYS

   LOS ANGELES _ For the sixth year in a row, HBO took the Emmy for
outstanding movie, this time for ``Don King: Only in America.'' The
movie also won for best writing, with a script written by Kario
Salem.
</P>
<P>
   The Emmy for best actor in a movie or mini-series went to Gary
Sinise for ``George Wallace''; the actor had been nominated
previously for his role as Harry Truman in ``Truman.'' The Emmy for
best actress in a movie or mini-series went to Ellen Barkin for her
role in ``Before Women Had Wings.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the awards had yet to be announced, but the Emmy for
best actress in a comedy series went, for the third consecutive
year, to Helen Hunt of ``Mad About You,'' and the best actor in a
comedy series, for the third time, went to Kelsey Grammer of
``Frasier.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Late Show with David Letterman'' won for best variety, music
or comedy series.
</P>
<P>
   In an evening noteworthy for the extent to which it reveled in
television's past rather than the immense uncertainty of its
future, Emmy Awards were presented Sunday evening largely to
established shows and a few first-time nominees in the 50th
telecast of the honors.
</P>
<P>
   Camryn Manheim, the earnest lawyer, Ellenor Frutt, in ``The
Practice,'' took the Emmy for best supporting actress in a drama
series. In one of the more memorable acceptance speeches of the
evening, the heavyset Ms. Manheim thanked her friends and
supporters, asked if she could get the autographs of her fellow
nominees, then shouted, ``This is for all the fat girls!''
</P>
<P>
   The Emmy for best supporting actor in a drama went to Gordon
Clapp, Detective Greg Medavoy in ``NYPD Blue.'' It was Ms.
Manheim's first nomination and Clapp's second.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony for the Emmys, given out by the Academy of
Television Arts and Sciences, was held at the Shrine Auditorium in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Kudrow, the sincere, slightly misguided, not always
coherent Phoebe in ``Friends,'' won her first Emmy as best
supporting actress in a comedy series. The best supporting actor in
a comedy went to David Hyde Pierce, the stuffy, emotionally
repressed Miles of ``Frasier.'' It was the second time he has taken
the honor, and he took a moment to particularly note one of his
fellow nominees, Phil Hartman from ``News Radio,'' who was killed
by his wife in late May.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Tolan and Garry Shandling won as best writers in a comedy
series for ``The Larry Sanders Show.'' It was the first Emmy for
Shandling after 19 nominations.
</P>
<P>
   The program was heavier on nostalgia than usual, with a series
of clips and moments commemorating people like the Marx Brothers
and Ed Sullivan and shows like ``Gunsmoke'' and ``Father Knows
Best.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a long standing ovation when Bob Hope, Milton Berle
and Sid Caesar appeared together onstage.
</P>
<P>
   The Academy and television executives were eager to focus on
creative achievements rather than the uncertainty of the future and
squabbles that have taken place behind the scenes for several
years.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, there has been much focus on whether several
records would be set Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
   David Kelley, the writer and producer, has been nominated for
and could win an unprecedented honor by garnering the Emmys for
best comedy, ``Ally McBeal,'' on Fox, and for best drama, ``The
Practice,'' on ABC. No one had previously been nominated in both
categories. These awards were scheduled to be announced late Sunday
evening.
</P>
<P>
   And ``Frasier,'' NBC's highly regarded sitcom, could also break
what many had thought a record as unassailable as Roger Maris' home
run mark by winning a fifth consecutive Emmy as best comedy. That
would mean it had taken the award every year that the series, about
an earnest but fumbling radio therapist, Dr. Frasier Crane, had
been on the air. Last year, ``Frasier'' tied the record of four
Emmys, matching ``Cheers,'' from which ``Frasier'' was spun off.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Last year, and even earlier this year, the world of television
was split into bitter factions because of the growing competition
that the cable channels are providing the broadcast networks, which
are struggling financially and losing audience share.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall several network executives suggested that the cable
channels ought to be placed in separate Emmy categories because of
allegations that they can spend far more on things like original
movies than the networks.
</P>
<P>
   This year the dispute took a different form, over whether HBO's
widely acclaimed, 12-part program, ``From the Earth to the Moon,''
about the Apollo space program, qualified as a mini-series.
</P>
<P>
   Meryl Marshall, the Academy's president and an independent
producer, rejected the idea of segregating the cable channels and
then turned down the protest against ``From the Earth to the
Moon.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only did it qualify in the mini-series category, but it
garnered 17 nominations, more than any other program this year.

GEORGE C. WALLACE, SYMBOL OF SEGREGATION, DIES AT 79
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: An abridged version of this obituary has already moved.) 
 (sw) 
 By HOWELL RAINES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Former Gov. George C. Wallace of Alabama, who built his
political career on segregation and spent a tormented retirement
arguing that he was not a racist in his heart, died Sunday night at
Jackson Hospital in Montgomery. He was 79 and lived in Montgomery,
Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace had been in declining health since being shot in his
1972 presidential campaign by a 21-year-old drifter named Arthur
Bremer.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, a Democrat who was a longtime champion of states'
rights, dominated his own state for almost a generation. But his
wish was to be remembered as a man who might have been president
and whose campaigns for that office in 1968, 1972 and 1976
established political trends that have dominated American politics
for the last quarter of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   He believed that his underdog campaigns made it possible for two
other Southerners, Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, to be taken
seriously as presidential candidates. He also argued ceaselessly
that his theme of middle-class empowerment was borrowed by Richard
Nixon in 1968 and then grabbed by another Californian, Ronald
Reagan, as the spine of his triumphant populist conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews later in his life, Wallace was always less keen to
talk about his other major role in Southern history. After being
elected to his first term as governor in 1962, he became the foil
for the huge protests that the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. used
to destroy segregation in public accommodations in 1963 and to
secure voting rights for blacks in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   As a young man, Wallace came boiling out of the sun-stricken,
Rebel-haunted reaches of southeast Alabama to win the governorship
on his second try. He became the only Alabamian ever sworn in for
four terms as governor, winning elections in 1962, 1970, 1974 and
1982. He retired at the end of his last term in January 1987.
</P>
<P>
   So great was his sway over Alabama that by the time he had been
in office only two years, other candidates literally begged him for
permission to put his slogan, ``Stand Up for Alabama,'' on their
billboards. Sens. John Sparkman and Lister Hill, New Deal veterans
who were powers in Washington and the national Democratic Party,
feared to contradict him in public when he vowed to plunge the
state into unrelenting confrontation with the federal government
over the integration of schools, buses, restrooms and public places
in Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   It was a power built entirely on his promise to Alabama's white
voting majority to continue the historic oppression of its
disfranchised and largely impoverished black citizens. And it was
snapshots of the peak moments of Wallace's campaign of racial
oppression that burned him into the nation's consciousness as the
Deep South's most forceful political brawler since Huey Long of
Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   First, on Jan. 14, 1963, there was his inaugural address,
written by a known Ku Klux Klansman, Asa Carter. In it, Wallace
promised to protect the state's ``Anglo-Saxon people'' from
``communistic amalgamation'' with blacks and ended with the line
that would haunt his later efforts to enter the Democratic
mainstream: ``Segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation
forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace's next signature moment came on June 11, 1963, when he
mounted his ``stand in the schoolhouse door'' to block two black
students, Vivian Malone and James Hood, from enrolling at the
University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa. Within days, it was
convincingly reported that Wallace, fearing jail for defying a
federal court order, had privately promised President John Kennedy
that he would step aside if first allowed to make a defiant speech.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace's in-state critics denounced him for a ``charade'' that
embarrassed the state. But the cold splash of reality did not
dampen his plans to use Alabama as a stepping stone to the national
political arena and to the anti-Big-government speeches by which he
obsessively longed to be remembered by history.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace talked of running for president in 1964 as a
neo-Dixiecrat candidate. But he backed off when the Republican
nominee, Sen. Barry Goldwater of Arizona, came out against the bill
that later became the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Goldwater's move
undercut Wallace's trademark assertion that ``there's not a dime's
worth of difference'' between the two main parties on race.
</P>
<P>
   After the election, Wallace regretted his timidity because he
thought Goldwater had run a campaign of comical ineptitude, and
when 1968 came around, he invented a party, drafted the eccentric
retired Air Force general Curtis LeMay as his running mate, and
began draining away the lunch-pail vote from Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for his success was that Wallace always campaigned
``with the tense urgency of a squirrel,'' in the memorable
description of one biographer, Marshall Frady. Another reason was
that his message worked among disaffected whites everywhere, not
just in the South.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace's political radar had picked up signals that Rust Belt
workers and urban white ethnic Americans from Boston to Baltimore
felt grumpy about black students in their neighborhood schools and
black competitors in the workplace. He cleaned up his language, but
he used an expurgated list of demons _ liberals, Communists, the
Eastern press, federal judges, ``pointy-headed intellectuals'' _ to
tap out in code words an updated version of his fire-hardened
message from the Heart of Dixie. It was race and rage.
</P>
<P>
   This blend of color prejudice and economic grievance appealed to
enough voters to win him more than 13 percent of the popular vote
and five states in the 1968 presidential election.

EARLY UPSETS MAKE COACH-SPEAK SOUND PROPHETIC 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Fla., Mich., N.Y., Ohio, Texas)  (nk) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Every college coach utters a version of it early in the season.
How his team has excellent potential, but don't make bowl
reservations yet.
</P>
<P>
   Their teams are young and inexperienced and have holes. They say
it as if they believe it, but when they actually do stumble, they
have a difficult time hiding their surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Since August, Bobby Bowden cautioned that his Florida State
Seminoles were young, with only 10 seniors. His starting
quarterback, the 26-year-old minor league baseball refugee Chris
Weinke, is the first true sophomore he has begun the season with at
the position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty stunned,'' Bowden said after North Carolina State
upset his Seminoles by 24-7. Weinke threw a school-record six
interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get beat like that, I'm very surprised, surprised how we
fell apart,'' Bowden said. ``Our offense just could not execute at
all. That's the biggest surprise I've got. For some reason, we
couldn't throw the ball and catch.''
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame Coach Bob Davie called last week's victory over
Michigan _ one that catapulted the Irish into the top 10 _ a ``big,
big win,'' but he warned that his team was a long way from
contending for a national title. His team did not wait long to
prove the coach right, falling behind by 42-3 in the first half to
an 0-2 Michigan State team on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm embarrassed; this football team's embarrassed,'' Davie
said after Notre Dame's 45-23 loss. ``There's not going to be a
whole lot of talk about it. I think we came in here expecting to
play well, and we didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Michigan's Lloyd Carr, on the other hand, pretty much kept his
concerns about his defending national co-champion to himself,
allowing only that he voted for Ohio State, his Big Ten rival, as
the nation's No. 1 team. Now his Wolverines are 0-2 after being
shellacked by Syracuse, 38-28, before the largest crowd in college
football history, 111,012, at newly renovated Michigan Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the ship sinks, it goes down fast,'' Wolverines offensive
tackle Jon Jansen said. ``We have to find out where those holes are
and get them patched fast. If you had told me this summer that we'd
be 0-2 at this point, I'd have said there was no way.''
</P>
<P>
   What is not surprising is that Florida State dropped from No. 2
to No. 11 in The Associated Press news media poll. Notre Dame
tumbled from No. 10 to No. 23. And Michigan slid all the way to the
dubious category of ``others receiving votes.''
</P>
<P>
   The upsets make room for some teams not usually tagged as
national-title contenders. In the West, UCLA's 49-31 victory over
Texas, the team's 11th straight victory dating to last season,
showed the Bruins not only have a Heisman Trophy contender in Cade
McNown (339 yards passing and 3 touchdowns), but are also probably
the best team in the region.
</P>
<P>
   In the East, Syracuse's victory over Michigan and near victory
over No. 6 Tennessee last week keep Donovan McNabb alive in the
Heisman race and make the No. 13 Orangemen viable title contenders.
They now settle into their Big East schedule, but their
nonconference schedule suddenly looks pretty good because of an
early October road game against North Carolina State, a newcomer to
the ranking at No. 21.
</P>
<P>
   One of the usual contenders, Nebraska, moved up to No. 3 with a
24-3 victory over California. And it has used its usual soft early
schedule to get over injuries _ five starters are out _ which
threaten its chances of winning its fourth national title in five
years. But how deep are the Cornhuskers?
</P>
<P>
   The starting quarterback, Bobby Newcombe, was sidelined for a
second straight week by a knee injury, and his replacement, Eric
Crouch, left with a hamstring strain after throwing for two
touchdowns. The third-stringer, Monte Christo, however, stepped in
to throw another one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are banged up; I don't think there is any question about
it,'' said first-year coach Frank Solich. ``I thought the guys that
did play, our backup players, did well. We have some depth on our
team, and it can certainly make us a stronger team as the season
goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Spurrier is also a proponent of soft early scheduling. But
after back-to-back routs of the Citadel and Northeast Louisiana,
his No. 2 Florida Gators head to Knoxville this week to face
Tennessee. In the first year of the Bowl Championship Series,
whichever team loses has a tough climb back to the title game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt if anybody is out yet with one loss,'' Bowden said.

RELIGIOUS LEADERS FACE CONGREGANTS QUESTIONS ON CLINTON SCANDAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``a'' national news file.) 
BY YVETTE CABRERA 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sex scandals aren't usually topics of church
sermons, but clergy across the nation used the Sabbath to focus on
the issue as parishioners struggled to come to terms with a
president who admitted to an extramarital affair.
</P>
<P>
   Some were faced with questions from church members about how to
explain President Clinton's conduct to children. Some said Clinton
should resign, and a number of religious leaders talked about
atonement.
</P>
<P>
   Pastors such as the Rev. Cecil Murray of the First AME Church in
Los Angeles took the opportunity to teach of sin, repentance and
forgiveness, as Americans continued to reel from details released
Friday about Bill Clinton's sexual affair with former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you will find very little if any opposition in the
minority black community to forgiveness,'' Murray said Sunday in a
phone interview from his South Central Los Angeles church.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through his sermon, Murray asked his congregation to
rise. He then spoke of how all should keep in mind that nobody is
without sin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally we have received a request for forgiveness, we have
received a commitment to repentance and our answer is a resounding
yes,'' Murray told his parishioners.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is a good leader who sees people regardless of their
circumstances, said Murray, echoing an opinion voiced by other
leaders in the African-American community.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has made terrible errors in this case and perhaps related
cases, but always on the scale of human values, one weighs the good
against the bad, and only one category fails to regard the good and
that's the total bad,'' Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Rabbi Elijah Schochet of Shomrei Torah, said much
can be learned from the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal, which is
unfolding during a key period for Jewish synagogues.
</P>
<P>
   Starting next Sunday, Jews will observe the new year, Rosh
Hashana, which begins the Ten Days of Penitence and will end with
Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, on Sept. 29.
</P>
<P>
   It is a time of the year when Jewish religious vocabulary is
replete with phrases like sin, repentance and atonement, which make
the Clinton issue all the more salient, Schochet said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very easy for these (phrases) to be abstract concepts,''
Schochet said. ``But all of a sudden there's a real live drama
that's taking place that brings it to the fore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it became a living demonstration of the central human
dilemma that we all face, which would be coming to grips with our
shortcomings, our mistakes in life and what to do about them,''
Schochet said.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous parents in Schochet's suburban synagogue of 750
families have approached him for advice on how to deal with the
questions that their young children have raised about Clinton's
sexual conduct.
</P>
<P>
   It is an issue ``I would say for quite a number of my members,''
Schochet said. ``How does one explain exactly what has
transpired?''
</P>
<P>
   Parents, with children as young as 3 and 4, who are faced with
this same dilemma have approached the Rev. Gary Dickey, pastor of
the First United Methodist Church in the San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a parent who told me, my child wanted to know what oral
sex was,'' said Dickey, who recommends that parents tackle the
touchy subject in a straightforward manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe this is the time to talk about these issues with a
child, as young as they may be, because if you don't talk, then
their decisions on what to do is determined by what they hear or
read,'' Dickey said.
</P>
<P>
   Dickey addressed the Clinton scandal in a Sept. 6 sermon but
declined to take sides on the issue of whether Clinton was guilty
or not. Instead, he used the opportunity to discuss morality and
sexual ethics and how this relates to a Christian who has to make
the same kinds of decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to expect from our leadership a good example because
our young people, our society, takes example from that
leadership,'' said Dickey, who did not broach the Clinton issue on
Sunday. ``It wouldn't matter if it was Clinton, Nixon or (Al) Gore.
The person is not the issue here; the issue is the ethics.''
</P>
<P>
   Opinion among Dickey's parishioners on what Clinton should do
now has been varied.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some who say he shouldn't be impeached and others
who say he should,'' Dickey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some are willing to forgive Clinton as much as any other
congregation might, but our issue is that forgiveness doesn't
mitigate one's actions. You can be forgiven, but you still have to
take responsibility for your actions.''

METRO MATTERS: ONE PRIMARY THAT'S NO HELP TO D'AMATO
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ELIZABETH KOLBERT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thomas Droleskey is not, he insists, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato's
enemy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm his adversary,'' he says, pausing to let the distinction
sink in. Still, it is easy to understand how D'Amato might get the
wrong idea.
</P>
<P>
   In each of D'Amato's three previous races for the Senate, he has
had, in addition to the backing of the Republican and Conservative
Parties, the support of the Right to Life Party. Though the party,
with fewer than 50,000 registered voters, is one of the smallest in
the state, it has played an outsized role in the senator's career.
</P>
<P>
   In his last race, D'Amato received 225,000 votes on the Right to
Life line, just enough to carry him to victory over his
Democratic-Liberal opponent, Robert Abrams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without our line,'' said the party's chairwoman, Lena
Harknett, ``he wouldn't be there now.''
</P>
<P>
   This time around, however, Droleskey, a part-time professor of
political science at C.W. Post College on Long Island, is
challenging D'Amato, claiming he is not enough of a true believer
to merit the party's nomination. For the last few months, he has
been using his newsletter, ``Christ or Chaos,'' to criticize the
senator while crisscrossing the state in his Saturn station wagon
urging party members to vote for him instead.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of losing to Droleskey, who received enough votes
at the party's convention in May to automatically win a spot on
Tuesday's primary ballot, has worried D'Amato enough that he has
paid for several mailings to Right to Life voters. But D'Amato has
elected not to stage a full-fledged campaign for the party's
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not that his anti-abortion stand is too weak to
defend; it is that defending it could cost him his seat.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Harknett calls D'Amato's voting record ``excellent,''
saying that ``as far as legislation is concerned, he has been with
us all the time.'' The National Abortion and Reproductive Rights
Action League essentially agrees with this assessment; the senator,
according to its tallies, has voted against abortion rights 91
percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   A pro-D'Amato flier passed out at the Right to Life Party's
convention lists 99 anti-abortion votes the senator has cast,
including 12 to prohibit the use of federal Medicaid funds to
finance abortions, three to ban abortions at U.S. military bases
abroad and one for a constitutional amendment that would have
allowed Congress and the states to outlaw the procedure entirely.
</P>
<P>
   Though often characterized as a legislator whose chief guide to
policy making is a finger to the wind, D'Amato has, with these
votes, clearly defied public opinion. According to a recent
Quinnipiac College poll, half of all New Yorkers believe abortion
should be ``generally available'' to those who want it, while a
third believe it should be available, but under stricter limits.
Only one in six shares D'Amato's view that it should not be
allowed.
</P>
<P>
   It is not D'Amato's voting record on abortion that has attracted
Droleskey's ire. Rather what offends him, he said, are the
political compromises the senator has made with abortion rights
proponents. He points to the senator's votes to confirm judges like
Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Supreme Court justice, and his support of
politicians like Gov. George Pataki as evidence of the senator's
insufficient commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``D'Amato doesn't care about changing hearts and minds,''
Droleskey declared. ``He cares about winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Droleskey added that D'Amato rarely spoke out about abortion
without being forced to, and generally has sought to say as little
about the issue as possible. Though D'Amato has used various
surrogates to campaign against him, Droleskey said, the senator
himself has refused to be drawn into debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I know,'' Droleskey said, ``he has never even
mentioned my name.'' Numerous calls to D'Amato's campaign
spokesman, Harvey Valentine, seeking a response from the senator to
Droleskey went unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens Tuesday, Droleskey acknowledged that he had no
hope of going on to win a seat in the Senate. When confronted with
the fact that his candidacy could help elect a Democrat favoring
abortion rights, he countered that the Right to Life Party should
not put local victories above the larger cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Third parties,'' he said, ``exist to move issues.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
DENVER _ Troy Aikman's left collarbone cracked, and Chan Gailey's
heart sank. The key to his reworked Cowboys offense was rushed to
an X-ray machine, brought back in jeans and a sling and declared
lost for a month, maybe two.
<TEXT>
<P>
   And as Gailey considered the wreckage of Sunday's 42-23 crash at
Denver, his quarterback's broken bone was, though not the least of
his worries, just one on a long list.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Aikman went down and out, his pain merely added
injury to insult. The Cowboys had been blitzed by the Broncos'
offense enough to remain well off the pace of the NFL's champions.
And a second-half rally to within a chance did little to cheer a
team with a defense as broken as its quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who expected this?'' Aikman said. ``This is the NFL. Nobody
can go into a game saying it's going to be a big shootout.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Cowboys were outgunned from the outset, long before
Aikman was hurt, and Gailey was left with an additional piece to
put back together before heading to New York to face the Giants on
Sept. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Garrett, who played well in Aikman's place Sunday,
throwing for more yards, 113, than in his past two seasons, will
replace Aikman for at least four weeks and as many as eight.
</P>
<P>
   But Aikman's departure Sunday had nothing to do with the
Cowboys' defensive failings.
</P>
<P>
   Before he was hurt, he had contributed nothing to the Cowboys'
pass rush, run defense or pass coverage. And that put him on a par
with much of the Cowboys' defense in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos led 28-14 when Aikman went out, having scored on
each of their first four possessions and with increasing ease.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos showed off both sides of their two-fisted offense as
if back in the Super Bowl, John Elway passing for 268 yards and two
touchdowns and Terrell Davis rushing for 191 yards and three
scores.
</P>
<P>
   Elway also left the game with an injury, but his strained right
hamstring is not expected to keep him out. He compared it to an
injury in 1996 with which he played for four weeks, until a playoff
spot was clinched and he could let it rest.
</P>
<P>
   And if he is given the time he had against the Cowboys' pass
rush Sunday, and could continue to pass against a confused
secondary, he won't need both legs anyway. The Broncos' 35-point
half was the most prolific ever against the Cowboys, as they scored
on all five drives while rolling up 379 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I've ever seen a team go five series and get
five touchdowns in the first half,'' Broncos coach Mike Shanahan
said. ``Any time you score 35 points in a half, five drives, five
touchdowns, you've got to be pleased. Using four wide receivers and
a tight end allowed us to spread the field out and give John some
targets.''
</P>
<P>
   And Elway threw darts. He found tight end Shannon Sharpe flying
past Cowboys safety Darren Woodson for 39 yards and a touchdown on
the Broncos' first possession. He fooled the Cowboys with a play
fake to easily add a 23-yard toss to Sharpe for the fourth score.
</P>
<P>
   In between, Davis sprinted untouched on consecutive plays as if
running wind sprints. He cut left around Dexter Coakley, then
outran the Cowboys' secondary for 63 yards on his first score. And
on the next Denver possession, Davis took a pitch, found a hole up
the middle and took off for 59 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said it all along: Mike Shanahan is an offensive
genius,'' Cowboys cornerback Deion Sanders said. ``He kept us
off-balance. And every time we made adjustments, he just made
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Cowboys corner Kevin Smith: ``They spread us out, and we
couldn't match up. They had a great game, a great game plan.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Cowboys stayed within reach. The Cowboys scored on three
consecutive possessions, Aikman passing to Ernie Mills for a
36-yard touchdown and Emmitt Smith scoring on a four-yard run. Even
on the possession in which Aikman was hurt, Garrett passed to
Michael Irvin for 32 yards to set up a Richie Cunningham field
goal.
</P>
<P>
   But each time the Cowboys would make a move, the Broncos'
offense would answer, as if nothing it had previously shown could
offer a clue as to how it could be stopped. Denver rolled 80 yards
to finish the half, Elway completing four of four passes for 71
yards before sneaking in from the one.
</P>
<P>
   And after the Cowboys drove well but settled for two field goals
to move within 35-23 early in the fourth quarter, the Broncos
erased any doubt. Elway began the drive completing three passes,
straining his hamstring on the third. But Bubby Brister came in to
toss a 38-yard pass to Ed McCaffrey, and Davis scored from the
three for a 19-point Broncos lead with 7:33 left.
</P>
<P>
   And as a measure of where the Cowboys stand early in the season
after last year's 6-10 record, the difference between the
rebuilding Cowboys and the teams at the top semed clear.

COWBOYS LOSE AIKMAN IN ROUT BY BRONCOS

 (ATTN: Colo., Texas)  (mk)

<P>
   DENVER _ This was supposed to be a measuring-stick game for
Dallas, an opportunity for the Cowboys to see where they stood
against a defending Super Bowl champion. Instead, it turned into a
punishing Sunday afternoon on a number of levels.
</P>
<P>
   On a football level, Denver pounded Dallas on the field, beating
the Cowboys, 42-23, behind quarterback John Elway's two touchdown
passes and one running score and running back Terrell Davis' 191
yards and three touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   On an even more painful level, both teams lost their
quarterbacks to injury. Aikman left the game in the second quarter
with what the team said was a fractured left collarbone, and will
miss four to eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Elway, who completed 16 of 22 passes for 268 yards before being
hurt, pulled up limping after rolling out for a pass to receiver Ed
McCaffrey midway through the fourth quarter. He left the game with
9 minutes 44 seconds to go after handing off to Davis. It appeared
that Elway might have pulled his right hamstring because he was
clutching the back of his thigh as he left the field.
</P>
<P>
   Denver raised its record to 2-0 and seemed to be in Super Bowl
form. Dallas (1-1), which visits the Meadowlands next Monday night
to play the Giants, is in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys will have to go against the Giants with the backup
quarterback Jason Garrett. The bad news for the Cowboys is that
Garrett is not Troy Aikman. The good news is that Garrett is 2-0 in
games he has started in place of Aikman.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman's latest injury came on the second of two runs around the
right end. He picked up three yards on the first run, when all of
his receivers were covered. He was forced to run again on the next
play, but instead of going into the quarterback hook slide, he went
down on his left side, and Denver's defensive end Neil Smith and
linebacker Marvin Washington landed on top of him, pushing his left
shoulder into the turf at an odd angle.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman got up slowly and then started to head back to the
huddle, but instead turned to the sideline. He was taken to the
locker room for X-rays, which revealed the fracture. He emerged
from the locker room just as Denver was driving for its fifth
touchdown of the first half.
</P>
<P>
   With one of the Cowboys' trainers carrying his shoulder pads,
Aikman walked past the Dallas bench and headed for the stadium
tunnel, holding his arm tight to his side.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman's injury thwarted any hope of the Cowboys engaging in a
shootout with the Broncos' high-powered offense. At the time Aikman
left the game, the Cowboys were trailing, 28-14. But the Dallas
offense was moving the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett managed to move the team into scoring position on the
drive when Aikman was injured. But the Cowboys couldn't punch it
into the end zone and had to settle for a 30-yard field goal by
Richie Cunningham that made it 28-17 Denver.
</P>
<P>
   The Aikman situation added injury to insult for the Cowboys,
whose defense was shredded by Elway, tight end Shannon Sharpe (two
first-half touchdown receptions) and Davis (two first-half
touchdowns on runs of 63 and 59 yards on successive Denver
possessions). Davis has scored a rushing touchdown in the last six
games, a team record.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, it looked as if this game might live up to its
possibilities for back-and-forth scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Elway found Sharpe, running as a slot receiver in a
five-receiver set, for a 38-yard scoring pass to give Denver a 7-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys came back with Aikman finding receiver Ernie Mills
behind Denver safety Eric Brown for a 36-yard touchdown pass that
helped tie the score, 7-7.
</P>
<P>
   Davis helped give Denver a 14-7 lead when he took a handoff, cut
back to the left and outran the Dallas defense for 63 yards to
score. He came back on the Broncos' next possession and again cut
back to the left, this time benefiting from what looked like an
illegal chop block against Dallas defensive tackle Chad Hennings at
the line of scrimmage, to score a touchdown on a 59-yard run. That
gave Denver a 21-7 lead. Hennings left the game with a sprained
left knee.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas running back Emmitt Smith, who had 93 yards on 20
carries, scored on a 4-yard run 52 seconds into the second quarter
to pull Dallas within 21-14.
</P>
<P>
   Elway followed that with a seven-play, 80-yard drive, which he
capped with a 23-yard touchdown pass to Sharpe that helped make it
28-14 Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Three plays later, Aikman was stumbling off the field, and the
Cowboys' hopes for this game and possibly this season were in a
sling.

SUSPECT AIDED BY FRENCH INTELLECTUALS

<P>
   PARIS _ For two decades, the police in Austria and Germany had
searched for the accused terrorist Hans-Joachim Klein, who was
arrested last week as he sipped beer at a cafe in the Norman
village of Ste.-Honorine-la-Guillaume, where he had had been living
for five years under an alias.
</P>
<P>
   But there were others, prominent people in France and Germany,
who knew where he had been all along, kept his true identity secret
and even paid his rent, they acknowledged in a letter published in
Le Monde on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Among them were the French philosopher Andre Glucksmann and
Daniel Cohn-Bendit, who holds dual French and German citizenship.
As ``Danny the Red,'' Cohn-Bendit was a leader of the French
student uprisings in 1968. After being expelled to Germany then, he
met Klein, who is German, in radical student circles of the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hans-Joachim Klein was arrested not far from his Norman
domicile only a few days before he planned to surrender,'' said
their letter, which was also signed by four other people, including
the co-author of a book that Klein wrote renouncing terrorism in
1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many of us in France and Germany who helped him by
protecting him against threats of death and vengeance by former
`friends' turned murderers, by giving him a minimum of support,
renting the house he lived in and paying the rent, and by trying to
help keep his spirits up during his long isolation,'' the letter
said.
</P>
<P>
   Klein was wanted by the authorities in Germany and Austria for
taking part in a spectacular kidnapping of OPEC oil ministers in
1975 that left three people dead and was led by Ilich Ramirez
Sanchez, the international terrorist who called himself Carlos.
Ramirez was captured by French police in Sudan in 1994 and was
sentenced to life imprisonment after a trial here last December.
</P>
<P>
   Klein, shot in the stomach during the OPEC attack, declared his
break with terrorism in a 1978 interview with a French journalist,
Jean-Marcel Bouguereau, one of the signers of the letter published
in Le Monde. A year later, he explained himself further in a book
entitled ``Mercenary Death,'' for which Cohn-Bendit wrote the
preface.
</P>
<P>
   ``Klein in fact not only renounced violence, he denounced its
errors and perversions,'' Cohn-Bendit and the others wrote. ``By
his book and through numerous conversations, he revealed the
reality of the distortion of `armed struggle.'''
</P>
<P>
   Cohn-Bendit, who lives in Frankfurt and plans to run on the
German Green Party ticket for a seat in the European Parliament
next year, could not be reached for comment over the weekend. But
last week Cohn-Bendit suggested that the arrest had more to do with
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's struggle for re-election in Germany's
elections on Sept. 27 than with justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The German authorities knew where he was all along,''
Cohn-Bendit said, and a German lawyer for Klein said that he had
been in negotiations with prosecutors in Frankfurt on a surrender
for his client since March.
</P>
<P>
   But the French police, acting on an old warrant from German
authorities, surprised Klein at his usual village cafe on Tuesday
night. He surrendered without a struggle and was arraigned and held
for possible extradition to either Germany or Austria.

 UNDATED: presidential election. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the 1972 race, he was running even stronger in the Democratic
presidential primaries. He rattled the party's establishment with a
second-place finish in Wisconsin and a rapid ascent in the polls.
He also won primaries in Maryland and Michigan on May 16, but got
the news in a hospital bed, having been shot and paralyzed on the
day before the balloting.
</P>
<P>
   The injury from Bremer's bullet became a ``thorn in my flesh,''
Wallace later said, and the truncated campaign became a thorn in
his psyche. He died believing that had he not been shot, popular
appeal would have forced the Democratic Party to put him on the
ticket in 1972 to keep Nixon from sweeping the Sun Belt and
blue-collar enclaves in the Middle West and Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace ran again in 1976. From the start, aides noticed that
the applause dwindled once crowds saw his shiny wheelchair. Wallace
noticed it, too, and in private he disputed friends who reminded
him that Franklin Roosevelt had won despite crutches and
wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' Wallace told his confidant Oscar Adams, ``they elected
Roosevelt, but they didn't watch him on television every night
getting hauled on a plane like he was half-dead.''
</P>
<P>
   The death of Wallace's presidential dream came just before the
Illinois primary, when he dropped out and endorsed a more modern
Southerner with no segregationist baggage, Gov. Jimmy Carter of
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace wanted to be remembered for his shining moment in 1972
and the Main Street themes he brought to prominence. Dan Carter, a
professor of history at Emory University and author of the most
detailed Wallace biography, ``The Politics of Rage,'' supports the
claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult to conceive of what American politics of the
1960s, 70s and 80s would be like without George Wallace,'' Carter
said in a 1994 interview. ``I don't think there's a single issue
that Nixon and Reagan talk of in terms of social issues that he
doesn't get to first.''
</P>
<P>
   In this view, Wallace's presidential campaigns prefigured, in an
especially abrasive way, a large portion of the country's politics
of later years. Wallace was the first major political figure in his
generation to exploit the antipathy toward Washington that went on
to be a prime force in politics from coast to coast.
</P>
<P>
   He was also surely the first in his generation to galvanize the
white, working-class voters later labeled as Reagan Democrats. And
he was the first nationally known politician of that generation to
put such raucous emphasis on race, crime, welfare and other issues
that still loom large, if less crudely, on the political landscape.
</P>
<P>
   After he retired as governor, Wallace used interviews to push
relentlessly at the theme that he was the real inventor of
Reaganism. Starting in 1979, he also undertook a campaign of
apology and revisionist explanation intended to erase the word
``racist'' from his epitaph.
</P>
<P>
   He argued that his early devotion to segregation was based on
his reading of the Constitution and the Bible and was
misinterpreted as a racist hatred of black people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a mistake in the sense that I should have clarified my
position more,'' he said in his last term as governor. ``I was
never saying anything that reflected upon black people, and I'm
very sorry it was taken that way.''
</P>
<P>
   That Wallace died haunted by race is appropriate to his life
story _ one of Faulknerian perversity embodying the old themes of
guilt and a steady, if clumsy, Snopsian aspiration.
</P>
<P>
   George Corley Wallace Jr. was born on Aug. 25, 1919, in Clio,
Ala., a cotton town in Barbour County, where mule-drawn wagons were
as common as cars on the unpaved main street. His father was the
wastrel son of a beloved local doctor. His mother, Mozelle Smith
Wallace, had survived abandonment by her mother and a depressing
girlhood in an Episcopal orphanage at Mobile.
</P>
<P>
   Like his father, George Jr. was quick with his fists and drawn
to politics. Calling himself the ``Barbour Bantam,'' he won two
Golden Gloves titles while in high school. As a 15-year-old
legislative page at the Capitol in Montgomery, he stood on the gold
star marking the spot where Jefferson Davis was sworn as president
of the Confederacy and where, by tradition, Alabama governors have
taken the oath of office ever since. It was the seminal moment of
his youth. Man and boy, George Wallace revered that spot, so much
so that as governor he ordered state troopers to encircle it so
that a visitor, Attorney General Robert Kennedy, could not put a
desecrating Yankee foot atop it.
</P>
<P>
   It was in 1937, on the oak-shaded Tuscaloosa campus of the
University of Alabama, that George Wallace began to define what he
would become politically. He arrived in the same shiny suit he had
worn as a page in Montgomery, but Tuscaloosa was a congenial place
for poor, ambitious country boys. And by tradition, it was a
virtual boot camp for future governors and senators. Young Wallace
won election as president of the freshman class. He never won
another student office, but his campaign to beat the fraternity
machine with a coalition of independents and out-of-state students
whetted his permanent taste for underdog politics.
</P>
<P>
   The other leitmotifs of his Alabama career _ cronyism and
betrayal _ emerged at the university. He acquired the hangers-on
who staffed his later efforts, and he made an unlikely, but
ill-fated friendship with Frank Johnson, a handsome law student
from Winston County, a Unionist stronghold in northern Alabama that
seceded from Alabama when Alabama left the Union. Johnson was a
Republican, Wallace an ardent New Deal Democrat. Johnson joked
about someday being a federal judge and Wallace about being
governor. But the big wheels on campus tended to dismiss Wallace's
ambitions as comical.

STATEWIDE CANDIDATES HITCH RIDES ON LOCAL COATTAILS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JONATHAN P. HICKS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a suite of offices above a storefront in the Crown
Heights section of Brooklyn, the campaign headquarters of
Assemblyman Clarence Norman Jr. was buzzing Sunday afternoon.
Teen-agers rushed to pick up campaign literature to hand out in the
neighborhood, while another cluster of campaign volunteers worked
the telephones, making sure that the 200 or so Election Day
volunteers had their marching orders.
</P>
<P>
   Norman, who is also the Brooklyn Democratic Party chairman, is
in the thick of a re-election battle, but the bustle at his
campaign headquarters was not only a get-out-the-vote effort for
him in Tuesday's Democratic primary, but for a string of other
candidates, including Charles Hynes, a candidate for governor, and
Eliot Spitzer, who is running for state attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, alliances between such local races as Norman's
re-election effort and a statewide campaign would be considered a
plus. But in this year's Democratic primary, where so many
candidates in statewide races are from New York City, linking one
campaign's get-out-the-vote effort with another's is considered
crucial to the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   In the primary for attorney general, for example, all the
candidates _ state Sen. Catherine Abate, G. Oliver Koppell and Evan
Davis, along with Spitzer _ are from New York City. And that
pattern is similar in the races for governor and U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom for a Democratic primary has been to
focus on New York City and one or two urban centers elsewhere in
the state. But that strategy has been turned upside down because
all the New York City candidates have balkanized the electorate
there. As a result, they have had to scramble for votes wherever
they can get them.
</P>
<P>
   That has made every connection more important than usual,
campaign officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer's campaign, with its deep war chest, has been
particularly notable for spending lavishly to win the support of
local Democratic clubs throughout the state. By contributing to the
campaigns of candidates for the Assembly and other local races, he
has earned the support of a host of foot soldiers, like those in
Norman's Thurgood Marshall Democratic Club.
</P>
<P>
   The payoff can be found in Norman's headquarters at the club.
Its ivory walls are filled with Spitzer's red-and-blue posters, and
a team of campaign volunteers marched out Sunday afternoon with
campaign literature bearing the names of Spitzer, a former
prosecutor, and Hynes, the Brooklyn district attorney, along with
Norman's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work together as a team,'' Norman said. ``And it benefits
all of us.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Abate, one of Spitzer's rivals for the attorney general
nomination, has focused her efforts on a combination of telephone
calls to likely voters and door-to-door visits by volunteers,
emphasizing Manhattan residents, women and Italian-American voters,
particularly in upstate areas, according to her Martin Brennan, her
campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they are done right, the get-out-the-vote operation
should be a combination of sophisticated organization and
grass-roots grunt work,'' Brennan said. ``There is not a lot of
thinking, just a lot of doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Candidates also have gone out of the way to court unions, whose
support is always considered an important force in a Democratic
primary because of their ability to make mass mailings, organize
telephone banks and turn out the vote.
</P>
<P>
   In the race for the Democratic nomination for Senate, Mark
Green, New York City's public advocate and one of three major
candidates in the race, began courting upstate Democrats more than
two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Green, who repeatedly closes his remarks by saying that he
believes the race will be decided by less than 10,000 votes, was
rewarded for his efforts last spring when he was endorsed by the
Democratic Rural Conference, a coalition of Democratic chairmen
from the state's 41 smallest counties.
</P>
<P>
   Well beyond the bragging rights, Green expects the rural
conference members to help him turn out the voters on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the campaign, Peter Vallone, the speaker of the New
York City Council and a candidate for the Democratic gubernatorial
nomination, won the support of the Democratic county organizations
in the Bronx and in his home borough, Queens. Those endorsements
are now bearing fruit, Vallone's campaign strategists said, because
of the large number of highly competitive races in the two
boroughs. There are several heated battles for the Assembly and
state Senate, and in some cases Vallone is supported by candidates
who are competing for the same seat.
</P>
<P>
   Local races also have the involvement of community groups and
established organizations _ an additional attraction for statewide
candidates. In local races where there are no official links with a
gubernatorial or Senate campaign, many of the statewide operations
are focusing their get-out-the-vote effort on areas where highly
competitive races are expected to draw a higher-than-average number
of voters to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Many statewide campaigns are calling voters and distributing
literature in the 9th Congressional District, which stretches from
Forest Hills, Queens, into southern Brooklyn. In that contest, four
Democratic officials _ City Councilmen Anthony Weiner and Noach
Dear and Assembly members Melinda Katz and Daniel Feldman _ are
running for the seat being vacated by Rep. Charles Schumer, who is
running for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Another such campaign is the race for a state Senate seat
representing the West Side of Manhattan. The incumbent, Franz
Leichter, is not running for re-election, and there is a spirited
campaign between Edward Schneiderman, a lawyer and Democratic
district leader and Daniel O'Donnell, a lawyer who is president of
a Democratic club and brother of Rosie O'Donnell, the entertainer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Statewide candidates hope that they can get some of the heat
given off by the friction of local races,'' said Jeffrey Plaut, a
partner at Global Strategies Group, a political consulting
organization.

NY SENATE RACE PITS THREE DEMOCRATS IN TWO TV DEBATES 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With less than 48 hours to go until their primary,
the Democratic candidates for Senate met in their first televised
debates of the campaign Sunday, two mannerly encounters in which
they squabbled over fund raising but mostly agreed on both the
shortcomings of Sen. Alfonse D'Amato and how a senator from New
York should vote in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   It was a day of smiles and first names as the candidates _
Geraldine Ferraro, Mark Green and Charles Schumer _ offered voters
a generally cordial discussion of politics and policy, interrupted
by only the occasional disagreement. The day precisely reflected
the tone of the entire Senate campaign in New York and left little
doubt that the 1998 contest would be remembered, at least in tone,
as the opposite of the antagonistic Democratic contest of 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate debates came on a day packed with politicking. In
another television studio, the Democratic candidates for the
nomination for governor met in their final debate, in which two of
them, Peter Vallone and Betsy McCaughey Ross, argued over Vallone's
commitment to abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, candidates for state attorney general and lieutenant
governor campaigned for support, shaking hands, visiting street
fairs on a warm late-summer afternoon and talking to any television
camera or reporter in sight.
</P>
<P>
   The comparative rush of last-minute politicking signaled the
approach of Tuesday's Democratic primary, the conclusion of what
several Democrats suggested were some of the quietest statewide
primary contests in a generation. As the campaigns went into their
final weekend, the candidates found themselves competing for
attention, and usually without success, with the investigation of
President Clinton. Fittingly, Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton
will come to New York on Monday, the eve of the primary, for a day
of fund raising, in the Clintons' first trip since the release of
the independent counsel's report on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate debates were clearly the most significant events of
the day, both because they offered viewers their first chance to
see the three major Democratic Senate candidates on the same stage
and because the Senate race is one of the few that has attracted
national attention _ D'Amato, a Republican seeking a fourth term,
is seen by some analysts as particularly vulnerable this year.
</P>
<P>
   Until Sunday, the three major Democratic candidates in the race
had only met twice for debate, in both cases upstate and not
televised. Schumer, a congressman from Brooklyn, and Green, the New
York City public advocate, had pushed for additional debates, but
Ms. Ferraro, a former congresswoman from Queens who ran for vice
president in 1984, had declined.
</P>
<P>
   Although the primary remained by all accounts volatile and
competitive, there were indications Sunday that some state
politicians were already looking beyond Tuesday to the general
election ahead. Over the weekend, D'Amato's campaign sent out a
mailing attacking Schumer's voting record, a signal that D'Amato
considered Schumer _ and not Ms. Ferraro, as he once did _ his more
likely opponent.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Schumer, reflecting confidence in his campaign,
quietly changed the tag line on his primary advertisements to a
theme that is intended for general election use if he wins the
primary: ``He'll make New York proud again.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, in the debates Sunday, he offered what his aides said
would be a central thrust of his attack on D'Amato should he win.
``Al D'Amato is not a legislator,'' Schumer said during the debate,
which was on WABC-TV and was sponsored by the League of Women
Voters. ``You cannot name a single piece of legislation he's passed
in 18 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer was the target of some of the only attacks of Sunday's
debate. Ms. Ferraro and Green assailed the congressman for the
aggressive fund raising that had allowed him to raise the $13
million that financed a saturation television campaign that both
his opponents said accounted for polls showing Schumer on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer responded by presenting himself as a champion of
restrictions on fund raising, and sought to differentiate himself
from D'Amato, who is also known as a tireless fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``My fund raising is totally different than Senator D'Amato,''
Schumer said, prompting a burst of laughter from an audience that
was largely made up of political supporters of all three
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer paused for an uncomfortable moment and then pushed
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am proud of the fund raising we have done,'' he said. ``We
have had 65,000 contributions from all over the country. Our
average contribution was $100.''
</P>
<P>
   At both the WABC debate and a later one with Gabe Pressman on
WNBC-TV, Green and Ms. Ferraro belittled Schumer on that score,
saying that he was a member of the House Banking Committee and thus
the beneficiary of contributions from banks and other financial
institutions with a clear interest in influencing his votes.
``Congressman Schumer is saying that he wants to change the system
that he milks reminds me of Elmer Gantry denouncing sin,'' Green
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ferraro said she would make campaign finance changes a
priority if she is elected to the Senate. ``Is it corrupt?'' she
asked. ``I don't know. But it certainly gives the perception of
corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, there were signs that both Ms. Ferraro and Green,
if scornful of Schumer's financial practices, were also envious of
his success. ``I envy Chuck a little bit,'' said Ms. Ferraro, who
has experienced fund-raising difficulties during her campaign. ``I
wish I had more money''
</P>
<P>
   When Pressman noted to Green that he, too, had received some
money from political action committees, the public advocate grinned
and said, ``I wish I could have gotten more.''

 UNDATED: deal down.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As this comment suggests, Wallace's first term was rowdy, even
by the standards of a region that had produced Gov. Eugene Talmadge
of Georgia, known as ``The Wild Man from Sugar Creek.''
</P>
<P>
   It is one of the paradoxes of Southern history that Alabama's
``Fighting Judge,'' by trying to revive the antebellum doctrine of
states' rights, instead enabled the civil rights movement to reach
its high-water mark. The Birmingham demonstrations in 1963 led to
the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Two years later the Selma
march led to the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these triumphs, it was a dangerous time for blacks and
whites who supported the civil rights movement. During the Wallace
years, at least 10 people died in racially motivated killings in
Alabama. Wallace and his flamboyantly inept and drug-addled public
safety director, Al Lingo, responded mainly by disrupting the
federal investigations into crimes like the bombing that killed
four little girls at the 16th Street Baptist Church on Sept. 15,
1963.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of Alabama's business and educational establishment,
always sensitive to the state's image, came to regard Wallace as an
embarrassment. The governor himself was hurt and stunned when
students at his beloved alma mater greeted him with chants of
``We're No. 50,'' a reference to the cash-starved university's
academic standing.
</P>
<P>
   But George Wallace was a creature of the storm who always had
wind beneath his wings, and that wind was the adoration of the
white farmers and factory workers and rural courthouse bosses who
counted the votes and doled out patronage.
</P>
<P>
   They loved it when Wallace waved his cigar, flooded his food
with ketchup and said that the guy pumping gas at an Alabama
crossroads knew more about Communism than the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   When a surprisingly strong anti-Wallace faction in the
legislature refused to alter the state Constitution to allow him a
second term, Wallace put his ailing wife Lurleen on the ballot in
1966. She won easily in a heart-rending campaign that demonstrated
the scope of his ambition. Only a few weeks before her husband
announced her candidacy, Mrs. Wallace had surgery and radiation
treatment for the aggressive intestinal cancer that would kill her
in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Political writers predicted that Alabamians would punish Wallace
for his cynical use of a sick woman. But he was only shifting
gears. He reclaimed the governorship in 1970 with the most
flagrantly racist campaign of his career, warning that his
progressive opponent, Albert Brewer, was using a black ``block
vote'' to install a regime of federal oppression. With Wallace's
clear approval, the Klan circulated fliers falsely accusing the
clean-living Brewer and his wife and daughters of sexual
perversions and miscegenation.
</P>
<P>
   It was a historic election for Alabama in two ways. First,
Alabama was resisting the epochal progressive wave that swept the
region in 1970 and installed New South governors like Jimmy Carter
in Georgia and Reubin Askew in Florida. Secondly, Wallace openly
committing himself to the presidential race track.
</P>
<P>
   By Wallace's reckoning, his appeal to blue-collar voters outside
the South had ``shaken the eyeteeth'' of both major parties in
1968. Indeed, President Nixon so feared Wallace's disruptive
potential in 1972 that he supplied $400,000 to Wallace's opponent
in the 1970 campaign for governor. But Wallace won with his racist
attacks and his invitation to Alabamians to ``send them a message''
by launching him toward the 1972 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   For a few months, Wallace was the hottest thing going. Gone were
the pomaded hair and the bargain-store threads. His stylish new
wife, Cornelia Ellis Snively, a niece of former Governor Folsom,
decked out Wallace in modish, wide-lapel suits and taught him to
use a blow dryer. Wallace talked less about race because he could
afford to. His attacks on school busing let conservative whites
know where he stood.
</P>
<P>
   As Wallace moved toward victory in the Florida primary, Nixon
himself made an anti-busing speech that was regarded as a tribute
to Wallace's growing appeal. Wallace finished second behind Sen.
George McGovern in the Wisconsin primary and second to former Vice
President Hubert Humphrey in Indiana. Having established himself as
a force in the Democratic Party, he was topping the polls in the
primary campaigns of Maryland and Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   But on the afternoon of May 15, at an unnecessary campaign rally
in Laurel, Md., Wallace overruled the Secret Service and moved into
a crowd for a final round of handshaking. ``Hey, George, let me
shake hands with you,'' shouted Arthur Bremer. Frustrated in an
earlier ambition to kill Nixon, Bremer, had been stalking the
governor for weeks. From a range of three feet, the gunman shot
Wallace three times, severing his spine and paralyzing him for
life. Bremer is now in prison in Maryland, serving the 63-year
sentence given him in June 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Although his presidential hopes ended, Wallace won two more
terms as governor by appealing to white loyalty and catering to the
thousands of new black voters whose franchise he had opposed. But
Wallace now behaved more like a pensioner than a chief executive.
The constant pain from his wound _ ``the thorn in my flesh'' _
limited his concentration and resulted in a dependence on methadone
and other painkillers. He became pathologically jealous of his
wife, Cornelia, who after a messy divorce in 1978 encountered her
own problems with substance abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace's hope to found a dynasty foundered when his son, George
Jr., proved a querulous campaigner who could not progress beyond
minor state offices. Wallace married again to a failed country
singer named Lisa Taylor. That marriage, too, generated sour
publicity before they divorced in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by four children from his first marriage: his
son, of Montgomery; three daughters, Lee Dye and Bobbi Jo Parsons,
both of Birmingham, and Peggy Kennedy of Montgomery; two brothers,
Gerald, of Montgomery, and Jack, of Eufaula, Ala.; and several
grandchildren.

BLACKFACE INCIDENT LEAVES RESIDENTS WITH MIXED FEELINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Wearing blackface and Afro wigs, the men who piled
into a pickup truck for the Labor Day parade in Broad Channel,
Queens, were trying to win a trophy. For decades, parade organizers
have awarded trophies for categories like ``cutest baby'' or ``most
popular pet,'' and the men had won ``funniest float'' for nine
straight years.
</P>
<P>
   Within Broad Channel, a narrow island in Jamaica Bay where
nearly everyone is white, the men had won with past themes like
``Gooks of Hazzard,'' ``Hasidic Park'' and ``Happy Gays.'' This
year's theme _ ``Black to the Future, Broad Channel, 2098'' _
stayed true to their formula of mocking minorities. They bounced
basketballs and tossed slices of watermelon.
</P>
<P>
   Would the formula have worked again? No one will ever know. The
float had not yet reached the judges when the Labor Day storms
suddenly interrupted the parade. Most people in Broad Channel first
saw it the next night when an amateur videotape was broadcast on
television. It showed one of the men mimicking a horrific hate
crime: the June killing of a black man in Texas, dragged behind a
pickup truck by three white men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell you,'' said Denise Horan, a Broad Channel
resident, ``it hurt like hell to see that.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet after a week of fierce outside condemnation and scrutiny,
there is still ambivalence in Broad Channel. Many residents have
spoken out, expressing shame and horror even as they defend their
``small town'' against charges of racism. On Saturday, a New York
City police officer, suspended for joining the float, publicly
apologized, declaring ``I'm not a racist.'' Four other men also
came forward and apologized.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone is sorry. There are people seething with anger,
unapologetic for something they consider a harmless joke. Nearly
everyone is furious that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is trying to
dismiss the police officer and two city firefighters who joined the
float. They are angrier still at the mayor for withdrawing city
money from the volunteer fire department and revoking the sale of
city land for a new firehouse. The ``vollies,'' who sponsored the
Labor Day parade, are the heart of Broad Channel.
</P>
<P>
   ``First time I ever agreed with that Al Sharpton,'' said Tommy
Mink, 67, a retired construction worker. ``He always accuses
Giuliani of overreaching. We have an awful lot of hate for the city
and for Giuliani now. He's playing politics.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was younger, Mink said he rode in a float that lampooned
civil rights advocates in the South. ``Every year they have a
parade and something gets in there,'' he said of the Labor Day
tradition. ``Whether it's a black float or a Jew float. It's all in
fun. They may call it prejudice, but it isn't prejudice. If there's
any town without prejudice, this is it.''
</P>
<P>
   Broad Channel, Mink explained, ``didn't have to have any''
prejudice because it has few, if any, black residents. Instead,
many of the families are Irish, German or Italian, some having
lived on the island for generations. It is isolation from the throb
of the city that many residents seek; Broad Channel is tethered to
New York City by bridge and by politics, but not by spirit. Visible
in the distance beyond Jamaica Bay, the Manhattan skyline rises
above the marshes on clear days, as remote and otherworldly as the
moon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a small town in New York City,'' said Dan Tubridy, whose
family has lived on the island since the 1920s. ``We're very proud
of that, very happy about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the ethnic roar of the city, the encroaching threat of dark,
unfamiliar faces, was apparently the focus of the group's attempt
at parody. ``What they were spoofing was that in the year 2098
their community, which is all white now, would have to have
blacks,'' said Marvyn Kornberg, a lawyer for four of the men.
``They were spoofing their own community.''
</P>
<P>
   Such fears, and resentments, are not hard to find in Broad
Channel. ``This was a bunch of black guys who were supposed to be
drunk coming back from a basketball game,'' a 43-year-old man said
of the float. ``Where was that racist? That's the whole idea of it
_ to be like `Saturday Night Live.' Chris Rock can do it. Why can't
we?''
</P>
<P>
   The man, a white construction worker who refused to give his
name, said he left Brooklyn for Broad Channel about 15 years ago
when his once-white neighborhood, Cypress Hills, began to change.
His parents, he said, are ``trapped'' there. Now, he fears the same
could happen to Broad Channel. The island's first real-estate
office, Century 21, opened in May, and a sign hanging in the window
promises, ``Houses Bought, All Ca$h, any condition.'' He said
brokers had called residents, searching for sellers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you ever seen blockbusting before?'' asked the man, who
lives on Cross Bay Boulevard, the community's main thoroughfare.
``You pay anything you need to pay to get the neighborhood
moving.'' He wondered aloud whether Century 21 officials had
videotaped the float, an assertion denied by a Century 21 manager,
Francine Hamill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not discriminate,'' she said. ``I think the incident
that happened is in very poor taste.'' She said her office had
called residents to look for dilapidated or undeveloped property.
But she did not mind the publicity. ``Not too many people know
about Broad Channel,'' she said. ``Now it's on everybody's lips.
It's not going to hurt me.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For decades, people on Broad Channel leased their land from the
city, which flirted with the idea of making it a park or a nature
preserve. Only in March 1995 did the city finally sell residents
the last parcels. Until then, many people could not get mortgages
or improvement loans for houses built on land they did not own.
Still, they stayed, many of them city employees who said they were
drawn by the salt air and quiet living.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know everybody,'' said one white resident, a Fordham
University student who refused to give his name. ``You can go over
to your neighbor's house and ask for bread or cheese if you don't
have any. It's nice when you see somebody in the street and they
say hello to you and you say hello to them.''
</P>
<P>
   What infuriates so many people is the harm the parade has
brought to the Broad Channel Volunteer Fire Department and
Ambulance Corps. Ray Holloway, who lives on Cross Bay Boulevard,
said the ``vollies'' have a waiting list. Affixed to many front
doors are small stickers that say, ``We Care, We Gave,'' indicating
a household that contributed to the fire department. With only
sporadic help from city fire trucks, the vollies handle more than
200 calls a year, including many on Labor Day, when Holloway said
they helped him with his collapsed chimney.
</P>
<P>
   To raise money every year, the fire department rotates
sponsorship of the Labor Day parade with officials of the local
youth athletic league. The parade is part of a weekend ``Mardi
Gras'' celebration, replete with parties and dances. Now, Giuliani
has canceled the city's $6,100 contribution to the volunteers and
revoked a deal to sell a piece of city property as a site for a new
firehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Many residents accused the mayor of trying to appease his
critics over the tactics used by police at the end of a Harlem
youth rally on Sept. 5. ``I'm very upset that the firehouse is
taking the fall for it,'' Ms. Horan said. ``They should come down
here when we're in the middle of a bad winter storm and they're on
boats rescuing people out of their houses.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the volunteer fire department refused to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the ``Black to the Future'' float, the Broad Channel
parade was benign. Children rode in floats titled ``Little
Rascals'' and ``The Wizard of Oz.'' Some teen-agers wore Spice
Girls costumes. There were bagpipers and school bands and a
procession of babies in strollers. In one float, a woman
masqueraded as Monica Lewinsky while a man impersonating President
Clinton yelled, ``I didn't do it! I didn't do it!''
</P>
<P>
   Then, lastly, came ``Black to the Future.'' The group apparently
registered only minutes before the start of the parade. Kornberg,
the lawyer, said the man who jumped behind the truck as if it were
dragging him did so without telling the others.
</P>
<P>
   ``The float was definitely in very poor taste,'' said Kathleen
Holloway, Ray Holloway's wife. ``No one is going to deny that, but
the people involved aren't horrible people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To say that everybody in Broad Channel is racist, and to say
we bring up our children to be prejudiced, is not right,'' she
added. ``Was it a racist act? I don't know. Are they racists? I
don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   One person who did see the ``Black to Future'' float, a
23-year-old white man, had watched the parade in front of Eddie B's
Bar. He said the float ``got out of control'' but called it just a
joke. ``They make fun of the Jews and the gays, and no one
complained about it as far as the city or the media,'' said the
man, who refused to give his name. ``And since they make fun of the
blacks, they make a big deal out of it. How did they hurt
anybody?''

EMMYS USE COMMAND OF TV TO CELEBRATE MEDIUM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``n'' California news file.) 
BY   KEITH MARDER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The television industry gets together to
congratulate itself in an annual ritual called the Emmy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   It's a wonder there isn't a rash of dislocated shoulders the
morning after.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday at the Shrine Auditorium, the television industry had
reason to celebrate. Its 50th Prime-time Emmy Awards show was a
time to reflect on how it has grown and what it has done best.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Oscars, which bogged down its 70th Award show with a
roll call of past winners, television knows how to do television.
It pulled off its self-tribute with an exciting range of historical
pieces. (Also, unlike the Oscars, the Emmys ended on time.)
</P>
<P>
   We saw whimsy and tragedy, improvements in cultural diversity
and the mushrooming of channels.
</P>
<P>
   If ever the changes in television were in question, consider
that Milton Berle and Katie Holmes (``Dawson's Creek'') appeared on
the same stage, we were reminded that Lesley Ann Warren and R&AMP;B
sensation Brandy both appeared as Cinderella, that the same box
that brought you a man landing on the moon also showed ``Mr. Ed.''
We also learned who shot J.R. and who shot JFK the same way.
</P>
<P>
   And as the country has grown up and acquired a higher tolerance
for racy material, that is what television has delivered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different world,'' said Sid Caesar, who was honored
along with fellow comedy legends Berle and Bob Hope. ``It's
actually a different universe. We couldn't say `pregnant.' Pregnant
was a dirty word. We could say `with child' or `expecting,' but
`pregnant' was dirty. Today ...'' he laughed.
</P>
<P>
   The record-long, four-hour Emmy broadcast unleashed by executive
producer Don Mischer and director Louis J. Horvitz efficiently and
effectively told the story of television with devices such as the
top 10 television moments of all time, time-line trivia questions
and a performance by percussion/dance troupe STOMP with perfectly
timed television clips running on large screens behind them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (space shuttle) Challenger disaster and those other great
moments are spectacular,'' said Mark Tinker, who won an Emmy for
outstanding director of a drama series. ``And the goodbyes are very
touching. The 50 years of television gets you right here.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a broadcast runs the risk of being didactic and ponderous,
but the reasonably fast-moving show offered enough eye candy to
keep even the notoriously short-attention-span viewing audience
entertained.
</P>
<P>
   Sure some of the segments fell short. Interviews with ``real
viewers'' were too slickly produced and packaged, losing any
spontaneity.
</P>
<P>
   The top 10 list, which was voted on by television historians and
journalists, left enough area for debate. For instance, the
premiere of ``Hill Street Blues'' ranked third, ahead of the
Kennedy assassination, Johnny Carson's final ``Tonight Show'' and
the Challenger explosion. ``Hill Street'' may have been
cutting-edge television, but that episode is not exactly one of
those events where you knew where you where when you heard the
news.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night's Emmy broadcast may not be remembered as one of
the great moments in television, but its four-hour tour of the
medium's greatest hits was a pleasant trip down memory lane. &UR;

VU VAN MAU, 84, SAIGON'S LAST PRIME MINISTER, IS DEAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ERIC PAGE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vu Van Mau, who was briefly South Vietnam's prime minister _ and
who called for all Americans to leave Saigon just before it fell to
the Communist forces in 1975 _ died on Aug. 20 in a hospital in
Paris. He was 84.
</P>
<P>
   He emigrated from Vietnam to France in 1988, Le Monde said in
reporting his death on Saturday. He died of natural causes, said
his son Dung Vu Hoang, according to The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Vu Van Mau was a Buddhist politician who was an advocate of
nonviolence and president of Forces for Reconciliation, a South
Vietnamese pacifist party. He was named prime minister by Gen.
Duong Van Minh, a South Vietnamese proponent of peace, neutrality
and cooperation with the Vietnamese Communists, in the last days
before the Communists achieved victory in the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   Minh became president after a Vietcong broadcast on April 24
strongly implied that only he was acceptable to them at the head of
the Saigon government.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the broadcast, while the Vietcong had not
declared that they would attack Saigon if their demands were not
met, there was no doubt among Saigon's residents that the
Communists were likely to attack soon _ and military and political
leaders expected that the outcome would be shattering. The Vietcong
had been calling for the departure of the incumbent South
Vietnamese president, Tran Van Huong, along with his political
associates and all ``American troops and military advisers
disguised as civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   In the days after the Vietcong broadcast, the departure of
Americans and some South Vietnamese progressed, President Ford
ordered the emergency evacuation of all Americans from South
Vietnam, Communist attacks continued around Saigon and a rocket
barrage hit the city's airport.
</P>
<P>
   On April 29, Minh, meeting with a U.S. officer, insisted only on
the prompt withdrawal of the staff of the U.S. defense attache's
office, Frank Snepp, a former CIA official in Vietnam, wrote in his
book ``Decent Interval: An Insider's Account of Saigon's Indecent
End'' (1977).
</P>
<P>
   But not more than an hour later, Snepp wrote, Saigon Radio
broadcast ``an appeal from the new prime minister, Vu Van Mau,
calling on all Americans to leave Saigon at once.'' Snepp wrote
that by the time of that broadcast, it seemed, Minh ``was angling
for maximum political advantage with the Communists by closing the
door on us all.''
</P>
<P>
   Late in the day of April 29, the United States put an end to
decades of military involvement in Vietnam by evacuating about
1,000 Americans and more than 5,000 South Vietnamese from Saigon.
On the following day, North Vietnamese troops marched into the
capital.
</P>
<P>
   North Vietnamese troops were seen leading Vu Van Mau away on May
3, 1975, but on May 4 Saigon radio said that he had been released.
In 1976, North and South Vietnam were united.
</P>
<P>
   Vu Van Mau was born and raised in Hanoi, earned a doctorate in
law from the University of Paris, practiced law in Hanoi and moved
to Saigon in 1954, after Vietnam's partition, along with his wife _
who died in 1969 _ a daughter and four sons. He went on to become
dean of the University of Saigon's faculty of law and later foreign
minister and then Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs under
South Vietnam's President, Ngo Dinh Diem, from 1955 to 1963.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, after South Vietnamese forces attacked Buddhist clergy,
Vu Van Mau resigned his government post and ``shaved his head like
a Buddhist monk as a gesture of protest,'' Stanley Karnow wrote in
his book ``Vietnam: a History''(1983, Penguin). At that time,
Karnow said in an interview, ``He was a gentle sort of guy.''
</P>
<P>
   In the mid 1960s he was South Vietnam's ambassador to Britain,
Belgium and the Netherlands. He was a senator from 1970 to 1975.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by five children and 15 grandchildren.

TV ACADEMY CELEBRATES ITS TOP TEN GIANT LEAPS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Honoring 50 years of Emmy Awards, Sunday's show
included a countdown of television's top 10 moments in history as
determined by TV historians and journalists.
</P>
<P>
   --10. The Beatles on ``The Ed Sullivan Show.'' The Feb. 9, 1964,
show drew 75 percent of all TV viewers. The Fab Four sang ``All My
Loving,'' ``She Loves You'' and ``I Want to Hold Your Hand'' before
a crowd of screaming teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   --9. Johnny Carson's final show. Carson had no celebrity guests
the night he closed his 4,531st show on May 22, 1992. Instead, he
showed clips from his 30 years on ``The Tonight Show'' before he
told viewers: ``I bid you a very heartfelt good night.''
</P>
<P>
   --8. Lucy having a baby. By coincidence, the Jan. 19, 1953, air
date of this taped ``I Love Lucy'' episode was the actual birth
date of Desi Arnaz Jr. ``I Love Lucy'' was the highest-rated
program of its day.
</P>
<P>
   --7. ``MASH'' finale. After 11 seasons, ``MASH'' said goodbye on
Feb. 28, 1983, with a 2{-hour special that was seen by the largest
audience ever to watch a single television program.
</P>
<P>
   --6. ``Who shot J.R.?'' Probably one of the most effective
cliffhangers in TV history, the ``Dallas'' episode that aired March
21, 1980, kept an international audience suspended all summer.
</P>
<P>
   --5. Challenger explosion. An American audience accustomed to
clean launches watched stunned as the space shuttle Challenger
exploded over the Atlantic Ocean 74 seconds after takeoff on Jan.
28, 1986, killing the seven people on board, including
schoolteacher Christa McAuliffe.
</P>
<P>
   --4. Kennedy assassination. Caught on a home movie camera, the
fatal gunshot that felled President John F. Kennedy on Nov. 22,
1963, rang across the nation. Newsman Walter Cronkite solemnly
delivered word of the death to a nation in shock.
</P>
<P>
   --3. Premiere of ``Hill Street Blues.'' Sgt. Phil Esterhaus' 7
a.m. roll call became the trademark opening of every episode. The
critically acclaimed series would take home four consecutive
outstanding drama Emmys (1981-84) after its debut on Jan. 15, 1981.
</P>
<P>
   --2. ``Roots.'' The first segment of the original eight-part
miniseries aired on Jan. 23, 1977, and the slavery epic became the
most-watched dramatic show in TV history. About 100 million people
watched the concluding installment of the special, based on Alex
Haley's novel about his own roots.
</P>
<P>
   --1. Moon landing. It was one small step for man, one giant leap
for television history when Apollo 11 astronaut Neil Armstrong
walked on the moon (and on live TV) on July 20, 1969.

   NEW YORK _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   My friend Ivy Podolski was driving home to New Jersey via Harlem
River Drive when her car began to overheat. She left the highway
and stopped at a service station. When her car was repaired, she
asked for directions back to the highway and was told to look for
Broadway and follow it until she saw the signs for Harlem River
Drive.
</P>
<P>
   After driving a few blocks, she realized she was hopelessly
lost. She stopped and asked a dreadlocked fellow on the street,
``Can you tell me how I can get to Broadway?'' He didn't miss a
beat. ``Well, it all depends,'' he replied. ``Can you sing, can you
dance?''

   The hazards of parking in Manhattan are many and well known, but
Jamie Moog has another to add to the list. His car was parked on
the Upper West Side and when he went to pick it up, it looked, in
his own words, ``like a rancid tossed salad.'' A sanitation pickup
had obviously taken place and one of the bags had somehow come
undone over his car. Moog had no choice. He needed his car, so he
got in and started off, trailing lettuce, shredded carrots,
cucumber peels and other mutilated vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Stopped for a red light at 65th and Madison, he noticed a man
hosing down the sidewalk. He rolled down his window and yelled,
``Think I could have a blast?'' indicating the mess. The stranger
took one look, aimed a stream at the car and voila, almost as good
as a car wash. Moog directed a thumbs-up signal through the watery
window and headed to his appointment, his faith in humanity
restored.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Amesse is the deputy superintendent of a large wastewater
treatment plant on Wards Island. His duties include reviewing the
log sheets listing visitors. The truck drivers for one of the
contractors who remove the plant's waste usually sign in by writing
their company name and their own first name. Amesse was amused as
he looked over the sheets for one week this summer. There were only
two entries on the final shift. That night, the plant was visited
by Mohammed and Jesus.

</P>
<P>
   Of people who do their wash
</P>
<P>
   Then just leave it in the laundry room
</P>
<P>
   Forgotten, like an old galosh?
</P>
<P>
   Do you think they go back home to wait
</P>
<P>
   And turn the kettle on
</P>
<P>
   Then, before the water boils,
</P>
<P>
   Move to Oregon?
</P>
<P>
   Or could their disappearance result
</P>
<P>
   From something less orthodox
</P>
<P>
   Abducted by the laundry cult
</P>
<P>
   Or aliens with dirty socks?
</P>
<P>
   I don't mean to be unneighborly,
</P>
<P>
   Well, you know what I mean.
</P>

   But I've got this double load to do
</P>
<P>
   And someone's hogging this machine.

   The sign on the Chinese restaurant read: ``To serve you better,
Excellent Dumpling will be closed on Sundays.'' Which led Bonnie
Seegmiller to ponder how better service is achieved by closing.

   Jill Plotkin was annoyed with Sydney, her 4-year-old daughter.
``How many times do I have to tell you not to play with my good
camera?'' she asked. ``Don't worry, Mommy,'' Sydney replied. ``I
won't press the Cheese button.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Yaeger, breaking his drive back from East Hampton with
a snack stop, noticed a woman eating at one of the picnic benches
near the restaurant. As she set a plate of food down before her
apparently ravenous dog, she issued her instructions: ``Eat
slower,'' she commanded. ``Chew!''
</P>
<P>
   Ivy Berchuck was at Chautauqua this summer racing from concerts
to lectures. At one particularly crowded event, she edged onto a
bench, squeezing an elderly couple even closer together. After
apologizing, she began talking to them and the woman eventually
asked where she was from. ``New York City,'' Ms. Berchuck said. The
woman was thrilled. ``We're from Nashville,'' she said. ``We would
just love to visit New York some day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Please come soon,'' Ms. Berchuck replied. ``I know you'll have
a great time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yes,'' the woman said. ``And I know what we'll do first.
We love music, so we'll drop our bags at a hotel and get ourselves
right over to the Metropolitan Opry.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Steuer and a friend were going through the security check
at Kennedy International Airport recently when the friend was
stopped. A mysterious-looking item in his suitcase showed up on the
X-ray. He opened his bag _ the item was a long shoehorn.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's that?'' the inspector asked. Told what it was, the
inspector said: ``Really? How do you play it?''
</P>
<P>
   The friend picked up the shoehorn, put it to his mouth and began
blowing through the hole at the end. Smiles all around. The couple
and the shoehorn were given a pass.
</P>
<P>
   Overheard on a Madison Avenue bus by Marilyn Baker:
</P>
<P>
   First chic woman: ``I just love your pedicure.''
</P>
<P>
   Second chic woman: ``I'll give you a card to my beauty salon but
ask for Monique. She really understands my toes.''
</P>
<P>
   Gene Alden was sitting on a bench at the entrance to the Museum
of the City of New York when he heard this exchange between a young
woman with a camera dangling from a strap around her neck, and her
friend who had come to meet her.
</P>
<P>
   Young Woman No. 1: ``Where is your camera?''
</P>
<P>
   Young Woman No. 2: ``I didn't bring it. I had no lens cover.''
</P>
<P>
   Young Woman No. 1: ``You could have brought it anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Young Woman No. 2: ``Well, I couldn't find my camera strap.''
</P>
<P>
   Young Woman No. 1: ``You could carry it in your hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Young Woman No. 2: ``Yeah, but I couldn't find the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Young Woman No. 1: ``So what! You could still carry it.''
</P>
<P>
   Young Woman No. 2 (after a few silent moments): ``Well, I didn't
have any film!''

BENES' NO-HIT ATTEMPT FALLS JUST SHORT IN 9TH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ It had been a few days since Mark McGwire came and
went, homerless, and so it was left to Andy Benes to produce some
magic on a field that could tell some stories if it could talk.
</P>
<P>
   Facing the Cincinnati Reds, the Diamondbacks right-hander was on
the brink of a no-hitter, cheered on by a tidy gathering of 17,741
at Cinergy Field, which used to be Riverfront Stadium, which used
to be the home of larger crowds, not to mention legendary
individuals and record-holders, Hall of Famers and collective world
champions.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire didn't come close to hitting home run No. 63 in two
games Wednesday and Thursday, but now here was Benes brushing up
against something special. With retired jerseys and other reminders
of past Reds glory glued to the outfield wall behind him, Benes was
looking in at Sean Casey, a young, hard-hitting first baseman, only
two outs away from what Diamondbacks pitching coach Mark Connor
called ``the pinnacle.''
</P>
<P>
   Casey, savvy for a rookie, worked the count to 3-2. Then he
swung at an inside fastball that Benes meant to throw outside and
lined it to right field for the first _ and only _ Reds' hit. Benes
got a nice hand. Reggie Sanders, the previous hitter who had
walked, went to second. And the hitter after Casey, Barry Larkin,
walked to load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Benes had thrown 138 pitches on a broiling afternoon and had to
come out. Gregg Olson came in and threw a double-play ball to end
the Diamondbacks' four-game losing streak with a combined
one-hitter and a 5-0 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed,'' said Benes, staked to the lead on two-run
homers by Jay Bell and Tony Batista, and Kelly Stinnett's RBI
double. ``You get to the ninth inning, you think you've got a
chance. It was fun to watch the reaction of my teammates. No one
would talk to me. Except Jay Bell. He was making fun of me because
I struck out three times.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell, the Diamondbacks' second baseman, said he doesn't believe
in the superstition of not mentioning a no-hitter or even talking
to the pitcher. But that wasn't it. He simply wasn't aware of what
was going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know,'' he said. ``He (Benes) had something like
three walks early. I was walking off the field and we were talking,
and I looked up to see how many hits we had. I saw four, and then I
saw none. I really wasn't paying attention.''
</P>
<P>
   This was about the sixth inning, Bell said, but he kept talking
to Benes, who got through the seventh and then the eighth,
surviving Bret Boone's deep fly ball to center. Benes himself said
he didn't start to seriously think about the circumstances until
the sixth. Then he realized, ``Hey, they don't have any hits.''
</P>
<P>
   Benes conceded he was far from overpowering, although he did
have command of his four pitches _ fastball, slider, curve and
change-up. He struck out six and walked five. There was talk of
plate umpire C.B. Bucknor's inconsistent strike zone, but not from
Benes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't like it was anything spectacular,'' he said. ``I
walked a bunch of guys. For the most part, I changed speeds and
threw the ball on both sides of the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Casey, who had hit three homers in three games prior to being
intentionally walked as a pinch-hitter on Saturday, flew out deep
to center, flied out to left and struck out in his first three
at-bats. On the fly to left, he was jammed on a fastball similar to
the one he hit to break up the no-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   This time, he jumped on the pitch from Benes, who admitted he
was tired.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too bad,'' Manager Buck Showalter said. ``He (Benes) had
a great outing.''
</P>
<P>
   Benes, who is from Evansville, Ind., about 3{ hours away,
reminded Casey about the earlier pitch when the two passed each
other underneath the stands after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nice job, man,'' Casey told Benes. ``Great job.''
</P>
<P>
   When Sanders walked before him, Casey thought, ``We might be
going down in history pretty soon.'' This sort of notoriety he
didn't need.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could really feel the fans getting into it,'' Casey said.
``A lot of emotion. But, as the opposing team, you've got to do
your job. . . . The 3-2 pitch, he just left it right over the
plate. I think it was his only mistake of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Benes, who lost a no-hitter while pitching for the San Diego
Padres in 1994 when Rico Brogna of the New York Mets led off the
eighth inning with a double, won his 13th game to tie a record for
victories by an expansion pitcher. Tampa Bay's Rolando Arrojo also
tied the mark and, like Benes, will get a couple more starts.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since getting bombed by the Mets on Aug. 22, Benes has been
outstanding. In his past four starts, he has given up three earned
runs over 31 innings to closely resemble the pitcher the
Diamondbacks thought they were getting when he signed a substantial
free-agent contract in February. Benes already has exceeded 200
innings for the fifth time in his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been the steady guy we felt we got,'' Connor said. ``He's
our guy, the workhorse of the staff. The No. 1 guy.'' &QL;

   SEATTLE _ Only two down, 14 to go, and already the Cardinals are
90 percent scar tissue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our team hurts a lot right now,'' Coach Vince Tobin said.
``We're licking our wounds.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a young team that could respond two ways to two crushing
road losses to open the season, including a 33-14 thumping by
Seattle on Sunday at the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody will be saying bad things about us,'' said Pro Bowl
left tackle Lomas Brown, one of the Cardinals offensive captains.
``We have to hang in there. This week is huge. We are a team that
is searching. We want to win badly. Things are just not going right
for us, not right at all. We've got to win this week, point blank.
No ifs, ands, or buts. Have to.''
</P>
<P>
   The season, already on the line, comes down to whether the
Cardinals can put their pain behind and their vision ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Four seemingly winnable games are upcoming in the most
Cardinal-friendly portion of the schedule, beginning with Sunday's
home opener against NFC East foe Philadelphia. Also ahead are St.
Louis, Oakland and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``How good we are will be determined by how well we handle
adversity,'' said Pro Bowl cornerback Aeneas Williams, a defensive
captain. ``That is what's going to decide the rest of our season.
It's to our advantage that we have so many young guys here now
because they're coming from winning college programs. They don't
come with the stigma of, `Here we go again.' I'm hearing guys
saying, `Let's find a way, let's get some wins, let's get something
going here.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals veterans agree it is critical that they remember
they are a growing team with talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still do have a chance,'' said outside linebacker Jamir
Miller. ``When it's over, I'll be the first to let you all know
it's over. But it's not. There's not as big a difference in talent
as it has appeared. There can't be any more showings like this,
though. ''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals have to begin asking hard questions of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Have they overestimated their talent? The young offensive
linemen are taking a particularly tough beating.
</P>
<P>
   Is the coaching staff getting the job done? Going back to the
6-6 point of the 1996 season, the Cardinals have dropped 17 of
their past 22 games under Tobin and his staff.
</P>
<P>
   Or can a rough start be chalked up to facing two tough foes, on
the road, shorthanded (injured starters Aaron Graham and Tony
McCombs did not suit up)?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, attitude and character are as important as physical
ability,'' said fullback Larry Centers. ``Right now, we need to
lean on our character. Our backs are to the wall already but all is
not lost. We have to realize that.''
</P>
<P>
   Falling behind big, early, is no boost to confidence. It was as
close as 20-0 at halftime only because the Seahawks managed only
three points out of drives to the Cardinals 34 , 12 and 2-yard
lines.
</P>
<P>
   While the Cardinals bristle at the suggestion that they're the
same old team that has given the Valley 10 [ non-winning seasons,
they would be hard-pressed to refute the evidence Sunday pointing
to classic Cardinal malfeasance:
</P>
<P>
   They marched to the Seahawks 30 on their opening possession, and
then suffered two sacks that took them out of field-goal range.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to get a reward on that first drive, a field goal at
the minimum,'' Centers said.
</P>
<P>
   They were in position to down a punt at the 3, but the ball
bounced past the coverage team into the end zone. Then Warren Moon,
the Seahawks 41-year-old quarterback, completed his first five
passes, leading to a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals were set to start a possession on their 27-yard
line, but an illegal-block penalty against Jarius Hayes on the
kickoff return put them back at the 6. Jake Plummer, who was
anything but the quarterback who completed his first 11 passes and
17 of his first 19 while passing for 322 yards against Seattle
three weeks earlier in a preseason game, dropped into the end zone
on the first snap and served up the first of two interceptions
returned for a touchdowns. This one was taken back 28 yards by
Willie Williams for a 10-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   A Cardinals punt appeared to pin the Seahawks at their 13-yard
line _ until Kwamie Lassiter was penalized for interfering with the
fair catch. Three plays into the Seattle drive, the Cardinals'
Williams was called for pass interference against speedy receiver
Joey Galloway at the Cardinals' 6 _ a 41-yard field-position change
_ even though replays showed that Galloway actually grabbed
Williams and pulled him down. Seattle scored to make it 17-0.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer was sacked seven times. And while the final statistics
indicate the Cardinals rushed for 111 yards, 61 of those came in
the fourth quarter after it was 33-7.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, the Cardinals prevented Moon from making the killer
passing plays, but they couldn't stop Ricky Watters, who rushed for
105 yards, the 22nd time he has reached triple figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line,'' Tobin said, ``is our team did not play well
enough to win the game. That's extremely disappointing.'' &QL;

JAKE PLUMMER CAUGHT IN SEAHAWKS PRESSURE COOKER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ First Jake Plummer wobbled. Then his pass did.
Three-plus quarters into the Arizona Cardinals' latest bloody
Sunday, Plummer lost his balance as the Seahawks' Cortez Kennedy
bulled through the line. Plummer's trembling toss found cornerback
Shawn Springs, who found the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   It was Seattle's second interception returned for a touchdown
Sunday, and the Seahawks had one more pick in their pocket. After
stopping the clock at :04 with a spike, Plummer ended the game with
a pass complete to Seahawks safety Mark Collins.
</P>
<P>
   That sealed a 19-point loss for the Cardinals, who fell by 28 in
their opening game at Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to start 0-2; that's bad, especially the way we
got beat twice,'' said Plummer, who has three wins in 11 NFL
starts. ``(You can say) it was on the road, on turf, whatever _ we
got beat twice pretty handily. If we want to be winners, we have to
show our mettle, come back next week and be mad. This should really
sting. It stings me right now, just standing here.''
</P>
<P>
   The sting was worse when he was surrounded by Seahawks, not
reporters. Seattle blitzed Plummer often to counter the Cardinals'
West Coast offensive style, and the Cardinals said they knew it was
coming. But that didn't help.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of times it was a physical breakdown, a couple of
times we missed reads, a couple of times it was just everything,''
said tackle Lomas Brown. ``It was a whole combination of different
things that contributed to us not being effective.''
</P>
<P>
   For Plummer, it was another session in an ongoing crash course
on life in the NFL. He was a star at Arizona State two years ago
and remains a fan favorite in Phoenix, but if he's really the
Cardinals' answer, he knows he needs time to grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was playing me, I'd blitz the hell out of me, every
single play,'' said Plummer, who was 22 of 36 for 204 yards and a
touchdown. ``It's something I have to learn. Once we see how
they're coming, we can work on a few things and become a pretty
lethal team. Right now, I'm struggling.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals were shut out in the first half but came out
strong in the third quarter. Brown said the Cardinals began
recognizing blitzes better, and their plan to run the ball more to
take pressure off Plummer worked.
</P>
<P>
   But that success was fleeting, and by the end the Cardinals were
the Seahawks' opposite, with two blowout losses and deflated
optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll continue to fight and find ways to improve ourselves
individually and as a team,'' said fullback Larry Centers. ``It's
just a matter of going back to the drawing board. We'll get this
thing on track before it's all over.''
</P>
<P>
   They'll have a chance in their home opener this week against
another Seahawk victim, Philadelphia. But Brown isn't expecting a
warm reception.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans are going to be pretty sour with us,'' he said.
``It's not the homecoming you'd expect.''

 UNDATED: as comical. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For in those days, too, Wallace impressed people by his frenetic
energy and tireless pugnacity rather than by any inherent
attractiveness. He waited tables and drove taxis and slid through
law school, cramming from borrowed books. Frank Johnson's wife,
Ruth, was worried by Wallace's habit of chasing innocent high
school girls, although she thought him more interested in the
adoration than sexual conquest. Finally in 1943, at the age of 23,
he decided to marry one of his naive admirers, a 16-year-old dime
store clerk named Lurleen Burns.
</P>
<P>
   It was wartime and Mrs. Wallace and their baby daughter, Bobbi
Joe, born in 1944, followed wherever Wallace's flight training in
the Army Air Forces took him. He shipped to the Mariana Islands as
a flight engineer in the spring of 1945, assigned to fly bombing
missions over Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The biographer Dan Carter found fellow crew members who
remembered Wallace's barracks lectures defending segregation in
Barbour County. ``I don't hate them,'' Wallace was reported to have
said. ``The colored are fine in their place. But they're just like
children, and it's not something that's going to change. It's
written in stone.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace had been through nine combat missions by the time the
war ended. He was discharged with a 10 percent disability for
combat-induced ``psychoneurosis,'' diagnosed after he refused
orders to fly dangerous training missions when his unit returned to
California after the Japanese surrender. Years later, Sen. Wayne
Morse, D-Ore., disclosed Wallace's wartime psychiatric history.
Wallace responded that unlike his liberal attacker, he could prove
that he was 90 percent sane.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Wallace began climbing up the political ladder
with remarkable speed. Using his Barbour County connections, he was
named an assistant to Alabama's attorney general in 1946. The next
year he won election to the Alabama legislature. He allied himself
with the racially moderate populist Gov. James Folsom and prevailed
on Folsom to appoint him as a trustee of all-black Tuskegee
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   As a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1948,
Wallace refused to join the walkout by segregationist
``Dixiecrats,'' a move that placed him firmly in the progressive,
racially moderate wing of a state Democratic Party that still had
``White Supremacy'' emblazoned on its ballot emblem.
</P>
<P>
   After this blooding in state and national politics, Wallace
settled in as an elected district judge in his home county, serving
from 1953 to 1958 and all the while laying plans to run for
governor in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   It was in the preparation of that race and its aftermath that
Wallace committed two betrayals _ one personal and one political _
that blemished his reputation for life, but also gave him a
generationlong stranglehold on Alabama politics.
</P>
<P>
   The first came after 1958, when Wallace's surprisingly strong
dark-horse candidacy failed. He had followed the tolerant racial
line laid down by Folsom and lost to John Patterson, whose devotion
to massive resistance to court-ordered integration won him the
following of the Ku Klux Klan. There were only about 5,000 Klan
members, Patterson later recalled, but they helped him paper the
state with campaign literature.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Wallace, in a quotation whose authenticity he long
disputed, was recorded as saying that no one ``will ever out
out-nigger me again.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if not literally true, the remark defined the strategy
Wallace would use to ride to power. He started the very next year
when his law school friend Frank Johnson, now a federal judge with
a strong civil rights record, ordered Wallace's court to surrender
voter-registration records to the United States Civil Rights
Commission. Wallace denounced Johnson in public as a federal
dictator, but conspired secretly to avoid being jailed on federal
contempt charges by having a local grand jury surrender the records
on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson ruled that Wallace had used ``devious means,'' but had
nonetheless obeyed the federal court order. Never one to be
embarrassed by the facts, Wallace labeled Johnson a
``carpet-bagging, scalawagging liar'' who wanted to mount ``a
second Sherman's March to the Sea.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace had lost a friend but gained a nickname, ``The Fighting
Judge,'' that would help make him governor in 1962 as an all-out
segregationist with Klan backing. As Johnson later told the Alabama
writer Frank Sikora, Wallace had also established the tactical
blueprint of his career: ``misleading the people of Alabama for the
purpose of pursuing his political career.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, of course, did not see it that way. He described
himself as devoted to the economic development of his state and to
advancing the causes of limited government and middle-class values
in national politics. The reality was both uglier and more
complicated.
</P>
<P>
   In his four terms as governor, Wallace saw an era of
unparalleled corruption that operated through a crony system
centered on his brother Gerald, a lawyer who died in 1993. With the
governor's approval, Gerald Wallace and his close associate, Oscar
Harper, went into business selling the state office supplies,
printing, vending machines and building leases. Gerald Wallace and
Harper established an asphalt company with $1,000 in capital. In a
year and half, the infant company garnered more than a million
dollars in state contracts.
</P>
<P>
   These unblushing accounts come not from political opponents, but
from Harper's 1988 memoir, ``Me 'n' George,'' regarded as one of
the best guides to the inside dealing in Alabama's capital during
the Wallace years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people have got the wrong idea about how I made my
money,'' Harper wrote. ``They think me and Gerald are crooks.''
Then he added: ``That ain't true. It's just that good deals kept
popping up and I never was one to turn a good deal down.''

TKACHUK SILENCE CONTINUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. - Although some players might be under the
impression that negotiations will continue with holdout left wing
 &UR; Keith Tkachuk, General Manager  &UR; Bobby Smith said they should not
be so optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got nothing to talk about with Tkachuk,'' Smith said
Sunday, the opening day of training camp. ``It's not like there's
going to be something new every day, because there's ``not'' going
to be anything new.''
</P>
<P>
   For the second straight day since he was suspended, Tkachuk, the
team's captain and leading scorer, could not be reached for
comment. Neither could his Boston-based agent,  &UR; Bob Murray.
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk now has forfeited $20,362 of his $2.8 million salary
since being suspended on Saturday, in accordance with rules in the
NHL's collective bargaining agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed, obviously,'' said Coyotes Coach  &UR; Jim
Schoenfeld, who built up a special relationship with Tkachuk last
season. ``As I've said before, Keith is a player under contract and
we expect all our contracted players to be here. He's decided not
to come, so now it's a situation where our planning for the start
of the regular season has to be done without him.
</P>
<P>
   ``After this point, we're going to talk about the players we
have in uniform. It's a situation between Keith and management.
Historically, these things get resolved, so I really think it's
fruitless for me to get involved one way or another because
everybody is all huggy-kissy after all the negotiations and
everything that's been said in the press.''
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk's teammates remain hopeful something will be resolved
soon with the power forward, who has two years worth $5.8 million
left on his current contract, but is demanding an extension worth
$8 million a season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had every inkling that he wasn't going to come,''
forward &UR; Rick Tocchet said. ``It seemed like they were pretty far
apart for a long time, so I didn't think one side was going to make
that big of concession.''
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman  &UR; Teppo Numminen and right wing  &UR; Dallas Drake both
said they expect negotiations to continue in hopes of a resolution,
but that doesn't seem to be a likely scenario.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every individual has their own beliefs, but it really doesn't
matter what I believe,'' Tocchet said. ``I know what I would do,
but it's a tough situation.'' &QL; 
Lemieux out indefinitely &QL; 
Veteran wing  &UR; Jocelyn Lemieux suffered a fractured collarbone while
mountain biking in north Scottsdale and will be sidelined 10 to 12
weeks after undergoing surgery this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   It's the second major obstacle the 30-year-old Lemieux, the
younger brother of Colorado star  &UR; Claude Lemieux, has had to endure
in the past two seasons. His career nearly was finished in December
1996 after he suffered a severe compound fracture to his forearm
while playing for the Long Beach Ice Dogs in the International
Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those things that's extremely unfortunate, and you
really feel bad for the player,'' Schoenfeld said. ``For Jocelyn,
it's just another obstacle he has to overcome.'' &QL; 
Roenick absent &QL; 
Center  &UR; Jeremy Roenick was excused from the first day of training
camp with permission from Smith so he could attend to family
business. Roenick flew to Boston, his hometown, but was back in the
Valley by Sunday afternoon, according to relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Roenick will practice this morning in Scottsdale, according to
Smith, who declined to give details for his absence. There was no
death or serious illness in the family, another relative said. &QL; 
Slap shots &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bruising defenseman  &UR; Sean Gagnon is sidelined day-to-day because
of a hip flexor injury, but he apparently has informed team
officials he plans to practice today.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations between the club and restricted Group II free-agent
defenseman &UR; Keith Carney have hit a wall, but Smith said Sunday he
still hopes to re-sign the U.S. Olympian at some point this week. &QL;

 UNDATED: several grandchildren.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wallace won his last election as governor in 1982, but it was
historical revision, rather than running the state, that occupied
his last years. Starting in 1977, he began giving interviews in
which he said that political philosophy rather than racism was the
motor of his career.
</P>
<P>
   In a typical interview, he said: ``The New York Times, the
Eastern establishment newspapers never did understand that
segregation wasn't about hate. I didn't hate anybody. I don't hate
the man who shot me. When I was young, I used to swim and play with
blacks all the time. You find more hate in New York, Chicago and
Washington, D.C., than in all the Southern states put together.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of his rehabilitation effort, Wallace sought meetings
with civil rights figures like the Rev. Ralph Abernathy, the Rev.
Jesse Jackson and Rep. John Lewis, whose beating on ``Bloody
Sunday'' at Selma galvanzied the voting-rights crusade. Wallace
made a well-publicized appearance at King's old church in
Montgomery. Sometimes he even managed to use the magic words ``I'm
sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   After Wallace left office in 1987, Alabamians continued to
support him through a figurehead position at Troy State University.
By the time he died, Republicans had taken over the governorship,
and Wallace's main legacy, a statewide system of trade schools,
junior colleges, and small four-year institutions, was regarded as
a monument to educational waste and redundancy that a poor state
could ill afford.
</P>
<P>
   One of his last public appearances was in the Spike Lee
documentary ``Four Little Girls,'' which tells the story of the
16th Street Baptist Church bombing. In his interview, Wallace
insists that his best friend in the world was a black orderly. The
obviously uncomfortable orderly keeps trying to walk out of the
frame only to be tugged back by Wallace. In public showings, that
passage of the film usually drew laughter.
</P>
<P>
   So ended the public career that saw Wallace move from being the
most feared politician of his era to a pitiable relic. It is a
career whose moral arc seemed, in retrospect, utterly predictable
and utterly of a piece with the Faulknerian idea of racism's
ineradicable curse. At the height of his powers, George Wallace
denied any moral responsibility for the violent acts that racked
his state. And in his Bible-haunted state, many insisted that a
terrible judgment had been visited upon him.
</P>
<P>
   Brandt Ayers, the liberal editor of The Star newspaper in
Anniston, put it this way: ``The Governor we Alabamians knew was a
man of primal passion: sincere champion of the working class,
cynical manipulator of their resentments, a sorcerer summoning the
beast in our nature, a man of deep insecurities, tenderness, and
finally, humility.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``When he came to my office in 1974 campaigning for
governor, I told him: `George, you always claimed to stand up for
the little man, but everybody knows that the real underdog is the
black man. We stood up for him. You didn't. Why?''' He did not
answer. He just looked down at his legs for what seemed a very long
time.''

SHOWALTER `REMINDS' TEAM OF GOALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Diamondbacks Manager  &UR; Buck Showalter doesn't like
to give speeches. But sometimes, he believes the time is right for
a little one-way conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday was one of those times. The Diamondbacks had lost four in
a row. Even more distressing was the manner in which they had
played. Less than stellar pitchers shut them down, and there were
defensive and mental lapses.
</P>
<P>
   After Saturday's game, a 3-0 loss to the Cincinnati Reds,
Showalter was clearly upset. He woke up Sunday feeling the same
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I still feel passionate the next day, I'll follow up on
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Showalter's pre-game talk lasted only about 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reiterated some things I thought they needed to be reminded
of,'' he said. ``It's never pleasant. But I have a lot of trust in
these guys. At the same time, we want to finish strong. I know the
fans want to, and I know the organization wants to.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a reminder of what we want to be about.''
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks then went out and beat the Cincinnati Reds,
5-0, as  &UR; Andy
 &UR; Benes lost a no-hitter with one out in the ninth inning. But
Showalter indicated there are still some things that bother him.
</P>
<P>
   Returning home for a three-game series with San Francisco
starting tonight, the Diamondbacks are 59-91. They need to win four
of their remaining 12 games to avoid 100 losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for us to remember that we're building for
something,'' Benes said, ``and that every time we go out there, we
want to win.'' &QL; 
HR mark &QL; 
 &UR; Tony Batista did it again. The Diamondbacks &QL; 
infielder hit his 18th homer of the season, a two-run shot in the
seventh inning. It was a new professional best for Batista and his
fourth homer in seven games.
</P>
<P>
   Batista has just 245 at-bats this year. That's one home run
every 13.3 at-bats, which would have put him among the league
leaders if he had played every day.
</P>
<P>
   Since Aug. 3, Batista has hit 13 home runs. That's one every
nine at-bats. For the sake of comparison,  &UR; Mark McGwire has hit a
home run every 7.5 at-bats, and  &UR; Sammy Sosa one every 9.8 at-bats
prior to Sunday's games.
</P>
<P>
   Batista's previous high was 17 homers for Class A Modesto in
1994. It took him 466 at-bats to get there.
</P>
<P>
   Batista was known to have decent power, but even he is
surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, yeah,'' he said. ``I don't know what I'm doing. All
the balls I hit are deep. It just happens.'' &QL; 
Heat wave &QL; 
It was hot on the AstroTurf at Cinergy Field _ over 100 degrees _
but even hotter in the dugout. How hot was it? For the second day
in a row, Showalter removed his trademark jacket and wore just his
uniform top. &QL;

SACKS QUICKLY ADDING UP FOR CARDINALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD

<P>
   SEATTLE _ Do the arithmetic.
</P>
<P>
   If the Cardinals continue to give up 4.5 sacks per game, they
will allow 72 this season, six fewer than last year but still the
third most in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   So after the Seattle Seahawks sacked quarterback Jake Plummer
seven times in their 33-14 victory Sunday, Cardinals offensive
tackle Lomas Brown conceded that opposing defenses will blitz the
second-year pro as soon as they get off the bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if you are a 20-year veteran or a two-year
veteran,'' Brown said. ``Until you shut them (blitzers) down, they
are going to keep coming after you week after week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what people say about the Arizona Cardinals. It's all
been written: `The Arizona Cardinals don't have an offensive line,
have a young quarterback and no running game. All you have to do is
put eight men on the line and go after the Cardinals and you will
beat them.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In the first half, the Cardinals gave up five sacks for 27 yards
in losses and gained only 27 yards on the ground. Plummer also
threw an interception for a touchdown, one of two he had returned
for scores.
</P>
<P>
   But on their opening drive, they moved from their 30 to
Seattle's 30 before Plummer was sacked on back-to-back plays,
moving the Cardinals out of field-goal range.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things were rolling,'' Brown said. ``We're chugging along,
feeling good about ourselves, and then we kill ourselves. We can't
do that against a good team. It's painful.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the off-season, the Cardinals maintained they had
improved their offensive line even though starting right guard
Lester Holmes was the only free-agent addition.
</P>
<P>
   They also have first-year starters in left guard Chris Dishman,
center Aaron Graham and right tackle James Dexter. Dishman was
critical of his performance, Graham was a last-minute scratch
because of a sore calf muscle and Dexter was beaten for two sacks
by Seahawks defensive end Michael Sinclair.
</P>
<P>
   One change could be moving rookie Anthony Clement, a
second-round draft pick from Southwestern Louisiana, into the
starting lineup. Clement, whose progress was slowed by a preseason
knee injury, dressed for the first time on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   If Clement becomes a starter at right tackle, Dexter could be
moved to guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't keep giving up that many sacks,'' Dishman said. ``If
we do stuff like that every week, we won't be around. The Seahawks
brought a lot of people on blitzes, but we knew it was coming. It's
no secret when it's second and 7, second and long, that they are
coming after us. We should have picked them up.''
</P>
<P>
   Center Mike Devlin, who replaced Graham in the starting lineup,
said the Seahawks didn't fool the Cardinals with any tricks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't do anything differently than the week before,''
Devlin said. ``Sometimes, it was us. We didn't pick up our men.
Sometimes, they brought more guys than we had blockers. But nobody
did a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals Coach Vince Tobin refused to put all of the blame on
the offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you have seven sacks, there's more to it than just
the offensive line,'' Tobin said. ``It's convenient to lay it all
on their shoulders, but that's just part of the problem. When you
are getting blitzed like that, you have to get rid of the football
and not take those sacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's a surprise. Seahawks safety Jay Bellamy thinks the
Philadelphia Eagles, the Cardinals' opponent next week, will try to
pressure Plummer from the outset.
</P>
<P>
   He said that was Seattle's strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every snap he goes back and throws the ball, we're going to
have somebody in his face,'' Bellamy said. &QL;

SORENSTAM METHODICALLY ROLLS TO FIVE-SHOT VICTORY IN SAFECO
CLASSIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KENT, Wash. _ Annika Sorenstam visited the media tent almost as
much as the driving range during the 17th Safeco Classic, looking
for statistics, seeking answers. Maybe that explains why four days
at Meridian Valley Country Club turned into a numbers crunch.
</P>
<P>
   Broken down, it went like something this: The No. 1 women's
golfer in the world _ though not the most revered _ Sunday turned
in the tournament's second most-decisive victory (five strokes)
before record-breaking crowds (33,200 on Sunday, 86,700 overall).
</P>
<P>
   Any way you added it up, it was Sorenstam by a lot.
</P>
<P>
   The 27-year-old Swede turned Lake Tahoe resident bogeyed just
one hole over the final 44. She shot 15-under-par 273, 68 on the
last day, good for $90,000. She was as methodical as a grocery
store checker, pounding away and tallying up her fourth victory
since June.
</P>
<P>
   Things were so one-sided, Patty Sheehan, who finished tied for
second with Laura Davies, congratulated Sorenstam on her victory _
halfway up the 18th fairway. The winner felt it was a wrap on the
16th hole. The scoreboard indicated as much on the 14th.
</P>
<P>
   ``She just had to walk in the park today, sing a little and do a
little two-step,'' Sheehan said.
</P>
<P>
   Safeco tried something new, then something old, before settling
on the best the LPGA has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie sensation Se Ri Pak, the one largely responsible for the
boost in Safeco attendance (2,000 more on Sunday, 200 more
overall), completed a two-day fade to finish tied for 21st with 10
other players. The South Korean teased local golf followers much
like Tiger Woods did at the PGA Championship, leading for a round
before falling well off the pace.
</P>
<P>
   The 41-year-old Sheehan, the LPGA's answer to Tom Watson, got
everyone a little emotional when she unexpectedly moved into
contention and led by a stroke entering the final round. A victory
would have been her fourth at Meridian Valley.
</P>
<P>
   While all this was going on, Sorenstam, whose game has been
described as ``boring'' at times, diligently positioned herself to
win. Her peers had seen it before.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's not an exciting player by any means, but shooting 15- or
17-under (par) each week is exciting in itself,'' Davies pointed
out. ``She keeps it in play. She's got a fabulous putter. She's the
real deal. She's proven it all over again why she is the best
player in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam made regular visits to the media tent, but she was
more interested in finding stat sheets than answering questions.
Each night, she left deep in thought. Admittedly, she's a golf
nerd.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1987, Sorenstam has been loading her tournament details in
a computer, checking tendencies. All kinds of minutia. Not
necessarily how many fairways she hits, but which side of the
fairway her ball landed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty hard on myself,'' she said. ``If I don't hit 18
greens, I strive to hit 18 greens the next time.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam toured the course Sunday with two players, Sheehan and
Juli Inkster, who had five Safeco victories between them.
</P>
<P>
   Easily recognizable by the big black bow in her hair, Sorenstam
smiled on the third hole when a male fan told her to knock one in.
She acknowledged a man who spoke to her in Swedish a few holes
later. She nodded when a man and woman pushing a baby stroller
called her name. She chatted easily with Sheehan during breaks on
several holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might look focused, but I see things and hear things that go
on around me,'' she said. ``I work very hard to stay calm. But the
atmosphere (Sunday) was very relaxed. I felt comfortable with my
playing partners.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam pulled even with Sheehan on the par-3 third hole,
rolling in a 15-foot putt for birdie. She took the lead for good on
the par-5 No. 5, reaching the hole in two shots and two-putting for
birdie, while Sheehan parred.
</P>
<P>
   At the same, history was being made on the hole ahead _ by Pak.
The first-year player, surrounded by her largest Korean-American
gallery of the year, shocked them by hitting her tee shot into the
right rough, shanking her second shot into the water, taking a drop
and hitting a tree with her next offering. She finally chipped on
and two-putted the 380-yard sixth hole for a triple-bogey seven.
</P>
<P>
   The shank and triple were firsts for her on the LPGA Tour, as
was a string of three consecutive double-bogeys on Saturday.
``Today I feel something not that good,'' she said in her broken
English. ``Other times it is just golf. Maybe from this, I will
learn many things.''
</P>
<P>
   When the last putt dropped, Sorenstam had her 16th LPGA victory
in five seasons, a commanding lead over Pak on the money list and
her first Safeco win.

INTERFERENCE PENALTY DIDN'T GRAB CARDINALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 and STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It's difficult to pin a 33-14 whipping on one play.
But the Cardinals agreed that one back-breaker as they fell to 0-2
Sunday at the Kingdome was a 41-yard pass interference call against
their Pro Bowl cornerback,  &UR; Aeneas Williams, who was covering
speedy Seattle Seahawks receiver  &UR; Joey Galloway.
</P>
<P>
   Replays showed that Galloway actually grabbed Williams and
pulled him down. It took several seconds for an official to throw a
flag.
</P>
<P>
   The penalty moved the Seahawks, who were leading, 10-0, early in
the second quarter, to the Cardinals 6-yard line. Quarterback
 &UR; Warren Moon then fired a 4-yard scoring pass to fullback  &UR; Mack
Strong for a 17-0 lead two plays later.
</P>
<P>
   For all intents and purposes, the Big Red was dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made the call,'' Williams said. ``I'll have to go back
and critique it on film. What I've got to do in that situation is
find a way to come up with the interception and not let them make
that call.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach  &UR; Vince Tobin, aware the league fines those who make
critical comments regarding officiating, would say only ``that's a
tough call.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what more Aeneas is supposed to do,'' Tobin said.
``He ran with Galloway and turned inside to make the play. The guy
came over his back and they called (Williams) for interference.
That's what I saw, but I don't know what the official saw.''
</P>
<P>
   That play accounted for nearly half of 88 first-half penalty
yards _ compared with none for the Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that we had an inordinate number of penalties,''
Tobin said. ``But that interference call was a big one.'' &QL; 
Quick stop &QL; 
Just as they had in their opening 38-10 loss at Dallas, the
Cardinals moved the ball into scoring position on their opening
drive but were denied the chance to take an early lead.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Jake Plummer took them to the Seahawks 30-yard line
before two sacks gave the Cardinals fourth-and-15 at the 35. It
would have been a 52-yard field-goal attempt by Joe Nedney.
Instead, Tobin ordered a punt.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle then drove to the Cardinals 34, where, faced with a
nearly identical situation, Seattle Coach Dennis Erickson called
for a field goal. Todd Peterson connected from 51 yards for a 3-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin said he did not give Nedney, who was erratic last season
beyond 40 yards, the chance because of a previously unreported hip
flexor injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nedney had a hip flexor that bothered him all week,'' Tobin
said. ``We didn't want to risk putting our defense in bad field
position right away if he missed. After he warmed up before the
game he didn't feel like he could make any over 50 yards, so I took
him at his word.'' &QL; 
Restless natives &QL; 
It was a bad weekend for teams that play at Sun Devil Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State was upset by Brigham Young, 26-6, on Saturday
night in Provo, Utah.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals were routed for the second consecutive week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans are going to be angry all over the state of
Arizona,'' offensive tackle  &UR; Lomas Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown called next week's home opener against the Eagles a
pressure game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Philadelphia is a team we need to beat,'' Brown said. ``We
have to beat them. It's a turning point of our season.'' &QL; 
Disappearing act
</P>
<P>
   Can you name the last time Cardinals defensive end &UR; Simeon Rice
had a sack?
</P>
<P>
   It came last Nov. 2 against the Eagles, meaning he has gone nine
consecutive games without a sack.
</P>
<P>
   He played most of Sunday's game and had only one tackle. &QL; 
Short shots
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals dropped to 3-15 on the road under Tobin.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker  &UR; Ronald McKinnon has 24 tackles in two games. He's on
a pace to finish with 192 tackles, the second most in team history.
</P>
<P>
   Only once last season did  &UR; Larry Centers have more catches than
the seven he had Sunday for 54 yards. &QL;

SEAHAWKS BLITZ CARDINALS FOR 2-0 START 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ On a day when Warren Moon passed for only 146 yards,
the defense collected seven sacks.
</P>
<P>
   On a day when Joey Galloway caught just two passes, the defense
returned two interceptions for touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   On a day when the big play was missing from the offense, the
defense forced five turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   On a day when Ricky Watters did run for 105 yards, the defense
ran Cardinals quarterback Jake Plummer ragged.
</P>
<P>
   The best defensive performance in Dennis Erickson's 50-game
tenure as coach of the Seahawks was more than enough to offset an
inconsistent offense in Sunday's 33-14 thrashing of the Arizona
Cardinals at the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   The victory before a home-opener crowd of 57,678 pushed the
Seahawks' record to 2-0, and put them very much within reach of
only the second 3-0 start in franchise history in next week's game
against the Washington Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this game showed is that when one side is not playing as
well as it should, the other side can pick up the slack,'' said
Moon, who threw TD passes to Galloway and fullback Mack Strong in
winning the 100th game of his 15-year NFL career.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks' defense didn't just pick up the slack, it
strangled the Cardinals' offense. For the second straight week, the
defense set the tempo by blitzing its way to one big play after
another.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the 38-0 shutout at Philadelphia in last week's season
opener, the Seahawks did not need an array of defensive sets to
rattle Plummer and the Cardinals offense. The Seahawks generated
enough pressure from their base 4-3 defense to wilt a seasoned NFL
passer, let alone one making only his 11th start.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came with it. We knew they were coming, but we just
couldn't quite get all of them blocked,'' Plummer said. ``When we
did get (a pass) off, they were covering the hottest on the
sidelines, so they had a good game plan for us defensively.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks blitzed early. They blitzed often. They blitzed
with devastating results.
</P>
<P>
   ``Total domination is what we strive for, for 60 minutes,'' said
defensive tackle Sam Adams, who did not have a sack but for the
second straight week was almost unblockable. ``We thought we could
get pressure just playing the regular defense. What we wanted to do
was force him to throw and then pressure each and every pass. I
think we were able to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Plummer was forced to throw early on a pass to Rob Moore in the
first quarter. The Cardinals' leading receiver never saw the pass
because he had yet to turn around. Instead, Seahawks cornerback
Willie Williams intercepted the pass and returned it 28 yards for a
touchdown that gave the Seahawks a 10-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was mixed up communication between the quarterback
and the receiver,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-9, 180-pound Williams had to leap past Cardinals
center Mike Devlin at the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to dive over. I didn't want to try to run him over. I
probably would have lost that battle,'' Williams said of the
318-pound Devlin.
</P>
<P>
   Another blitz, this one by safety Mark Collins, forced Plummer
to serve up a wobbler of a pass that was picked off by cornerback
Shawn Springs and returned 56 yards for a touchdown to make it 33-7
in the fourth quarter. The combination of Collins blitzing and
Springs intercepting also clicked for a score in last week's win at
Philly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the same exact play, the same exact blitz,'' said
Springs, who was playing despite a hip flexor he suffered in
practice last week. ``I think we have something special on defense
this year. We pride ourselves on just completely dominating and not
giving up really anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The interceptions were just the biggest plays in what was an
inferno of an afternoon for Plummer.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Darrin Smith had two sacks and also forced a fumble
as part of his 10-tackle effort. Defensive end Michael Sinclair
also got to Plummer twice, and now has 4{ sacks in two games.
Defensive end Matt LaBounty and strong safety Jay Bellamy each had
a sack. Linebacker Chad Brown and defensive end Phillip Daniels
shared a sack.
</P>
<P>
   Seven sacks, from six different players, from a half-dozen
directions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like winning is contagious, making big plays is
contagious,'' Sinclair said. ``There was a lot said about Jake
escaping. I thought we kept him in the pocket. We contained him. We
hit him. He just didn't seem comfortable back there.''
</P>
<P>
   It was another dominating performance. But it also was just one
more game against another inexperienced quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's two wins. It's just two wins. There are a lot of rounds
left in this fight,'' Brown said. ``We can't break our arms patting
ourselves on the back and thinking, `Oh, the Seahawks are all this
and all that.' It's two wins in two games against teams with young
quarterbacks.''
</P>
<P>
   With a third set for Sunday against the Redskins and quarterback
Trent Green.

THE EYES HAVE IT: REFLECT QB'S ANGER  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE - In the second half, Lomas Brown turned and faced his
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jake,'' he said, ``lemme see your eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Why the eyes, Lomas?
</P>
<P>
   ``The eyes,'' Brown said, ``tell it all.''
</P>
<P>
   A 14-year NFL veteran, Brown looked deeply into the eyes of No.
16. He studied the eyes of the young face the way a boxing trainer
reads the eyes of a fighter slumped on a stool between rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Brown was concerned. The kid he and his fellow offensive linemen
are paid to protect was taking a physical and mental beating.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals couldn't stop Seattle's pass rush. Between sacks,
seven in all, Plummer threw a terrible pass _ ``a gift'' Vince
Tobin called the ball that cornerback Willie Williams intercepted
and returned 28 yards for a first-quarter touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Plummer would throw another.
</P>
<P>
   The player around whom this offense is built, the kid whom Bill
Walsh has called the next Joe Montana, never saw Shawn Springs pick
off his fluttery pass and prance 56 yards to make the score 33-7.
</P>
<P>
   More frustration. More embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   Jake missed the Seahawks' fourth touchdown. As blood from a turf
burn oozed through an elbow bandage, Plummer lay on the ground,
pinned under 306 pounds of Cortez Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Jake Plummer, who is featured in national magazines and on
ESPN's promotion for Sunday night's Cardinals home opener against
Philadelphia, was suffering through another bad game. Terrible
game.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer, the guy this team is counting on to score points and
win games and shed that ``same old Cardinals'' tag he hates, later
said it best, ``We stunk offensively.''
</P>
<P>
   The game not over _ would it ever end? _ Brown searched
Plummer's eyes. What was he looking for?
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to see if there was any intensity there,'' the left
tackle said. The old pro checked to see if the kid had that vacant
gaze Brown has seen in quarterbacks whose spirit is broken.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to see Jake's reaction. Measure his resiliency. He
wanted to see if Jake had given up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see that,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   What he saw was a kid who was angry. Angry and upset over the
sorry way this season has started. Mostly, Plummer was angry with
himself.
</P>
<P>
   This is a new offense, one designed to exploit his talents. Jake
would shine. Jake would be the playmaker. He hasn't done that this
year. He spent Sunday dodging rushers, throwing passes he wished he
could pull back like a yo-yo on a string. He spent a long day in
the tomb-like gloom of the Kingdome licking his lips between plays
and looking to the sideline at Marc Trestman, the offensive
coordinator, for answers.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's game plan was simple. Blitz the young quarterback.
Plummer admired the strategy. ``If I were playing me,'' he said,
``I would blitz the hell out of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Plummer knows the situation. So does Trestman. Seattle's plan is
a blueprint for every team. Every Cardinals opponent will come
after the quarterback until he proves he can beat them. Can he?
Will he? When?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm young,'' Plummer said, reminding himself, trying to smile.
But he is impatient with himself. He hates to lose. He feels the
burden of high expectation, what center Mike Devlin called `'the
weight of the world'' on his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   So when the game ended, No. 16 didn't linger. As fireworks
exploded overhead, Plummer was the first Cardinals player off the
field, sprinting toward the locker. He didn't stay around to
chit-chat with Jeff Feagles, the former Cardinals punter, or talk
over old times with Springs, the former Ohio State defensive back
whom Jake played against in the Rose Bowl two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``What am I going to say?'' Plummer asked. ``Hi.
Congratulations. You kicked our (. . .).' I can't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The eyes are impatient. Angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plum . . . mer! Plum . . . mer!'' they sang out from the first
row of seats behind the Cardinals' bench.
</P>
<P>
   He ignored the catcalls. He didn't check the scoreboard when it
was over. He just wanted to shower and dress and get on the bus and
fly home. The present and future quarterback of 47 men who meet the
``legal'' definition of a ``professional'' football team, but so
far has not performed like one.

SEAHAWKS 2-0, BUT AGAINST NFC LEAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Somebody check to see if the polar caps have melted.
</P>
<P>
   Find out if Steven Seagal made a good movie.
</P>
<P>
   Hey _ maybe the president was honest Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks are 2-0. Assume nothing about the world.
</P>
<P>
   Each season of Dennis Erickson's term as Seahawk coach started
out 0-2. With Sunday's 33-14 home-opener win over the Arizona
Discard-inals, the Seahawks are positively woozy from the heights.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so it's a molehill, not a mountain. When one knows nothing
but the valley, any variation in terrain is breathtaking.
</P>
<P>
   Seahawk giddiness is tempered by the fact that Sunday was the
second of three games against opponents from the NFC East, possibly
the worst grouping since fever blisters.
</P>
<P>
   It was also the second encounter with an inexperienced
quarterback, this one Jake Plummer, a starter of 11 NFL games. Last
week Philadelphia's Bobby Hoying made his seventh start against the
Seahawks. Next week, it's Trent Green, who makes his NFL debut in
the Monday night game tonight for the Washington Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   These guys are human teething rings. They don't know blitz from
zits. When Seahawk defenders lean across the line of scrimmage and
whisper, ``Boo!'' these QBs get more vertical than Sergei Bubka.
</P>
<P>
   But after a recent history of quarterbacks that included Rick
Mirer, Dan McGwire and Kelly Stouffer, the Seahawks can figure they
are entitled to a few gimmes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the three years and two games I've been here, that's the
best defensive effort we've had,'' said Erickson, his face missing
its usual September torque. A year ago at this point, the Seahawks
allowed 76 points and were on their way to giving back more ground
than Rommel in North Africa.
</P>
<P>
   This year appears to be a new deal, especially for the defense.
Perhaps not as dramatic as the cumulative scores so far indicate,
but the fact is the Seahawk defense has scored three touchdowns and
allowed two, and one of the latter was a fourth-quarter non-event.
</P>
<P>
   ``The blitz _ period,'' said defensive tackle Dan Saleamua, when
asked to explain. ``We're just going after 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   So it would seem, since the Seahawks added seven quarterback
sacks to their nine against the Eagles. Since the NFL team record
is 104, that puts them on a pace to beat not only the record, but
Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire as well.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive backs Shawn Springs and Willie Williams returned
interceptions for touchdowns and the longest play allowed the
Discard-inals from scrimmage was 23 yards. This is the kind of
opportunism combined with stoutness that can make a case for some
serious reckoning from future opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want people to come here worried about our defense, like
they (worried) about the old Steelers and Raiders,'' said newcomer
linebacker Darrin Smith, whose two sacks were part of his team-high
10 tackles. ``I don't know if there's a better front four in the
league. They allow us linebackers to run around. The secondary is
back there making plays and scoring touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's so excited to be running around that nobody wants
to be caught walking.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, all this running around can come to an abrupt halt
against Kansas City or Denver. But that's a ways off, and the
puffball early schedule is allowing the Seahawks to get more
plugged into one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not five new guys out there running into each other,''
said linebacker Chad Brown, one of last year's five new starters
whose collective learning curve was steep, particularly at the
start. The Seahawk defense improved as the season progressed, but
couldn't cover for collapses elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Williams has been here a year with our system of coverages,''
he said. ``Shawn is no longer a rookie. There's 11 guys who can
execute the zone blitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing is you can't blow a zone assignment or
it's a big play. If someone is supposed to blitz and doesn't, a guy
like Plummer can make some yards. We blew a few today, but we
played well a lot more than we played bad.''
</P>
<P>
   The obvious Seahawk defensive game plan of Jake-rattle-and-roll
for the second-year quarterback worked so well that Arizona really
had no ability to come back from the 20-0 halftime hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't comfortable back there at all,'' said defensive end
Michael Sinclair. ``He just didn't feel at home back there, and
that's a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   With a year together as a unit, and improvement in last year's
downfall of special teams, the Seahawks seem on the verge of a
developing a swagger. Once they get into the AFC West schedule,
that swagger can turn quickly into a limp. For now, it's fun to
practice it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect,'' said Brown, ``to play well.''
</P>
<P>
   But you expected the same a year ago, right?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I expected it,'' he said. ``Not pointing fingers, but
after things started turning bad last year, maybe certain people
didn't expect to win. They wanted to win, but did they have it in
their heart they were going to win? I don't know.
</P>
<P>
   ``This organization hasn't had a lot of winning seasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Since it hasn't been tested, it's too early to tell the makeup
of the Seahawk heart. But 2-0 is indisputable, not to mention
hardly recognizable.
</P>
<P>
   Some things in life are supposed to be constants. But yet
another has disappeared. Seahawk fans can only hope to make the
best of the unknown.

 By PETER APPLEBOME   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sure, Pat Costa had already seen ``Jekyll and Hyde''
66 times, but this was different.
</P>
<P>
   As a successful bidder at a theater group's auction, she had
just been given a backstage tour, including the dressing rooms, wig
rooms and bathrooms, by the show's star Robert Cuccioli. When she
finally made it outside with her friend Connie Cadieux, who had
seen the show a mere 18 times, she was shaking as if near a
meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you verklempt?'' asked Jodi Stevens, a cast member and
Cuccioli's real-life girlfriend, as they left through the stage
door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Verklempt? I'm tres verklempt,'' gasped Ms. Costa, a nurse
from West Islip, whose home answering machine greets callers with
``This Is the Moment,'' the show's big number. ``I feel like my
life is hanging in the balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Reality seems to hang in the balance most nights at the Plymouth
Theater as one of Broadway's oddest obsessions plays out nightly.
``Jekyll and Hyde,'' Frank Wildhorn's hyperbolic musical, came to
New York last year with a built-in following of fans known as
Jekkies, who show up for performances nearly as regularly as some
people show up for work.
</P>
<P>
   In its second year, Jekkiedom shows no signs of dissipating, a
syndrome with implications not just for curious clinicians but
perhaps for other theatrical productions as well.
</P>
<P>
   By all rights, ``Jekyll and Hyde'' should be long gone. The
pallid blurbs culled from mostly underwhelmed reviews on the
theater marquee (```Like ``Phantom,'' it will run forever' _
Gannett Newspapers'') are a reminder that ``Jekyll'' is not exactly
a critic's favorite. In his review in The New York Times, Ben
Brantley called it a ``leaden, solemnly campy musical.'' In
Newsday, Linda Winer called the show ``dreary nonsense'' and ``a
pseudo-serious potboiler.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the Deadheads of Broadway, the hard-core Jekkies have
helped build word of mouth that has made the show a phenomenon. It
had its 500th Broadway performance in July, and plans are set for
productions in Sydney, Australia; Bremen, Germany; Madrid, Spain;
and Scandinavia, with others in the works for London, Mexico City
and Buenos Aires, Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   Most people in the Broadway audience each night are
first-timers, of course. But few shows are likely to build a
following as fanatical as the Jekkies. Paul Martin, who saw the
show the same night as Ms. Costa, said he had lost exact count but
figured his 100th trip to ``Jekyll'' coincided with Linda Eder's
epochal last performance on Aug. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Goldman was there for the 41st time. Debbie Krigger of
Houston has seen the show in its nearly endless pre-New York tour
in Houston, Cleveland, St. Louis, Pittsburgh, Dallas, San Antonio,
Orlando, Miami, Baltimore, Washington and Phoenix as well as in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   The main Jekkie fan club has about 400 members, and there are
Web sites not just for the show but for Cuccioli; his understudy,
Robert Evan, who performs at Wednesday and Saturday matinees; Ms.
Eder, who played Lucy, the prostitute, and Christiane Noll, who
plays the virginal Emma.
</P>
<P>
   Those who miss each night's show are likely to get a review of
it on the day's Jekkie Internet message board at
www.jekyllhyde.com, which includes fan notes, cast-member sightings
and musings on various Jekkie obsessions like the guy who was
beginning to see a therapist because he thought his Jekkiedom was
getting out of control.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are not alone,'' came a reply. ``Many of us feel the same
way as you. Instead of going to a therapist, we talk to each other
about it, since others truly don't understand.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jekyll and Hyde'' is not the first show to attract repeat
customers, though it is more likely to happen in critical hits like
``A Chorus Line'' or ``Rent.'' Movies like ``The Rocky Horror
Picture Show'' have long been cult favorites as well.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some of these, which have a young following, ``Jekyll''
draws its faithful from a wide age range, with most from the early
20s to the late 40s.
</P>
<P>
   Regular-price tickets to ``Jekyll'' range from $45 to $75, which
can make becoming a Jekkie an expensive hobby. But to ease the
pain, many repeat offenders rely on $20 tickets available the day
of the show or discount tickets from the TKTS booth.
</P>
<P>
   The faithful, most of whom see other shows as well as ``Jekyll
and Hyde,'' have a little trouble putting their fingers on what
makes them serial customers. But most start with the music, which
is a mixture of high-wattage, Disneyesque Top 40 pop and brassy
Broadway bombast. ``This Is the Moment'' has already become a
staple at events in congenital need of emotional overkill, like the
Miss America contest, the Olympics and the 1996 Democratic National
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, without the revenue from ``Jekyll'' albums _ 250,000
copies were sold before the show opened in New York _ it is
doubtful the show would have lasted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a metal-rock musician, and the first time I saw their
commercial on television, I thought, `Hey this guy can sing,'''
said Sal Italiano, who has seen the show 19 times. ``I'll tell you
right now, Frank Wildhorn is going to redefine Broadway. He's just
got a handle on a new genre of fan, a whole new market.''
</P>
<P>
   But, like being a Deadhead, being a fan of ``Jekyll and Hyde''
is about more than the show. Goldman met his girlfriend, Amy Hogge
of Dallas, through the ``Jekyll'' network. When he showed up at the
theater recently, he was guaranteed to find a ready community of
fellow travelers. They included fans and friends like Martin or
Melissa Charwin, who stopped by after the show to see how Ms.
Costa's backstage tour went.
</P>
<P>
   He chatted with Charles Wallace, who had just left the ensemble
and had come to see the show from the audience for the first time,
and he regularly talks with cast members like Ms. Noll after the
show.
</P>
<P>
   Most striking is the way the cast members have come to see the
fans more as parishioners than customers. Even the show's stars
make a point of lingering after the performance to sign autographs,
pose for pictures and chat with the faithful. Some go to Jekkies'
parties or join them for after-show coffee or drinks.

<P>

</P>
<P>
   ``After you see the same faces every day, you get used to them,
and they become almost like family, to some extent,'' said
Cuccioli, who was nominated for a Tony last year for his
performance. ``I never expected anything like this, to be honest,
and I wasn't prepared for it. But they've been very supportive of
us, and I feel a responsibility to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jekkie culture is also a product of the Internet, and the
way it has been able to spread information and bring people
together around a common interest like nothing in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Like all families, Jekkiedom has its own family tree and rites
of passage. The extended family includes Wildhorn's other show on
Broadway, the even more widely panned ``Scarlet Pimpernel.'' And
fans are awaiting his next one, ``The Civil War,'' a recounting of
the war's personal conflicts, based on contemporary accounts. It is
to have its debut in Houston this month, starring Ms. Eder.
</P>
<P>
   And this was a traumatic week when the revered Ms. Eder was
replaced by a newcomer to the cast, Luba Mason.
</P>
<P>
   After the emotional catharsis of Ms. Eder's last performance,
when the theater was packed with the faithful following every
nuance and gesture as if interpreting Scripture, Martin came to a
recent show with a pained expression as if revisiting a favorite
haunt from a faded romance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw it four times the last week, and the last show was the
most amazing thing I ever saw in my life,'' he said wistfully.
``Linda has the lungs of a lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   So Ms. Mason's performance was like a first dinner with
prospective in-laws. But when it was over, both he and Goldman
proclaimed themselves pleased with the actress, who had an earthier
take on the character but seemed a welcome addition to the family.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if the music, message and community account for the
serial Jekkies, whatever makes someone see a show 100 times may be
a mystery too dense to unravel. Most of the first-timers in the
audience seemed to like the show but were baffled at the notion of
seeing it dozens of times. Even those at Ground Zero don't have a
ready explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're normal people usually,'' said Ms. Costa, who has seen
the show four more times over the past week bringing her total to
71. ``I'm a nurse. She's a bank manager. I never did this for
anything before. But I saw the second preview, March 22, 1997, and
I thought this is what Broadway is supposed to be. So I keep coming
back. Maybe it's a case of arrested development. What I didn't do
at 16, I'm doing at 47.''

DAVENPORT'S U.S. OPEN TITLE FILLS VOID IN WOMEN'S TENNIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The new U.S. Open singles champion said she walked
into her hotel room late Saturday afternoon and found the message
light bright as Rudolph's nose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the most messages,'' Lindsay Davenport said Sunday after
she and Natasha Zvereva lost the women's doubles championship match
to Martina Hingis and Jana Novotna _ although one championship
seemed enough to turn Davenport's world around.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like, `You have 23 messages.' And I said, `Oh, my God.'
The first call I got, I'll never forget it, it was from a guy who
plays on the Tour. His name is Brian McPhie. He called and said `It
is 3:27 and you just won match point,' and he was screaming into
the phone. Those are the ones you remember,'' Davenport said.
</P>
<P>
   One day had passed since the 22-year-old Californian had secured
her most important tennis victory _ a win that puts her in some
pretty rare, pretty good company.
</P>
<P>
   The names Billie Jean King, Chris Evert and Tracey Austin are
also etched on that silver trophy that commemorates all singles
winners of the U.S. Grand Slam since the Open era began in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Now Davenport's name is etched in sterling, too.
</P>
<P>
   What this means is that for a 1998 U.S. Open that did not
produce Pete Sampras' 12th career Grand Slam victory _ Australia's
Patrick Rafter defend his men's title with a win over Mark
Philippousas _ something else was gained here. Something unexpected
but something necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the 20 pounds she lost and because of the new level
of dedication she mustered for the game, Davenport has picked up
where something was left off. For all the American women who have
turned their athletic attention to tennis, the royal lineage
continues. Davenport is now the next American champion.
</P>
<P>
   She is the one who takes the place at the table set for Jennifer
Capriati, who could not ingest all the hype and pressure and who
could not endure the lost childhood that came from a too-much,
too-soon life on the tour.
</P>
<P>
   And Davenport got to that elite place among American tennis
champions before Venus Williams, the awesome 18-year-old whose
tennis mind and tennis patience need more time to develop.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport's arrival, especially because her first slam win came
at the U.S. Open, helps fill a void maybe none of us realized
existed until you look around and see that no American woman has
yet emerged from the deep wake after King and Evert.
</P>
<P>
   Those American women played their best tennis in their 20's and
into their 30's. Because of their persistence, consistency and
force of personality, tennis gained a foothold in the American
sporting consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Now Davenport seems prepared to take up the cause, even if she
continues to battle a perception that she is not a fitting heir to
the legacy of her predecessors' success and even if tennis needs a
much bigger boost (from some sort of comprehensive marketing push)
than one polite, laid-back Californian can supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't put myself in that same category as Billie Jean or
Chris, or even Martina (Navratoliva) or Monica (Seles, who became
U.S. citizens.) Maybe after I've won 10 or 12,'' Davenport said,
understanding this is just a beginning for her.
</P>
<P>
   The computer rankings will keep Davenport at No. 2, behind
Hingis, this week. But Davenport is well-positioned to take over
No. 1, especially since her U.S. Open victory over Hingis gives her
five titles this year and she is playing the best tennis of any
woman on the tour.
</P>
<P>
   This momentum had Davenport's International Management Group
agent licking his lips a bit Sunday. The opportunities are sure to
float Davenport's way now, even if that was the last thing on her
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has obviously proven herself, especially after this Open
victory, to be the best player in the world this year. She's got
big bonuses coming from Wilson and Nike,'' said Tony Godsick,
trying to pose for a picture with Davenport in front of the famous
Atlas on the Worlds Fairgrounds outside the United States Tennis
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport was mobbed by photographers from around the world
Sunday, and fans, too, tried to get a shot of the new champ.
</P>
<P>
   ``But she is very different from some of the other players. She
is as American as, I hate to say this, but apple pie. She is a
Californian. Very laid back. She turns down exhibitions and things
to spend whatever time she has with her mom and her sisters,''
Godsick said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing she has ever done is hold up that
silver trophy. She wanted to be the best player she could be.''
</P>
<P>
   And that alone is no small victory.
</P>
<P>
   Time will tell more about Lindsay Davenport, she knows that. But
what she started here at the Open, where she won every set and
seemed to possess a mandate for victory, was pretty impressive.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it was Billie Jean King who was one of those 23 callers
who left a message Saturday night, after Davenport added her name
to the illustrious list of American women etched in Grand Slam
sterling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billie called me back and said `I'm really proud of you. You
looked great. You handled yourself great. You should be proud,'''
Davenport said.
</P>
<P>
   Even at 6-foot-2{, Lindsay Davenport knew she could stand
taller.

PRETENDERS BE ING IDENTIFIED IN FIESTA RACE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - There is no more fruitless exercise in sports than
trying to come up with a preseason college football ranking. That
has been proven again in the first few weeks this season.
</P>
<P>
   Contenders have become pretenders. One marquee team, Michigan,
has seen its chances of playing in the Fiesta Bowl for a second
straight national title disappear with an 0-2 start.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State, which also harbored some hope of playing for a
national title in Sun Devil Stadium Jan. 4, is also 0-2 and can't
afford to take its next opponent, North Texas, for granted.
</P>
<P>
   Another perennial frontrunner, Florida State, saw its chance of
a national title severely damaged with an upset loss to North
Carolina State on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame, which moved into darkhorse status with a victory
over Michigan a week ago, came back to earth with a loss last
Saturday against Michigan State.
</P>
<P>
   Some of college football's elite have come through the opening
weeks unscathed. No. 1 Ohio State has been impressive. Nebraska is
3-0, despite playing without starting quarterback Bobby Newcombe
the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Penn State, which gave Coach Joe Paterno his 300th victory last
Saturday, looks better than most people expected. Florida will gets
its first serious test this Saturday against Tennessee. UCLA looked
good against a so-so Texas team.
</P>
<P>
   Like Florida, Kansas State is 2-0 thanks to an easy schedule.
The Wildcats' weak nonconference schedule could hurt them later in
the year should they remain a contender for the Fiesta Bowl.
Strength of schedule is one of the criteria used in determing the
participants. &QL;

SUSPICIOUS FIRE DESTROYS EXHIBIT ON ULSTER STRIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERSEY CITY, N.J. _ In a suspected act of arson that officials
say may have been politically motivated, an art gallery was set
ablaze early Sunday morning just hours before it was to unveil a
photography exhibition of Catholic children in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   No one was injured in the fire, which broke out at 6:42 a.m. at
the Cooper Gallery, and was contained at 7:02 a.m, said Capt. Brett
Minor of the Jersey City Fire Department. But the gallery, which is
in the basement of a three-story building, was extensively damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Freshly painted white walls had been singed black. Office files
were destroyed. And all 23 of the black-and-white prints in the
exhibition, ``Faces of War: Children of Belfast,'' by Michael
Schwartz, were ruined.
</P>
<P>
   At first, officials suspected that the fire was routine, or
perhaps an act of arson. But after the owners informed
investigators of the nature of the photographs _ which depict,
among other images, the children of members of the Irish Republican
Army _ the police began investigating it as a bias incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fire was deliberately set, and we're going to handle it as
a bias incident,'' said Lieut. John Sheyka of the Jersey City
Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   He said investigators had determined that the vandals had broken
into an adjacent gallery that was under construction and gained
access to the Cooper Gallery. There, they disabled the alarm system
and smoke detectors, made a pile of combustible materials in the
director's office and lighted it, Sheyka said. No fingerprints were
found.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it was political or malicious, we're going to have to
find out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To Schwartz and the gallery's owners, though, the motivation was
clearly political.
</P>
<P>
   ``The subject matter obviously antagonized a person or a
group,'' said Schwartz, who works as a freelance photographer for
The Daily News. ``I would say that even though my intent was to try
to show some compassion for these little kids that are victims over
there, and maybe change some people in thinking about the peace
process, all it did was the exact opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   As of Sunday night, no arrests had been made, nor had anyone
claimed responsibility for the fire, Sheyka said. But the police
had arranged to have an officer patrol outside the gallery
overnight, to guard against any more acts of violence.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   e The fire caught many by surprise and offered a reminder that
even the most foreign of conflicts can sometimes be felt closer to
home.
</P>
<P>
   But on Sunday night, it remained a mystery who might have wanted
to make a political statement about Northern Ireland in a small,
sedate New Jersey gallery that, with its two main exhibition spaces
and rear garden, has often been used by the public as an escape
from the city since the gallery opened in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz noted that some of the photographs in the exhibit had
been shown in public before, either in smaller solo shows or in
group shows, and that they had never provoked any protests.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit is the product of 10 years of work and captures
children ages 9 to 16 at rest and play in Belfast in the
British-ruled territory of Northern Ireland, which has been
beleaguered by decades of violence between Catholics and
Protestants.
</P>
<P>
   Irish people in the United States were also puzzled. Niall
O'Dowd, the publisher of The Irish Voice, a weekly newspaper, said
he could not recall an incident in this country in which an exhibit
or event was disrupted for political reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering the tremendous ground swell for peace, when
there's more hope than ever,'' he said, ``something like this is
completely mystifying.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Dowd added that he could not imagine how the fire could have
been related to the topic, which he said was not overly
controversial.
</P>
<P>
   The pictures reflect the complicated reality of life in Belfast.
In one, a child makes an obscene gesture at a British paratrooper;
in another, a child smiles at a paratrooper, who returns the
expression. In others, youths play with guns and wear ski masks.
</P>
<P>
   To accentuate the emotional impact, the gallery's window
featured empty bullet casings and an assortment of children's toys
_ a Lego piece, crayons, sneakers, a baseball glove. But like the
photographs, those items, too, were damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Before the opening reception planned for Sunday, the exhibition
had been the subject of articles in several newspapers, including
The Daily News, The Star-Ledger of Newark, The Jersey Journal and
The Hudson Current, a local weekly.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition had attracted more attention, perhaps, because it
was the product of the gallery's first-ever national contest, said
Stephan Shedrowitz, director of exhibitions and an owner of the
gallery.
</P>
<P>
   One grace note Sunday was that the pictures have not been lost
forever; the negatives, Schwartz said, are in a safe-deposit box.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the fire, the gallery went ahead with its previously
scheduled 2 p.m. opening of the show in the garden area, to mark
not only Schwartz's work, but that of the other artists whose
pieces were destroyed in the fire.
</P>
<P>
   There was a touch of bitter irony, too. Guests who had to
negotiate their way past the gallery's broken windows, singed walls
and destroyed photographs were greeted by several signs in front of
the gallery that read: ``Welcome to the War Zone.''

50TH EMMYS SHOW CELEBRATES HISTORY; `FRASIER,' HUNT MAKE SOME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``n'' California news file.) 
BY   GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ On a night where television celebrated 50 years
of history, the NBC comedy series ``Frasier'' made a little history
of its own, becoming the first program to a fifth outstanding
comedy series Emmy, at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frasier,'' which will move into television's plum time slot
this fall _ the 9 p.m. Thursday spot recently vacated by
``Seinfeld'' _ also won awards for actors Kelsey Grammer and David
Hyde Pierce to go along with a technical award presented two weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The show has won the Emmy for outstanding comedy series in each
of its five years on the air and also became the only television
program to win Emmys in five consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty cool,'' Grammer said after the show. ``It's a lot
of hardware, and it's all it's cracked up to be. I don't think the
momentous moment hit me until they said the name `Frasier.' It's
just incredible that we've been able to do this five times in a
row.''
</P>
<P>
   Helen Hunt made some history of her own. The ``Mad About You''
star, who earlier this year won an Oscar for best actress in ``As
Good as It Gets,'' took home her third consecutive outstanding
comedy actress Emmy. Hunt is the first lead actress to win an Oscar
and an Emmy in the same year. Grammer's Emmy for outstanding actor
in a comedy was also his third.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dreams came true this year,'' Hunt said backstage. ``It's
so big, I don't know how to put it into words. I feel more and more
grateful every day.''
</P>
<P>
   The broadcast network count: NBC, 18; ABC, 17; CBS, 8, Fox, 6,
and The WB, 2. PBS netted four Emmys. HBO led the cable networks
with 14 Emmys.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's second-year law drama ``The Practice'' was named
outstanding drama series, giving program creator David E. Kelley
the Emmy that many expected him to win for his comedy, ``Ally
McBeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Andre Braugher (``Homicide: Life on the Street'') and Christine
Lahti (``Chicago Hope'') won the dramatic lead performer Emmys.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the year, Lahti won a Golden Globe for ``Chicago
Hope'' but was late arriving to the stage because she was stuck in
the ladies' room. This time she took no chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, you can unlock the bathrooms now,'' she quipped from the
podium.
</P>
<P>
   For Braugher, who left the cast of ``Homicide'' this past
season, winning the Emmy on his third try was quite special.
</P>
<P>
   ``That it came late does not make it any less sweet,'' Braugher
said. ``I'm hoping this award will spur me to even greater
heights.''
</P>
<P>
   On the night that former Alabama governor and former
presidential candidate George C. Wallace died, the TNT miniseries
``George Wallace'' took three Emmys, winning awards for actor Gary
Sinise, director John Frankenheimer (his fourth Emmy win) and
supporting actress Mare Winningham.
</P>
<P>
   HBO's ``Don King: Only in America'' won awards for outstanding
television movie and outstanding writing for a miniseries. Tom
Hanks' celebrated ``From the Earth to the Moon'' was named
outstanding miniseries. The 12-part HBO epic won three Emmys
altogether after picking up 17 nods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, we were able to dramatize a period piece 30 years old,
about 40,000 people in every state of the union working toward one
common goal and achieving the impossible _ something so impossible
it was considered madness to consider it for thousands upon
thousands of years,'' Hanks told the audience. ``Imagine what
problems we could solve and the ills that we could cure if we chose
to live the same way the people of Apollo did in the 1960s. Thank
you, and God bless America.''
</P>
<P>
   Garry Shandling, who entered the evening with no wins to show
for 19 previous nominations, seemed to be still in a mild state of
shock when he talked to reporters after winning an Emmy with Peter
Tolan for comedy writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so meaningful for us on our last year to finally win
something,'' Shandling said. ``I figured we'd come away with
nothing again.''
</P>
<P>
   Shandling, who came to the show with NBC sportscaster Jim Gray,
joked that he will be trolling the parties afterward for available
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, this award will be as powerful as the presidency,
and I'll be able to meet someone,'' Shandling said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Late Show With David Letterman'' also finally took home an
Emmy, ending a similar 0-for-19 drought.
</P>
<P>
   Awards shows were popular with voters, not a huge surprise given
the entertainment industry's penchant for self-congratulation. The
Tony Awards won for outstanding variety special. The Academy Awards
won five Emmys, including outstanding variety direction; Billy
Crystal won for outstanding variety performance. For Crystal, it
was his sixth Emmy and second for hosting the Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good negotiating tool, I'll tell you that,'' Crystal
said, holding up his award.
</P>
<P>
   NBC locked up both awards for best support in a comedy series.
Lisa Kudrow was singled out of ``Friends'' as best supporting
actress. David Hyde Pierce got his second Emmy out of five
nominations for ``Frasier.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the evening's most enthusiastic winners was Camryn
Manheim, who won outstanding supporting actress in a drama series
for her work on ABC law drama ``The Practice.'' Manheim, who
brought her autograph book to the ceremony, dedicated the award to
``all the fat girls.'' Backstage, she was no less exuberant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel so sexy right now!'' Manheim roared. ``I was always
told I would never make it on television, but I always had a strong
I'll-show-you attitude. And here I am. It's incredible.''

A FEW IDEAS FOR McGWIRE'S PAYOFF PITCH 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Moments after he became the first player to hit 62
home runs in a season, Mark McGwire declared he was going to Disney
World. Why stop there? For the St. Louis slugger, the basepaths are
lined with gold. Whether it's homers he's hitting or products he's
pitching, the sky's the limit. Consider the possibilities:
</P>
<P>
   All-American Auto Glass Window Repair. Because 550-foot home
runs happen.
</P>
<P>
   Milk. A white mustache to go with his red goatee.
</P>
<P>
   Sports Connection fitness centers. Because Linda Evans hawks
health clubs and the only records she has broken lately are those
of her ex-flame Yanni.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth's Chris Steak House. Real men eat custom-aged and corn-fed
beef.
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro. Because every sports hero should be an action figure.
</P>
<P>

alone.

and Ruth think.

<P>
   Green Giant Canned Spinach. Popeye would envy his biceps.
</P>
<P>
   Hallmark greeting cards. Because psychotherapy showed him real
men express their feelings.
</P>
<P>
   U-Haul Self Storage. His 1987 Rookie of the Year award is
stashed away with other awards and assorted memorabilia and there's
more clutter where that came from.
</P>
<P>
   Stay Sharp Permanent Markers. Because they leave an indelible
mark, just like he has.
</P>
<P>
   The Lock Doc. Someone's gotta pinch hit if he misplaces his key
to St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Norelco Advantage razors. Because he already has one shadow in
Sammy Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   Nikon cameras. He shouldn't be the only one taking his best
shots.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Postal Service. Because he also specializes in air-mail
deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   Target stores. The left-field bleachers are his bullseye.
</P>
<P>
   Audubon Society. Because he's the reason all eyes have been on
the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Aim toothpaste. Perfect for the slugging son of a dentist.
</P>
<P>
   TWA. Because flights into its St. Louis hub are re-routed to
avoid his home-run balls.
</P>
<P>
   Hanes underwear. Boxers or briefs, inquiring female fans want to
know.
</P>
<P>
   Stouffers Hearty Portions frozen dinners. Because who wants to
go to restaurants and be mobbed?
</P>
<P>
   Maalox. Opposing pitchers stock up on the stuff when he's in
town.
</P>
<P>
   Great Expectations Dating Service. Because connecting in love is
harder than connecting at the plate for this DWM.
</P>
<P>
   M&AMP;Ms. McGwire and Maris. Maris and McGwire. What could be
sweeter?
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Scholls. Because the Lord of the Arch city has god-awful
arches.
</P>
<P>
   Cap'n Crunch cereal. The breakfast of sluggers.
</P>
<P>
   Toys-R-Us. Because he's a big kid at heart.
</P>
<P>
   Popsicle Big Sticks. He'd melt over the Big Reds.
</P>
<P>

</P>

</P>
<P>
   Champion athletic wear. The label fits.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola. Because he's the real thing.

the celebrity constellation.
</P>
<P>
   House of Fabrics. Because curtain calls have become part of the
fabric of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com. Aeronautics. Classics. History. Self-improvement.
It's got all his bases covered.
</P>
<P>
   All America Auto Transport. Because he's accustomed to long
drives.
</P>
<P>
   Sinutab. His sky-scraping shots handle the altitude better than
his cranky sinuses.
</P>
<P>
   Laser Eye Center. Because he's blind as a bat (wood or mammal)
without his contacts.
</P>
<P>
   Dockers. They fit loosely, like the cover on a ball he has just
whacked.
</P>
<P>
   Payday candy bars. Because he struck it on 09-08-98.
</P>
<P>
   Androstenedione. In addition to its other benefits, he has
suggested it's a poor man's Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   Kleenex. Because there is crying in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Ritz-Carlton hotel chain. His home base during the season.
</P>
<P>
   Boggle. It's hard to find the words to describe his achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Cadillac. Behold a Mark 62.
</P>
<P>
   The Abbey. The baseball caps already are a hit, can the
signature Biggest Mac burger be far behind?
</P>
<P>
   Panasonic Digital Palmcorder. Because he may make history again
but his son Matt will only be 10 once. &QL;

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You be Siskel, he'll be Ebert, we'll just spit out
the truth:
</P>
<P>
   Steve Prefontaine would even agree that, within reason,
</P>
<P>
   Billy Crudup's performance in ``Without Limits'' is more on
track than Jared Leto's fake hair-and-mustache job in ``Pre.''...
</P>
<P>
   ``Pre'' may have been more accurate, but ``Without Limits'' was
more believable, thanks to Donald Sutherland, too....
</P>
<P>
   The latter even gets away _ somehow _ with using NBC's Charlie
Jones and Frank Shorter on the call of the 5,000 meters from the
'72 Munich Games. Remember, ABC covered the real deal and Shorter
competed in (and won) that Olympic marathon shortly after
Prefontaine's run....
</P>
<P>
   Jones plays himself as a 1972 broadcaster _ and looks remarkably
like himself a quarter of a century later....
</P>
<P>
   And why couldn't Jones miscall this race and let Pre win (or did
we give away a key element to non-sports moviegoers)?...
</P>
<P>
   Memo to Def Master Shaq: Practicing free throws during the
lockout is good, trying to sell rap CDs in Bakersfield is bad.
That's bad in a bad way....
</P>
<P>
   Irony definition No. 6,262: Because of the season he's had, Mark
McGwire is about the most valuable player the game of baseball has
right now. But he won't win his league's most valuable award....
</P>
<P>
   Reason you didn't get to see McAndro try to one-up two-timin'
Sammy Sosa in the home-run twist was 'cuz this was one of the
``Sunday Night Baseball'' games ESPN wanted to ship over to ESPN2
so it could televise that huge ``Sunday Night Football'' New
England-Indianapolis tilt, but baseball's all-knowin' suits
wouldn't allow the swap. So the game dropped all together from
national view....

   Couldn't force-feed me a Big Mac even if it was on special for
.062 cents....

<P>
   Don't be so sure Murdoch had nuthin' to do with the U.S. Open
men's finals....
</P>
<P>
   Ross Porter obscure stat of the week: Eric Karros is the
major-league leader in career homers without a grand slam. He's
sittin' on 176....
</P>
<P>
   Upside to the huge expansion fee charged to the new suckers of
the Cleveland Browns _ Georgia Frontiere will receive NO SHARE of
it. When the Rams left L.A. for St. Louie in '95, Frontiere had to
forfeit the cut she'd usually get for the next two expansion teams
over a 10-year period _ unless a team was given to L.A. Even more
reason to hold off on begging for a new franchise....
</P>
<P>
   Attention fantasy dweebs: The latest McGwire-covered Sporting
News determines the top 100 players today in the NFL. The USC
grad-count is just four _ Tony Boselli, Junior Seau, Bruce Matthews
and Willie McGinest _ because it decided against including Keyshawn
``Just Put Me On the Damn List'' Johnson and purposely removed
Jason Sehorn after his season-ending knee injury. UCLA is
represented by three _ Troy Aikman, Jonathan Ogden and Carnell Lake
But don't rush out and get Aikman in any transactions today....
</P>
<P>
   Reggie White, who had three sacks Sunday, didn't make the list.
But we're OK with that....

   Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flint expands his literary

50TH EMMYS SHOW CELEBRATES HISTORY; `FRASIER,' HUNT MAKE SOME

<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ On a night where television celebrated 50 years
of history, the NBC comedy series ``Frasier'' made a little history
of its own, becoming the first program to a fifth outstanding
comedy series Emmy, at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles.

just incredible that we've been able to do this five times in a
row.''
</P>
<P>
   Helen Hunt made some history of her own. The ``Mad About You''
star, who earlier this year won an Oscar for best actress in ``As
Good as It Gets,'' took home her third consecutive outstanding
comedy actress Emmy. Hunt is the first lead actress to win an Oscar
and an Emmy in the same year. Grammer's Emmy for outstanding actor
in a comedy was also his third.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dreams came true this year,'' Hunt said backstage. ``It's
so big, I don't know how to put it into words. I feel more and more
grateful every day.''
</P>
<P>
   The broadcast network count: NBC, 18; ABC, 17; CBS, 8, Fox, 6,
and The WB, 2. PBS netted four Emmys. HBO led the cable networks
with 14 Emmys.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's second-year law drama ``The Practice'' was named
outstanding drama series, giving program creator David E. Kelley
the Emmy that many expected him to win for his comedy, ``Ally
McBeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Andre Braugher (``Homicide: Life on the Street'') and Christine
Lahti (``Chicago Hope'') won the dramatic lead performer Emmys.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the year, Lahti won a Golden Globe for ``Chicago
Hope'' but was late arriving to the stage because she was stuck in
the ladies' room. This time she took no chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, you can unlock the bathrooms now,'' she quipped from the
podium.
</P>
<P>
   For Braugher, who left the cast of ``Homicide'' this past
season, winning the Emmy on his third try was quite special.
</P>
<P>
   ``That it came late does not make it any less sweet,'' Braugher
said. ``I'm hoping this award will spur me to even greater
heights.''
</P>
<P>
   On the night that former Alabama governor and former
presidential candidate George C. Wallace died, the TNT miniseries
``George Wallace'' took three Emmys, winning awards for actor Gary
Sinise, director John Frankenheimer (his fourth Emmy win) and
supporting actress Mare Winningham.
</P>
<P>
   HBO's ``Don King: Only in America'' won awards for outstanding
television movie and outstanding writing for a miniseries. Tom
Hanks' celebrated ``From the Earth to the Moon'' was named
outstanding miniseries. The 12-part HBO epic won three Emmys
altogether after picking up 17 nods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, we were able to dramatize a period piece 30 years old,
about 40,000 people in every state of the union working toward one
common goal and achieving the impossible _ something so impossible
it was considered madness to consider it for thousands upon
thousands of years,'' Hanks told the audience. ``Imagine what
problems we could solve and the ills that we could cure if we chose
to live the same way the people of Apollo did in the 1960s. Thank
you, and God bless America.''
</P>
<P>
   Garry Shandling, who entered the evening with no wins to show
for 19 previous nominations, seemed to be still in a mild state of
shock when he talked to reporters after winning an Emmy with Peter
Tolan for comedy writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so meaningful for us on our last year to finally win
something,'' Shandling said. ``I figured we'd come away with
nothing again.''
</P>
<P>
   Shandling, who came to the show with NBC sportscaster Jim Gray,
joked that he will be trolling the parties afterward for available
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, this award will be as powerful as the presidency,
and I'll be able to meet someone,'' Shandling said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Late Show With David Letterman'' also finally took home an
Emmy, ending a similar 0-for-19 drought.
</P>
<P>
   Awards shows were popular with voters, not a huge surprise given
the entertainment industry's penchant for self-congratulation. The
Tony Awards won for outstanding variety special. The Academy Awards
won five Emmys, including outstanding variety direction; Billy
Crystal won for outstanding variety performance. For Crystal, it
was his sixth Emmy and second for hosting the Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good negotiating tool, I'll tell you that,'' Crystal
said, holding up his award.
</P>
<P>
   NBC locked up both awards for best support in a comedy series.
Lisa Kudrow was singled out of ``Friends'' as best supporting
actress. David Hyde Pierce got his second Emmy out of five
nominations for ``Frasier.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the evening's most enthusiastic winners was Camryn
Manheim, who won outstanding supporting actress in a drama series
for her work on ABC law drama ``The Practice.'' Manheim, who
brought her autograph book to the ceremony, dedicated the award to
``all the fat girls.'' Backstage, she was no less exuberant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel so sexy right now!'' Manheim roared. ``I was always
told I would never make it on television, but I always had a strong
I'll-show-you attitude. And here I am. It's incredible.''

BLAKE DETERMINED TO GET `RIGHT' DEAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The man voted the National Hockey League's best defenseman last
season spent the first day of this year's training camp apart from
his team, burning off energy on an exercise bicycle Sunday and
watching football at his Manhattan Beach home with Kings teammates
Glen Murray and Sean O'Donnell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little different,'' Rob Blake said Sunday afternoon.
``I should be doing something different now. But it's not going to
happen here for a bit, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake, a restricted free agent, has turned down a reported
five-year, $25-million Kings offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's hard to relate and I know (fans) are going to
think whatever,'' said Blake, who earned $3.15 million last year.
``It's difficult. The thing I want to get across is there's going
to be a lot said about the money. But I want to be treated fairly
as a player and until that happens, you're not going to be happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the fact that he's eligible for unrestricted free
agency when he turns 31, the 28-year-old Blake said of the Kings'
offer: ``That's for five years, which gives up two years of
(unrestricted) free agency. I'd love to stay here for five years. I
don't want to move. But I'm 28 and this is the biggest contract of
my life. I want to make sure it's the right one.''
</P>
<P>
   Off-ice Berg: Coach Larry Robinson made his strongest statement
to date about an unsigned player, and it wasn't about Blake.
Rather, he is disappointed at the decision by 21-year-old
restricted free-agent defenseman Aki Berg to return to his native
Finland while negotiations proceed. Berg earned $825,000 last
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope he's getting the right advice,'' Robinson said. ``For a
guy who really hasn't done anything in three years and is ready to
make a statement in the league, he's going about it in the wrong
way. I hope he knows what he's doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is his time to shine and he's not here. When you look at
his statistics, what has he got to base his actions on? He had the
sixth-most minutes played and he had no goals and eight assists.
He's not an offensive star. Do something before you ask for
something. In his case, he's wanting something before he's done
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to reach Berg's agent were unsuccessful and it's not
known whether Berg is considering playing in Finland this season.
But if he were to play even one game there, he would have to clear
NHL waivers before rejoining the Kings this season, an unlikely
scenario for a 21-year-old player chosen third overall in the draft
just three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   On the ice: Two Kings suffered what appeared to be minor
injuries on the first day of practice. Center Jozef Stumpel, the
Kings' leading scorer last season, twisted his right ankle and
might be sidelined for two or three days, and rookie center Eric
Belanger suffered a cut on his nose.
</P>
<P>
   Of the first day's action, Robinson said: ``The pace was pretty
good. But it's not the first day you worry about. It's the second
or third day. That's when the fatigue sets in.''

<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ On a night where television celebrated 50 years
of history, the NBC comedy series ``Frasier'' made a little history
of its own, becoming the first program to a fifth outstanding
comedy series Emmy, at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frasier,'' which will move into television's plum time slot
this fall _ the 9 p.m. Thursday spot recently vacated by
``Seinfeld'' _ also won awards for actors Kelsey Grammer and David
Hyde Pierce to go along with a technical award presented two weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The show has won the Emmy for outstanding comedy series in each
of its five years on the air and also became the only television
program to win Emmys in five consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty cool,'' Grammer said after the show. ``It's a lot
of hardware, and it's all it's cracked up to be. I don't think the
momentous moment hit me until they said the name `Frasier.' It's
just incredible that we've been able to do this five times in a

   Helen Hunt made some history of her own. The ``Mad About You''
star, who earlier this year won an Oscar for best actress in ``As

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
An afternoon victory by the Chicago Cubs assured the Astros a
chance to clinch the National League Central Division title on
their own terms.
<TEXT>
<P>
   They took the field Sunday night with a flame in their eyes that
would have sent any fire marshal into a citation-writing frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   False alarm.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis Cardinals doused the Astros' plans in
table-turning fashion with a 3-2 come-from-behind victory in the
Astrodome. The Cards' Fernando Tatis entered the game late, but he
was just in time to be a party pooper for the Astros and the 52,338
people on their guest list.
</P>
<P>
   Tatis, who took the field in the fifth inning after Mark McGwire
left because of back spasms, delivered a two-out, two-run double in
the eighth off Astros reliever Doug Henry to put a damper on the
festivities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hung a slider, and (Tatis) tattooed it,'' Henry said. ``It
was a really bad slider. It would have been nice to wrap up the
division today, but it didn't happen. We'll have to come back
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the third time will be the charm. The Astros will take
another crack at locking up the division against the New York Mets
tonight in the first of a four-game series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is disappointed,'' said Jeff Bagwell, who was 4-for-4
to raise his average to .295. ``We wanted to do it today because
there probably won't be a crowd this big tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's crowd saw the Astros' season-high-tying eight-game
winning streak end. Because Atlanta lost, the Astros maintained
sole possession of the NL's best record.
</P>
<P>
   But the only number that seemed to matter Sunday was the ``1''
hanging from the rafters near the left-field foul pole _ the one
representing the Astros' magic number.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're far from panicking,'' Astros catcher Brad Ausmus said.
``This was our first loss in a week. You can't expect us to win
every game.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals righthander Juan Acevedo survived warning-track fly
balls by pinch hitters Bill Spiers and Dave Clark to earn his ninth
save.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros scored first on a second-inning single by Ausmus.
Bagwell doubled home Derek Bell to give the Astros a 2-0 lead in
the third.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Astros starter Sean Bergman was doing his best
impersonation of Mike Scott, who pitched a no-hitter the day the
Astros clinched the NL West in 1986. Bergman retired the first nine
batters he faced and took a no-hitter into the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   But the early tease ended when Cardinals second baseman Delino
DeShields launched a 1-0 pitch into the right-field seats.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of few mistakes by Bergman, who held the Cardinals to
five hits and three runs in 7 innings. Unfortunately for Bergman,
his best outing in about three weeks wasn't enough to help the
Astros lock up their second division title in as many years.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a tough loss,'' Bergman said. ``I really wanted to be
the guy on the mound at the end of a big game like this. That's
always been a dream of mine. It's too bad we had to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros cranked out seven hits in the first three innings
against Cardinals starter Kent Mercker, but it was quite an
accomplishment to get one runner off the veteran lefty after he
settled into a groove. Mercker retired eight consecutive batters
after Bagwell's RBI double in the third, and he polished off 13 of
the last 14 batters he faced.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals' winning rally was ignited by Bergman's only two
walks of the game. He issued free passes to Eli Marrero _ on four
pitches _ and J.D. Drew. Tatis, who was batting in McGwire's spot
in the order, chased both home with a double out of Moises Alou's
reach in left field.
</P>
<P>
   ``The four-pitch walk was unacceptable,'' Bergman said.
</P>
<P>
   Alou wasn't much happier with the way he played the ball off
Tatis' bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I should have caught that ball,'' Alou said. ``I
misjudged it. That would have been the game right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Astros seldom go down without at least the threat
of a comeback. The outlook was pretty good in the eighth inning,
but hard-throwing Cardinals reliever Rich Croushore struck out
Alou, who has been the Astros' best clutch hitter all season, with
the tying run at second base.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've come through in that situation a lot of times, but you
can't do it all of the time,'' Alou said. ``I love those
situations. I would have loved to have come through with 50,000
people on their feet, especially after making a mistake in the
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I didn't have the best plan up there. I was trying to hit
the ball 10,000 feet instead of just trying to hit it hard
somewhere. I'd love to be in that situation again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're eventually going to clinch it. Whether it's tomorrow or
next week, we will clinch it.''

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
DENVER _ It had seemed like such a good idea a week earlier when
Troy Aikman was making like a jackrabbit against the Arizona
Cardinals, darting through the briar patch for 40 yards. Even
rushing for two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   There were plenty of locker-room jokes and chuckles. The Chan
Gailey Era was being ushered in with a new high-tech offensive
weapon, a 31-year-old quarterback with wheels you used to think
belonged up on milk crates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slash,'' they called Troy Aikman after he went in twice for
scores. ``Flash,'' they called him for the way he looked like a
jumbo jet rolling down the runway as he beat the Cardinals
defenders to the outside on one particularly surprising takeoff
into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Aikman can add a new nickname to his collection. Call him
``Crash.''
</P>
<P>
   That's ``Crash'' for the way he turned upfield on a scramble
early in the second quarter in an attempt to squeeze by linebacker
Bill Romanowski and gain an extra two yards.
</P>
<P>
   That's ``Crash'' in the way he slammed hard into the Mile High
Stadium turf, was hit by defensive end Marvin Washington and
suffered a broken collarbone.
</P>
<P>
   With the prognosis Aikman will be sidelined four to eight weeks,
that also might be the sound that describes the Cowboys' season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crash.'' As in the recent Dow Jones averages. Suddenly, it's a
bear market for the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing to lose to the defending Super Bowl champions.
But it's an entirely different thing to have your defense torched
42-23 and lose the cog to your offense on the same afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what people are going to say, that I did a lot of
running last week and the idea of having me out there is too
risky,'' Aikman said. ``But this wasn't a designed play. It was a
scramble. I saw Romanowski, and I thought I could get an angle on
him for a couple of extra yards. Then I got hurt. It was one of
those freakish things that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Freakish, maybe. But unnecessary and unthinking from a 10-year
veteran who knows what is at stake.
</P>
<P>
   You can understand it and not excuse it at the same time. On the
other side of the field, after 16 years in the NFL, the Broncos'
John Elway has it in his head to take on a linebacker from time to
time. The image from the Super Bowl, when Elway was smashed and
spun around by the Packers, stays in your mind. In Denver's opener
against New England, Elway took off and ran five times. On one
occasion, he had his bell rung louder than a fire alarm.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think I'm going to stop doing that, you're crazy,''
Elway said. ``That's the way I play the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is the same macho response Aikman offered up after the
game, while standing there with his left arm in a sling.
</P>
<P>
   The difference in the two quarterbacks is not only Elway's
better speed and mobility but that he is not, like Aikman, the
poster boy for NFL head injuries. Aikman has had more concussions
than Rush Limbaugh has chins, and every time he decides to
challenge a defender he risks his career. Not to mention crippling
the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the offense falls into the hands of Jason Garrett, a nice
Ivy League boy from Princeton with six years as an understudy on
his rsum. He also has a throwing arm that, compared to Aikman's, is
a popgun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Due to his arm strength, there are probably some things that
we won't be able to do with Jason,'' Gailey said. ``But we are
going to ask him to do a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey has to ask for a lot out of his quarterback and his
offense, because his defense has more holes than the one coming out
of the White House. The Broncos scored five touchdowns on their
first five possessions of the first half. Elway completed 16 of 22
passes for 268 yards and two touchdowns. Terrell Davis carried the
ball 23 times for 191 yards and three TDs, including runs of 63 and
59 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody but Sammy Sosa scored against the Cowboys in the first
half.
</P>
<P>
   Which is not so surprising, considering Dallas gets no defensive
pressure from its front seven and had Darren Woodson, Kevin Smith
and Omar Stoutmire roaming around the secondary looking like Moe,
Larry and Shemp. (Please, don't insult Curly.)
</P>
<P>
   If the Cowboys had any hope this season, it was to outscore
their opponents. Now, they must do that without their triggerman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a violent game, and there are a lot of big hits,'' Aikman
said with a shrug. ``I believe the league has done all that it can
to prevent the quarterback position from getting hurt too bad.''
</P>
<P>
   After all these years, Crash Aikman can't say the same.

NFL QBS ON BOUNTY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Streams of unconsciousness while wishing NFL teams would go deep
as often as Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire:
</P>
<P>
   I can see the NFL's future as clearly as Ken Starr can see
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   I see an epidemic of biblical proportions as quarterbacks fall
faster than the Dow. The Big Picture in the NFL is an X-ray. On any
given Sunday, a quarterback's career may come to an end.
</P>
<P>
   For those counting at home, 10 NFL teams have already had to
change quarterbacks because of injuries in two weeks of plays.
That's 33 percent of the teams in the league with an eighth of the
season in the books.
</P>
<P>
   George Blanda and Vince Evans, wherever you are, please suit up.
</P>
<P>
   At this rate of attrition, it is very easy to predict the first
seven picks in the 1999 NFL draft. They will be, in alphabetical
order, Michael Bishop, Tim Couch, Daunte Culpepper, Brock Huard,
Donovan McNabb, Cade McNown and Tim Rattay. The next Big Thing in
sports will be prep All-American quarterbacks skipping college so
they can play in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL, of course, is not a pee wee football league that thinks
safety first. These are well-grown young men playing a physical,
intense game, and its audience does not care to watch flag
football. Insisting the league step in between its quarterbacks and
Warren Sapp is the quickest path to wimp-dom.
</P>
<P>
   But the injury rate does nothing for the growth of the game.
Troy Aikman (fractured collarbone), Brad Johnson (leg) and John
Elway (hamstring) left games Sunday, a week after seven starters
were KO'd from games. It would be a mighty shame if your favorite
team's season swung on the strength of its backup quarterbacks. ...
</P>
<P>
   That's where a few teams are already at. The new Redskins
starter is Trent Green. The Cowboys will start Jason Garrett with
Aikman out for a month or two. Rich Gannon (K.C.), Eric Zeier
(Baltimore) and Danny Wuerffel (New Orleans) are starting now while
the regulars heal.
</P>
<P>
   It's not like the league is flush with 30 good starters, either.
Four starters, all future Hall of Famers, are nearing retirement
age: Warren Moon (41), Elway (38), Dan Marino (37 Tuesday) and
Steve Young (37 in October). Two others, Peyton Manning and Ryan
Leaf, are rookies.
</P>
<P>
   The next tier would be a five-pack of quality starters: Aikman,
Johnson, Drew Bledsoe, Mark Brunell and Brett Favre. They're
followed by a group that still has more promise than performance:
Kordell Stewart, Steve McNair and Rob Johnson. The Jets (Glenn
Foley, 3 interceptions Sunday) and Cardinals (Jake Plummer) hope
their quarterbacks rise to that level.
</P>
<P>
   If they do not, they'll join Jeff George, Chris Chandler, Jim
Harbaugh and Neil O'Donnell as guys good enough to start but not
good enough to win much. Or worse, they'll become the Lions' Scott
Mitchell (15-for-31 and an OT pick returned for a TD) and the Rams'
Tony Banks (four picks), fellows who may soon be demoted.
</P>
<P>
   And for who? Look at the ages of some backups Steve DeBerg (44,
Falcons), Dave Krieg (39, Oilers), Jeff Hostetler (38, Redskins),
Frank Reich (36, Lions), Doug Flutie (35, Bills), Randall
Cunningham (35, Vikes), Steve Beuerlein (33, Panthers) and Rodney
Peete (32, Eagles).
</P>
<P>
   And look at the others, who don't even have age on their side:
Kelly Holcomb (Colts), Jamie Martin (Jags), Scott Zolak (Pats),
Steve Stenstrom (Bears), Rick Mirer (Packers), Kent Graham
(Giants), Steve Bono (Rams), Ty Detmer (49ers) and Steve Walsh
(Bucs). No wonder Vinny Testaverde (Jets) and Mike Tomczak
(Steelers) are still on a roster. ...
</P>
<P>
   With this dearth, it's a wonder NFL coaches haven't junked their
playbook and West Coast offenses and adopted the old single wing or
wishbone.
</P>
<P>
   Some have, sort of. Brunell threw only 18 passes Sunday in the
Jags' win. The Saints (Mike Ditka) and Jets (Bill Parcells) worked
overtime this offseason to upgrade their running game. Denver
finally won a Super Bowl last year when Terrell Davis emerged as a
complement for Elway.
</P>
<P>
   And look at the Fish. Jimmy Johnson is having his way in Miami
with a ground-oriented attack. Dan Marino has attempted just 50
passes in two games. Miami is 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best way to protect your quarterback is not to use
him. ...
</P>
<P>
   Here's one example why college football is so enjoyable. Seven
of the top eight teams in the new AP poll won games Saturday by
margins of 18, 21, 32, 36, 45, 49 and 67. Yet despite those
whackings, there were also major upsets of Florida State, Michigan,
Notre Dame and Arizona State. ...
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State, the co-favorite in the Pac-10 race, is now 0-2.
So much for the Sun Devils hosting the national title game. But
this doesn't mean the Pac-10 is having a down year.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Washington looks strong, Arizona and Oregon are much
better than their preseason status indicated, and USC, Cal and
Oregon State seem improved, too. Everyone thought UCLA's
Washington-USC parlay in November would be its their
</P>
<P>
   challenge, but now it may be the back-to-back Arizona-Oregon
games in October. ...
</P>
<P>
   UCLA and Bob Toledo very likely will have to hire a new
offensive coordinator next season, because Al Borges is very likely
to receive offers to be a college head coach or NFL coordinator
next season.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' offense may be the smoothest drive in the nation. It
is both balanced and innovative, and so much more exciting and
sophisticated than the West Coast offense.
</P>
<P>
   That offense is special when you have players like Steve Young
and Jerry Rice. But it has been adopted and co-opted to the point
where it has become a boring cliche. ...
</P>
<P>
   R. Jay Soward's night against San Diego State shows that this
town is plenty big enough for two good teams as opposed to, say the
Rams and Raiders.

UPBEAT DUCKS OPEN CAMP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ After a summer of front-office discontent, the Mighty
Ducks finally turned their attention to the ice Sunday when
training camp opened at Disney Ice.
</P>
<P>
   Former Chicago coach Craig Hartsburg put his new team through
its paces as new president and general manager Pierre Gauthier and
former GM Jack Ferreira, among others, looked on.
</P>
<P>
   Coming off a year that goalie Guy Hebert called ``a disaster,''
the Ducks are already one step ahead of the game when compared to
last year at this time _ both Paul Kariya and Teemu Selanne are in
camp from day one.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time we will be starting the season
together. I think it's really important, and really a good sign,''
said Selanne, who tied the league lead in goals (52) even though
Kariya missed 60 games due to a contract dispute and a
season-ending concussion.
</P>
<P>
   Kariya, who missed training camp in 1996 due to an abdominal
injury and was a no-show in '97 when he and the Ducks couldn't
agree on a contract, looked sharp in the opening workout and
admitted a full camp certainly won't hurt him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last two times (after missing camp) it took me a while to
get going,'' said Kariya, who scored 17 goals and 31 points in 22
games last year. ``If you've had a full camp you are ready to go in
the first game. It (camp) isn't life or death, but obviously
helps.''
</P>
<P>
   While Kariya and Selanne will provide plenty of offense for the
Ducks, Hartsburg is making defense a priority. And he started
drilling that point home Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal from day one is to improve defensively,'' explained
Hartsburg, who added the Ducks will work especially hard on their
defense in the first three days of workouts. ``Defense is a
commitment thing. You can teach X's and O's, but you can't play
defense without commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, only Vancouver (273) and Tampa Bay (269) allowed more
goals than Anaheim (261).
</P>
<P>
   The opening of camp also marked the return of original Duck Stu
Grimson and defenseman Milos Holan. Holan is attempting to make a
return to hockey, nearly three years after he was diagnosed with
leukemia.
</P>
<P>
   The only significant no-show Sunday was defenseman Fredrik
Olausson, who was found to have an enlarged spleen during his
physical Saturday. He was scheduled to see a specialist today.

TOP 10 TRIO BOTTOMS OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ So much for preseason predictions. Michigan, Florida
State, and Arizona State were all in the Top 10 two weeks ago, each
believing it had a real chance to contend for the national
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Now they're all gone. Arizona State and Michigan, with 0-2
starts, are history. They're not only out of the Top 10, they're
out of the Top 25. Florida State still can recover, but the
Seminoles' 24-7 loss to North Carolina State Saturday was a
stunner, not so much because FSU lost _ Bobby Bowden's team always
seem to stumble at least once a season _ but because it clearly was
no fluke.
</P>
<P>
   The Wolfpack gave Florida State all it could handle last year in
Tallahassee before getting outscored, 48-35.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I'm pretty stunned,'' said Bowden, who knows his team
has no margin for error if it hopes to make it to Tempe, Ariz., for
the national championship game in the Fiesta Bowl Jan. 4. ``To get
beat like that, I'm very surprised how we fell apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Falling apart doesn't begin to describe what is happening at
Michigan and Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   After losses to Notre Dame and Syracuse, Michigan is 0-2 for the
first time since 1988, the second time since 1959. The only thing
the Wolverines have going for them is the incentive to upset No.
1-ranked Ohio State in Columbus Nov. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State is an enigma. The Sun Devils lost a heartbreaker
at home against Washington in their opener last week. A letdown was
inevitable. But Saturday night, in a 26-6 loss to Brigham Young,
ASU stunk.
</P>
<P>
   ``They outplayed us,'' said Arizona State coach Bruce Snyder.
``We do need to play a lot better, but I believe in this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is good, since right now no one else does.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This week's Give Me a Break Award goes to Kansas State coach
 &UR; Bill Snyder &LR; . Kansas State was leading mighty Northern Illinois,
56-7, with two seconds left in the first half. What did Snyder do?
He sent All-American  &UR; Martin Gramatica  &LR; in to kick a school-record
65-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   To make things worse, Snyder kept in first-string quarterback
 &UR; Michael Bishop  &LR; in the third quarter, and Bishop capped a scoring
drive by throwing a 27-yard pass that made it 66-7.
</P>
<P>
   Northern Illinois has lost its last 20 games.
</P>
<P>
   Contrast this with the class shown by Boston College coach  &UR; Tom
O'Brien &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who in the waning moments of Saturday's 41-14 win over
Rutgers chose to run the ball instead of pass it, even on a third
and 12 from the BC 37.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Florida State quarterback  &UR; Chris Weinke  &LR; is in the Seminoles'
record book only two games into his career as a starter. He threw a
record six interceptions in the loss to North Carolina State ...
When is Prairie View going to catch a break? It had an 8-point
halftime lead against Division 3 Howard Payne Saturday. Final
score? 22-14, Howard Payne. Prairie View's NCAA-record losing
streak is now 79. ``It was a situation we've never been in
before,'' Prairie View coach  &UR; Glen Johnson &LR;  said of the lead. ``And
the kids didn't really know how to respond.'' Prairie View has not
won since Oct. 28, 1989.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Give credit to Notre Dame coach  &UR; Bob Davie  &LR; for candor if
nothing else. Following Notre Dame's 45-23 loss to Michigan State,
Davie had no excuses. ``I'm embarrassed, this football team's
embarrassed,'' said Davie, who watched his team fall behind, 42-3,
at the half ... While Notre Dame was down, Illinois was
celebrating. The Illini snapped an 18-game losing streak by beating
Middle Tennessee, 48-20. However, the longest losing streak in
Division 1-A still belongs to a team from Illinois: Northern
Illinois ... Best Name of the Week: Oregon running back  &UR; Herman
Ho-Ching &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who had 117 yards on 13 carries to lead the Ducks to a
33-26 win over Texas-El Paso ... Oregon and Oregon State are a
combined 0-4, and Michigan, Notre Dame, and Arizona State a
combined 1-5 ... Heisman Trophy contenders are putting up some
strong early numbers. Central Florida, a team still looking for a
league, improved to 2-0 as  &UR; Daunte Culpepper  &LR; completed 28 of 33
passes for 406 yards and four touchdowns and ran for three more in
a 48-0 win over Division 1-AA Eastern Illinois. Let's see how
Culpepper does this week, when he meets Purdue in West Lafayette,
Ind. Kentucky's  &UR; Tim Couch  &LR; threw for 372 yards and five TDs in a
52-7 win over Division 1-AA Eastern Kentucky. Kentucky has the No.
1 offense in the nation, while Central Florida is No. 4.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time to start our weekly look at poll glitches. Let's start with
the writer's poll. Michigan and Arizona State are 0-2 and still got
Top 25 votes. If losing games _ and losing them badly _ is a
criterion, maybe Prairie View should get votes next week. And in
the coaches' poll, Notre Dame is ranked 25th, while Michigan State
received only 6 points. And, of course, there's North Carolina
State, with a 2-0 record and a solid win over 1-1 Florida State.
This week's poll: FSU No. 11, N.C. State No. 24. What people seem
to forget is that it's a weekly poll, and the rankings should
reflect that. Is North Carolina State a better team than Florida
State? Probably not. But Saturday it was, and with a better record,
its ranking should reflect that ... Other than Rutgers and Temple,
who clearly are hopeless, the Big East is having a great season.
Boston College, Miami, West Virginia, Virginia Tech, and Syracuse
are all worthy of Top 25 consideration.

BC (2-0) IS JUST GETTING STARTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Two down, two to go.
</P>
<P>
   After winning its first two games of the season, scoring 41
points in each victory, Boston College is halfway to a 4-0
September. The Eagles drew one step closer to that goal by scoring
a 41-14 conference victory over Rutgers Saturday at Alumni Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles, though still unranked, continued to better their
showing in the polls, garnering 28 points in the USA Today/ESPN
coaches' poll and 25 in the Associated Press Top 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I look at it, winning is a lot better than losing,''
said senior left guard Doug Brzezinski. ``It's a lot better than
the previous situations we've been in. Hey, right now we're 2-0 and
it's a lot better than being 0-2.''
</P>
<P>
   BC's start, its best since a 7-0-1 beginning in 1992, certainly
is a vast improvement over a year ago, when the Eagles stumbled out
of the blocks, sustaining a 28-21 loss at Temple in Tom O'Brien's
debut as BC coach.
</P>
<P>
   BC next hosts Temple, which will arrive at Chestnut Hill
Saturday for its conference opener with an 0-2 record. After
dropping their season opener at Toledo, 24-12, the Owls bowed to
another Mid-American Conference opponent, Akron, 35-28. But no one
on BC's roster is deceived by Temple's struggles. They all remember
last year's upset in Philly.
</P>
<P>
   ``This week is payback,'' said junior free safety Pedro Cirino,
who must prepare to face an option-oriented Temple offense that
ranks fourth in the nation in rushing, with 298.5 yards per game.
``Option football is so assignment-oriented; it's going to be a
challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite several lapses _ one that led to a 56-yard TD pass from
Mike McMahon to Bill Powell for a 7-0 lead; and another that
resulted in a 54-yard catch by Andy Holland on a third-and-8 _ BC's
defense held Rutgers to 271 yards of total offense, 53 rushing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we take each game at a time,'' said junior nose guard
Chris Hovan, who was credited with seven tackles and a pair of
sacks for 20 yards in losses. ``We gave up 31 points (in Week 1),
but if we gave up 7 last week and 31 this week, then we're not
getting better. We're making strides to make this a better defense.
As long as we're taking steps forward and not backward, then this
defense is going to be really good.''
</P>
<P>
   For the second consecutive week, after its 41-31 season-opening
triumph at Georgia Tech, BC generated 41 points from a balanced
attack that produced 486 yards of total offense. But when Rutgers
cut BC's lead to 20-14 on a 28-yard interception return by Reggie
Stephens, the Eagles responded with a seven-play, 80-yard scoring
march.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to play up and down and think we can turn it
on,'' O'Brien said. ``I want us to play consistent all the time and
keep working to get better. I don't like this, just turning it on,
because someday when you try to turn it on it ain't going to be
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the drive was, as senior quarterback Scott Mutryn said,
``a telling moment for the team,'' because it sparked a decisive
21-point eruption.
</P>
<P>
   Senior running back Mike Cloud, who had 201 all-purpose yards
(156 rushing, 45 receiving), capped the drive with a 6-yard swan
dive that gave BC a 27-14 lead with 52 seconds left in the third.
Cloud gained 73 yards on the drive, including 67 on the first four
plays: a 1-yard carry, an 18-yard catch, and back-to-back runs of
25 and 23 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we do anything special,'' said Cloud. ``We go
into every game thinking we can play smash-mouth football. We're
going to bring the run and open it up for Scotty to throw some
passes. I think we prepare the same for each team.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Mutryn, ``When the chips were down and we needed to make a
play, we got our composure and we started making plays. There's
just a confidence that the guy next to you is going to be doing his
job and you can count on him from the first snap to the last
whistle. And when you have that kind of confidence in one another,
good things are going to happen.''

HEINZE BACK IN BRUINS' FOLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, Mass. _ The Bruins Sunday practiced as a team for
the first time this preseason at the Ristuccia Center with only one
of their five Group 2 free agents in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   Forward Steve Heinze agreed to terms on a two-year deal and
joined his mates for the afternoon scrimmage. The situation before
he settled his contract was a bit chaotic.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a miscommunication,'' said Heinze, who signed a pact
that is believed to be worth about $1 million a year. Heinze said
his agent, Steve Mountain, ``agreed to recommend the contract to me
on Friday. He came to me and said, `I think you should take it.' I
said, `Let me think about it.' We had until midnight Saturday.
Steve left (president/general manager) Harry Sinden a message
Saturday night, but he never got it. I came to camp and he didn't
know I had taken it. Sometimes the telephone doesn't work so well.
But it's all agreed to now.''
</P>
<P>
   Free agents Jason Allison, Anson Carter, and Kyle McLaren
remained out of camp. The sides are worlds apart in those
negotiations. Ted Donato is home, too, but not because of money. He
is hoping to be traded.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins are banking on the 28-year-old Heinze, who had 26
goals in 61 games last season, to provide some scoring punch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need his goals,'' said Sinden. ``He plays hard. He can play
either side and the fact he can play left wing is pretty important
to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden said confidence is a key issue with Heinze. At times, he
hasn't had enough of it, but Sinden said he thinks the player has
overcome that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not so much the last couple of years, but he's kind of been
his own worst enemy,'' said Sinden. ``He gets down on himself when
things aren't going well and I think it gets worse for him and
that's why he goes into those slumps. As he gets a little older,
you don't notice it as much.''
</P>
<P>
   Heinze has had streaky periods in his career. However, the most
substantial obstacles for him the past two seasons have been
injuries. He had 17 goals in his first 30 games in 1996-97 but then
missed the rest of the season because of abdominal and knee
injuries. Last year he missed seven games with a right ankle sprain
and another 14 with a broken left foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to play 80 games and stay consistent for those 80
games,'' said Heinze of 1998-99. ``By doing that, I'm pretty
confident I'll put up some good numbers. My goal going in is
definitely consistency and health.''
</P>
<P>
   In seasons in which the coach has used Heinze in more defensive
roles, he has been healthy. When he's shown offensive flourish,
he's gotten hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``A full year of being relied on, being on the power play, being
on the top two or three lines, that would be great,'' he said.
``That in itself would be a career year for me. The numbers would
probably follow.''
</P>
<P>
   Heinze is relieved, too, that with a two-year deal he won't have
to spend next summer haggling over a contract, which he's had to do
the last few years. He has other plans. He is scheduled to be
married next offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``The contract has a little security in it which is something I
haven't had for a while,'' he said. ``I think I'll enjoy next
summer a lot more.''

ETCHELLS WORLD A DREAM FOR CANADIANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARBLEHEAD, Mass. _ The names of sailors near the front of the
103-boat fleet were familiar. Star-quality stuff: Dennis Conner,
Dave Curtis, Russell Coutts ... By anyone's standard, a dream
regatta.
</P>
<P>
   But when the gun fired to end Day 1 of the Etchells World
Championships, being raced here this week, it was a lesser-known
Canadian team of Dirk Kneulman, Paul Sustronk, and Allan Harvey who
placed first in the largest and most talented Etchells fleet ever
assembled on a world class race course.
</P>
<P>
   Playing wind shifts to perfection and keeping their air clear in
the huge fleet, the Canadians finished the first leg in the top
five, poured on the coal to take the lead halfway up the second
beat, and then extended to a 40-second lead at the fourth leg, a
run to the leeward mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a fleet this big, you never feel comfortable with a lead,''
said Kneulman, who comes from Oakland, Ontario, and is racing in
his seventh Etchells worlds.
</P>
<P>
   A strong wind had built up big, lumpy seas by the time the fleet
got a start around 1 p.m. And while the seas flattened out later,
the wind held fairly steady until the end of the 10-mile race.
After a general recall in the first start, only four boats were
over 10 minutes later, and the fleet tacked off to the east toward
the windward mark.
</P>
<P>
   In second place was the Chicago team of Ben Atlman and Scheiber
Mahon, who managed to nose Conner into third place, a spot he does
not mind at this point in the regatta. Said Conner, winner of three
of four of the Etchells worlds he has raced, and famed for his
America's Cup exploits, ``If you could take five thirds in this
regatta, you'd win it by 40 points.''
</P>
<P>
   Conner was referring to the talent-laden field, and a fleet so
huge that the start line stretches for three-quarters of a mile and
needs three boats to officiate the start.
</P>
<P>
   Conner said he was ``on a racing holiday'' from his preparation
for the America's Cup next year in Auckland, New Zealand. Defending
Cup champion Coutts placed sixth, about half a minute off Conner's
pace.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the best performances in the closing legs of the race
came from Marblehead's Curtis, a repeat world champion in several
classes, and the sailor many in this regatta regard one of the
heavy favorites.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis, who finished just behind the fourth-place team of Carl
Anderson and Moffet Thorpe, from Buzzards Bay, appeared to have
fallen out of the top 10 before putting together a strong finishing
leg to place fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the Eastern Yacht Club after his first race of six,
Conner summed up his view of the competition. ``If you can beat
Dave Curtis,'' he said, ``you can win this regatta.''

ZENGA PROVIDES ZIP FOR REVOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The Revolution lost a significant part of
their playoff hopes during the weekend, but they took steps toward
gaining something more important.
</P>
<P>
   They defeated Columbus, 2-0, Saturday night but remained 6
points behind Miami for the final playoff place in the Eastern
Conference after the Fusion edged D.C. United, 4-3, Sunday. Miami
can clinch a playoff berth with one victory in its final three
matches.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Revolution fail to qualify for the playoffs for the
second time in Major League Soccer's three-year history, they seem
to have discovered a coach/lucky charm in Walter Zenga.
</P>
<P>
   How important has Zenga been to the Revolution? In three years,
they are 15-44-8 without him and 13-9-4 with him as either coach or
player. Next year, Zenga hopes to become the Revolution's
player-coach, which should guarantee at least some success for the
team.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Zenga has displayed a winning touch as a coach. He has
reorganized the team's defense, leading to successive 2-0 victories
over the Metro-Stars and Crew, the Revolution's first back-to-back
shutouts ever. He has made effective, timely substitutions. And he
has added intangible qualities and eliminated some of the pressure
from the players.
</P>
<P>
   Zenga is still in the process of making the transition from the
playing field, but he seems comfortable in the role of authority.
It has been a quick process, starting with the Aug. 22 proposal
that he take over from Thomas Rongen to the 3-2 loss at Miami in
his first game eight days later. In that game, in the South Florida
sun, Zenga seemed more like a player, wearing shorts and a backward
baseball cap. By his third game, he had changed to a dark blue
suit, but kept the cap on backward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walter is flamboyant and unorthodox,'' general manager Brian
O'Donovan said Sunday. ``But there is no question who is charge of
this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Zenga's flexibility, lankiness, and reactions made him appear to
be a born goalkeeper. But though Zenga sometimes seems an anomaly
as an authority figure, he is also a born leader who is comfortable
instructing players and managing a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is giving us a model for professionalism,'' O'Donovan said.
``Players have to play as a team, and he will not accept anything
less. Everyone knows they are on equal footing. If players are
discontent, he himself has been in that situation and he
understands both sides. It's an epiphany for him to be in charge
and making decisions. He sees himself in the players, in the best-
and the worst-case scenarios.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution have regained credibility, a crucial quality
especially with a 35,462 crowd Saturday and another nearly 50,000
expected for the final two regular-season games, against Tampa Bay
next Saturday and the MetroStars Sept. 26. Hope for the future has
been regained.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should not go overboard one way or the other,'' O'Donovan
said. ``Walter is a very strong personality on a team that has
struggled with its personality without him. We have found our
personality directly through Walter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since Walter decided to retire in December, he started seeing
his future and realized his mistake, and now he is really drawn to
the project that is American soccer, and that part of his soul has
been planted here.''

RED SOX WOES A PRESSING ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``Going on the road may be good for us, you know?'' _ &UR;  &LR; Mo
Vaughn &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We know, Mo. Everyone knows.
</P>
<P>
   You can gauge what kind of afternoon it was Sunday at Fenway
Park when the feel-good events du jour in the Boston clubhouse were
the announcement of a contract extension for Bret Saberhagen and
the distribution of meal money for the week.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox had lost, again, to the, ahem, Tigers, the supposed
September panacea for the struggling team. The Red Sox are now just
three games up on Toronto in the wild-card race and are on the road
this week with games in New York, Baltimore, and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   They will be away from newspapers (unless they're online kinda
guys) and talk radio and the fatalist, Calvinist essence of most
every Red Sox fan. By the time they return, the wild-card race
could be moot or, well, you know.
</P>
<P>
   Jimy Williams, the ever-optimistic manager, already is tired of
all the negative what-ifs. He made several not-so-subtle jabs at
the inevitable reaction to the team's latest misfortune, a 4-1
loss. He's been here less than two years _ this is his first
experience when the team is a playoff threat _ and he's already got
a pretty good read on the vox populi.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not you people,'' he said, unconvincingly, to reporters.
``We all want the same thing, the same goal. We're after the same
thing. It's a mutual admiration society.'' He smiled, the sort of
smile you might see from an IRS agent during an audit.
</P>
<P>
   Any pressure, skip?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not with us. We're basically in the same place we were a week
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Did he sense any uneasiness among the faithful?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got 20-20 hearing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox have lost eight of their last 10 games, including
the last two of this weekend series to the horrible Tigers. They
struggled against a pitching staff not to be confused with the 1954
Indians or the 1971 Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still in a good position,'' offered Steve Avery, who
took a no-hitter into the fifth, a shutout into the sixth, and a
shower after getting the hook in the seventh. ``I'd be nervous if I
was a fan. But as long as we're in this situation, we don't have to
worry. The only time we have to worry is if we get behind
(Toronto/-Texas), and I don't think that's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Even using today's trendy whole math, where there is no answer
book, the Red Sox are still in pretty good shape. They have 15
games remaining, seven against the White Sox and Devil Rays.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents and venues never seem to matter in situations like
these. Who could have imagined scuffling in the last two games
against the Tigers? Who could have envisioned Vaughn, Nomar
Garciaparra, and Troy O'Leary all striking out in the ninth? (The
Sox also had three strikeouts in the eighth and one in the seventh,
10 overall.)
</P>
<P>
   Avery said he thinks the Red Sox might be pressing, but he added
that most teams do under similar circumstances. ``There's always a
difference in September,'' he said. ``But Jimy has been through
this and he's the one we feed off. He doesn't panic. We don't
panic.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thought the team was right, Vaughn snorted, ``I
would hope not.'' He added, ``You gotta want to be here. It's when
you lose that gets everyone excited. It's a big panic now. But no
one cared when we were winning earlier in the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn knows better than most about all the inherent angst that
will continue to bubble until the season ends. He still likes the
team's position and its chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still in the lead and that's the way you have to look at
it,'' he said. ``There's no time for frustration, pressing, getting
down, none of that. It's not how many games you get in by. It's
getting in there that matters.''

CLARK HR SENDS RED SOX ON ROAD FOR REFUGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Let's face it, the Red Sox need to get out of town.
Watching a wild-card contender self-destruct at Fenway Park hasn't
been fun.
</P>
<P>
   Fenway certainly wasn't a very happy place Sunday in the wake of
a 4-1 loss to the Detroit Tigers that put the Olde Towne Team on
its heels again and a crowd of 31,255 into a blue funk. The Blue
Jays are within three games in the wild-card race. Boston's next
seven games are on the road, starting Monday night against the
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox lost four of six games at home and have lost eight of
their last 10. The lowly Tigers won two straight after losing on
Friday, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing hard,'' said manager Jimy Williams. ``We're
pitching good. We haven't been scoring a lot of runs lately. But we
don't accept losing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get the kind of pitching we've gotten in the last few
days, we're going to win a lot of games. We didn't get this far by
just going out there. We've competed all year long. We're not going
to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers won for the second straight time with a late home
run. Saturday, the Sox lost, 3-2, on a two-run ninth-inning blast
by Joe Randa. Sunday Tony Clark hit a three-run shot off reliever
Greg Swindell to break a 1-1 tie in the eighth. All three runs were
unearned because of shortstop Nomar Garciaparra's 24th error of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Is the party over?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really,'' said first baseman Mo Vaughn. ``This is no time
for frustration. This is no time for pressing. I don't understand
why everybody is getting excited. We're still in first place in the
wild-card race. We've still got an opportunity to do some things.
We have just got to put some wins together. That's the bottom
line.''
</P>
<P>
   If you went by the number of grim faces and tough questions
being asked these days, you'd certainly think the Sox were on the
ropes. The confidence of two weeks ago is missing. The hitting is
off. Boston has scored only three runs in the last 20 innings. The
pitching is just good enough to get beaten. Not a good sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing to come home and play the way we did,''
said starter Steve Avery, who worked six innings and gave up one
earned run. ``I don't like the fact that we lost four of six after
playing so well all year here. We definitely have to pick it up.
We're not going to be able to back into the playoffs. We have to go
in with some wins.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox started the day with 83 wins. One would think 90 wins is
attainable, and would be good enough for any wild-card team. But it
won't be if Toronto doesn't stop winning. Given the history of
Boston teams, this is a feeling Red Sox fans know too well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to just go out and play,'' said Vaughn. ``Don't try to
do too much. Don't force it. Do it pitch by pitch, at-bat by
at-bat. The game hasn't changed since the time we were playing
well. It's just one of those things that happens, and we've got to
go about it as professionals.''
</P>
<P>
   With one out in the eighth, Garciaparra muffed a routine
grounder by Brian Hunter. Bobby Higginson struck out for what would
have been the third out. But Juan Encarnacion singled to center and
Clark followed with his 32d home run of the year, which cleared the
left-field screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't much to it,'' said Swindell, who blamed himself
rather than Garciaparra. ``One changeup, right into his swing. He
got it. This game is hard and we're all struggling right now. The
team has been through it before. We have to dig down deep and keep
playing. Every game means something. It's time to dig down deep and
see what you got.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for home cooking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to go on the road and get untracked,'' said
Williams. ``Slump? I don't feel it in the clubhouse. We're putting
some good at-bats up there. We're just not getting hits.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, said Avery, it comes down to having a little luck.
``We need to get a break here and there and try to get the momentum
going the other way,'' he said. ``We're pressing a little. But
those other teams are pressing, too. I think we just need to relax
and have some fun out there.''

OPEN TRIUMPH A WALTZ FOR AUSSIE 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Waltzing Matilda,'' the Australian national anthem,
came out of Queensland, and so did Patrick Michael Rafter, the
Australian national hero _ waltzing his way to the US Open title
and taking it Down Under once more.
</P>
<P>
   What a dancing master Rafter was _ an Astaire in sneakers _
cakewalking blithely across Arthur's Gulch, the year-old stadium at
Flushing Meadow, to extend his lease on the massive tennis palace
named for the champ of 30 years ago, Arthur Ashe. It takes two to
tangle on a court, and the party of the second part, hulking Mark
Philippoussis, just couldn't keep up as Rafter led, and kept
swirling them faster and faster, 6-3, 3-6, 6-2, 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   But 21-year-old Philippoussis, in his major final debut, is an
Aussie, too, and you wondered, sitting there among the sun-draped
mob of 21,447, if a new Down Undertaking plague has been launched.
Sitting there, too, with patriotic smiles on their weathered faces,
were Ken Rosewall and Tony Roche, the champ and runner-up 28 years
ago, the last all-Aussie title-round party of 10 that had concluded
US Championships over 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we may be back in business,'' grinned Australian Davis
Cup captain John Newcombe, the last pre-Rafter US Open champ from
their neighborhood in 1973. ``When we dominated, the tournament was
on grass. It's been hard courts here since 1978, and Patrick and
Mark are real breakthroughs for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Queensland, the huge but lightly populated northeast state, has
produced far more than its share of US Open champs: Mal Anderson,
Roy Emerson (whom Pete Sampras continues to stalk), Rod Laver, and
now Rafter, cutting up seven titles among them.
</P>
<P>
   Way out in the Outback, about a century ago in a dusty cow town
called Winton, the country's favorite poet, A.B. (Banjo) Paterson
wrote the words to ``Waltzing Matilda,'' a bush hymn that lifted
Aussie spirits through two world wars and identifies them wherever
they go. Rafter had his own stringed banjo, a racket on which for
two hours he played an ominous tune such as seldom has been heard
on a tennis court at this level.
</P>
<P>
   It was the twang of doom for the 6-foot-4-inch outsider, No. 22
Philippoussis, who found that prying points from Rafter was like
getting the US to pay its UN debt. Rafter, less charitable than
Scrooge, contributed all of five unforced errors to Philippoussis's
cause. Five of Philippoussis's 85 points was the total of his foe's
generosity. This tightness was reminiscent of John McEnroe's
offering Jimmy Connors but two unforced errors in an airtight 1984
Wimbledon final triumph.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter simply did not give at the office. But he did give his
all in beating Sampras and Philippoussis in succession, and that
``all,'' as we've seen all summer, is merely spectacular. He never
stopped pounding the pavement _ and opponents _ once the hard-court
campaign began in the US following Wimbledon: four titles in six
starts and a 25-2 match record, a 12-straight streak intact.
</P>
<P>
   Over the same stretch Sampras entered four tourneys, won none,
and may have been a victim of the Queensland old boy network, the
Emerson defense force. Sampras, with 11 major titles, came in
expecting to tie Emmo's rec-ord of 12. Rafter, from the copper
mining community of Mt. Isa, made sure Sampras didn't strike gold
at the Meadow.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter and Philippoussis played the kind of in-your-face tennis
that transformed the asphalt rectangle to the grass of Wimbledon.
Serve-and-volley, mate, and let's see who wins the race to the net.
Two points _ that's all _ endured as long as seven strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter always won that race even though Philippoussis had longer
legs. As a couple of song-and-dance men, Rafter, the tenor released
``Hehhh!'' notes as he served, generally winning the duets with
Philippoussis's bass ``Wuuuuhh!''
</P>
<P>
   But it was his footwork that left young Philippoussis feeling
like a wallflower at the prom. Call it the Rafter Rhumba _ serve,
four quick steps covering 7 yards, bend, and volley. All afternoon.
Only twice did Rafter forget to charge behind his serve. ``Just
trying to mix things up,'' he said with a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know how I'd come up after Sampras. But I was even
stronger, really fit for this kind of tennis. The adrenaline was
flowing.''
</P>
<P>
   Philippoussis found himself constantly repeating the infantile
drill, trying to deal with Rafter's low, troubling returns. ``Too
many volleys at my shoelaces,'' he sighed.
</P>
<P>
   It was ``Waltzing Matilda'' time again in New York, and Matilda
could have only one love this time: Patrick Michael Rafter.

PHILIPPOUSSIS DOWN, UNDER RAFTER BLITZ 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ And then there were nine.
</P>
<P>
   A gap of nine championships in major tennis tournaments between
Patrick Rafter and Pete Sampras, that is.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter won his second straight US Open by keeping the pressure
on and finally cracking fellow Australian Mark Philippoussis, 6-3,
3-6, 6-2, 6-0, Sunday. Rafter, the No. 2 seed, earned $700,000 for
the win and Philippoussis, who was unseeded and in his first Grand
Slam final, collected $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras recently was asked the difference between his game and
Rafter's: ``Ten Grand Slams,'' joked Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   Make it nine. Rafter made sure Sampras remained stalled at 11
major singles titles _ one short of Roy Emerson's record _ when he
sent Sampras out in Saturday's semifinals after the four-time
champion had hurt his leg.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras left here saying it would take some time to see if his
rivalry with Rafter could develop into something special.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Rafter _ still with a long way to go before reaching the
Sampras level of longevity _ rallied in the third set to steal the
momentum from Philippoussis. He roared from there to his second
major title, solidifying a claim to his role as rival and
contender.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Rafter leaped into a courtside box to celebrate his
victory over Greg Rusedski. This year, partly because he was
playing a fellow Australian, partly because he had been here
before, and partly because of the way the match ended, he was a
little more subdued.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the initial feeling was not quite as exciting as
last year,'' Rafter said. ``Don't get me wrong, take nothing away
from this title, but last year I think was a little more
nerve-racking.''
</P>
<P>
   Rafter played nearly flawless tennis. He had two unforced errors
in the final two sets and five for the match to the 29 of his
countryman.
</P>
<P>
   Philippoussis had only three break points on Rafter's serve in
the match and won only one. Rafter's attacking style helped make
sure Philippoussis, often a serving machine, struggled on serve.
Philippoussis had 13 double faults in the match and only five aces.
Rafter had six aces and one double fault.
</P>
<P>
   Still, things did not look that great for Rafter in the second
set. He was down a break and Philippoussis was serving to even the
match when he got himself in a huge hole at 15-40 with three
straight double faults. But Philippoussis escaped and took the set.
</P>
<P>
   On to the third set where Philippoussis again wiggled free from
15-40. Finally, Rafter, on his fourth break point of the sixth
game, converted one. It was deuce when Rafter won the point of the
match. Philippoussis had gotten back to deuce the point before with
a nice overhead. This time, Philippoussis had another overhead and
couldn't put it away and Rafter, hustling from side to side,
punched a forehand over the net and Philippoussis netted a volley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, that was a bit disappointing,'' Philippoussis said. ``It
was a bad choice of shot for myself. You know, Pat is very quick
around the court.''
</P>
<P>
   The rout was on.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter won 22 of the next 26 points, including 12 straight, and
was on his way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started making a lot of passing shots, a lot of returns, a
lot of tough shots for him,'' Rafter said. ``Just a combination of
him losing maybe a bit of spirit, intensity, and myself making him
play very tough shots.''
</P>
<P>
   The turnaround, Rafter said, was fueled a game earlier. Ahead,
40-0, on his serve, he nearly squandered his advantage. A forehand
volley into the net got it to deuce and Rafter angrily threw his
racket to the ground. On the next point, Philippoussis hit a
forehand into the net and Rafter, at the net, let out a sigh.
Philippoussis then put a backhand into the net and Rafter clenched
his fist and went on to his big break.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, it was over.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter, whose Open title last year was only his second
championship of any kind, had taken another major step.
</P>
<P>
   And Rafter, who scrambled from two sets down just to survive a
first-round match with Hicham Arazi, was feeling pretty good about
things.
</P>
<P>
   He still has a long way to go to match the accomplishments of
Sampras, of course. But Rafter is 25, Sampras 27, and Rafter has
beaten the world's No. 1 player twice in a row. And it's quite
obvious that future winners of major championships _ at least this
major championship _ must deal with him.
</P>
<P>
   He proved something to himself, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year I feel I've consolidated,'' Rafter said. ``Maybe I
can kick on and have another great next six months whereas last
year, the last six months weren't quite as advantageous for me as
far as gaining points. I was sort of struggling, I guess, with
maybe if people respected me for what I'd done or, again, if it was
just a fluke.''

PATRIOTS WISE TO COLTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The game plan was executed.
</P>
<P>
   Make Peyton Manning, the NFL's top draft pick, shoot himself in
the foot. Take advantage of his miscues and move on to next week's
game against the Tennessee Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   Perfect.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots broke into the win column Sunday night by
flawlessly executing that game plan. They forced four Manning
turnovers and turned them into points, defeating the Indianapolis
Colts, 29-6, before a sellout crowd of 60,068 at Foxboro Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defensive line did a great job,'' said Ty Law, who picked
off two passes. Chris Canty had the other. ``They pressured Peyton
into having to throw off his back foot. When that happens, it gives
the secondary a chance to break on the ball better. I figured
Peyton had to throw the ball to my side because his favorite
target, Marvin Harrison, was my responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just took advantage of a rookie quarterback,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots improved to 1-1, winning their first divisional
game with a great defensive performance _ with a big assist to
Manning.
</P>
<P>
   Manning actually passed the ball well most of the night,
completing 21 of 33 for 188 yards. But there were two crucial Law
pickoffs, one of which the cornerback ran back 59 yards for a
score, and another that ruined the Colts' chances of scoring in the
second quarter when Law picked off a pass in the end zone. The
Canty pickoff came after the Patriots had built a comfortable lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots built a 16-0 lead at the half mostly with defense
and Manning mistakes. The New England offense finally cranked it up
in the second half, scoring two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to get up for a team like Denver on Monday night
against the champions,'' said Patriots quarterback Drew Bledsoe.
``But to come back in a short week against a team like this could
be a little dangerous. But we have the maturity now to approach a
game like this and win it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots amassed 321 yards, 218 in the air.
</P>
<P>
   One area that wasn't an artistic success for the Patriots was
the running game. It was never established, with rookie Robert
Edwards gaining 36 yards on 18 carries. Sedrick Shaw broke a
51-yarder in the fourth quarter, but Edwards was more useful in
receiving the ball _ three catches for 71 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The key for the Patriots was that they didn't turn the ball
over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been able to play keep-away with the defense,'' said
Bledsoe. ``I've been putting the ball where only our guys can catch
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense was ignited by end Willie McGinest, who set up the
first of Adam Vinatieri's three field goals, a 19-yarder in the
first quarter that came after Edwards was stuffed three times at
the 2-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Manning's arm was hit by McGinest as he attempted to throw,
forcing a loose ball that was picked up briefly by Chris Slade. He
bobbled it, but Willie Clay recovered at the 2.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later Manning underthrew receiver Marcus Pollard on
third and 3 at his 41. Law leaped for the ball, came down with it,
and proceeded 59 yards on some nifty moves to give the Patriots
their first touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   It was Law's second interception return for a touchdown, the
first coming last Dec. 8 against Bill Parcells's New York Jets.
</P>
<P>
   In the second quarter, the Colts moved the ball down the field,
but once again Manning made a rookie mistake and threw right into
the hands of Law in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   When the Patriots took over, the offense actually looked OK.
Bledsoe had his finest moment by hitting Shawn Jefferson for a
38-yard gain to the Colt 34. Jefferson made a nice move on Jeff
Burris to break to the sideline and open up enough daylight to make
the play.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe then hit Terry Glenn for a 14-yard gain. But the drive
stalled there. Bledsoe threw to goal line on third and 6 to third
tight end Mike Bartrum, but cornerback Monty Montgomery broke up
the play from behind to force the Patriots into a 23-yard field
goal by Vinatieri, making it 13-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots worked their two-minute offense fairly well after
they took over at their 10 with 1:49 remaining in the second.
Bledsoe hit Lovett Purnell for a 22-yard gain, Glenn for 12, and
Troy Brown for 15. The Patriots got to the Colt 36 before the drive
stalled and Vinatieri booted a 52-yard field goal, tying a career
high. It went over the goalpost, banged off the goalpost camera,
and came back onto the field, one of the most unusual field goals
in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   The offense finally got one in the end zone early in the third
quarter, mounting a 46-yard drive that concluded with a 3-yard pass
from Bledsoe to Glenn with Burris draped all over him. Bledsoe put
the ball low, in a spot where Burris couldn't get to it.
</P>
<P>
   The rest was garbage time. The Colts scored once, on a Manning
3-yard pass to Torrance Small. But the Patriots had this well in
hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough when you play a good team like the Patriots,'' said
Manning, who did get help from Marshall Faulk, who gained 127 yards
on 29 carries and had seven receptions for 60 yards. ``I feel I'm
making bad decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   All of them helped the Patriots.

ALL BUT ONE PROBLEM SOLVED BY PATRIOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ They did what they had to do Sunday night.
They destroyed a sacrificial lamb. Or, in this case, 53 sacrificial
Colts.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots were not in a no-win situation when they trotted
onto the field at Foxboro Stadium to meet the futile Indianapolis
Colts and they knew it. Barring a tornado or some other act of God,
they were in a win situation. The only issue then was, would they
just win or would they really win.
</P>
<P>
   The former would be good enough, since a win is a win in the NFL
these days, but that would answer none of the questions about them
that had resurfaced last Monday night in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   The latter would be better because the latter would say
something about them that needed to be said now, before questions
began to creep into their minds and those of their supporters over
just who, exactly, they are.
</P>
<P>
   By halftime the just-win half of the equation had been solved
and by early in the fourth quarter the score was 29-0, the Colts
had converted only 23 percent of their third down attempts, and any
concerns that the Patriots might suffer some sort of letdown after
the disappointment of losing in Denver seemed so silly as to be
absurd. What the Patriots needed to show Sunday night against the
lowly Colts they had shown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our team ... we know what we are,'' quarterback Drew Bledsoe
said after the 29-6 victory. ``We know we're a good football team.
We were playing a team we should beat and we beat them
convincingly. It was an affirmation of who we are. We know we're a
good team and we played like it.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Patriots succeeded in doing was to send their fans home
early, giving them a Sunday night break with a work day coming up
this morning. When they pushed the score to 29-0 with 14:21 still
to play in the fourth quarter, red tailights began to light up
Route 1, and within minutes those lights were moving slowly because
the Patriots had moved quickly to destroy the Colts.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, they took control of the game early despite the
running of Indianapolis' Marshall Faulk (127 yards). They sacked
rookie quarterback Peyton Manning, forcing him to fumble, and the
ball was recovered by Willie Clay at the 2 to set up the first of
Adam Vinatieri's three field goals just eight minutes into the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Five plays later, Ty Law made the first of his two interceptions
and returned it 59 yards for a touchdown by weaving so effectively
through his pursuers that it gave one reason to ask if maybe New
England's brain trust should try him at running back instead of the
current crew of 2.2 yards-per-carry operatives.
</P>
<P>
   Soon Law would have a second interception to set up another
field goal, and then Vinatieri would hit a third one from 52 yards
as the first half closed. And the Patriots nearly had acheived
their unstated but very real goal: to destroy an inferior opponent
and thus put the rest of the AFC on notice that just because they
can't beat the Denver Broncos doesn't mean the rest of the
conference was safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``A game like this we wanted to go out and dominate,'' Clay
said. ``We know we're a pretty good team but we had to jump out on
them.''
</P>
<P>
   They did that at two critical times, early in the first quarter
and again early in the third quarter, thus establishing who was the
boss on this night. Perhaps the most important moment came on the
first two possessions of the second half.
</P>
<P>
   First Clay's defense again slapped down Manning and the Colts,
forcing them to open the second half by going three-and-out. Then
Bledsoe's offense took over at the Colts' 46 and finally got in
gear, needing just eight plays to culminate the drive with Terry
Glenn's first touchdown catch since Nov. 2, 1997, a 3-yard
reception that made it 22-0 with 9:34 to play in the third quarter
and effectively sent the fans home for the evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're becoming a more veteran football team,'' Bledsoe said.
``We understand different types of games. It's easy to get up for
Denver. But now we have enough discipline and maturity to prepare
for a game like this and win it.''
</P>
<P>
   They won it as they should have, by making a rookie quarterback
look like a rookie quarterback and by making an average defense
look below average and by giving a young opponent with many holes
on offense and defense no reason to believe it could win.
</P>
<P>
   They choked the life out of the Colts with a defense that forced
four turnovers and then finished them off with an offense that made
none. But most of all, they played like the team they believe they
are, which is a team that concedes you nothing when you have the
ball and threatens you every time it has it.
</P>
<P>
   That may not have impressed the Broncos, watching back home in
Denver, but what it told the rest of the AFC is that these Patriots
will not be an easy team to beat this season in places other than
Mile High Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if they could just figure out how to run the ball ... well,
we'll leave that for another day.

   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Night school.
</P>
<P>
   Course: Educating a Quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Professor: Steve Sidwell.
</P>
<P>
   His daddy, Archie, told young Peyton Manning there would be
nights like Sunday night, during which all a struggling first-year
QB in the National Football League could get for a grade is an A
for effort.
</P>
<P>
   This test, the second of the semester, was just too much to
handle, the Patriots beating the Colts, 29-6.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the education of a quarterback,'' said Indianapolis
general manager Bill Polian, who decided Manning was going to be
his prize pupil when the Colts had the first pick of the NFL draft
last spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what has to happen to him,'' Polian said evenly, after
Manning struggled against the sophisticated Patriot schemes drawn
up by defensive coordinator Sidwell.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew coming into this game he would see some things he
hadn't seen before,'' said Polian. ``New England is very good on
defense. They do a lot of different things and they do them well.
He made some good plays, but he had some he wished he had back. But
this is all part of the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to see all of these things and learn from them. When he
does, then the ball will come out of his hand at the right time and
to the right person. Then he can go from there.''
</P>
<P>
   The first priority of the Colts offense Sunday night was to run
the ball, leading to the second priority, not getting Manning into
certain passing situations where the Patriots could throw a lot of
looks at him, confusing him.
</P>
<P>
   ``On his first interception (which Ty Law returned for a
touchdown), Law just made a terrific play,'' said Polian. ``He left
his coverage and got himself back into the play.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the second interception (again by Law), Manning was
confused. He pump-faked and then threw it deep. He was not supposed
to do that against the coverage the Patriots had. They gave him one
look, and then Law dropped back into the end zone in zone coverage,
and Manning threw the ball right to him. Manning should have thrown
the ball to the other side of the field.''
</P>
<P>
   The game plan was to stay away from Law. The Colts respect him
as one of the best cornerbacks in the conference. However, the
Patriots swung their double coverage toward Chris Canty, who was
burned often by John Elway in Denver last Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Manning had a dilemma. Go toward Law in man-to-man, or throw
into double coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give the Patriots credit,'' said Polian. ``They kept bringing
a safety up to the line of scrimmage, and then dropped him off.
This confused him.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for Manning's inexperience, the Colts played a solid
first half. They trailed, 16-0, but 10 of those points were
directly attributable to Manning. He fumbled deep in his own end,
when Willie McGinest beat tight end Ken Dilger to the outside with
a speed rush. McGinest hit Manning from the blind side, and he
fumbled, setting up an Adam Vinatieri field goal.
</P>
<P>
   With less than five minutes left in the first period, Manning
had a third-and-3 at his 42 when he made another critical error in
judgment. Instead of throwing short, trying to get a first down, he
looked away from Dilger in the right flat and focused on Marcus
Pollard running a crossing pattern 20 yards deep across the field
left to right. Law left Dilger and stepped in front of Pollard to
make the interception and return it 59 yards for the score.
</P>
<P>
   But Manning's most embarrassing moment was yet to come, and cost
his team more points. With a second-and-10 at the Patriots 15 in
the second period, Manning threw a pump fake toward Marvin Harrison
running a slant, then brought the ball back down and lobbed it
toward the corner of the end zone. Law, who again had dropped into
coverage, just stood there and waited for it to drop in his hands.
</P>
<P>
   Before his miserable night would end, Manning tallied four
turnovers, with three interceptions and a fumble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we did some good things,'' Manning said. ``We ran
the ball really well. I feel I'm making some bad decisions. All of
them (interceptions) were poor decisions on my part.''
</P>
<P>
   Patriot quarterback Drew Bledsoe, asked if he empathized with
Manning, said, ``I sure do. But he's going to be a very good
quarterback. This is something when you're a rookie that's going to
happen, but he'll come back and play well.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Manning finished with 21 completions in 33 attempts, but for
only 188 yards. Generally, a passer with that many completions
should end up with more than 250 yards, but most of his completions
were for less than 10 yards, as the Colts tried not to expose him
to the Patriots' rush.
</P>
<P>
   He failed this test. But there will be 14 more before the end of
the marking period, and a final grade.

GEORGE C. WALLACE, SYMBOL OF SEGREGATION, DIES AT 79
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Inserts new 2nd graf with cause and time of death)  (sw) 
 By HOWELL RAINES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Former Gov. George C. Wallace of Alabama, who built his
political career on segregation and spent a tormented retirement
arguing that he was not a racist in his heart, died Sunday night at
Jackson Hospital in Montgomery. He was 79 and lived in Montgomery,
Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace died of respiratory and cardiac arrest at 9:49 p.m.,
said Dana Beyerly, a spokeswoman for Jackson Hospital in
Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace had been in declining health since being shot in his
1972 presidential campaign by a 21-year-old drifter named Arthur
Bremer.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, a Democrat who was a longtime champion of states'
rights, dominated his own state for almost a generation. But his
wish was to be remembered as a man who might have been president
and whose campaigns for that office in 1968, 1972 and 1976
established political trends that have dominated American politics
for the last quarter of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   He believed that his underdog campaigns made it possible for two
other Southerners, Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, to be taken
seriously as presidential candidates. He also argued ceaselessly
that his theme of middle-class empowerment was borrowed by Richard
Nixon in 1968 and then grabbed by another Californian, Ronald
Reagan, as the spine of his triumphant populist conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews later in his life, Wallace was always less keen to
talk about his other major role in Southern history. After being
elected to his first term as governor in 1962, he became the foil
for the huge protests that the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. used
to destroy segregation in public accommodations in 1963 and to
secure voting rights for blacks in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   As a young man, Wallace came boiling out of the sun-stricken,
Rebel-haunted reaches of southeast Alabama to win the governorship
on his second try. He became the only Alabamian ever sworn in for
four terms as governor, winning elections in 1962, 1970, 1974 and
1982. He retired at the end of his last term in January 1987.
</P>
<P>
   So great was his sway over Alabama that by the time he had been
in office only two years, other candidates literally begged him for
permission to put his slogan, ``Stand Up for Alabama,'' on their
billboards. Sens. John Sparkman and Lister Hill, New Deal veterans
who were powers in Washington and the national Democratic Party,
feared to contradict him in public when he vowed to plunge the
state into unrelenting confrontation with the federal government
over the integration of schools, buses, restrooms and public places
in Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   It was a power built entirely on his promise to Alabama's white
voting majority to continue the historic oppression of its
disfranchised and largely impoverished black citizens. And it was
snapshots of the peak moments of Wallace's campaign of racial
oppression that burned him into the nation's consciousness as the
Deep South's most forceful political brawler since Huey Long of
Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   First, on Jan. 14, 1963, there was his inaugural address,
written by a known Ku Klux Klansman, Asa Carter. In it, Wallace
promised to protect the state's ``Anglo-Saxon people'' from
``communistic amalgamation'' with blacks and ended with the line
that would haunt his later efforts to enter the Democratic
mainstream: ``Segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation
forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace's next signature moment came on June 11, 1963, when he
mounted his ``stand in the schoolhouse door'' to block two black
students, Vivian Malone and James Hood, from enrolling at the
University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa. Within days, it was
convincingly reported that Wallace, fearing jail for defying a
federal court order, had privately promised President John Kennedy
that he would step aside if first allowed to make a defiant speech.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace's in-state critics denounced him for a ``charade'' that
embarrassed the state. But the cold splash of reality did not
dampen his plans to use Alabama as a stepping stone to the national
political arena and to the anti-Big-government speeches by which he
obsessively longed to be remembered by history.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace talked of running for president in 1964 as a
neo-Dixiecrat candidate. But he backed off when the Republican
nominee, Sen. Barry Goldwater of Arizona, came out against the bill
that later became the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Goldwater's move
undercut Wallace's trademark assertion that ``there's not a dime's
worth of difference'' between the two main parties on race.
</P>
<P>
   After the election, Wallace regretted his timidity because he
thought Goldwater had run a campaign of comical ineptitude, and
when 1968 came around, he invented a party, drafted the eccentric
retired Air Force general Curtis LeMay as his running mate, and
began draining away the lunch-pail vote from Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for his success was that Wallace always campaigned
``with the tense urgency of a squirrel,'' in the memorable
description of one biographer, Marshall Frady. Another reason was
that his message worked among disaffected whites everywhere, not
just in the South.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace's political radar had picked up signals that Rust Belt
workers and urban white ethnic Americans from Boston to Baltimore
felt grumpy about black students in their neighborhood schools and
black competitors in the workplace. He cleaned up his language, but
he used an expurgated list of demons _ liberals, Communists, the
Eastern press, federal judges, ``pointy-headed intellectuals'' _ to
tap out in code words an updated version of his fire-hardened
message from the Heart of Dixie. It was race and rage.
</P>
<P>
   This blend of color prejudice and economic grievance appealed to
enough voters to win him more than 13 percent of the popular vote
and five states in the 1968 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1972 race, he was running even stronger in the Democratic
presidential primaries. He rattled the party's establishment with a
second-place finish in Wisconsin and a rapid ascent in the polls.
He also won primaries in Maryland and Michigan on May 16, but got
the news in a hospital bed, having been shot and paralyzed on the
day before the balloting.
</P>
<P>
   The injury from Bremer's bullet became a ``thorn in my flesh,''
Wallace later said, and the truncated campaign became a thorn in
his psyche. He died believing that had he not been shot, popular
appeal would have forced the Democratic Party to put him on the
ticket in 1972 to keep Nixon from sweeping the Sun Belt and
blue-collar enclaves in the Middle West and Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace ran again in 1976. From the start, aides noticed that
the applause dwindled once crowds saw his shiny wheelchair. Wallace
noticed it, too, and in private he disputed friends who reminded
him that Franklin Roosevelt had won despite crutches and
wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' Wallace told his confidant Oscar Adams, ``they elected
Roosevelt, but they didn't watch him on television every night
getting hauled on a plane like he was half-dead.''
</P>
<P>
   The death of Wallace's presidential dream came just before the
Illinois primary, when he dropped out and endorsed a more modern
Southerner with no segregationist baggage, Gov. Jimmy Carter of
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace wanted to be remembered for his shining moment in 1972
and the Main Street themes he brought to prominence. Dan Carter, a
professor of history at Emory University and author of the most
detailed Wallace biography, ``The Politics of Rage,'' supports the
claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult to conceive of what American politics of the
1960s, 70s and 80s would be like without George Wallace,'' Carter
said in a 1994 interview. ``I don't think there's a single issue
that Nixon and Reagan talk of in terms of social issues that he
doesn't get to first.''
</P>
<P>
   In this view, Wallace's presidential campaigns prefigured, in an
especially abrasive way, a large portion of the country's politics
of later years. Wallace was the first major political figure in his
generation to exploit the antipathy toward Washington that went on
to be a prime force in politics from coast to coast.
</P>
<P>
   He was also surely the first in his generation to galvanize the
white, working-class voters later labeled as Reagan Democrats. And
he was the first nationally known politician of that generation to
put such raucous emphasis on race, crime, welfare and other issues
that still loom large, if less crudely, on the political landscape.
</P>
<P>
   After he retired as governor, Wallace used interviews to push
relentlessly at the theme that he was the real inventor of
Reaganism. Starting in 1979, he also undertook a campaign of
apology and revisionist explanation intended to erase the word
``racist'' from his epitaph.
</P>
<P>
   He argued that his early devotion to segregation was based on
his reading of the Constitution and the Bible and was
misinterpreted as a racist hatred of black people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a mistake in the sense that I should have clarified my
position more,'' he said in his last term as governor. ``I was
never saying anything that reflected upon black people, and I'm
very sorry it was taken that way.''
</P>
<P>
   That Wallace died haunted by race is appropriate to his life
story _ one of Faulknerian perversity embodying the old themes of
guilt and a steady, if clumsy, Snopsian aspiration.
</P>
<P>
   George Corley Wallace Jr. was born on Aug. 25, 1919, in Clio,
Ala., a cotton town in Barbour County, where mule-drawn wagons were
as common as cars on the unpaved main street. His father was the
wastrel son of a beloved local doctor. His mother, Mozelle Smith
Wallace, had survived abandonment by her mother and a depressing
girlhood in an Episcopal orphanage at Mobile.
</P>
<P>
   Like his father, George Jr. was quick with his fists and drawn
to politics. Calling himself the ``Barbour Bantam,'' he won two
Golden Gloves titles while in high school. As a 15-year-old
legislative page at the Capitol in Montgomery, he stood on the gold
star marking the spot where Jefferson Davis was sworn as president
of the Confederacy and where, by tradition, Alabama governors have
taken the oath of office ever since. It was the seminal moment of
his youth. Man and boy, George Wallace revered that spot, so much
so that as governor he ordered state troopers to encircle it so
that a visitor, Attorney General Robert Kennedy, could not put a
desecrating Yankee foot atop it.
</P>
<P>
   It was in 1937, on the oak-shaded Tuscaloosa campus of the
University of Alabama, that George Wallace began to define what he
would become politically. He arrived in the same shiny suit he had
worn as a page in Montgomery, but Tuscaloosa was a congenial place
for poor, ambitious country boys. And by tradition, it was a
virtual boot camp for future governors and senators. Young Wallace
won election as president of the freshman class. He never won
another student office, but his campaign to beat the fraternity
machine with a coalition of independents and out-of-state students
whetted his permanent taste for underdog politics.
</P>
<P>
   The other leitmotifs of his Alabama career _ cronyism and
betrayal _ emerged at the university. He acquired the hangers-on
who staffed his later efforts, and he made an unlikely, but
ill-fated friendship with Frank Johnson, a handsome law student
from Winston County, a Unionist stronghold in northern Alabama that
seceded from Alabama when Alabama left the Union. Johnson was a
Republican, Wallace an ardent New Deal Democrat. Johnson joked
about someday being a federal judge and Wallace about being
governor. But the big wheels on campus tended to dismiss Wallace's
ambitions as comical.
</P>
<P>
   For in those days, too, Wallace impressed people by his frenetic
energy and tireless pugnacity rather than by any inherent
attractiveness. He waited tables and drove taxis and slid through
law school, cramming from borrowed books. Frank Johnson's wife,
Ruth, was worried by Wallace's habit of chasing innocent high
school girls, although she thought him more interested in the
adoration than sexual conquest. Finally in 1943, at the age of 23,
he decided to marry one of his naive admirers, a 16-year-old dime
store clerk named Lurleen Burns.
</P>
<P>
   It was wartime and Mrs. Wallace and their baby daughter, Bobbi
Joe, born in 1944, followed wherever Wallace's flight training in
the Army Air Forces took him. He shipped to the Mariana Islands as
a flight engineer in the spring of 1945, assigned to fly bombing
missions over Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The biographer Dan Carter found fellow crew members who
remembered Wallace's barracks lectures defending segregation in
Barbour County. ``I don't hate them,'' Wallace was reported to have
said. ``The colored are fine in their place. But they're just like
children, and it's not something that's going to change. It's
written in stone.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace had been through nine combat missions by the time the
war ended. He was discharged with a 10 percent disability for
combat-induced ``psychoneurosis,'' diagnosed after he refused
orders to fly dangerous training missions when his unit returned to
California after the Japanese surrender. Years later, Sen. Wayne
Morse, D-Ore., disclosed Wallace's wartime psychiatric history.
Wallace responded that unlike his liberal attacker, he could prove
that he was 90 percent sane.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Wallace began climbing up the political ladder
with remarkable speed. Using his Barbour County connections, he was
named an assistant to Alabama's attorney general in 1946. The next
year he won election to the Alabama legislature. He allied himself
with the racially moderate populist Gov. James Folsom and prevailed
on Folsom to appoint him as a trustee of all-black Tuskegee
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   As a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1948,
Wallace refused to join the walkout by segregationist
``Dixiecrats,'' a move that placed him firmly in the progressive,
racially moderate wing of a state Democratic Party that still had
``White Supremacy'' emblazoned on its ballot emblem.
</P>
<P>
   After this blooding in state and national politics, Wallace
settled in as an elected district judge in his home county, serving
from 1953 to 1958 and all the while laying plans to run for
governor in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   It was in the preparation of that race and its aftermath that
Wallace committed two betrayals _ one personal and one political _
that blemished his reputation for life, but also gave him a
generationlong stranglehold on Alabama politics.
</P>
<P>
   The first came after 1958, when Wallace's surprisingly strong
dark-horse candidacy failed. He had followed the tolerant racial
line laid down by Folsom and lost to John Patterson, whose devotion
to massive resistance to court-ordered integration won him the
following of the Ku Klux Klan. There were only about 5,000 Klan
members, Patterson later recalled, but they helped him paper the
state with campaign literature.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Wallace, in a quotation whose authenticity he long
disputed, was recorded as saying that no one ``will ever out
out-nigger me again.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if not literally true, the remark defined the strategy
Wallace would use to ride to power. He started the very next year
when his law school friend Frank Johnson, now a federal judge with
a strong civil rights record, ordered Wallace's court to surrender
voter-registration records to the United States Civil Rights
Commission. Wallace denounced Johnson in public as a federal
dictator, but conspired secretly to avoid being jailed on federal
contempt charges by having a local grand jury surrender the records
on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson ruled that Wallace had used ``devious means,'' but had
nonetheless obeyed the federal court order. Never one to be
embarrassed by the facts, Wallace labeled Johnson a
``carpet-bagging, scalawagging liar'' who wanted to mount ``a
second Sherman's March to the Sea.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace had lost a friend but gained a nickname, ``The Fighting
Judge,'' that would help make him governor in 1962 as an all-out
segregationist with Klan backing. As Johnson later told the Alabama
writer Frank Sikora, Wallace had also established the tactical
blueprint of his career: ``misleading the people of Alabama for the
purpose of pursuing his political career.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, of course, did not see it that way. He described
himself as devoted to the economic development of his state and to
advancing the causes of limited government and middle-class values
in national politics. The reality was both uglier and more
complicated.
</P>
<P>
   In his four terms as governor, Wallace saw an era of
unparalleled corruption that operated through a crony system
centered on his brother Gerald, a lawyer who died in 1993. With the
governor's approval, Gerald Wallace and his close associate, Oscar
Harper, went into business selling the state office supplies,
printing, vending machines and building leases. Gerald Wallace and
Harper established an asphalt company with $1,000 in capital. In a
year and half, the infant company garnered more than a million
dollars in state contracts.
</P>
<P>
   These unblushing accounts come not from political opponents, but
from Harper's 1988 memoir, ``Me 'n' George,'' regarded as one of
the best guides to the inside dealing in Alabama's capital during
the Wallace years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people have got the wrong idea about how I made my
money,'' Harper wrote. ``They think me and Gerald are crooks.''
Then he added: ``That ain't true. It's just that good deals kept
popping up and I never was one to turn a good deal down.''

QB FOUGHT LAW, AND LAW WON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ In so many ways, Peyton Manning was the
epitome of a rookie quarterback Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Manning threw floaters, weak passes that cannot be thrown in the
National Football League. ``Any time they float 'em, we're supposed
to pick them off,'' was how Patriot safety Willie Clay put it.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Manning threw across his body, which all young QBs
eventually learn they cannot do. Even worse, Manning threw a pass
across his body that also was across the field. An absolute no-no.
Of course, that pass was picked off.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most of all, though, Manning showed that he was the
rawest of rookies this way: Time and again he threw the ball toward
cornerback Ty Law. Few QBs do that _ not John Elway, not Dan
Marino, not Brett Favre.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been asking since I was a rookie,'' said Law, who picked
off two passes and could have had two more (one was called back
because of a penalty and the other went off his fingertips). ``I've
been wanting to cover the other team's best receiver. But
(then-coach) Bill Parcells basically told me to go to hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Astrologers might have seen a confluence of the planets Sunday
night, but Law took advantage of a confluence of factors that he
seldom sees _ a rookie QB (Manning) who looks to throw most passes
toward his best receiver (Marvin Harrison) and the Patriots' best
corner (Law) covering the Colts' best. The result was many passes
thrown Law's way, and poor passes at that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played like a rookie quarterback,'' said Clay. ``He made a
lot of mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   And throwing Law's way was among the most egregious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't do anything exceptional,'' said Law. ``Manning's a
great talent, but we just took advantage of him. I got a couple of
good breaks on the ball. You've got to credit the guys up front.''
</P>
<P>
   But, as Law pointed out, ``I knew I'd be on Marvin Harrison.
He's their go-to guy. I was just waiting for the opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Law said he was aware that Miami's Terrell Buckley picked off
Manning twice in Indianapolis' opener, ``and I studied the films of
what Terrell Buckley did and I tried to follow that.''
</P>
<P>
   Law's first interception, a truly ugly floater from Manning in
the first quarter, was easily picked off by the cornerback. But
what Law did after the pick in the first quarter totally befit his
bloodlines _ he's a cousin of former Cowboys great Tony Dorsett.
Law darted and snaked and twisted and turned 59 yards on his way to
the Indianapolis end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember breaking any tackles,'' said Law. ``I was
just thinking: `End zone.'''
</P>
<P>
   Early in the second quarter, the Colts were on the Patriot 15
when Law picked off his second Manning pass (Law also had two
interceptions against Dallas in 1996). Once again, this
interception looked easy _ Law merely picked off a floater in the
end zone _ but it was a true blend of experience and talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ty saw that their tight end was lined up in the backfield,''
said safety Lawyer Milloy, ``and when Ty saw that he signaled to me
that I was to come up and jumped their slant pass. I came up and Ty
dropped back.''
</P>
<P>
   The timing was exqusite between the two. Just at the snap,
Milloy rushed up to Law's position, while Law dropped back deep.
Manning pump-faked toward Harrison but it was the most futile of
fakes _ because Law was dropping back into deep coverage, more like
a safety than a corner. Manning's pass came directly to Law.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great to see Ty have a big night,'' said coach Pete
Carroll, ``and that was great awareness by him down there near the
goal line when they tried to pump-fake and beat him. Ty knew what
was coming and he made a heck of a play.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Law blanketed Michael Irvin and picked off two passes
in that Dallas game two years ago (``Michael Irvin ... that was my
breakthrough''), opposing QBs have preferred to ignore Law and
throw toward the various right cornerbacks New England has lined
up.
</P>
<P>
   But Law has asked Carroll to let him cover the opposing team's
best receiver (Elway, for instance, rarely threw toward Rod Smith a
week ago in Denver, and Smith caught only one pass on Law). ``I
think I'm up to flip-flopping,'' said Law, moving from side to side
with the other team's best.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran QBs don't make the mistakes Manning made, and the rookie
surely will know by the next Colts-Patriots game that it is wise
not to throw the ball toward Law. ``If that happens,'' said Law,
``so be it.''
</P>
<P>
   Manning learned his lesson Sunday night.

 UNDATED: deal down.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As this comment suggests, Wallace's first term was rowdy, even
by the standards of a region that had produced Gov. Eugene Talmadge
of Georgia, known as ``The Wild Man from Sugar Creek.''
</P>
<P>
   It is one of the paradoxes of Southern history that Alabama's
``Fighting Judge,'' by trying to revive the antebellum doctrine of
states' rights, instead enabled the civil rights movement to reach
its high-water mark. The Birmingham demonstrations in 1963 led to
the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Two years later the Selma
march led to the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these triumphs, it was a dangerous time for blacks and
whites who supported the civil rights movement. During the Wallace
years, at least 10 people died in racially motivated killings in
Alabama. Wallace and his flamboyantly inept and drug-addled public
safety director, Al Lingo, responded mainly by disrupting the
federal investigations into crimes like the bombing that killed
four little girls at the 16th Street Baptist Church on Sept. 15,
1963.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of Alabama's business and educational establishment,
always sensitive to the state's image, came to regard Wallace as an
embarrassment. The governor himself was hurt and stunned when
students at his beloved alma mater greeted him with chants of
``We're No. 50,'' a reference to the cash-starved university's
academic standing.
</P>
<P>
   But George Wallace was a creature of the storm who always had
wind beneath his wings, and that wind was the adoration of the
white farmers and factory workers and rural courthouse bosses who
counted the votes and doled out patronage.
</P>
<P>
   They loved it when Wallace waved his cigar, flooded his food
with ketchup and said that the guy pumping gas at an Alabama
crossroads knew more about Communism than the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   When a surprisingly strong anti-Wallace faction in the
legislature refused to alter the state Constitution to allow him a
second term, Wallace put his ailing wife Lurleen on the ballot in
1966. She won easily in a heart-rending campaign that demonstrated
the scope of his ambition. Only a few weeks before her husband
announced her candidacy, Mrs. Wallace had surgery and radiation
treatment for the aggressive intestinal cancer that would kill her
in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Political writers predicted that Alabamians would punish Wallace
for his cynical use of a sick woman. But he was only shifting
gears. He reclaimed the governorship in 1970 with the most
flagrantly racist campaign of his career, warning that his
progressive opponent, Albert Brewer, was using a black ``block
vote'' to install a regime of federal oppression. With Wallace's
clear approval, the Klan circulated fliers falsely accusing the
clean-living Brewer and his wife and daughters of sexual
perversions and miscegenation.
</P>
<P>
   It was a historic election for Alabama in two ways. First,
Alabama was resisting the epochal progressive wave that swept the
region in 1970 and installed New South governors like Jimmy Carter
in Georgia and Reubin Askew in Florida. Secondly, Wallace openly
committing himself to the presidential race track.
</P>
<P>
   By Wallace's reckoning, his appeal to blue-collar voters outside
the South had ``shaken the eyeteeth'' of both major parties in
1968. Indeed, President Nixon so feared Wallace's disruptive
potential in 1972 that he supplied $400,000 to Wallace's opponent
in the 1970 campaign for governor. But Wallace won with his racist
attacks and his invitation to Alabamians to ``send them a message''
by launching him toward the 1972 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   For a few months, Wallace was the hottest thing going. Gone were
the pomaded hair and the bargain-store threads. His stylish new
wife, Cornelia Ellis Snively, a niece of former Governor Folsom,
decked out Wallace in modish, wide-lapel suits and taught him to
use a blow dryer. Wallace talked less about race because he could
afford to. His attacks on school busing let conservative whites
know where he stood.
</P>
<P>
   As Wallace moved toward victory in the Florida primary, Nixon
himself made an anti-busing speech that was regarded as a tribute
to Wallace's growing appeal. Wallace finished second behind Sen.
George McGovern in the Wisconsin primary and second to former Vice
President Hubert Humphrey in Indiana. Having established himself as
a force in the Democratic Party, he was topping the polls in the
primary campaigns of Maryland and Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   But on the afternoon of May 15, at an unnecessary campaign rally
in Laurel, Md., Wallace overruled the Secret Service and moved into
a crowd for a final round of handshaking. ``Hey, George, let me
shake hands with you,'' shouted Arthur Bremer. Frustrated in an
earlier ambition to kill Nixon, Bremer, had been stalking the
governor for weeks. From a range of three feet, the gunman shot
Wallace three times, severing his spine and paralyzing him for
life. Bremer is now in prison in Maryland, serving the 63-year
sentence given him in June 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Although his presidential hopes ended, Wallace won two more
terms as governor by appealing to white loyalty and catering to the
thousands of new black voters whose franchise he had opposed. But
Wallace now behaved more like a pensioner than a chief executive.
The constant pain from his wound _ ``the thorn in my flesh'' _
limited his concentration and resulted in a dependence on methadone
and other painkillers. He became pathologically jealous of his
wife, Cornelia, who after a messy divorce in 1978 encountered her
own problems with substance abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace's hope to found a dynasty foundered when his son, George
Jr., proved a querulous campaigner who could not progress beyond
minor state offices. Wallace married again to a failed country
singer named Lisa Taylor. That marriage, too, generated sour
publicity before they divorced in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by four children from his first marriage: his
son, of Montgomery; three daughters, Lee Dye and Bobbi Jo Parsons,
both of Birmingham, and Peggy Kennedy of Montgomery; two brothers,
Gerald, of Montgomery, and Jack, of Eufaula, Ala.; and several
grandchildren.

 UNDATED: several grandchildren.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wallace won his last election as governor in 1982, but it was
historical revision, rather than running the state, that occupied
his last years. Starting in 1977, he began giving interviews in
which he said that political philosophy rather than racism was the
motor of his career.
</P>
<P>
   In a typical interview, he said: ``The New York Times, the
Eastern establishment newspapers never did understand that
segregation wasn't about hate. I didn't hate anybody. I don't hate
the man who shot me. When I was young, I used to swim and play with
blacks all the time. You find more hate in New York, Chicago and
Washington, D.C., than in all the Southern states put together.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of his rehabilitation effort, Wallace sought meetings
with civil rights figures like the Rev. Ralph Abernathy, the Rev.
Jesse Jackson and Rep. John Lewis, whose beating on ``Bloody
Sunday'' at Selma galvanzied the voting-rights crusade. Wallace
made a well-publicized appearance at King's old church in
Montgomery. Sometimes he even managed to use the magic words ``I'm
sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   After Wallace left office in 1987, Alabamians continued to
support him through a figurehead position at Troy State University.
By the time he died, Republicans had taken over the governorship,
and Wallace's main legacy, a statewide system of trade schools,
junior colleges, and small four-year institutions, was regarded as
a monument to educational waste and redundancy that a poor state
could ill afford.
</P>
<P>
   One of his last public appearances was in the Spike Lee
documentary ``Four Little Girls,'' which tells the story of the
16th Street Baptist Church bombing. In his interview, Wallace
insists that his best friend in the world was a black orderly. The
obviously uncomfortable orderly keeps trying to walk out of the
frame only to be tugged back by Wallace. In public showings, that
passage of the film usually drew laughter.
</P>
<P>
   So ended the public career that saw Wallace move from being the
most feared politician of his era to a pitiable relic. It is a
career whose moral arc seemed, in retrospect, utterly predictable
and utterly of a piece with the Faulknerian idea of racism's
ineradicable curse. At the height of his powers, George Wallace
denied any moral responsibility for the violent acts that racked
his state. And in his Bible-haunted state, many insisted that a
terrible judgment had been visited upon him.
</P>
<P>
   Brandt Ayers, the liberal editor of The Star newspaper in
Anniston, put it this way: ``The Governor we Alabamians knew was a
man of primal passion: sincere champion of the working class,
cynical manipulator of their resentments, a sorcerer summoning the
beast in our nature, a man of deep insecurities, tenderness, and
finally, humility.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``When he came to my office in 1974 campaigning for
governor, I told him: `George, you always claimed to stand up for
the little man, but everybody knows that the real underdog is the
black man. We stood up for him. You didn't. Why?''' He did not
answer. He just looked down at his legs for what seemed a very long
time.''

GEORGE WALLACE DIES AT 79 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Inserts new 2nd graf with cause and time of death) (EDS: A full-length obituary (4,700 words) will move within the
hour.) 
(th) 
 By HOWELL RAINES    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Former Gov. George C. Wallace of Alabama, who built his
political career on segregation and spent a tormented retirement
arguing that he was not a racist in his heart, died Sunday night at
Jackson Hospital in Montgomery. He was 79 and lived in Montgomery,
Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace died of respiratory and cardiac arrest at 9:49 p.m.,
said Dana Beterktm a spokeswoman for Jackson Hospital in
Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace had been in declining health since being shot in his
1972 presidential campaign by a 21-year-old drifter named Arthur
Bremer.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, a Democrat who was a longtime champion of states'
rights, dominated his own state for almost a generation. But his
wish was to be remembered as a man who might have been president
and whose campaigns for that office in 1968, 1972 and 1976
established political trends that have dominated American politics
for the last quarter of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1972 race, he was running strongly in the Democratic
presidential primaries. He rattled the party's establishment with a
second-place finish in Wisconsin and a rapid ascent in the polls.
He also won primaries in Maryland and Michigan on May 16, but got
the news in a hospital bed, having been shot and paralyzed on the
day before the balloting.
</P>
<P>
   The injury from Bremer's bullet became a ``thorn in my flesh,''
Wallace later said, and the truncated campaign became a thorn in
his psyche. He died believing that had he not been shot, popular
appeal would have forced the Democratic Party to put him on the
ticket in 1972 to keep Nixon from sweeping the Sun Belt and
blue-collar enclaves in the Middle West and Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   He believed that his underdog campaigns made it possible for two
other Southerners, Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, to be taken
seriously as presidential candidates. He also argued ceaselessly
that his theme of middle-class empowerment was borrowed by Richard
M. Nixon in 1968 and then grabbed by another Californian, Ronald
Reagan, as the spine of his triumphant populist conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews later in his life, Wallace was always less keen to
talk about his other major role in Southern history. After being
elected to his first term as governor in 1962, he became the foil
for the huge protests that the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. used
to destroy segregation in public accommodations in 1963 and to
secure voting rights for blacks in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace was the first major political figure in his generation
to exploit the antipathy toward Washington that went on to be a
prime force in politics from coast to coast.
</P>
<P>
   He was also surely the first in his generation to galvanize the
white, working-class voters later labeled as Reagan Democrats. And
he was the first nationally known politician of that generation to
put such raucous emphasis on race, crime, welfare and other issues
that still loom large, if less crudely, on the political landscape.

PATRIOTS GROUND GAME STILL AT STANDSTILL 
</HEADLINE>
 BACKS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ There is cause for concern but not alarm.
Sunday night Patriots running backs combined for 103 yards on 33
carries against the Indianapolis Colts _ and 51 of those yards came
on a scamper by backup tailback Sedrick Shaw. New England finished
the first half with 28 yards on 14 carries and was stopped on
short-yardage situations throughout the contest.
</P>
<P>
   Many Patriots fans were too busy singing the praises of
defensive back Ty Law (two interceptions) and defensive end Willie
McGinest (eight tackles, a sack, a forced fumble) to raise eyebrows
about the running backs' futility. But the ground game soon will be
a focal point.
</P>
<P>
   Coupled with their season-opening effort against Denver, the
Patriots have just 184 yards rushing in two games. That will need
to improve, particuarly in outings in which the defense isn't in
sync and the receivers are well-covered.
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention the fact that few teams go far in the NFL without
a solid running game. The New England attack has shown flashes. How
far it is from consistency is anyone's guess.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not frustrated (with the running game). There are going to
be games like this,'' said running back Robert Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   The first-round draft picked charged with making fans forget
about the departure of Curtis Martin had 36 yards on 18 carries,
including 8 yards in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   He did, however, score the team's only rushing touchdown on a
1-yard run on third down in the fourth quarter _ after a 1-yard run
on second down went for no gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won the game, and that's all that matters. I'm just trying
to take what the defense is giving me. Indianapolis did a great job
tonight,'' said Edwards, who gained 50 yards on 13 carries in the
opener against Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a few good plays, but you're going to have bad plays
along with the good. We're going to go and look at the film this
week and see what we need to work on. There's a lot of improvement
that needs to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, who missed much of the exhibition season because of
injury, said he is becoming more comfortable with the offense.
Right now, it's showing most with his receiving, as the former
University of Georgia standout is living up to his reputation as a
reliable threat out of the backfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to be a good receiver,'' said quarterback Drew
Bledsoe, who completed three passes to Edwards for 71 yards. ``He
made a nice catch on the one crossing pattern to him. The ball
wasn't particularly well thrown and he caught it down at his feet.
It's nice to have a back who can catch the ball when the ball's not
thrown well.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards was most effective Sunday night running cutbacks and
sweeps, plays on which he made the first tackler miss. He was often
stuffed at the line of scrimmage or behind it on runs up the
middle. Yet the rookie said Indianapolis deserves much credit, too,
for stopping the run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indy did a great job on defense as far as slow-playing a lot
of stuff,'' he said. ``The cutbacks weren't there as they have
been. They really studied their film and they just waited for stuff
to happen and just attacked.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is always a man unaccounted for, and that's my man. I
tried to give a little something and give a little extra effort to
get yardage, but sometimes it doesn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't think coach Pete Carroll isn't aware of that. After Shaw's
big gain, no other back had a run of more than 8 yards. Even Shaw
wasn't effective past his big gain, with just 4 more yards on four
carries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a good, clean night for us in the running game,''
Carroll said. ``By halftime we were not running the football well
at all. Our stats are a little misleading because of that run with
Sedrick.''
</P>

BLEDSOE STILL IN THE RUNNING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL McDONOUGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ With Week 2 of the National Football
League season still to be completed, nearly half of the starting
quarterbacks have been injured.
</P>
<P>
   Opening week, eight went down. Sunday Troy Aikman, John Elway,
and Brad Johnson could not finish games.
</P>
<P>
   And some Patriot fans would like to see Drew Bledsoe run more.
</P>
<P>
   That shows how much they know, cerainly not much about the value
of keeping your starting quarterback in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   As much as they moan about Bledsoe and his alleged lack of
toughness and mobility, he has not missed a game in more than 2 1/2
seasons, and only one in the last four years, after he separated
his shoulder in San Francisco when he was planted into the ground
by linebacker Ken Norton.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman, who is not a runner to begin with, must have been
feeling his oats. He ran for two touchdowns last week in the opener
against Arizona. And in Denver Sunday he scrambled on two plays in
succession. The problem was, he never got up after the second one.
On the way down, two defenders landed on Aikman, hammering his left
shoulder into the turf. He sustained a fractured left clavicle and
is expected to be out 4-8 weeks. That just might kill any playoff
hopes the Cowboys have this year.
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday night, during the Patriots' loss in Denver, Bledsoe
was forced out of the pocket and ran as fast as he could, which is
not very fast, for the sideline. He gained 9 yards on the play, but
it was called back because of a penalty.
</P>
<P>
   During the week, talk show types and some writers discussed how
Bledsoe showed leadership on the play, and how great that was for
the team.
</P>
<P>
   They had the same reaction two years ago, in the third game of
the season, and the first in Foxboro Stadium. The Patriots had lost
the first two on the road, and Bledsoe was widely criticized for
his lack of mobility. Toward the end of a close game in Buffalo, he
had a chance to run in for a score that would have won the game,
and didn't.
</P>
<P>
   The next week, on a meaningless play early in the game, he ran
to his right for a first down, leaped in the air over a tackler,
and landed on his head. The crowd went wild. Bledsoe had showed he
was one of the boys. He was lucky he didn't end up in Massachusetts
General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Before this season started, Miami coach Jimmy Johnson was asked
to assess the Eastern Division of the AFC. He said that the
Patriots had the best team but added: ``If anything happens to
Bledsoe, then we are the team to beat. We go right by them.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though he is not mobile, is not a talented runner, and
cannot slide in the pocket to make rushers miss like the great ones
can, Bledsoe is resilient. He has been hit with some hellacious
shots over the last couple of years and bounced back to play.
</P>
<P>
   On the whole, he does not get beat up like other quarterbacks.
In fact, he is hit probably less than any other starting passer.
</P>
<P>
   Though some Patriots followers like to complain about the lack
of a running game, and the lack of solid blocking by the offensive
line for those runs, this unit has been one of the best in the NFL
at protecting he passer. Also, Patriots offensive coordinators have
not put Bledsoe at risk.
</P>
<P>
   For example, there were at least a dozen times last Monday night
that Elway rolled outside the end on a semi-bootleg to throw and
exposed himself to hits by rushers, especially Willie McGinest.
There was a point in the game that he obviously was not happy with
the calls that put him in those positions. Once he even took a
dive, throwing the ball away and ducking, before the rusher got a
clear shot. That was the smart thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you like him or not, as Johnson indicates, Bledsoe is
the Patriots offense. Without him, every opposing team would stack
the line of scrimmage. With him, they back off and play pass
defense, which is why the Patriots should be able to run the ball
better this year, especially with the nice, easy schedule they
play.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City, in Week 5, was supposed to be the first big test
after Denver. But starting quarterback Elvis Grbac is out with a
bad shoulder, and may not play. The Chiefs had more players on the
injured list Sunday than at any other time in recent memory, and
they lost in Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Polian, the highly regarded general manager of the Colts,
pinpointed the reason for the rash of early-season injuries. ``It's
these zone blitzes and zone dogs,'' said Polian, just before
kickoff Sunday night. ``They are giving these defensive people
clean shots at the passer. And these defensive blitzers are getting
bigger and faster all the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of these zone dogs, your offense has to practice more
11 on 11, and when this happens, you get more injuries in practice,
because you have to practice at a faster pace to simulate what
happens when a zone dog comes. It's a real problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago, at the league meeting, Well Mara (owner of the
Giants) proposed that we make intentional grounding legal, that it
not be a penalty. This might be something we look at to help save
these quarterbacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Including Drew Bledsoe.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Sept. 13, moved Saturday in the `a' category and are
repeated Monday.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-CENSURE-REVIEW _ Andrew Johnson was the only president
ever impeached, and Andrew Jackson was the only president ever
censured. The historical auguries may not bode well for high-minded
nonpartisanship. The records of the two big presidential crises of
the 19th century show that when Congress acted to remove or
sanction a president, raw politics prevailed. Here are excerpts.
</P>
<P>
   CONGRESS-CLINTON-REVIEW _ Kenneth W. Starr's report became
public so suddenly last week that Americans are still digesting its
charges and tawdriness and weighing their significance. But already
potentially seismic attitudes are taking shape. The politicians,
strategists and scholars trying to gauge them are certain of little
except that much is at stake, regardless of whether Bill Clinton
survives as president. By David E. Rosenbaum. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GLOBAL-MARKETS-REVIEW _ As more of the world's markets come
unhinged _ last week the contagion hit Brazil full force, and many
now worry that the rest of Latin America could succumb as well _
there is a modest revolt under way against one of the biggest
trends of the 1980s and 1990s, the view that money should move
unimpeded around the world, to the places where it can be used most
efficiently. By David E. Sanger. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TEEN-VOLUNTEERS-REVIEW _ Nowadays, volunteerism is the most
popular prescription for improving young people and it has the
added virtue of saving the world. But since this is America,
there's a group or two somewhere voluntarily opposed to it. To
instill a sense of civic duty in teen-agers, the Chicago public
school system has enacted a policy requiring its students to
perform 40 hours of public service to earn a high school diploma.
By Dirk Johnson. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   STARR-CLINTON-REVIEW _ Historians will, no doubt, analyze the
blood feud nearing its denouemont between Bill Clinton and Kenneth
W. Starr in lots of ways _ as a showdown over politics and law, of
constitutional issues and human ones. But a look at where both men
came from suggests another possible prism _ a battle of dueling
Southerners, each of them summing up the competing instincts of the
South in which issues of politics, morals and religion have become
personalized at a deep, visceral level. By Peter Applebome. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   U.N.-ASSEMBLY-REVIEW _ When the annual limousine-and-sirens
season opens at the United Nations on Sept. 21 with high-level
speeches in the General Assembly, a lot of the world's bad boys
won't be anywhere near the podium. They always stay home. By
Barbara Crossette. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TEACHERS-REVIEW _ How do you measure the talent to teach? And
how do you turn knowledgeable people into talented educators? Is an
exam like the one in Massachusetts a tool to raise standards or
does it represent the long, stultifying reach of an educational
bureaucracy? As states raise academic standards for students, New
York and others are moving to stiffen their credentialing
requirements to make sure that teachers can teach more rigorous
curriculum. By Randal C. Archibold. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BASEBALL-HEROES-REVIEW _ Although baseball's charming 129-year
history is a unique asset that distinguishes it from younger
sports, it has also become an undertow from which the sport has
struggled to escape. Today's sports fans aren't preoccupied with
history; they focus on the next this, the next that. Figures from
the past often get mistaken as curiosities rather than as cherished
legends. By Alan Schwarz. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GERMANY-VOTE-REVIEW _ Germany's most important election in
decades will take place two weeks from Sunday and the striking
thing is this: Whoever wins will inherit a land where the pace has
already been set for them, not so much by politicians as by the
barons of big business. Almost nine years after the fall of the
Berlin Wall, that is not entirely a surprise: As in the United
States or Britain, ideology has lost its primacy, yielding to a
contest among rival politicians to define and capture the
post-ideological center. By Alan Cowell. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ATROCITIES-SUITS-REVIEW _ In the wake of the settlement between
Holocaust survivors and Swiss banks accused of profiting from
looted Jewish assets, some experts fear that opportunistic lawyers
may see a potential gold mine in the precedent, and will seek every
opportunity to file suits on behalf of victims of past atrocities.
By David Rohde.
</P>
<P>
   CIA-CHILE-REVIEW _ Excerpts from newly declassified documents on
how the CIA under President Richard M. Nixon targeted Chilean
President Salvadore Allende in the early 1970s. Allende was ousted
in a coup 25 years ago this month.

 TRADITIONALISTS VS. MODERNIZERS: TWO DUELING SONS OF THE SOUTH 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Historians will, no doubt, analyze the blood feud between Bill
Clinton and Kenneth Starr in many ways _ as a showdown over
politics and law, of constitutional issues and human ones.
</P>
<P>
   But a look at both men's roots suggests another possible prism _
a duel between Southerners, each representing competing instincts
of the South, that has dragged the nation into a morally charged
meltdown of sin, repentance and redemption.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Starr were born months apart in Hope, Ark., and
Vernon, Texas. Both were bright and ambitious, headed to Washington
for college, went on to law school and eventually returned to
Washington, one bound for the White House, the other aiming for the
Supreme Court. Both share a conspicuous religiosity, though of a
very different strain, and the sort of compulsive accent on manners
that still defines the South.
</P>
<P>
   So much for similarities. Clinton veered left, politically and
culturally, becoming a familiar Southern hybrid _ part grown-up,
part rogue _ introduced to the country in the 1992 campaign as a
mix of Elvis Presley and John F. Kennedy. Starr began college at
arch-conservative Harding University in Searcy, Ark., and never
strayed from his strict, straight-arrow, Church of Christ
upbringing.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1990 book, ``Tar Heel Politics'' (University of North
Carolina), Paul Luebke, a North Carolina state representative and a
sociologist, argues that Southern politics is not about liberals
and conservatives but about traditionalists and modernizers. He
distinguishes between politicians like Clinton, who focus on
education and economic development, and those like North Carolina
Sen. Jesse Helms, who focus on traditional economic interests and
social values.
</P>
<P>
   But the distinction also describes a philosophical difference
between Clinton and Starr, with Starr, by all accounts, a moral
traditionalist to the core, and Clinton, to put it charitably,
having a more elastic moral code.
</P>
<P>
   Sin and infidelity did not originate with baby boomers. And no
one but Starr can fully understand what motivated him to go where
some other prosecutors would not have gone. But Luebke said it was
impossible to understand Starr's investigation without
understanding the traditional religious culture of the South.
</P>
<P>
   According to that view, Starr's pursuit not just of a sinner but
an apostate Southerner willfully cloaked in the robes of religion
might help explain Starr's investigation to some associates who
have said they found his zealous, unrelenting pursuit of Clinton
out of character.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drove by a Free Will Baptist Church the other day where the
sign in front read, `Sin Is Our Greatest Problem,' '' Luebke said.
``A lot of people have underestimated how far this could go because
they didn't have a Southern perspective. If you're Europe-centric
and you think of Mitterrand, you think, what's the big deal? If you
come from a culture in which sin is our greatest problem, then
Mitterrand is completely irrelevant.'' He referred to the late
French President Francois Mitterrand, a married politician who
openly kept a mistress for much of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly Charles Reagan Wilson, a historian at the University
of Mississippi, said the Monica Lewinsky matter was playing out
along the main themes of Southern religion, with Starr upholding
the Calvinist view of morality at the heart of his Church of Christ
background and Clinton seeking grace and forgiveness for his
transgressions in a spectacle as familiar to Southerners as
cornbread and iced tea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost as if you have the Old Testament in Starr and the
New Testament in Clinton,'' he said. ``One is invoking the Old
Testament religion of law, the other the New Testament of grace,
love and understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   There may be better lenses for understanding the crisis, but its
Southern tinge is hard to miss at a time when the president, vice
president, House speaker, House majority leader, House majority
whip and Senate majority leader are all from the South. Starr began
his tenure amid furious controversy when it was revealed that David
Sentelle, the conservative North Carolinian and protege of Helms
who heads the special appellate council that appointed Starr, met
with Helms and Sen. Lauch Faircloth of North Carolina before
appointing Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Once aggrieved Southerners fought duels over such differences.
Now, perhaps they precipitate constitutional crises over them.

 HOW THE CIA TOOK AIM AT ALLENDE

   WASHINGTON _ From 1970 to 1973, the United States sought to
overthrow the government of Chile and its democratically elected
president, Dr. Salvador Allende, whom it deemed a Marxist threat to
U.S. interests. Under orders from President Richard M. Nixon, the
CIA mounted a full-tilt covert operation to keep Allende from
taking office and, when that failed, undertook subtler efforts to
undermine him. Those efforts ``never really ended,'' the CIA's
director of operations at the time, Thomas Karamessines, later told
Senate investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years ago last week, on Sept. 11, 1973, the Chilean
military seized power, The junta, under Gen. Augusto Pinochet,
ruled until 1990. Its death squads murdered more than 3,000 people,
and it jailed and tortured thousands more. Chile is still trying to
come to terms with the damage done to its democratic institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The declassified government documents excerpted below were
collected by the National Security Archive, a nonprofit research
group in Washington that has sought to uncover secret records since
1985. They were posted on its website (www.seas.gwu.edu/nsarchive)
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   They show how much the United States was committed to thwarting
Allende even before he took office, and they illustrate a fact that
was not well understood during the Cold War: The CIA very rarely
acted as a rogue elephant. When it plotted coups and shipped guns
to murderous colonels, it did so on orders from the president.

   On 15 September 1970, CIA was directed to try to prevent Marxist
Salvador Allende's ascent to the Chilean Presidency. . . . A

noteworthy in this connection was the Time cover story which owed a
great deal to written materials and briefings provided by CIA . . .
CIA briefings in Washington (deleted) changed the basic thrust of
the story in the final stages according to another Time
correspondent. It provoked Allende to complain on 13 October, ``We
are suffering the most brutal and horrible pressure, both domestic
and international,'' singling out Time in particular as having
``openly called'' for an invasion of Chile.

   Chile's coup d'etat was close to perfect. Unfortunately,
``close'' only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades. . . .
Original plan called for President Allende to be held incommunicado
in his home until the coup was a fait accompli. H-hour delay in
Santiago permitted Allende to be alerted at 0730. Allende
immediately dashed to the palace . . . (where) he had access to
radio communications facilities which permitted him to personally
implore ``workers and students, come to the Moneda and defend your
government against the Armed Forces.'' The hour was 0830. . . .
Military had all roads to Santiago blocked. Lid was on TIGHT inside
city. Everyone on streets not wearing right color jersey stood an
excellent chance of getting shot. Allende managed to personally
broadcast two ``MAYDAY'' messages. The first, at 0830, sounded
strong and confident as he summoned the workers and students. The
second at 0945 sounded morose, almost as if he was preparing the
eulogy for his dying government. It was his last broadcast as the
Air Force soon located and rocketed his antennae. The hour was
1015. . . .

<P>
   Allende was found alone and dead in his office off the inner
courtyard. He had killed himself by placing a sub-machine gun under
his chin and pulling the trigger. Messy, but efficient. The gun was
lying near his body. A gold metal plate imbedded in the stock was
inscribed ``To my good friend Salvador Allende from Fidel Castro.''
Obviously Communist Cuba had sent one too many guns to Chile for
their own good. The hour was 1345. . . .

 FALLOUT FAR BEYOND STARR-STRUCK CLINTON
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturday, September (The Week in Review) 
(bl) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Kenneth Starr's report became public so suddenly
last week that Americans are still digesting its charges and
tawdriness and weighing their significance.
</P>
<P>
   But already potentially seismic attitudes are taking shape. The
politicians, strategists and scholars trying to gauge them are
certain of little except that much is at stake, regardless of
whether Bill Clinton survives as president.
</P>
<P>
   They are considering the implications for the elections this
November and in 2000. They wonder what the consequences are for the
presidential ambitions of Vice President Al Gore, House Speaker
Newt Gingrich and House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt. They worry
about whether the public's view of Congress will be burnished or
tarnished.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the implications are apparent. Republicans, most agree,
cannot help but gain in the short run, although how much the gain
will be is open to debate.
</P>
<P>
   But other questions cannot be answered so readily. It is unclear
whether a Congress so polarized politically can judiciously handle
an impeachment inquiry. No one knows for sure whether Gingrich's
mien will be level headed or explosive. Democrats wonder whether
Gephardt, their leader in the House, will defend the president or
abandon him.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, if Republicans win enough swing seats in the next
elections, the result could be a moderating influence on that
party's ideology and force the Democrats more to the left.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could define a generation of politics for both parties,''
said Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, congressional leaders from both parties last
week promised moderation and nonpartisanship, well aware of the
public distaste for the normal sniping and back-biting.
</P>
<P>
   But it seems naive to expect that Congress will change its ways
dramatically or for long. Professor Ross Baker, a political
scientist at Rutgers University who specializes in Congress, had
this forecast: ``What we're going to see from Congress is at least
theatrical exhibitions of statesmanship. It may be a pose. Or
people may actually be on their best behavior for a while. But this
will be very difficult to sustain over time.''
</P>
<P>
   As if to document Baker's point, Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan.,
disregarded his leaders' cautions and went to the Senate floor on
Thursday to demand Clinton's resignation. And in the House of
Representatives, the Rules Committee's vote was along straight
party lines to reject the White House's request for 48 hours to
study the Starr report before its public release.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic politicians make no secret of their distress. ``I
can't imagine this in any way helping any Democrat anywhere,'' said
Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa. But ``if we handle it correctly,'' he went
on, trying to sound upbeat, ``it may be possible to keep the
Republicans from using it to advance their own political power.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are of two minds over whether to go after the
president aggressively in the next few weeks in the hopes of
gaining maximum advantage in this year's elections or to take a
more cautious approach with an eye to the presidential race in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   But while a crippled Clinton presidency might seem to be to the
Republicans' advantage, the problem is that ``two years is a very
long time politically,'' said Jeffrey Eisenach, a former Republican
strategist and aide to Gingrich who now runs the Progress and
Freedom Foundation, a conservative research institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't seem impossible to me that Clinton could recover to
something close to neutrality,'' Eisenach said.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, no one can say with confidence how the Clinton
scandal will translate into votes on Nov. 3. For years, people
outside Washington have been more forgiving of the president's
missteps than have those in the capital. Eisenach had this
explanation: ``If you live in Peoria and someone soils the nest in
Washington, it is not your nest. But if you live in Washington,
it's personal.''
</P>
<P>
   In political circles, according to Charles E. Cook Jr., the
editor of a nonpartisan newsletter that handicaps congressional
elections, the prevailing view is that Republicans will benefit in
November because their rank and file will be motivated to vote,
while an unusually large number of discouraged Democrats will stay
home. The best bet now, Cook wrote in his most recent report, is
that Republicans will add a bit to their 11-seat advantage in the
House and pick up a few seats in the Senate, though probably not
the 5 they need to have a 60-vote, veto-proof majority.
</P>
<P>
   As for presidential politics, the Clinton scandal is a serious
setback for Gore. Even if Clinton continues as president, he has
probably forfeited the prerogative of a successful two-term
president to choose his successor. And if Clinton resigns or is
impeached and Gore becomes president, he may still be at a
disadvantage in the 2000 election, though running as an incumbent.
``It's hard to imagine that Gore could stand up and say, `Our long
national nightmare is over,''' said a former member of Gore's
staff, recalling Gerald R. Ford's statement when he became
president after Richard M. Nixon's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Gore's reputation for personal rectitude has been
damaged by word that Attorney General Janet Reno is considering the
appointment of an independent counsel to investigate Gore's
fund-raising practices two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt, next to Gore the most organized candidate for the
Democratic presidential nomination, is in an awkward position. If
he defends Clinton, as one might expect the House Democratic leader
to do, he could forfeit a claim of nonpartisan statesmanship that
might help his candidacy. But if he turns his back on Clinton, he
will perhaps offend segments of his party that will be instrumental
in choosing the next candidate.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One possibility that delights some Democrats and fills others
with dread is that the centrist course Clinton espoused _
involving, for instance, a balanced budget, free trade and welfare
reform _ will fall by the wayside and that liberal domination of
the party will return.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, Gingrich seems to have the most to win
and lose. If he deals with the impeachment inquiry judiciously,
that could help dispel his reputation as a hothead that has kept
his popularity low in the opinion polls. It could also draw
attention away from the circumstances that led the House last year
to reprimand and fine him for ethical transgressions.
</P>
<P>
   But Gingrich has never been known for discipline in the
political trenches, and he is under pressure from those in his
party who want Clinton's head on a platter. Bush's Peril
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush could benefit from being outside
Washington and from not having to participate in difficult debates
or cast tough votes. On the other hand, one of Bush's main claims
is that he is the Republican who has the best chance of defeating
the Democratic nominee and winning the White House for his party.
If Republicans conclude that Democrats have been so diminished that
any Republican, centrist or not, can win the election, that could
hurt Bush's prospects.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, old-timers speak wistfully of the public
approbation that followed Watergate. Many doubt that the high
standard can be replicated. ``If you want to see the Congress sink
to a lower level than where the presidency is falling,'' said
former Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., who is now director of the
Institute of Politics at Harvard, ``just start the ideological
battle and watch the people switch their howitzers from the
president to Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   As high as the stakes are, no one seems to believe this time
that the American system of government is on the line. During
Watergate, there was much talk of a constitutional crisis. What if
Nixon barricaded himself in the White House or called out the Army
to defend him?
</P>
<P>
   No one talks that way now. Perhaps this is because the country
survived the ordeal so handily 24 years ago. Maybe it is because
with the end of the Cold War, nothing seems as serious as it did
then.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis now is not constitutional. It is political.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Long before the Asian economic crisis threatened a
broader global meltdown, U.S. officials saw a silver lining in all
those plunging markets and dissolving currencies. The world, it
said, was beginning to see the benefits of unfettered,
American-style capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   For a while it looked like a convincing argument. When South
Korea needed emergency Western aid, the quid pro quo was an
agreement to lift restrictions that had long kept foreign
competitors at bay, in everything from computers to financial
services. Politicians around the world reluctantly went along with
the Washington orthodoxy that if they stopped meddling in the
markets and let international investors move money freely in and
out of their countries, it would help restore confidence.
</P>
<P>
   It was a compelling pitch _ for a year or so. But now, after
some of the West's brightest ideas for engineering economic
recovery have gone up in flames, a few countries are marching the
other way. As more of the world's markets come unhinged _ last week
the contagion hit Brazil full force, and many now worry that the
rest of Latin America could succumb as well _ there is a modest
revolt under way against one of the biggest trends of the 1980s and
1990s, the view that money should move unimpeded around the world,
to the places where it can be used most efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   So far the revolt is contained to a few small economies:
Malaysia and Hong Kong, both of which have long been darlings of
U.S. companies seeking a base in Asia, and Russia, a country that
talked incessantly about reform but never adopted the mindset of a
market economy.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's latest prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov, gave voice to
his country's doubts about economic reform Friday, the day the
Russian Parliament confirmed him in office, when he asked: ``What
must we do? Repeat the wild capitalism that we had until now?'' The
answer, he said vaguely, was that ``the government should intervene
into economic affairs and regulate them,'' but he insisted that
effort would be more akin to Franklin D. Roosevelt's actions during
the Depression than to Soviet-style controls.
</P>
<P>
   All this amounts to a direct challenge to one of the few clear
themes of President Clinton's foreign policy: that the U.S. push
for more open markets and freer trade will not only bolster U.S.
prosperity, but it will also pave the way to more open societies
and democratization. After all, commerce and interchange with the
West are the force that is supposed to open up China gradually, to
say nothing of rebuilding Russia and spreading democracy in Asia
and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, real life is a lot messier. The United States deeply
interfered with the workings of its economy for most of its
history, and it still does in times of crisis. And China and
Singapore are prime examples of how free markets can thrive under
authoritarian rule.
</P>
<P>
   But two years ago it was hard to find finance ministers who
would argue _ on a theoretical level, at least _ that their
countries should cut themselves off from the global capital
markets. After all, they were standing at the spigot, soaking up
investments from around the world. Now that the foreign money is
pouring out in torrents _ a development that is producing
unemployment, inflation, political upheaval and painful recession _
the global economy looks a lot more like a global sinkhole.
</P>
<P>
   And suddenly politicians and economists are noting that the
countries that have fared best in these times of crisis _ China and
Chile, for example _ are also countries that have imposed rules
that make it difficult for investors to buy and sell local
currencies with abandon.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly many believe that the best way to practice capitalism
is to make sure that once the capital pours in it can't pour out
all at once.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only a bit of an overstatement to say that the
free-market IMF, Bob Rubin and Larry Summers model is in
shambles,'' said John Wadsworth, who runs Morgan Stanley's
operations in Asia, referring to the Treasury secretary and his
deputy. ``At this point the problems are so serious that
politicians figure that trying anything else is better.''
</P>
<P>
   The most direct assault, not surprisingly, has come from the
fiery leader of Malaysia, Mahathir Mohamad. A year ago he was the
first to blame Asia's troubles on a vague conspiracy of Western
financiers: At various times he blamed speculators, currency
traders, unnamed Wall Street powerhouses and, of course, George
Soros. But all the while he kept accepting International Monetary
Fund-style remedies, drastically cutting spending and hiking
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Until 10 days ago, when it became clear that Malaysia's
once-vibrant economy was entering its deepest crisis since the
country's communist emergency, a Cold War skirmish that shook the
country 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In one stroke, Mahathir fired his Western-thinking finance
minister, Anwar Ibrahim, who was also Mahathir's heir apparent.
Then he shut Malaysia off from the world currency markets,
declaring that any of the country's currency held outside its
borders would be worthless.
</P>
<P>
   That made it impossible for currency traders to deal in the
ringgit outside Malaysia, where Mahathir can control the
transactions. It also made it somewhat more difficult for foreign
giants, including Coca-Cola and Intel and Motorola, to take profits
out of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way to manage the economy is to insulate from
currency speculators and traders,'' Mahathir said, speaking darkly
about the possibility that Malaysia's downturn might tear apart the
delicate fabric of the country's society, an uneasy mix of Malays _
who are mostly Islamic _ and ethnic Chinese. ``The free market has
failed disastrously because of abuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Mahathir was denounced in capitals around the world
as an economic retrograde. In Washington, some officials quietly
expressed the hope that his experiment would fail so spectacularly
that the smoldering ruins of the Malaysian economy would act as a
caution to other countries.
</P>
<P>
   But while many of Mahathir's Asian neighbors assured the IMF
that they would not follow the Mahathir path, they were also
watching carefully to see if he would succeed. He almost certainly
will stop the devastating fall of his currency.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether he will also scare off the international
investors who turned his country's old plantations into gleaming
factories that became the envy of Asia.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Mahathir went to an extreme, but the same notion has infected
the city that was once the embodiment of unfettered markets: Hong
Kong. With its trade-dependent economy in free fall, and its
currency under attack by speculators who use the Hong Kong dollar
as a proxy to place their bets about China, the Hong Kong
authorities began spending the region's huge reserves to prop up
the stock market. They also adopted rules to make it harder for
speculators to bet against the Hong Kong dollar.
</P>
<P>
   A top official of the government, Andrew Sheng, rushed to
Washington last week to make the case that Hong Kong was not
abandoning the free market. It was just making sure, he said, that
the region was not destabilized as billions upon billions of
dollars that came gradually into Hong Kong head for the exits all
at once.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are addressing a situation the world has never seen
before,'' he insisted. ``The stresses and strains of flows of money
create a danger of destabilization.'' But he could not help adding,
``There is now a healthy debate about whether the Washington
consensus about how to solve the world's economic problems will
really work.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that the ``Washington consensus'' itself is
fraying, as Clinton's team _ distracted by scandal, overwhelmed by
other foreign problems _ searches for new approaches to contain an
increasingly global economic crisis that refuses to be quelled.
Curiously, officials here are less vociferous than ever in their
opposition to some kinds of controls on the flow of capital.
</P>
<P>
   A little more than a year ago, for example, the Treasury was
urging the Chinese, for example, to make their currency completely
convertible. No one has repeated that advice recently.

   Reno Announces Review of Clinton Campaign Ads
</P>
<P>
   As if the White House did not have enough problems, Attorney
General Janet Reno moved an important step closer to seeking an
independent prosecutor to investigate whether President Clinton
violated federal election laws during his 1996 re-election
campaign. Reno ordered a 90-day review of whether the $42 million
the Democrats split among state party organizations for general
advertising was actually an illegal scheme to finance an ad
campaign for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's decision marked the third time in two weeks that she
opened campaign finance inquiries that could lead to independent
prosecutors: The others involve fund-raising calls made by Vice
President Al Gore and possible perjury by Harold M. Ickes, the
former deputy White House chief of staff.

   Campaign Finance Bill Dies
</P>
<P>
   The Senate effectively buried an overhaul of campaign finance
laws for this year. Senators voted 52-48 to cut off debate and vote
on a bill to ban unlimited, unregulated donations, called soft
money, to political parties. But supporters failed to muster the 60
votes needed to end a Republican filibuster, so the bill was
withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's supporters had hoped to build new momentum from the
House's strong vote last month for a similar bill.

   Relief for North Korea
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said they were readying a large humanitarian food
shipment to North Korea. The move was part of an effort to keep the
secretive country talking about its nuclear program, which includes
a large underground site that American intelligence agencies
believe could be part of a new nuclear complex.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement to provide aid was made despite North Korea's
recent launching of a multistage missile over Japan two weeks ago.
The North was condemned for the act, but insisted that it had
merely launched a small satellite to broadcast praise for the late
dictator Kim Il Sung. Now it appears that there really was a tiny
satellite, but that it failed to get into orbit.

   Method to Pick Baby's Sex
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in the millennia that humans have tried to
select the sex of their baby, success may be at hand. Doctors at
the Genetics &AMP; IVF Institute in Fairfax, Va., reported that they
can sort sperm by exploiting the one difference between sperm that
produce a male and those that produce a female: Sperm that produce
a male have 2.8 percent less DNA.
</P>
<P>
   The method does not guarantee couples a baby with the sex of
their choice _ it merely stacks the odds. But already questions are
being raised. Is society ready to go down this path? And how safe
is the method?

   Congo Peace Talks End

   A summit meeting of African leaders to negotiate a peace
settlement for the Congo ended with little more than a joint
statement endorsing peace as an ultimate goal. All the parties
involved in the conflict got together, but they had little to show

   One way to avoid most deadly E. coli bacteria is to tinker with

University have come up with another solution: First tinker with

</P>
<P>
   Feeding grain to cattle in the days before slaughter, they
found, can foster the growth of E. coli, but if the cattle switch
to hay and grass in those crucial days, the bacteria have only a
slim chance of surviving.
</P>
<P>
   If further research backs up the Cornell findings, the
Agriculture Department could recommend changes in cattle feeding.

   Justices to Hear Census Case
</P>
<P>
   The constitutional mandate to conduct a national headcount every
10 years sounds simple enough, and once it was. But a highly
charged debate over how to run the census has reached the Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   The justices agreed to decide whether the Clinton
administration's plan to have the Census Bureau use statistical
sampling as part of the census for the year 2000, to correct for an
anticipated undercount of some 4 million people using traditional
door-to-door and mailed survey methods, is permissible. Poor people
and members of minorities are missed disproportionately in the
traditional census.
</P>
<P>
   A special three-judge U.S. District Court ruled last month, in a
suit brought by the House of Representatives, that the sampling
proposal violated federal law. The Supreme Court will hear
arguments Nov. 30.

   U.N. Extends Iraq Sanctions

Council pulled together in surprising strength and voted
unanimously to deprive Baghdad of any chance of having sanctions
lifted until the inspectors were allowed to resume their jobs.

   Hope in Swissair Crash
</P>
<P>
   In a case of deja vu, The U.S. Navy salvage ship Grapple is once
again preparing to raise airplane parts from the ocean. It almost
seems as if the crash of TWA Flight 800 off New York in July 1996
had repeated itself Sept. 2 when Swissair Flight 111 crashed in the
Atlantic Ocean off Nova Scotia, killing all 229 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   But it is already clear that the crew of the Swissair MD-11 had
at least 16 minutes to struggle for survival, while the TWA Boeing
747 exploded without warning. And while the TWA crash is still
unsolved, the Swissair plane carried an advanced flight data
recorder; combined with evidence from the cockpit, investigators
believe they will eventually find the cause of the disaster.

   Big-Time Sports, Big-Time Bids
</P>
<P>
   If you thought Mark McGwire set the only sports record by
swatting his 62nd home run Tuesday, you'd be wrong. The record
price paid for a sports franchise tumbled twice in two days, making
the $311 million paid by Rupert Murdoch for the Los Angeles Dodgers
last January look like a Filene's Basement bargain.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the National Football League accepted $530 million
for the new Cleveland Browns from Alfred Lerner, chairman of MBNA
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   One day later, BSkyB, Murdoch's British satellite TV company,
agreed to pay $1 billion in cash and stock for Manchester United,
Britain's richest soccer club with $45 million in profits last
year. The team is central to the English Premier League, BSkyB's
prized attraction.
</P>
<P>
   Murdoch is accustomed to paying outlandish prices for sports
properties to enhance his global media empire. The Dodgers'
acquisition secured the team's presence on Fox Sports West,
Murdoch's regional sports channel in southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Buying Manchester United means Murdoch will have a team owner's
role in the future of the Premier League, especially when TV rights
are renegotiated.
</P>
<P>
   Lerner, who is not in the media business, offered this
perspective on buying the successors to the original Browns
franchise, which moved to Baltimore in 1996. ``If you ask me how it
feels to write a check for a pair of shoes, I could tell you,'' he
said. ``But at this level, it's a unique experience.''
</P>
<P>
   It makes one wonder what owners who bought their teams on the
cheap are thinking. What, after all, could George Steinbrenner and
his partners get for the Yankees, which cost them only $10 million
in 1973?

   The Dow Feels the Yo-Yo Effect
</P>
<P>
   The stock market has given investors more than a few jolts
lately, but some bumps aren't what they used to be.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell nearly 100
points in the first 15 minutes of trading, then turned on a dime
and in the next 20 minutes shot up more than 200 points from its
low. The turnaround came as President Clinton, appearing at a
televised prayer breakfast, asked Monica Lewinsky and her family
for forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow finished up 179.96 points, at 7,795.50. It was the
fourth consecutive trading session _ and eighth in the last 10
trading days _ in which the Dow rose or fell by more than 100
points.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly the stock market is in turmoil. But is the market's
recent volatility any worse than at other times of political and
economic uncertainty?
</P>
<P>
   By one measure of volatility _ how often the Dow has risen or
fallen by more than 1 percent in a single day _ the year so far is
the market's most volatile in more than a decade. In fact, 1998
isn't out of line with previous periods of extreme ups and downs _
like 1987, when the stock market crashed, or 1980, when the silver
market crashed.
</P>
<P>
   There is no shortage of causes for the recent swings in the Dow.
Faltering economies in Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America have
begun to put a squeeze on the profits of U.S. companies, causing
investors to fear that the seven-year economic boom could be coming
to an end. In addition, uncertainty about Clinton's problems has
caused big market gyrations.
</P>
<P>
   But there's also a psychological dimension: Many investors are
only beginning to get used to triple-digit fluctuations in the
Dow's close. In 1987, a swing of 100 points equaled 4 percent of
the Dow. When the index peaked above 9,000 in July, the same
100-point move represented little more than 1 percent. Still a bit
unnerving, but hardly cause for panic.

 THE LAWSUITS PILE UP, MATCHING THE LIST OF ATROCITIES

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fifty-three years after it ended, the Second World War is
spawning a new form of international justice that victims hail as
long overdue. But some of its targets decry it as a dubious new
legal cottage industry, in which some lawyers seize upon human
rights abuses as the basis for emotionally charged class-action
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of last month's $1.25 billion settlement between
Holocaust survivors and Swiss banks that were accused of profiting
from looted Jewish assets, some officials and lawyers involved in
the Holocaust cases say they fear that opportunistic lawyers may
see a potential gold mine in the precedent, and will seek every
opportunity to file suits on behalf of victims of past atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worry about an explosion of these kind of suits,'' said Bert
Neuborne, a New York University law professor working without fee
on the Holocaust cases. ``That a lot of people will see a potential
for what they think is a fast buck.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not the only thorny question being raised. More tricky,
perhaps, is the question of where it will all end. If Holocaust
victims are compensated now, as native American tribes were
compensated for past wrongs over the previous two decades, who
might be next? African-Americans because their ancestors were
slaves? Bosnians who consider the United Nations accountable for
breaking promises to protect them?
</P>
<P>
   These are, of course, genuine victims with genuine grievances.
The problem is that sometimes sincere efforts to right clear moral
wrongs can be seized upon by people with less-than-noble motives.
And under legal standards, it is easier to demonstrate damage from
some historical wrongs than from others.
</P>
<P>
   The number of suits keeps growing. On Friday, Melvin Weiss, a
nationally known class-action lawyer, filed in federal court in
Newark, N.J., against the German conglomerate Krupp, charging that
it had profited from slave labor during World War II. Two weeks
ago, another group of lawyers filed another class action suit in
federal court in Brooklyn against more than a dozen German
companies, including Krupp.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, suits have also been filed against Ford
Motor Co., Italian and German insurance companies and French banks
accused of profiting from the cruelties of Hitler's Germany. Banks
in Sweden, Spain, Portugal and Argentina could be next, Neuborne
said.
</P>
<P>
   Asian-American groups, meanwhile, have been scouring the United
States for victims of the Nanking Massacre and the use of forced
labor by wartime Japan. They hope to file class-action lawsuits in
U.S. courts against Japanese corporations, such as Mitsubishi, as
well as the Japanese government.
</P>
<P>
   And some black leaders have repeatedly called for reparations to
be paid for slave labor in the United States. ``If the descendants
of Nazi-era slave laborers deserve some compensation, why don't the
descendants of the victims of 250 years of American slave labor
deserve compensation?'' asked Eric Foner, a Columbia University
history professor.
</P>
<P>
   But Foner also said it was a difficult question: ``How far back
do you go? If we want to go all the way back, all the land would go
back to the Indians.''
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts warn that suits involving other historic
grievances may not lead to settlements as quickly as some of the
Holocaust cases. Kent Syverud, dean of the Vanderbilt University
law school, said suing for damages based on slave labor in the
United States would be difficult. He said few records exist that
define exactly who was a slave, who is a descendant of a specific
slave, and how much the slave-owner benefited from the slave's
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Holocaust suits are different in that they involve much
more concrete and identifiable events and records,'' he said. ``The
events of slavery are very hard to link it to a specific bank
account.''
</P>
<P>
   Efforts by groups to sue the American government for damages
have achieved mixed results. In the 1970s, Native American tribes
successfully sued for the rights to control and profit from vast
amounts of land. But legal actions by Japanese-Americans interned
during World War II were less successful, and they had to wait
until Congress awarded them $20,000 each in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Among the newer Holocaust suits, the Ford case may provide the
clearest indication of difficulties ahead for claimants. While some
German companies, for example Volkswagen, have already agreed to
create some form of fund to compensate former slave laborers, Ford
is vowing to fight.
</P>
<P>
   In the suit, Weiss' team argues that Henry Ford's anti-Semitic
remarks in the 1920s and alleged close relationship with Hitler
resulted in Ford's subsidiary in Germany never being taken over by
the Nazis. But Ian Slater, a Ford spokesman in the United States,
said the company lost control of its subsidiary during the war and
the factory was badly damaged when Ford regained control of it. He
said the suit was an unfair attempt to use bad publicity to force
the company to settle.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the question of lawyers' fees. Weiss said he would
request minimal fees. Ed Fagan, who is working on the Swiss bank
and German slave labor cases and said he hoped to represent victims
of Japanese slave labor practices, said he expected a standard
share of settlements. The World Jewish Congress and other Jewish
groups that support such legal claims are calling for all lawyers
involved in the Holocaust cases to work free.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not believe that the Holocaust is an area anyone should
be profiting from,'' said Elan Steinberg, the organization's
executive director.

 &HT;    George Wallace, paradox of Southern politics
 &HT;    By Tom Bennett and Jim Yardley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   George Wallace was a Southern populist and opportunist. He
embodied Southern racism in the tumultuous 1960s, grew more
moderate in the 1970s and asked for forgiveness _ and black votes _
in the 1980s. He was despised and admired _ and not necessarily
along racial lines.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, who served four terms as governor of Alabama, died of
cardiac arrest Sunday night in Montgomery while suffering from a
blood infection. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama, where he was a folk hero, a generation grew up
having known only brief periods when the governor's mansion was not
occupied by a Wallace _ George or his first wife, Lurleen. He was
governor from 1963-67, 1971-79 and 1983-87. She served a partial
term as governor in 1967-68 when by law he could not succeed
himself. Lurleen Wallace died in office.
</P>
<P>
   Early in his political career, in the 1940s, Wallace was labeled
``liberal'' when he backed populist Gov. James E. ``Big Jim''
Folsom. But Folsom's popularity dimmed after the Supreme Court
outlawed school segregation, and Wallace dropped him cold. Wallace
won the governorship in 1962 and declared in his 1963 inaugural
address, ``Segregation now! Segregation tomorrow! Segregation
forever!''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace ran for president four times, including in 1972 when
Arthur Bremer shot him during a campaign stop in Laurel, Md.
Wallace was left paralyzed, and his national influence gradually
faded. But future presidents from Richard Nixon to Bill Clinton
would adopt many of his themes, including welfare reform.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace toned down his racial views in the 1974 governor's race,
then came full circle in 1982, winning the governorship for the
fourth and final time with 90 percent of the black vote after he
declared segregation to be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   George Corley Wallace Jr. was born Aug. 25, 1919, in the tiny
southeast Alabama town of Clio. His home county, Barbour, was known
as ``the Home of the Governors,'' having produced seven. He was the
oldest son of George C. ``Sag'' Wallace Sr., a farmer, and Mozelle
Smith Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   The young Wallace began his political career at 16 as a page in
the state Senate. At the University of Alabama, he was freshman
class president and two-time state bantamweight boxing champion. He
received a law degree in 1942. To make ends meet, he worked as a
busboy, taxi driver, dogcatcher and magazine salesman.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, he enlisted in the Army Air Forces, but
washed out of pilots' school after contracting spinal meningitis.
On furlough in 1943, he married Lurleen Burns, a clerk at the
Kresge's store in Tuscaloosa.
</P>
<P>
   Aboard a B-29 superfortress, Wallace flew 19 often-harrowing
bombing missions over Japan. He was discharged after the war with a
10 percent disability related to ``a nervous condition resulting
from combat fatigue.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace was known as a ``liberal'' after his 1946 election in
Barbour County to the state House of Representatives. In 1948, at
the Democratic Convention, he was one of the few Southerners not to
walk out with the ``Dixiecrats'' protesting a civil rights plank in
the platform.
</P>
<P>
   In 1952, he was elected a judge of the 3rd Judicial District _
Barbour, Dale and Bullock counties. Two years later, the political
winds changed with the Supreme Court's landmark Brown desegregation
ruling. Wallace changed, too. Folsom as governor invited Harlem
attorney Adam Clayton Powell to the governor's mansion for a drink.
Wallace and others became segregationists.
</P>
<P>
   The only governor's race Wallace would lose would be his first
in 1958. All 13 candidates were segregationists, but Attorney
General John Patterson emerged as the most irreconcilable of all.
Patterson and Wallace led the Democratic primary and met in a
runoff where Wallace labeled Patterson the Ku Klux Klan candidate.
Patterson crushed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patterson out-niggered me,'' Wallace said in defeat, ``and,
boys, I'm not going to be out-niggered again.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace entered the 1962 governor's race pledging to ``stand in
the door'' to prevent integration. His newfound intransigence
carried him to victory. At his swearing-in, Wallace stood on a star
on the Capitol steps in Montgomery marking the spot where Jefferson
Davis had been sworn in as Confederate president.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most infamous declarations in Southern demagoguery
followed. Wallace said: ``In the name of the greatest people that
have ever trod this Earth, I draw the line in the dust and toss the
gauntlet before the feet of tyranny and I say, Segregation now!
Segregation tomorrow! Segregation forever!''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace's defining moment came only months later when a federal
judge ordered the University of Alabama to admit two black
students, Jimmy Hood and Vivian Malone. Hood and Malone arrived on
the Tuscaloosa campus June 11, 1963. Wallace and federal officials
played out a drama fulfilling Wallace's ``stand'' pledge, and
saving face for all while avoiding violence.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace stood in front of a door as U.S. Assistant Attorney
General Nicholas Katzenbach and the students approached. Wallace
threw up a hand. Katzenbach handed him a cease-and-desist order,
and Wallace read a statement berating the federal authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Katzenbach withdrew. The students were taken to dorm rooms. The
Alabama National Guard was federalized. The students later
registered without incident as Wallace returned to Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   Three months later, on Sept. 15, 1963, the Sixteenth Street
Baptist Church in Birmingham was bombed; four young girls were
killed. Wallace denounced the bombing. But President John F.
Kennedy implied some culpability on the part of Wallace when he
said that it was ``regrettable that public disparagement of law and
order had encouraged violence which had fallen on the innocent.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace's ``stand'' vaulted him onto the national stage. He made
his first run for president in 1964 as a Democrat, challenging
President Lyndon Johnson. Wallace earned large support in primaries
in Wisconsin, Indiana and Maryland, but supporters failed to place
him on the ballots in Georgia, Mississippi and South Carolina. The
death blow to his candidacy was the Republicans' nomination of
conservative Sen. Barry Goldwater. Wallace withdrew.
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama, the increasingly bloody civil rights struggle
continued to dominate politics. In the historic 1965 Selma Voting
Rights March, state troopers beat and tear-gassed 700 blacks and
whites attempting to march to Montgomery. Wallace, who said the
march ``will not be tolerated,'' was blamed for the brutality. Two
months later, Atlanta's Martin Luther King Jr. led marchers to
Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   Forbidden by the state constitution to seek re-election, Wallace
ran his wife in 1966. Lurleen Wallace swept the Democratic primary
and the general election. Wallace openly ran the state from an
office across from his wife's office until her death from cancer in
May 1968. Lt. Gov. Albert Brewer succeeded her.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, meanwhile, launched his most successful and sustained
presidential run in 1968 as a third-party candidate. He collected 3
million signatures and made the ballot in all 50 states. Wallace
won 9,90l,151 popular votes, finished third behind Richard Nixon
and Hubert Humphrey, and carried Georgia, Alabama, Arkansas,
Louisiana and Mississippi. A politician without an office, Wallace
ran for governor again in 1970. After a bitter Democratic primary,
Wallace trailed the incumbent Brewer. But he won the runoff,
559,832 to 525,951, and easily took the general election.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1971, Wallace married Cornelia Ellis Snively, 19
years his junior. She was a beautiful divorcee who was Folsom's
niece and who once had performed in the water-ski show at Florida's
Cypress Gardens. They would divorce in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace became a Democrat again for his third presidential run
in 1972. He reeled off primary victories in Florida, Alabama,
Tennessee and North Carolina, and finished second in Wisconsin,
Pennsylvania and Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   On May 15, 1972, Wallace was walking among supporters at a
Laurel, Md., shopping center when Bremer, a young drifter, shot him
several times, leaving him critically wounded. The next day, the
hospitalized Wallace won the Maryland and Michigan primaries.
</P>
<P>
   But he was in a hospital bed for seven weeks, and eventually
underwent four major operations, several minor surgical procedures,
and suffered various complications. He tried acupuncture and DMSO.
He suffered a progressive loss of hearing. The days before the
assassination attempt would mark the zenith of Wallace's national
popularity. Afterward, he gradually faded from the national scene.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, with a rewritten Alabama constitution permitting
re-election, Wallace was elected governor for the third time in a
landslide. Two years later, he again sought the presidency but
eventually bowed out in favor of another Southerner, Jimmy Carter
of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Forbidden to seek a third straight term, Wallace left the
governor's mansion in January 1979 with his political career
seemingly over. Two years later, he was married for the third time,
to Linda Lee Taylor, 29 years his junior. She was a divorcee and
country music singer who had been ``Lisa'' in a singing duo, ``Mona
and Lisa,'' that performed during his political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   His final political two-step came in 1982, when Wallace returned
and openly courted black voters in the governor's race. Segregation
is wrong, he now said. Facing Republican Emory Folmar in the
general election, Wallace received 90 percent of the black vote to
win easily.
</P>
<P>
   He left office for the last time in 1987 and lived in a
ranch-style house in Montgomery until his death. He and Taylor
divorced that year.
</P>
<P>
   Tuskegee University awarded him an honorary degree in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Surviving are a son by his first marriage, George Wallace Jr. of
Montgomery; three daughters by his first marriage, Peggy Sue
Kennedy of Montgomery and Bobbi Jo Parsons and Janie Lee Dye, both
of Birmingham; a brother, Jack Wallace of Clayton, Ala.; a sister,
Marianne Dauphin of Montgomery; and eight grandchildren.

 &HT;    George Wallace: Precursor of modern conservatism
 &HT;    Staff report
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dan T. Carter, Andrew Mellon professor of history at Atlanta's
Emory University, is the author of ``The Politics of Rage: George
Wallace, the Origins of the New Conservatism and the Transformation
of American Politics.'' He answered questions about George Wallace
recently:
</P>
<P>
   Q: Former Montgomery Advertiser-Journal editor and Carter White
House official Ray Jenkins has said that George Wallace's ``most
enduring legacy'' is ``Richard Nixon's `Southern strategy' and the
fulfillment of it in Ronald Reagan.'' Do you agree? It seems to
leave out credit for the 1964 Barry Goldwater campaign for
president as being the criticial event swinging the South to the
GOP.
</P>
<P>
   A: Goldwater's legacy is relevant, but keep in mind that to many
Republicans (including Richard Nixon), Goldwater's strategy had
backfired. (Goldwater lost to Lyndon Johnson in a landslide,
carrying only six states _ Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Louisiana,
Mississippi and South Carolina.) The real shift for the center of
the Republican Party toward the Southern strategy came under the
leadership of Nixon, particularly after the '68 election when he
saw how much he had been threatened by George Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Wallace told The Associated Press in 1992 that he ``should
have been vice president in 1972.'' Do you agree? Would a
doctrinaire liberal like George McGovern, in the bitter Vietnam-era
climate, have named archconservative Wallace his running mate?
</P>
<P>
   A: Ray Jenkins has the final word on this, I think, since he
talked to both Hubert Humphrey (about the 1968 race) and McGovern
(about '72). Neither would have run with Wallace. That kind of
ticket was a pig that would not fly. Despite his crushing defeat in
'72, McGovern wasn't stupid.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you feel regarding Wallace's sea change to moderatism
on the race issue? Was it a genuine spiritual conversion or
political expediency?
</P>
<P>
   A: The late Bob Vance (Alabama Democratic Party chairman and
later an 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals judge) had the best
response to that question. When asked it by an Alabama public
television director for a two-hour documentary on Wallace, he
paused and said, `His philosophy never got in the way.' I don't
think he was a visceral racist in the sense that it overshadowed
his thinking, so it wasn't that hard to change his public views
once the political terrain shifted.''

 VOLUNTEER: THAT'S AN ORDER 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturday, September (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By DIRK JOHNSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ They just don't make young people the way they used
to. Nary a generation has looked upon its callow successors without
finding them soft, spoiled and self-centered.
</P>
<P>
   The old remedy, a good swift kick in the pants, is obsolete,
even illegal. Nowadays, volunteerism is the most popular
prescription for improving young people and it has the added virtue
of saving the world. But since this is America, there's a group or
two somewhere voluntarily opposed to it.
</P>
<P>
   To instill a sense of civic duty in teen-agers, the Chicago
public school system has enacted a policy requiring its students to
perform 40 hours of public service to earn a high school diploma.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want students to learn the importance of community,'' said
Bruce Marchiafava, a spokesman for the Chicago schools, the
nation's third-largest system behind New York and Los Angeles.
``They need to know that community is about giving, not just
getting.''
</P>
<P>
   While Chicago is the nation's biggest school system to make
public service a requirement, experts on volunteerism say thousands
of American schools demand that their students get out and help a
good cause. Every student in Maryland's public schools must fulfill
a public service requirement. Many prep schools routinely bus
students to soup kitchens, mentoring programs, children-in-crisis
and elder-care centers and literacy tutorials.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of public service and self-sacrifice has been a
cherished American value long before John F. Kennedy's exhortation
to ``ask what you can do for your country.'' But never before in
peacetime has there been so much emphasis on volunteering. ``Every
young American,'' President Clinton has said, ``should be taught
the joy and the duty of serving.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the president's summit on volunteerism in Philadelphia
last year, Colin Powell has been traveling the country encouraging
young people to give of themselves. And every teen-ager applying to
a top college knows that high test scores and grades can be a
two-legged stool without some evidence of good works.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of making young people more useful, though, has
provoked some criticism, especially when such volunteerism is
mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   On a practical level, requiring public service can be an
administrative and legal nightmare. Is the school district liable
if a child is hurt while fulfilling the requirement. And who
decides which charitable organizations are acceptable?
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's school administrators, who are still working on its
new policy, are aware of the quandaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you let students work for an anti-handgun group, do you
also let them work for the NRA?'' Marchiafava asked, referring to
the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   Those very problems have stopped other big city districts like
Los Angeles from requiring volunteerism. Though the idea has been
raised in New York, J.D. LaRock, a spokesman for New York City
Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew, said officials had no plans to
consider such a requirement. Mandatory volunteerism was a
contradiction in terms, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The courts have upheld the rights of school districts to require
public service, rejecting claims that it amounted to involuntary
servitude and violated the Constitution. One of the unsuccessful
suits filed by the Institute for Justice argued that the 13th
Amendment forbids involuntary servitude. The group also argued in
the case of one Long Island, N.Y., teen-ager that the high &UR;  &LR; school
student came from a working-class family and needed to earn money
to contribute to the family's coffers.
</P>
<P>
   John Kramer, a spokesman for the Institute for Justice, a
Washington-based research organization with a libertarian bent,
said that surveys indicate that between 4 percent and 15 percent of
all schools now require some sort of public service, a form of
learning that some educators call ``infusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Kramer said many districts have backed away from mandatory
volunteerism. One of the rubs with such programs, he said, is that
parents are roped in as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who do you think is going to do all the driving to and from
these volunteer activities?'' Kramer said.
</P>
<P>
   For students who bristle at the notion of required public
service, the Ayn Rand Institute has offered an internship designed
to allow them to fulfill the requirement by protesting
volunteerism.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteerism has become ``the most explicit moral crusade this
country has seen in some time,'' said Michael Berliner, the
executive director of the research organization founded by an heir
of Ayn Rand, the late philosopher who argued that people should be
guided by self-interest and reject the notion of charity as a moral
virtue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We disagree with this idea that service to the community is
the ultimate good,'' he said.

   UNITED NATIONS _ When the annual limousine-and-sirens season
opens at the United Nations on Sept. 21 with high-level speeches in
the General Assembly, a lot of the world's bad boys won't be
anywhere near the podium. They always stay home.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam Hussein won't be here. He never is. He hangs out in Iraq,
sleeping in a different bed every night. Moammar Gadhafi stays put
in Libya. Kim Jong Il of North Korea finds he has other things to
do. There is a tradition to uphold: Pol Pot never made an
appearance, nor did Stalin or Albania's Enver Hoxha.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hafez al-Assad has never come, but he never goes anywhere
much,'' said Sir Brian Urquhart, a former undersecretary-general,
who in 40 years with the organization saw a lot of heads of state
come and go, but not Syria's president. ``Hafez al-Assad doesn't
travel in the Arab world either,'' Sir Brian said. ``He almost
never leaves Damascus.''
</P>
<P>
   Sir Brian remembers that Idi Amin of Uganda came once, with a
bodyguard unit of strikingly statuesque women, to speak as the
chairman of the Organization of African Unity. It was, Sir Brian
said, ``an amazing show.''
</P>
<P>
   Jean Gazarian, who has worked at the United Nations since 1946
and served for years as director of U.N. affairs, was caught in the
middle of another great performance in the 1950s, when Soviet
leader Nikita Khrushchev suddenly interrupted a speech by British
Prime Minister Harold Macmillan by shouting in Russian, pounding
his fist and then banging a shoe on his delegation's desk. ``Mr.
Macmillan stopped, raised his reading glasses and said, `I would
like to have a translation if he is really saying something,'''
Gazarian recalls.
</P>
<P>
   But at least Khrushchev was in the Assembly to be heard. The
people who never show up are often the ones other leaders most need
to approach on neutral ground. Just observing troublemakers close
up can be a useful experience. Gazarian said it was fascinating to
watch Cuban President Fidel Castro evolve in his very few visits
over several decades from a guerrilla leader in uniform to a
statesman in a suit.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the appearance of a president signals a significant
change in a country's attitude, or a move toward a more democratic
society. This year, Iranian President Mohamad Khatami will speak,
making his first trip to New York and perhaps giving his country a
new international face. He will be joined by Gen. Abdulsalami
Abubakar, the interim president of Nigeria, who has promised an
election next year to end military rule.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the United States has always attended _ until
now, at least. This year there has been some confusion about
whether the need to deal with scandal in Washington will make him
the latest no-show, but U.N. officials are still assuming he'll
come.
</P>
<P>
   Among those leaders who rule their nations with tactics that
range from whimsy to terror, by contrast, there seems to be a sense
that there is something unhealthy about the free air of the annual
general debate _ not that most people would call the self-serving,
made-for-local-television speeches a debate. For leaders of
dictatorial regimes, there is nothing to discuss in New York.
Besides, the audience has not been tamed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming to New York does have this totemic quality of
submitting yourself to multilateral governance,'' Ruth Wedgwood of
the Council on Foreign Relations said. ``This is the house of
sanctions.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, absence from home could be risky. ``A lot of them
would unwise to leave their own countries,'' Sir Brian said of the
totalitarians, suggesting that they might not get back in.
</P>
<P>
   From the totalitarians' viewpoint, New York is scary. The place
is not under their control. They can easily imagine that the
streets harbor U.S. government assassination squads. Certainly
there are exile groups with scores to settle. Diplomats say the
fear of attack most often keeps controversial leaders away.
</P>
<P>
   Yet over the years, there has been only one known assassination
attempt on U.N. territory, although diplomats have been killed on
city streets. Cuban exiles once plotted to kill Che Guevara. They
were able to fire a diversionary bazooka toward U.N. headquarters
from Queens, across the East River, to distract guards' attention
from the General Assembly, but the team planning to hit the main
target got trapped in traffic in the Holland Tunnel, where they
were duly found and arrested on a tip from the Secret Service. New
York has secret weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of countries under sanctions, like Libya and Iraq, are
not barred from coming to New York to speak their pieces, because
the 1947 agreement between Washington and the United Nations
explicitly guarantees access.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, the United States defied this agreement and refused a
visa to Yasser Arafat, whose Palestine Liberation Organization had
just been given observer status at the United Nations. The General
Assembly decamped to Geneva to hear Arafat speak. In 1995, Arafat,
now part of the Mideast peace process, addressed the same 50th
anniversary General Assembly session that Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak thought prudent to skip.
</P>
<P>
   Some leaders don't come, because somebody else is sitting in
their seats. The Mullah Omar, Afghanistan's spiritual leader, and
the Taliban, his religious movement, which controls most of the
country, would love a chance to speak this year. But Afghanistan's
seat is still held by Burhanuddin Rabbani, the president driven out
of Kabul and into exile in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   None of this should suggest that all the missing faces in the
U.N. autumn general debate belong to rogues. Charles de Gaulle
never came to address the United Nations, because he didn't much
like the organization. And Mao Tse-tung, who waited more than two
decades to claim China's seat after he came to power in 1949, was
by 1971 old and tired and badly buffeted by the Cultural
Revolution. He died in 1976, before China got full U.S. diplomatic
recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, says Chen Ranfeng of China's U.N. mission, ``We believe
that the chairman didn't like traveling to foreign countries.''

 HOW SCHOOLS MEASURE THE TALENT TO TEACH  
 (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Massachusetts Board of Education chairman John Silber recently
berated deans of education schools for standards so low that nearly
six of every 10 prospects who took the state's new basic skills
exam for teachers failed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``A high school senior should have been able to pass this,''
said Silber, who helped develop the test. ``Something ought to be
done to bring talented people in.''
</P>
<P>
   But how do you measure the talent to teach? And how do you turn
knowledgeable people into talented educators? Is an exam like
Massachusetts' a tool to raise standards or does it represent the
long, stultifying reach of an educational bureaucracy?
</P>
<P>
   As states raise academic standards for students, New York and
others are moving to stiffen their credentialing requirements to
make sure that teachers can teach a more rigorous curriculum.
Meanwhile, teacher shortages are requiring many states and
localities to hire personnel who don't meet the requirements. Among
the latest crop of 5,000 hired in New York City, one in four isn't
fully certified, which is an improvement over the one in two of 10
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Some states are reassessing the effectiveness of written exams
in gauging how well a person will perform in the classroom. At
least two, Ohio and California, are conducting pilot programs
involving intensive review of beginning teachers.
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio program involves interviewing and observing the new
teachers on their curriculum and methods, observing them in class
for a day or more and then reinterviewing them. Assessors also
examine lesson plans and students' work before deciding on a score
or a recommendation on certification.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really ensuring the performance is successful and holding
the individual accountable for how they do in classes,'' said Mary
Troyer, the director of the program. ``I wouldn't say we had a
large number of teachers who were miserable failures in the past.
It's just an extra accountability piece.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohio's program is modeled on an updated teacher certification
exam developed five years ago by the Educational Testing Service of
Princeton, N.J., which is now used by 31 states.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the test includes an assessment of the teacher in the
classroom, which reflects the idea that written exams do not fully
detect how well a fresh recruit will do in the classroom. So far no
state has yet adopted this kind of review of rookie teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``To do performance assessment is very expensive,'' said Mari
Pearlman, vice president of teaching and learning at the
Educational Testing Service. ``People who have to do the evaluation
must be practitioners themselves. You need to train people to
actually observe.''
</P>
<P>
   After the famous 1983 report ``A Nation at Risk,'' by the
National Commission on Excellence in Education, warned that the
poor level of teaching college graduates was hindering American
children from competing academically with peers around the globe, a
follow-up study in 1986 by Carnegie Corp.'s Task Force on Teaching
as a Profession recommended the creation in 1987 of the nonprofit
National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, a rigorous
voluntary national certification program.
</P>
<P>
   So far 912 teachers from 41 states and the District of Columbia
have won certification, or 45 percent of those who tried.
Applicants must successfully complete an arduous year-long
examination of lesson plans, student work samples, and videotapes
and analyses of classroom instruction.
</P>
<P>
   But drawbacks include a $2,000 exam fee (some states now pay all
or part of the cost). And the test is not recommended for those
with less than three years of teaching experience. Only recently
have any states begun to recognize the board certification in place
of their own exams.
</P>
<P>
   Still, said Mary-Dean Barringer, vice president for teacher
programs at the board, ``we would hope there is enough incentive
for teachers to publicly affirm their teaching at this high level.
Our goal is to drive the standard of teaching quality by getting
states to embrace the high standards.''

   A Test for Beginners Only
</P>
<P>
   The following sample questions, and the two brief essays on
which they are based, are from the Praxis Series, an exam devised
by the Educational Testing Service of Princeton, N.J. The questions
are designed to evaluate beginning teachers.

<P>
   ``Lyndon Johnson's father once told him that he did not belong
in politics unless he could walk into a roomful of people and tell
immediately who was for him and who was against him. In fact, even
the shrewd Johnson had not quite such occult power, but his liking
for this story tells us something useful about him: he set much
store by instinct. No wonder, then, that it would be to his
instincts _ honed in the Texas hill country, sharpened in a life of
politics, confirmed in a long and respected congressional career _
that he would often turn while in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   This reliance on instinct enabled Johnson to put on the
presidency like a suit of comfortable old clothes. John Kennedy, on
the other hand, came to it with a historical, nearly theoretical
view of what was required of a strong president _ he knew exactly
what Woodrow Wilson had said about the office and he had read
Corwin and Neustadt. With eager confidence, Kennedy acquired a
presidential suit off the rack and put on a little weight to make
himself fit it.''

   ``With the influx of Cuban citizens into Miami in 1959,
thousands of Spanish-speaking children enrolled in Florida's public
schools. Since teachers had been among the professional groups that
left Cuba, Florida schools had access to teachers who shared the
language and culture of the new students. The school boards had to
decide whether the children should learn English before entering
school or whether education in both languages should be tried.
Fortunately, the latter method was chosen. This event had a
significant influence on the acceptance and growth of bilingual
education in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   3. Which of the following statements best expresses the author's
main point in the passage?
</P>
<P>
   (A) Florida's public schools were among the first in the country
to offer bilingual education to Spanish-speaking children.
</P>
<P>
   (B) School systems considering bilingual education programs
would do well to model their programs after those used in Miami
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   (C) Bilingual education programs in Florida schools have been
very successful and deserve more national recognition.
</P>
<P>
   (D) Florida school boards made the right choice when they
decided in 1959 to offer bilingual education to Spanish-speaking
children.
</P>
<P>
   (E) Bilingual education was revived in Florida in the 1960s
because of an influx of Spanish-speaking students into the public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Answers
</P>
<P>
   (1.) The passage is about the different approaches of Johnson
and Kennedy to the presidency. In explaining how each approached
the office and how they differed in this respect, the author is
necessarily making a comparison. The correct answer is B.
</P>
<P>
   (2.) The ``occult'' power described in the first sentence is
clearly not a power that people ordinarily have. It could,
therefore, best be described as ``supernatural.'' Choice E is the
best answer.
</P>
<P>
   (3.) The author presents an educational problem that confronted
Florida schools in 1959 _ the need to make an important decision
about whether to require Spanish-speaking children to learn English
before entering school. However, in addition to conveying this
information, the author wishes to convey approval of the decision
made by the Florida school boards because of its positive influence
on the acceptance of bilingual education. The last two sentences of
the passage demonstrate the author's positive attitude toward the
school boards' decision. This attitude toward the decision is
reflected in choice D, the correct answer.

 BIG-BANG THEORY: A BLAST FROM THE PAST MAKES BASEBALL A CURRENT

<TEXT>
<P>
   Shortly after Fox Television bought the broadcasting rights to
major-league baseball games three years ago, Fox Sports president
David Hill issued a simple dictum to his newly assembled producers
and announcers: ``I don't want to hear about dead guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill, a native Australian, rankled a few people by seemingly
thumbing his nose at baseball's cherished memories of Babe Ruth,
Mickey Mantle and countless others. But he had decided that the
sport needed to lose some of its past to move into the future. How
fitting, then, that Fox wound up broadcasting Mark McGwire's
record-breaking 62nd home run Tuesday night: when one swing,
witnessed by more than 50 million people in living rooms, bars and
airport waiting lounges around the world, helped vault baseball
into the modern age.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, baseball has been haunted by its past. Other sports
(and the news media that cover them) have always embraced
evolution, capitalizing on gradual appreciation of fans for
end-zone dances and monster dunks, and hailing contemporary players
like Michael Jordan and Joe Montana as the best of all time.
Baseball, though, has remained beholden to its halcyon days of
Ruth, Joe DiMaggio and the Brooklyn Dodgers' Boys of Summer,
suggesting that the sport's best days are behind it.
</P>
<P>
   Mention to many fans that the Seattle Mariners slugger Ken
Griffey Jr. could be a better all-around player than Willie Mays
and they gasp as if you're burning baseball's flag. No other sport
makes such a killing off old-time uniforms that sob ``Remember
when?'' And as the new economics of professional sports spawn
viruses ranging from free-agent hopscotch to player strikes,
baseball's mantra has become ``Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio?''
</P>
<P>
   Although baseball's charming 129-year history is a unique asset
that distinguishes it from younger sports, it has also become an
undertow from which the sport has struggled to escape. Today's
sports fans aren't preoccupied with history; they focus on the next
this, the next that. Figures from the past often get mistaken as
curiosities rather than as cherished legends.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's home run threw baseball a lifeline in that regard. In
the past 20 years no player's pursuit of history has evoked such
widespread intrigue and excitement. (The breaking of Lou Gehrig's
consecutive-game record by Cal Ripken Jr. in 1995 was enjoyed more
as an antidote to the bitterness left by the recent strike than
with the sheer giddiness surrounding McGwire.) At last, a modern
star moved past the black-and-white ghosts of the past to wrest
away baseball's most prestigious record. Today's era now has its
own bona-fide hero, one that has joined the towering figures of
old.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the only sport with a history, with players like Babe
Ruth, Lou Gehrig and Ty Cobb,'' said major-league baseball
president Paul Beeston. ``Now we've got a guy at the close of the
century you can mention in the same breath.''
</P>
<P>
   After McGwire swatted No. 62 to break Roger Maris' 37-year-old
record, the new generation of fans said they were tired of hearing
how great the old-timers were, and felt empowered to stick up for
their era. ``I think that today's players are as good as anyone,''
said Adam Modesto, a 13-year-old St. Louis eighth-grader. ``Just
because the older ones did it first doesn't mean they're the
best.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if previous generations of players were better than those
playing today, Ken Caver, a 19-year-old sophomore at Austin Peay
University in Clarksville, Tenn., smiled. ``I thought they were,''
he said. ``Until now.''
</P>
<P>
   Modern players share the frustration at how their sport's rich
history obscures the present. ``Baseball is a good-ol'-boy club,''
said Barry Larkin, the Cincinnati Reds shortstop. ``It's so
conservative and so slow to change. The tradition of baseball _ you
hear about that all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   All-time all-star teams usually pay tribute to legends like
Jimmie Foxx, Ted Williams and Honus Wagner and include few, if any,
players who played in the last 20 years. Will McGwire now get some
consideration over Gehrig at first base? Will that start
conversation about other current players? What is heresy today
could be history tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire himself saw a subtle shift toward appreciating the
modern game during his chase. ``Hopefully it continues with not
just me, but with the other great players in the game,'' he said,
giving a nod to his fellow sluggers Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs
and Griffey. ``There is unbelievable talent right now in the game
of baseball. I think everybody across America is seeing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Before McGwire, whose summer-long pursuit of the home-run record
inspired celebratory national commercials from the likes of
Mastercard and Pepsi, companies involved with baseball often played
off the sport's grip on its past. To promote its ``Sunday Night
Baseball'' games three years ago, ESPN stuck two crotchety
Brooklynites in a bar and had them complain about everything from
the Dodgers' defection to how they couldn't set the clock on their
VCR.
</P>
<P>
   A commercial for Sports Illustrated, with elegiac music in the
background, offered a free baseball video titled ``When It Was a
Game.'' A TV ad for Franklin batting gloves captured baseball's
discomfort with changing times perfectly: It had Barry Bonds (the
me-first modern athlete) teasing Ripken (the treasured throwback)
that he needed an earring. As Ripken looked in the mirror, he
sighed, ``I wonder what Dad would say.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, meanwhile, has been embraced by both fathers and sons.
(Grandfathers? Let's not get greedy.) Surveys showed that up to 90
percent of fans, both young and old, wanted the brawny Cardinal
first baseman to break the record. Their fascination with the
slugger helped unify generations of fans.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, one reason why McGwire's chase enthralled the nation
was that baseball, by virtue of its age and history, has hallowed
records and legends (and dead guys) that capture the imagination
the way few other sports can match.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine there will be daily countdowns and live
cut-ins when a football quarterback approaches the touchdown-pass
record, or when a basketball guard scores the most points ever in a
season. Baseball records have evolved over so much time that they
evoke a public respect and loyalty unmatched in American sports.
</P>
<P>
   That loyalty, however, has often held baseball back as the rest
of the sports world has evolved. Ask fans over the age of 40 what
image most symbolizes baseball and many would say Mantle's
ferocious swing, or Mays playing stick ball in the streets. It was
so much simpler then.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's blast showed that baseball still provides its simple
thrills. And maybe, just maybe, these can be the good old days,
too.

 IMPEACHMENT OR CENSURE: EITHER PRECEDENT IS UGLY

<P>
   Impeachment, censure or resignation? As far as the American
presidency goes, history offers one instance of each.
</P>
<P>
   Many people remember Richard M. Nixon's resignation in 1974 as
the House was moving to impeach him. But the impeachment of Andrew
Johnson and the Senate censure of Andrew Jackson occurred more than
a century ago. Do they offer any insights into the crisis now
engulfing President Clinton?
</P>
<P>
   At least one: that the historical auguries may not bode well for
high-minded nonpartisanship. The records of the two big
presidential crises of the 19th century show that when Congress
acted to remove or sanction a president, raw politics prevailed.
Here are excerpts.
</P>
<P>
   _ By TOM KUNTZ
</P>
<P>
   ANDREW JOHNSON'S IMPEACHMENT
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) After the Civil War, the Radical
Republicans in control of Congress were able to override President
Johnson's vetoes and undermine the policy of leniency toward the
defeated South begun under Abraham Lincoln, Johnson's slain
predecessor. To protect radical allies in the administration like
Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, the Republicans rammed through the
Tenure of Office Act, barring the dismissal of Cabinet members
without congressional approval. Johnson thought the law violated
the principle of separation of powers, and, to force a Supreme
Court test, he dismissed Stanton on Feb. 21, 1868:(END ITALICS
HERE)
</P>
<P>
   SIR: By virtue of the power and authority vested in me as
President by the Constitution and laws of the United States, you
are hereby removed from office as Secretary for the Department of
War. ...
</P>
<P>
   You will transfer to Brevet Major General Lorenzo Thomas,
Adjutant General of the Army, who has this day been authorized and
empowered to act as Secretary of War ad interim, all records,
books, papers and other public property now in your custody and
charge.
</P>
<P>
   Respectfully yours,
</P>
<P>
   ANDREW JOHNSON
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)That followed an earlier, unsuccessful
attempt to oust Stanton, in which he had barricaded himself in his
office. The Republicans had had enough of Johnson, a Tennessean.
After preparatory work by the House Judiciary and Reconstruction
committees, the House on Feb. 24, 1868, approved 11 articles of
impeachment, the first 9 alleging violation of the Tenure of Office
Act. But probably none of the articles better illustrated their
decidedly political nature than Article 10, which said it was an
impeachable offense for the president to speak ill of Congress
``with a loud voice.'' The article held: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   That said Andrew Johnson ... unmindful of the high duties of his
office and the dignity and proprieties thereof ... did attempt to
bring into disgrace, ridicule, hatred, contempt and reproach the
Congress of the United States, and several branches thereof, to
impair and destroy the regard and respect of all the good people of
the United States for the Congress and legislative power thereof
... and in pursuance of his said design and intent openly and
publicly, and before divers assemblages of the citizens of the
United States convened in divers parts thereof to meet and receive
said Andrew Johnson as the Chief Magistrate of the United States,
did ... make and deliver with a loud voice certain intemperate,
inflammatory and scandalous harangues, and did therein utter loud
threats and bitter menaces as well against Congress ... amid the
cries, jeers and laughter of the multitudes then assembled. ...
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Johnson, who had a reputation as a drinker,
often spoke bluntly. The impeachment articles cited disdainful
remarks he made in St. Louis on Sept. 8, 1866, directed at Radical
Republican legislators: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   If I have played the Judas, who has been my Christ that I have
played the Judas with? Was it Thad. Stevens? Was it Wendell
Phillips? Was it Charles Sumner? These are the men that stop and
compare themselves with the Savior; and everybody that differs with
them in opinion, and to try to stay and arrest their diabolical and
nefarious policy, is to be denounced as a Judas.
</P>
<P>
   Well, let me say to you ... if you will stand by me in trying to
give the people a fair chance, soldiers and citizens ... God being
willing, I will kick them out. I will kick them out just as fast as
I can.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)In early March, 1868, the House's articles
were presented to the Senate, and later that month an impeachment
trial began before the Senate's 42 Republicans and 12 Democrats,
with Chief Justice Salmon Chase presiding. A two-thirds majority
was needed to oust Johnson, who did not attend (though much of
Washington society did). The trial lasted three months. Charles
Sumner of Massachusetts, famous for the prewar caning he suffered
on the Senate floor at the hands of a pro-slavery legislator, spoke
for conviction: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the last great battles with slavery. Driven from
these legislative chambers, driven from the field of war, this
monstrous power has found refuge in the executive mansion, where in
utter disregard of the Constitution and laws, it seeks to exercise
its ancient, far-reaching sway. All this is very plain. Nobody can
question it. Andrew Johnson is the impersonation of the tyrannical
slave power. In him it lives again.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Linking Johnson with pro-slavery holdouts,
Sumner used a sexually charged term (``promiscuous'') typical of
abolitionist oratory seeking to portray slaveholders as motivated
by carnal lust: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Original partisans of slavery, North and South; habitual
compromisers of great principles; maligners of the Declaration of
Independence; politicians without heart ... and a promiscuous
company who at every stage of the battle have set their faces
against equal rights _ These are (Johnson's) allies.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)But as the trial had ground on, it had
become clear that the case against Johnson was weak. In two days of
voting, on May 16 and 28, seven Republicans joined the 12 Johnson
Democrats, making the vote 19 for acquittal and 35 for conviction _
one short of the two-thirds majority needed for ouster. A defector,
James Grimes of Iowa, said in a written statement afterward:(END
ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   I am wholly unable ... to deduce any criminal intent. ... I
cannot agree to destroy the harmonious working of the Constitution
for the sake of getting rid of an unacceptable President.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)In the press gallery, Mark Twain, on
assignment for several newspapers, had grumbled:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   This is the place to get a poor opinion of everybody in.

</P>
<P>
   ANDREW JACKSON'S CENSURE
</P>
<P>
   In his history of the Senate, Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., notes
that the censure of a president, unlike impeachment, ``lacks a
constitutional basis.'' But the Senate took that course in 1834
after President Jackson, who hated banks and mistrusted central
authority, vetoed the rechartering of the Second Bank of the United
States in 1832 and the next year ordered government funds
withdrawn. A political struggle ensued, worsening the depression of
the 1830s. In late 1833, the Senate, led by Henry Clay of Kentucky,
began an inquiry, but the president wrote back that he would not
cooperate, in effect claiming executive privilege:
</P>
<P>
   The Executive is a coordinate and independent branch of the
government equally with the Senate; and I have yet to learn under
what Constitutional authority that branch of the Legislature has a
right to require of me an account of any communication ... made to
the heads of departments acting as a cabinet council.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Rep. John Quincy Adams, who preceded
Jackson as president, noted in his diary ``a tone of insolence and
insult'' in Jackson's messages to Congress:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   The domineering tone has heretofore been usually on the side of
the legislative bodies to the Executive, and Clay has not been
sparing in the use of it. He is now paid in his own coin.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Sens. Clay, John C. Calhoun of South
Carolina and Daniel Webster of Massachusetts formed an alliance on
the bank issue that was the progenitor of the Whig Party. In
December 1833, Clay introduced two measures of censure against
Jackson, and laid it on thick in a speech stretching over three
days:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   The premonitory symptoms of despotism are upon us; and if
Congress does not apply an instantaneous and effective remedy, the
fatal collapse will soon come on, and we shall die _ ignobly die _
base, mean and abject slaves; the scorn and contempt of mankind;
unpitied, unwept, unmourned!
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Clay tried to tar Vice President Martin Van
Buren, Jackson's heir apparent, with the bank issue. With Van Buren
presiding over the proceedings, Clay conspicuously urged him to
intercede with Jackson. Afterward Van Buren made a show of
sincerity by approaching Clay in his seat, but when he got there
the ``Little Magician'' merely asked for a pinch of Clay's snuff,
and blithely walked away. Finally, on March 28, 1834, the Senate,
voting 28-18, passed a pared-down censure: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Resolved. That the President, in the last executive proceedings
in relation to the public revenue, has assumed upon himself
authority and power not conferred by the Constitution and laws, but
in derogation of both.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)The measure had no effect. But in January
1837, after Jackson's Democrats had won the Senate, they ordered
black lines drawn around the resolution in the official record,
with ``Expunged by order of the Senate'' superimposed. Clay said
after the boisterous session: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is no longer a place for any decent man.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Postscript: Today Andrew Jackson's portrait
is on the $20 bill, symbol of modern central banking. That's surely
one of history's ironies.(END ITALICS HERE)

   BONN, Germany _ This country's most important election in
decades will take place two weeks from Sunday and the striking
thing is this: Whoever wins will inherit a land where the pace has
already been set for them, not so much by politicians as by the
barons of big business.
</P>
<P>
   Almost nine years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, that is not
entirely a surprise: As in the United States or Britain, ideology
has lost its primacy, yielding to a contest among rival politicians
to define and capture the post-ideological center.
</P>
<P>
   But in Germany, there is another departure as well. This has
long been the land of the cartel, of compacts and consensus that
brought workers into the boardrooms and, at the same time, bound
banks and businesses and politicians of all stripes in a sheltered
covenant of enormous prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   But the compact was underpinned by a huge and costly social
network that gradually hampered Germany's competitiveness. And
these days, many large companies have simply decided to pursue
their own interests within and beyond Germany's borders, often
supplanting the politicians in framing the way Germans and
foreigners alike perceive the German nation.
</P>
<P>
   Consider, for example, U.S.-German relations, which were once
propelled almost exclusively by Cold War security considerations;
if Germany prospered, it was as an ally and a showcase of
capitalism, under the U.S. economic as well as nuclear umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   But by last May, the relationship had clearly taken on a new
flavor; the takeover of Chrysler by Daimler-Benz showed a German
assertiveness that had long been held in check. ``This is clearly
the result of the end of the Cold War and the globalized economy,''
said a legislator in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
   The transatlantic relationship, in which many politicians still
tread gently as the deferential junior partner to Washington's
military and political initiatives, has been retextured by the
unmistakable whiff of German economic might. Key players in the New
York publishing industry are owned by Germany's media giants; in
recent years, German investment in the United States has created
600,000 American jobs and the figure is growing, according to the
German Embassy in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In this land of export-driven prosperity, many companies have
long seen their markets far beyond their borders: Bertelsmann, the
media giant, does 70 per cent of its business outside Germany; two
thirds of Daimler-Benz's annual revenue was earned outside Germany
last year, and over one-third of its stock is held by foreign
investors. Volkswagen now owns auto companies from the Czech
Republic to Spain, BMW owns Britain's Rover and between the two of
them, the companies just carved up Rolls Royce and Bentley.
</P>
<P>
   This, then, is the landscape in which Germany's politicians and
business executives operate today _ a landscape in which big
business is far more prepared to take the initiative, leaving
politicians to play catch-up.
</P>
<P>
   German companies ``are responding to the exigencies of the
market and they are doing it rather late in the game,'' said Josef
Joffe, a senior commentator at the newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung in
Munich. But, he said, there was an underlying pattern: ``Big
business is separating from the state and proceeding on its own
path. What these firms are saying is `We are going to follow our
own interests and therefore going our own way.'''
</P>
<P>
   Another way to look at the change is through the lens of
European unity. This goal began as a a politicians' dream, but
today the vision is being realized by the money men. A vast single
market is in place, and its moves towards a single currency in
particular are inspiring German companies to seek economies of
scale on a Europe-wide platform. This, in turn, has led them to
take a sometimes vocal stake in their new hosts' business _ and
politics.
</P>
<P>
   When the German-owned Rover car company in Britain announced
plans to reduce its work force by 1,500 people this summer, a
German executive bluntly told the British government that the
layoffs were a direct result of British economic policy, as if he
had a rightful claim to a voice in shaping it. It was a claim no
German statesman would have thought to make, at least in public.
</P>
<P>
   It is no surprise, either, that, in all of Europe, Germany has
most at stake in Russia's crisis. History and geography may condemn
Berlin and Moscow to tug central Europe between them, but the
bottom line this time really is a bottom line: German banks have
some $30 billion in state-guaranteed credits threatened by Russia's
tailspin. That exposure _ and Germany's reluctance to extend it _
dominates German policy.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the exposure itself is a hangover from the close
relationship between politicians and big money. In the early 1990s,
Chancellor Helmut Kohl encouraged banks to lend in an
overoptimistic effort to cement Russia's lurch into market-driven
democracy. As a result, some 90 percent of the loans are backed by
state guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   But now, faced with the Russian meltdown, the bottom line has
reasserted itself. Without reforms in Moscow, Kohl said, ``It will
not be possible to mobilize money either from international
financial organizations or from Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   And within Germany the likely consequences of Germany's
international corporatism have left politicians feeling queasy
that, as a former auto executive remarked, ``politics has lost the
primacy.'' Since Daimler's takeover of Chrysler, for instance,
Joffe said, Daimler's executives may well be in a position to tell
German politicians, ``We are going to take the whole company to
Detroit,'' to press for economic policy changes.
</P>
<P>
   And that touches a central issue: Even as German companies
respond to the pressures of globalization and European integration,
Bonn's politicians have failed to reduce taxation and social
spending, leading German companies to complain that the high labor
costs financing Germany's welfare state have become more entrenched
than before.
</P>
<P>
   So, as they seek profits, companies streamline their operations
at home and look for profit margins abroad. The upshot has been
disastrous for Kohl: Record unemployment is the single biggest
issue in the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a danger that while German big business
internationalizes, Germany itself remains provincial,'' said
Hermann Groehe, a member of Kohl's Christian Democrats.
``Technological advance and economic change are so rapid that we
must be careful to ensure that politics isn't too slow.''

   &UR; ALL OVER BUT THE SHOUTIN' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Rick Bragg. Vintage, $14.
</P>
<P>
   A child of ``white trash'' America tells of how he escaped his
dirt-poor Alabama upbringing to become a Pulitzer Prize-winning
correspondent for The New York Times, a journey made possible in
large part by the sacrifice and suffering of his formidable mother.
Last year our reviewer, Anthony Walton, called this a ``sad,
beautiful, funny and moving memoir.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LARRY'S PARTY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Carol Shields. Penguin, $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   Focusing in minute detail on the inner life of Larry Weller, a
thoughtful Canadian landscape designer whose passion is building
garden mazes, this affectionate novel seeks to define what it's
like being a man in the '90s. The labyrinth of Larry's existence is
revealed gradually: his childhood, his elusive and complicated
romantic entanglements, his friends and family, above all his
unflinching dialogue with his ``self's silver mirror.'' By the end,
``the reader could not feel closer to Larry Weller or more
benevolently disposed toward him, a measure of his creator's
generosity,'' Verlyn Klinkenborg wrote in the Book Review in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE DARK SIDE OF CAMELOT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Seymour M. Hersh. Back Bay/Little, Brown, $15.
</P>
<P>
   A renowned investigative reporter trots out nearly every report,
claim or rumor of nasty goings-on by John F. Kennedy and his
coterie. Even if the author's scattershot approach has mixed
results, ``he makes life difficult for historians by digging up
just enough about distressing matters so they can't honestly be
ignored,'' Thomas Powers said here last year. In  &UR; THE KENNEDY
TAPES: INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE DURING THE CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS &LR; ,
edited by Ernest R. May and Philip D. Zelikow (Belknap/Harvard
University, $16.95), the president emerges as a highly skeptical
dove when the world was on the brink of nuclear war, and seems
Lincolnesque in his grim resolve. In 1997 our reviewer, Barry
Gewen, called this scholarly transcription, which includes
connecting text and explanatory passages, ``a splendid
achievement.'' The Cuban missile crisis is also the subject of  &UR; ONE
HELL OF A GAMBLE: KHRUSHCHEV, CASTRO, AND KENNEDY, 1958-1964 &LR; , by
Aleksandr Fursenko and Timothy Naftali (Norton, $14.95), in which
two historians, one Russian and one American, draw on archival
material from official Soviet sources to provide a fresh
perspective on the drama. ``The story takes on the elements of
great theater as it moves to its denouement,'' John Newhouse wrote
in these pages last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE FORTUNATE PILGRIM &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Mario Puzo. Fawcett Columbine, $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   Before Don Corleone there was Lucia Santa, a cunning,
tough-as-nails matriarch who raises six children by herself in
Hell's Kitchen. This fictional chronicle of immigrant life by the
author of  &UR; THE GODFATHER &LR;  is ``lifted into literature by ... its
penetrating insights and its mixture of tenderness and rage,''
David Boroff said here in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE BEGINNING OF SPRING &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Penelope Fitzgerald. Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $12.
</P>
<P>
   This comedy of manners, set in Russia in 1913, revolves around a
self-effacing British printer who scrambles to find someone to care
for his three children after his wife bails out and returns home.
``It is a lovely novel,'' Robert Plunket wrote here in 1989, with a
colorful cast of flaky expats and exuberant locals. The same
publisher has reissued an earlier novel by the author,  &UR; INNOCENCE &LR; 
($12), in which a guileless woman from an aristocratic Florentine
family summons an English girlfriend to help her win the heart of a
neurologist. ``Fitzgerald casts a wry, forgiving eye on her
characters and charms us,'' our reviewer, Emily Leider, said in
1987.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A COMMOTION IN THE BLOOD: LIFE, DEATH, AND THE IMMUNE SYSTEM &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Stephen S. Hall. Owl/Holt, $16.95.
</P>
<P>
   The author, a contributing writer and editor at The New York
Times Magazine, argues that the history of immunotherapy in the war
against cancer has been a messy, up-and-down affair that is
fascinating even if there isn't a ``magic bullet'' in sight. The
result is a ``masterly study,'' Roy Porter wrote here last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HOCKEY SUR GLACE: STORIES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Peter LaSalle. Breakaway/Lyons Press, $13.
</P>
<P>
   These seven stories and four poems are marked by a deep
affection for the hockey of mill towns and pickup games played on
pond ice by older skaters with young hearts. The tales ``all take
weight from a powerful retrospect, from lost times that were both
troubled and blessed,'' Ron Carlson wrote in these pages last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; RACHEL CARSON: WITNESS FOR NATURE  &LR;  By Linda Lear. Owl/Holt,
$17.95.
</P>
<P>
   This biography reveals how the largely self-taught author of
 &UR; SILENT SPRING &LR;  contributed so much to the postwar environmental
movement and had such a strong influence on American sensibilities.
This is ``the most exhaustive account so far of Carson's private,
professional and public lives,'' Robert B. Semple Jr. said here in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE BACON FANCIER: FOUR TALES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Alan Isler. Penguin, $11.95.
</P>
<P>
   Each of these novellas is set in a different century and locale,
from 17th-century Venice to latter-day Manhattan, but they are
linked by mistrustful Jewish protagonists struggling with pride in
a gentile world. Last year our reviewer, James Saynor, called this
a ``clever and radiant work.''

   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,
and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the non-fiction
list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To, and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

   Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending Sept. 5,
1998, at almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000

such outlets nationwide. The number of titles within the two
subdivisions of non-fiction can change from week to week,
reflecting changes in book buying.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Looking beyond Clinton, to America
 &HT;    (For release, Wednesday, Sept. 16, 1998)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   And, so, we again are about to send out Diogenes and his lantern
in search of a person who can lead a life of self-control and,
although probably too much to ask, free of all desire for material
things and pleasures.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how our presidential crisis comes out _ impeachment,
censure, resignation, continuance _ there's going to be a new
president. If not next week, certainly by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The office of the presidency has been eroded by Bill Clinton's
lies, betrayals and libido; the institution is severely damaged and
badly in need of repair.
</P>
<P>
   When Richard Nixon was forced to resign, he was replaced by a
man, Gerald Ford, whose integrity few would question. Although his
pardon of Nixon did raise some questions, Ford nevertheless served
this country best by calming it down from the divisiveness of the
Watergate investigation and subsequent findings.
</P>
<P>
   We are at that point again. Who shall succeed Clinton? For the
next few years, that would be Al Gore, but you don't have to read
tea leaves to know that he already has been targeted for illegal
fund-raising, and his ascension to the presidency only will
accelerate that issue.
</P>
<P>
   Looking out on the American scene is dispiriting; few are out
there who command the respect of the entire nation. Too much has
the U.S. been politically polarized.
</P>
<P>
   It is interesting, therefore, to look back at Colin Powell, the
reluctant candidate with Republican credentials. All through this
continuing Clinton tragedy, Powell has kept clear of the mob, on a
high plane, dealing with matters free of taint or partisanship.
</P>
<P>
   Others who would be president _ Gore, Dan Quayle, Newt Gingrich,
Dick Gephardt, Steve Forbes, et al. _ hardly are universally loved,
or respected.
</P>
<P>
   America looks for the same person sought by Diogenes. Whether or
not he (or she) exists is questionable, as no one is safe from the
deepest scrutiny of muckrakers _ whether in the media or on ugly
political expeditions.
</P>
<P>
   Diogenes never found what he was looking for, nor will we. There
is no perfect person. But next best will do quite well. And I don't
see ``next best'' stoking up the coals for a mid-winter visit to
New Hampshire and Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Through all this, Powell has been quiet, a nonparticipant in the
filth that is covering Washington, D.C., these days. I am loath to
proclaim that the former Army general has gone through life without
fault, because we have re-created and expanded our interpretations
of public fault.
</P>
<P>
   His wife fears a presidential run; she said so several years
ago. But, she said, she feared it more for whatever racial tremors
it might stir. We still don't know if Colin Powell is a choirboy
because the cutthroats haven't been set loose on him yet.
</P>
<P>
   Just the other day, when most of us were basking in the aura of
the Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa accomplishments in baseball, saying
to ourselves how wonderful it was to happen at a time like this, my
cynical genes caused me to remark that after the glow of the
baseball glory wears off, someone is going to look for and possibly
find some dark secret lurking in McGwire's or Sosa's pasts to tear
them down from their pedestals.
</P>
<P>
   It's the way we do things.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton wasn't solely responsible for improving the U.S.
economy any more than Ronald Reagan and George Bush were
responsible for the collapse of the Soviet Union. Those things just
happened to happen on their watch.
</P>
<P>
   What we seek most in a president is to respect and revere him.
Our Constitution wisely has separated the powers of the nation into
three branches, the executive being only one _ and, to my thinking,
the least powerful.
</P>
<P>
   This nation needs a leader who can restore our confidence in the
presidency. I don't see any of the prominent pretenders as having
that ability. And unless or until someone finds something deep in
Colin Powell's closet, he would appear to be, however reluctant he
is, a man we might need at this time.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: No case for impeachment
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   OK, so sometimes a cigar isn't just a cigar, but even so, if
anything can rehabilitate the Clinton presidency, the Starr
report's excesses and flimsy charges may do the trick.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ought to resign for ethical reasons, out of chagrin at
the human wreckage caused by his misbehaviors and, pragmatically,
in recognition that even if he can manage to stick, he'll be the
captain of a grounded ship of state.
</P>
<P>
   But if the president does try to gut this thing out, his
impeachment on the evidence of the Starr report would set a
precedent that could start a cycle of political attacks and
presidential collapses that would amount to coups in legal
trimmings.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Starr never should have been in the Paula Jones/Monica
Lewinsky business in the first place. His presence there is an
insupportable extrusion from his original charter to investigate
land deals from the 1980s in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, a conservative Republican and long-laboring water carrier
for his party, has functioned as the de facto legal arm of lavishly
funded right-wing efforts to undo Clinton's elections. The
prosecutor has acted _ not overtly but surely not unwittingly
either _ as a facilitator for Jones's private lawyers, who were
outrageously demanding that the president name every woman he had
sex with while he was attorney general and governor of Arkansas and
as president.
</P>
<P>
   In was in furtherance of that sort of get-Clinton trolling that
Starr perked up at Linda Tripp's sexual tattling when he should
have dismissed it out of hand as having no legitimate bearing on
his charge. The result is a report that for all its huffing and
puffing presents a case for impeachment that is very thin gruel.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear the president lied, in the common meaning of the
word, about not having had sex with Lewinsky, though he may have
been dodgy enough in his testimony to fishtail through the narrow
definition of sex that had been established for the Jones case.
Either way, few of us would have a president impeached for lying
about sex in a private lawsuit that was itself politically
inspired.
</P>
<P>
   Starr charges obstruction of justice in the prior understanding
Lewinsky and Clinton had to deny their affair, but how many illicit
lovers don't have such an understanding? The back-and-forth over
the president's gifts to Lewinsky is muddled and inconclusive.
Clinton's efforts to land Lewinsky a new job preceded her subpoena
and Starr doesn't tie them to her testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The scariest part of the report _ with grave implications for
everyone's civil liberties should it prevail _ is its charge that
the president abused his power by lying to associates who were then
unable to rat him out to the grand jury, by putting off his own
testimony as long as he could and by filing bothersome lawsuits _
in short, by defending himself from Starr. There are the makings of
megalomania in that weird construction of abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   In its needlessly extensive rehearsal of sexual particulars and
in its leering prurience _ so like the anti-smut crusaders who
collect pornography to decry it _ the Starr report suggests that
this business really is just about sex, even, and maybe especially,
in Starr's own mind.

EX-ALABAMA GOVERNOR GEORGE WALLACE DEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WIL HAYGOOD  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   George Wallace, the feisty and mercurial Alabama governor who
ran for president four times and enshrined himself in US political
history when he challenged the Kennedy administration over the
issue of integration at the University of Alabama in 1963, died
Sunday in a Montgomery, Ala., hospital. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Wallace entered the hospital Thursday, suffering from
breathing problems and septic shock caused by a severe bacterial
infection. He also had been hospitalized this summer with similar
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Wallace's health had been failing since 1972, when he was
shot five times by a would-be assassin in a parking lot in Laurel,
Md., during a presidential campaign rally.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting paralyzed Mr. Wallace from the waist down and left
him in perpetual pain, according to his doctors. But those who
thought the shooting would end Mr. Wallace's political career were
premature in their thinking: He went on to serve two additional
terms as Alabama's governor.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Wallace in recent years had battled Parkinson's disease as
well as the lingering effects of his wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Wallace's death ends one of the more storied and volatile
careers in American political history, which saw Mr. Wallace assail
blacks, liberals, presidents, and ``pinko communists.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a career that began in Mr. Wallace's native Barbour
County, Ala., when he returned home from World War II. As a state
judicial candidate, Mr. Wallace shamelessly appealed to racist
tactics, at times drawing Ku Klux Klan support, which he utilized
during future campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   But during the last decade of his life, Mr. Wallace had begged
forgiveness for his onetime racist appeals, crying from the pulpit
of black churches across Alabama, giving his political life an
unexpected _ and sometimes touching _ twist as it ended.
</P>
<P>
   George Corley Wallace was born in the small town of Clio, Ala.,
on Aug. 25, 1919.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Wallace would ricochet onto the national political scene in
a riveting showdown with the Kennedy Justice Department. On June
11, 1963, Mr. Wallace stood in the schoolhouse door on the
University of Alabama campus in Tuscaloosa and tried to block two
blacks from entering. Mr. Wallace, who stepped aside with the show
of federal troops, called the federal action an ``illegal
usurpation of power by the central government.''
</P>
<P>
   To many of his fellow Southerners, Mr. Wallace rose as icon and
near-mythic figure.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Wallace's Jan. 14, 1963, inauguration speech seemed a brutal
and nostalgic reach for Southern gallantry during the Civil War.
Mr. Wallace wrapped himself in Old Confederacy rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the name of the greatest people that ever trod this earth,
I draw the line in the dust and toss the gauntlet before the feet
of tyranny. And I say: Segregation now! Segregation tomorrow!
Segregation forever!''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Wallace's political rise coincided with the modern American
civil rights movement. A mere two blocks from the Montgomery
statehouse sat the Dexter Avenue Baptist church. In its pulpit
stood the young Martin Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   On March 21, 1965, one of the more dramatic civil rights
demonstrations was staged in Alabama: the Selma-to-Montgomery
march, a 50-mile trek on behalf of voting rights. When the 50,000
marchers reached the Alabama statehouse, Mr. Wallace ignored them.
Mr. Wallace had earlier tried to stop the march but was overruled
by Judge Johnson. On the night the march ended, March 25, a civil
rights worker from Detroit named Viola Liuzzo was murdered on a
Lowndes County highway by racists.
</P>
<P>
   President Johnson, a short time later, signed the 1965 Voting
Rights Act into law. ``At times history and fate meet in a single
time in a single place to shape a turning point in man's unending
search for freedom,'' Johnson said. ``So it was at Lexington and
Concord. So it was a century ago at Appomattox. So it was last week
in Selma, Alabama.''
</P>
<P>
   In his presidential campaigns Mr. Wallace painted himself as a
little man against the tyranny of the big federal government. Mr.
Wallace waged all-out verbal assaults against hippies, Vietnam War
protesters, and those engaged in acts of civil disobedience. ``Any
anarchist scum who lies down in front of our car when we get to be
president, it'll be the last car he'll ever lie down in front of,''
Mr. Wallace remarked.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Wallace first ran for president on the American Independent
Party ticket in 1964. He registered a stunning 43 percent showing
in a Maryland primary. Northern Democratic operatives feared his
appeal to angry voters. Mr. Wallace's campaign eventually fizzled,
but he ran again, in 1968. At times Mr. Wallace approached the
totals of Democratic nominee Hubert Humphrey in early fall opinion
polls. However, in the end, Mr. Wallace won only five states and
Richard Nixon was elected president.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Wallace's digs at bigtime Washington political figures
endeared him to poor Southern whites and disgruntled voters
elsewhere. ``The instincts of a common-sense Alabamian are better
than the brains of a New York intellectual moron,'' Mr. Wallace
once remarked.
</P>
<P>
   On May 15, 1972, a onetime Milwaukee busboy named Arthur Bremer
trailed presidential candidate George Wallace to a campaign rally
at a Maryland shopping center. Bremer fired five bullets into Mr.
Wallace, paralyzing him from the waist down. Mr. Wallace believed
the assasination attempt was a conspiracy, without offering proof.
Bremer received a 60-year prison sentence and refused to talk about
his motives.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Wallace had several operations to ease the pain over the
years, but remained on heavy doses of pain-killing medication the
rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his confinement to a wheelchair, Mr. Wallace won
reelection for governor again in 1974. By that time, the South had
begun to change perceptibly, especially in statehouses. Georgia
Gov. Governor Jimmy Carter, for example, had gained national
attention for espousing progressive attitudes toward race. It was
the success of Carter's 1976 presidential run that thwarted Mr.
Wallace's final attempt to reach the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the more dramatic aspects of his waning political
life, Mr. Wallace sought to make amends with blacks. Appearing
before groups of black elected officials, Mr. Wallace apologized
for his stance against integration. During his last stint as
governor, from 1983 to 1987, Mr. Wallace made significant black
appointments, and was also credited with funding black junior
colleges in the state of Alabama. Often, appearing before black
groups, he became teary-eyed and emotional.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1993 interview in his Montgomery law office with The Boston
Globe, Mr. Wallace said, ``I'm not a bad man.'' And as he pondered
death, he said, ``I'm all right with the Lord.''

`FRASIER' WINS FOR FIFTH TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``No one should complain that the Oscars are the longest show on
TV again,'' announced Billy Crystal Sunday night, picking up his
second Emmy for hosting the Academy Awards show.
</P>
<P>
   But after NBC's enjoyably epic Emmy telecast, we can still
complain that the Oscars remain the most tedious. The four-hour
Emmy presentation was a fast-paced night of TV that paid tribute to
a half-century of itself without an excess of vanity, tedium, or
stuffiness. Filled with vintage, emotion-packed footage and
appearances by faces from TV's past, it was as swift and engaging
as 240 electronic minutes can be. So what if the awards themselves
sometimes seemed like an afterthought, punctuation for the run-on
sentence of clips and reminiscences?
</P>
<P>
   As on most awards shows, the winners ranged from the expected
(HBO's ``From the Earth to the Moon'' for best miniseries) to the
delightful (``The Practice'' for best drama series) to the strange
and outrageous (Helen Hunt's third consecutive Emmy, over Calista
Flockhart and Jenna Elfman, for her notably wan season of ``Mad
About You''). If there was a trend, it belonged to ``Frasier,''
which won three major awards only two weeks before its high-profile
move into the Thursday night ``Seinfeld'' timeslot. The show _
certainly the most consistently funny series _ took its fifth
consecutive Emmy (a record) for outstanding comedy, Kelsey Grammer
won his third Emmy as lead actor in a comedy, and David Hyde Pierce
had his second win as a supporting player, a surprise as he was up
against a sentimental favorite, the late Phil Hartman.
</P>
<P>
   While David E. Kelley's ``Ally McBeal'' did not win in any of
its categories, the writer-producer's other celebrated show, ``The
Practice,'' won not only best dramatic series but best supporting
actress, for Camryn Manheim, who gave the show its strongest
subplot last season. Andre Braugher of ``Homicide'' took home a
long-deserved Emmy for his final season on ``Homicide,'' TV's best
cop show in spite of the fact that it has never been nominated as a
series. ``NYPD Blue,'' meanwhile, took home three statues despite
its weakest season so far. Gordon Clapp won for his supporting
work, against the more heavy-duty performances of ``ER'' actors
Noah Wyle and Eriq La Salle. ``NYPD'' also won awards for writing
and directing. Christine Lahti of `Chicago Hope' was named best
actress in a dramatic series, and, against the more formidable
comedy of Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Lisa Kudrow won as supporting
actress in a comedy series for ``Friends.''
</P>
<P>
   In an odd coincidence, Gary Sinese won for best actor in a
miniseries for ``George Wallace,'' on the day the former governor
died.
</P>
<P>
   As entertainment, the Emmy show had it all _ moments of real
sentiment, triumph, injustice, and nostalgia. There were the
fashion wonders of the world, including a radiant Julianna
Margulies, a regal Camryn Manheim, and Gillian Anderson in black
lace, and there were the requisite Clinton-Lewinski jokes, with
Chris Rock producing a cigar and Dennis Miller thanking Vernon
Jordan for his job. After a barrage of clips of TV's original
comedians, Milton Berle, Bob Hope, and Sid Ceasar appeared on stage
to a wonderfully endless standing ovation. The trio said nothing,
and that was enough.
</P>
<P>
   Most winners kept their acceptances short and sweet, some of
them genuinely emotional. ``Frasier's'' Pierce honored Hartman,
saying ``You all know how great he is,'' and Grammer referred to
his sobriety, thanking those who helped him ``at a very dark time
in my life and told me there was a way out.'' The happiest moment
came courtesy of Manheim. ``This is for all the fat girls,'' she
screamed in triumph.
</P>
<P>
   There were clever presenter pairings _ Garry Shandling and David
Duchovny, who showed their comic chemistry in the last episode of
``The Larry Sanders Show'' and again Sunday night _ and a reunion
of the living members of the ``Hill Street Blues'' premiere. The
ubiquitous clips also produced touching moments _ from John
Travolta tearfully accepting an Emmy for his late love, Diana
Hyland, to the always potent newscasts of the death of President
John F. Kennedy, presented as one of 10 TV milestones.
</P>
<P>
   The show's misteps were a trivia game before and after
commercials, and an opening sequence hosted by Bill Costas outside
the LA Shrine Auditorium, as guests arrived. Stiffly, Costas asked
questions to stars like Jenna Elfman, who talked about how being
nominated is like winning. Blah blah blah. Aside from these bits,
the night was golden.

 &HT;    Experience separates 'Birch' boys
 &HT;    By Alison Macor
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Although he's only a few weeks shy of his 15th
birthday, Joseph Mazzello is no stranger to the endless parade of
print and television interviews that make up the publicity machine
for a major motion picture such as Disney's ``Simon Birch,'' a
loose adaptation by Mark Steven Johnson of John Irving's much-loved
novel, ``A Prayer for Owen Meany.''
</P>
<P>
   A veteran of more than 10 films, including ``Jurassic Park'' and
``The River Wild,'' Mazzello speaks with authority about his role
in ``Simon Birch'' from the back seat of a limousine spiriting him
from a Houston television station to theairport.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks later, another interview takes place by phone. This time,
however, the interviewee is Ian Michael Smith, the 11-year-old
sixth-grader who plays the title role in ``Simon Birch.'' Ensconced
in his father's Ill- inois office, far from studio-rented
limousines, Smith talks about his first acting experience as his
father, Steve, remains unobtrusively in the background.
</P>
<P>
   Separated by four years, many movie roles and perhaps even
vastly different perceptions of Hollywood moviemaking, Mazzello's
and Smith's comments about the making of ``Simon Birch'' reflect
their individual approaches to acting as much as they reveal
Mazzello's veteran status in Hollywood and Smith's role as the
enthusiastic newcomer.
</P>
<P>
   Mazzello hasn't read Irving's novel but says he chose the script
because it represented an acting challenge for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really liked the character of Joe,'' says Mazzello,
referring to Simon Birch's best friend. ``I thought that he had a
lot of emotion in the movie, and he had a long range of things that
he had to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that (the role of Joe) showed my talent and what I
could do,'' says Mazzello, revealing the thoughtful choosiness that
has led to his well-received and varied screen performances.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Smith's reasons for starring in ``Simon Birch'' are
less goal-oriented. ``It might be something fun'' is what he
remembers thinking when approached to audition for the film. He
thought Johnson's script about a small boy seeking his destiny was
a ``great story'' and read half of Irving's novel before production
began last fall.
</P>
<P>
   He finished the book after shooting wrapped, and while Smith
likes the witty and sprawling novel that chronicles the fated life
of a small boy with a wrecked voice, he admits that he thought it
was a dense read. ``Too much to process,'' says the young actor,
who is a voracious reader currently plowing through Dilbert creator
Scott Adams' ``Dogbert's Top Secret Management Handbook'' and a
do-it-yourself computer programming book. Toned-down emotions
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who suffers from a rare enzyme disorder called Morquio
syndrome (symptoms include dwarfism and constant fatigue), was
given two acting coaches to help him prepare for his first film
role. Steve Smith, who acted throughout high school and college,
also worked with his son as they read the script many times to
process the film's themes. Mazzello's experience provided another
source of inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something Joe said is really right,'' says Ian Michael Smith
as he talks about getting in and out of character. ``You have to
put yourself in the character's place.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Mazzello was able to offer more input into the film
and his role because of his years of acting experience. He credits
the director for letting him decide how to handle his character.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did talk about how there were so many emotional themes,''
he says. ``We kind of toned down some of them and made them not so
sad. We didn't want this movie to be overly sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, ``Simon Birch'' has its poignant moments but some
hilariously chaotic scenes as well. Such Disney-esque mirth may
rankle fans of the Irving book, but it allows ``Simon Birch'' to
stand apart from its source and, from a marketing standpoint, to
appeal to the widest possible audience. As Mazzello says, ``We
didn't want (the movie) to be too much, for people to say, `Oh, I
can't see this movie again.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Both boys have favorite scenes from the film, and Mazzello
sounds delighted when he is told his interviewer likes the
Christmas pageant sequence and the scenes in which Simon and Joe
race through the woods in a symbolic gesture of friendship. These
also are Mazzello's favorites.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most affecting scene to him is one in which Joe,
Simon and Joe's mother Rebecca (Ashley Judd) walk down a church
aisle, beautifully backlit. ``I like how that's set up, in between
the pews and (with) the light coming through the doors,'' Mazzello
says.
</P>
<P>
   His awareness of the metaphoric power of a shot's mise-en-scene
not only suggests a veteran's sense of composition but also reveals
Mazzello's desire to direct movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm going to like the behind-the-scenes things,'' he
says. ``I've always wanted'' to direct films.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see how it is when you're actually picking the
people instead of getting picked,'' he adds, and his ability to
realize where the power lies on a film set reminds one that he's
been acting in films for most of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Smith also likes the Christmas pageant sequence, but for reasons
that go beyond its hilarity. Shot over the course of two to three
weeks, the sequence allowed the actors to get to know each other
and the children who played supporting characters Without a trace
of disingenuousness, Smith says, ``We really got to know all the
shepherds and the sheep on the set.'' Star personas
</P>
<P>
   While Mazzello hopes to attend college and direct movies, Smith
isn't entirely ready to commit to an acting career. Although he
says he'll continue to act in school plays whether or not other
movie offers materialize, Smith's plans may include practicing law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been attracted to being a lawyer ever since the
second grade,'' he says. ``We had a mock trial over a book called
`Superfudge' (by Judy Blume). We were arguing over whose fault it
was that Fudge lost his two front teeth, and I won!''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the two actors hope only that their film appeals to a
wide range of viewers. Like many of their comments, their
interpretations of the film reflect their ages and their appealing
_ and in the case of Smith, slowly emerging _ star personas.
</P>
<P>
   Mazzello articulately describes ``Simon Birch'' as being ``about
two boys looking for something: One's trying to find his father and
the other (is trying to find) his destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real family movie,'' he says. ``I think everyone's
gonna like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith offers his own description of the film, one that is sweet
without being precious, much like the character he plays in the
film.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's for all kinds of people who like all kinds of movies,''
he says, ``because it's got some stuff for the people who like sad
drama, stuff for the people who like excitement, and it's got some
funny parts, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon Birch himself couldn't have said it any better.

   Bruins wary of UT, 'ludicrous' 66-3
</P>
<P>
   By Kirk Bohls

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Mike Meyers has always been a huge college
football fan. Every Saturday afternoon, a satellite dish brought to
the Southern California home of the Fortune 500 distributor many of
the nation's elite programs. Notre Dame. Alabama. USC. And Texas.
Yes, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Meyers would sit at his father's knee and be educated.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad loves all the old teams,'' the freckle-faced giant of
an offensive guard was saying after UCLA's practice. ``Texas
football is big-time, he'd say. He used to root for Texas all the
time, but I don't think he will on Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   Allegiances change, the same as power structures and kids so
skinny they were nicknamed ``Bones.'' Andy Meyers has grown up, and
so has the game he plays. Scholarship limitations, gender equity,
the advent of pro-style offenses, better athletes, and yes, even
satellite dishes that have shrunk college football's global village
have shifted at least part of the game's power base away from
programs like Texas and UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   That's why in the '90s Colorado State and Kansas State can
finagle their way into the Top 25, why Arizona State crowds into
the traditional Pac-10 conflict along with the USC, UCLA and
Washington, why Miami of Ohio can be ranked ahead of that other
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in this class struggle with a radically altered football
landscape, Texas' image curiously remains unsoiled. How else can
Texas whip up on a hapless New Mexico State 66-36 and find itself
ranked? How else can one explain the Bruins' deferential respect
for a program they obliterated by 63 points just a year ago?
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't show us Texas football,'' UCLA linebacker Brendon
Ayanbadejo says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an automatic respect for Texas,'' center Shawn Stuart
says. ``They're Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Or they were. Since Darrell Royal coached his last season in
1976, the Longhorns have finished in the Top 10 only four times.
Texas has won only two minor bowls since 1981, one of which
(Bluebonnet) no longer even exists. Of the school's 12 losing
seasons in 105 years, five have come since 1985. Saturday's game
with UCLA would be a good place for the new coach, Mack Brown, to
start reclaiming Texas' place.
</P>
<P>
   ``They scored 66 points last week,'' UCLA Coach Bob Toledo says.
``That got our attention. Last year was just a crazy game.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Texas handed out turnovers like they were campaign
literature, and UCLA took them. And, sure, Ricky Williams was
limited to 36 yards as much by the Longhorns wanting to spare him
as the Bruins wanting to deny him. But Texas allowed it to totally
defrock part of college football royalty. Great programs do not
lose 66-3 at home. To anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect the University of Texas,'' says Ayanbadejo, one of
only four returning starters on the UCLA defense. ``But I'd have to
say they gave up last year. They put their heads down. I was
definitely surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some Horns haven't disputed it.
</P>
<P>
   Texas offensive guard Ben Adams, a Californian by birth but
Longhorn by position, called it ``the worst four hours in my entire
life. They came into our house and beat us 66-3. The one thing that
broke my heart was halfway through the third (second actually)
quarter, our fans were leaving. I don't blame 'em, but it's just so
sad.''
</P>
<P>
   The question that remains revolves around these two teams'
reaction to last year's disaster. The Bruins minimize the revenge
factor. ``That'll wear off, that initial hatred,'' Ayanbadejo
notes. ``They have a lot of tendencies. I think they're somewhat
predictable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to be out for blood, but we're going to be
motivated, too,'' Stuart adds. ``They've got some burning, but
they're by no means walking into a scared football team.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year's win snapped an 0-2 slump and propelled the Bruins to
10 consecutive wins, including a victory over Texas A&AMP;M in the
Cotton Bowl, and a preseason No. 7 ranking. Despite the loss of two
offensive players who scored 37 of the team's 60 touchdowns, the
bulk of the defense and its coordinator, UCLA is a legitimate
contender to win its second national title and first since 1954.
The Bruins have rising stars in redshirt freshman wideout Freddie
Mitchell and rookie tailback DeShaun Foster and think the team's
better than last year.
</P>
<P>
   Texas is trying to become respected again. UCLA is already
giving them that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've practiced so hard that the coaches have had to calm us
down,'' Meyers says. ``Last year's score was absolutely ludicrous.
We just caught them off guard. Hey, they probably overlooked New
Mexico State last week, but we're definitely not New Mexico
State.''

 &HT;    Collins memoirs were matter of survival
 &HT;    By Anne Morris
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Judy Collins always looks peaceful on stage
singing intricate folksongs in her pure, clear voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm peaceful,'' she says, ``but my legs are really moving
under water.'' Her voice is cheerful, familiar.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, somehow her life has always been more difficult than it
looked from the outside.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed by phone from her home in New York City, Collins
talked about the pain that produced ``Singing Lessons: A Memoir of
Love, Loss, Hope and Healing,'' and the accompanying CD of four
original songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Upon my son's death it seemed clear that I had to write about
it,'' she said. ``It really was the only way I could get through
the personal recovery.'' Clark, her son and only child, committed
suicide in 1992, leaving a wife and child. He had been troubled for
years with drug and alcohol addiction, but appeared to be doing
better.
</P>
<P>
   Devastated by Clark's death, Collins looked for ways to live
afterward . Always a reader, she tried to find books on suicide
survival. There was none that spoke to her. She kept a journal,
writing daily meditations, and began writing the story of her life
and her son's. ``Singing Lessons'' includes what she learned about
suicide, addictions and survival through therapy, through friends,
through books. In the end, she learned to live again, even to allow
herself to experience joy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was an important story to tell,'' she said. ``I
was determined to get this story out.''
</P>
<P>
   No one wanted a book about suicide, but as a memoir, it could be
published.
</P>
<P>
   Since she had earlier written an autobiography, this book does
not go into as much detail about all parts of her life as it might.
There is a fair amount about her much-adored father, a radio
performer sightless since he was a child and unpredictable when he
drank; a description of her bouts with polio and tuberculosis and
of her recovery from alcoholism; stories of her demanding music
teachers, her developing career. But sometimes, the book leaves you
wanting more.
</P>
<P>
   For example, you'll be reading along about her musical history
and run into a sentence like: ``I had become friends with John
Phillips, with whom I had taken my first acid trip, and who...would
put together the Mamas and Papas.'' In the next paragraph she's
talking about using a cello on an album for the first time. It's
all straightforward and matter-of-fact, yet strangely warm and
open. You learn her family was, and is, important to her. You learn
how hard she worked and what social issues she cared about. In some
ways she was highly disciplined; in others, not at all. She came to
fame in the '60s, after all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted you to know the context of my life, but I wanted to
not go into detail with things that would take away from the
flow.''
</P>
<P>
   The main story is about Clark. Her meditations about his loss
alternate with the chapters. As a teen-ager she married his father,
a graduate student in English literature. At first, her singing
largely supported their lives. But as it took her away more and
more, they grew apart. With the divorce she lost custody of her
son. When he was 9, and his father had remarried, Clark came back
to her.
</P>
<P>
   The book describes her therapy, her son's therapy _ successes
and failures. ``I think that a 28-day program and a recovery
program for addictions can work,'' she said. ``Most of us have some
addiction _ something we'd like to change in our lives. Although it
has its benefits, I'm not sure therapy is terribly helpful for
those things. In my therapy I ran into a bunch of people that I
don't think were very helpful in the long run for me, but I don't
know how I would've managed to live if I hadn't found them in the
first place.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Collins turns to short-term therapy. Living day by
day, she exercises, meditates and, of course, sings. Such things
have saved her life.
</P>
<P>
   A fan of President Bill Clinton, who along with Hillary is a fan
of hers, Collins gives a chapter to her performances in Washington,
D.C., and her night spent in the Lincoln bedroom, after which she
got up and jogged with the president.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky affair, Collins is
worried about her friend. She called him recently on Martha's
Vineyard to wish him a happy birthday. ``In the midst of it, I
think he was stunned that anybody was on the phone to him,''
Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   She sees Clinton now as having a serious problem but hopes the
presidency can be salvaged. ``You and I hired this guy,'' she said.
``What do you do with somebody who's an employee who's got
problems, but who's also got tremendous strengths? Do you want to
throw away all the good things? Do you only focus on the negative?
I must say, though, that it's essential in a personal crisis of
this kind where there's some kind of dysfunction or illness going
on that it be confronted. I have no doubt about that.''
</P>
<P>
   In the happy part of Collins' book, she marries the man she has
been with for 17 years and embraces the future as embodied by her
work, her granddaughter. At 59, the singer is doing more concerts
than ever and continuing to write songs and books. ``Sixty? It's
there and I don't feel any particular way about it...I have no
intention of retiring. Anybody who has the kind of life that I've
had knows that's not in the cards. I'll probably do a novel next.''
</P>
<P>
   She reads constantly. This past summer it was mostly
biographies, though she also had ``Memoirs of a Geisha'' and Iris
Murdoch's ``Jackson's Dilemma'' on her stack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I've found through my writing the kind of voice that I
needed to find that singing could not provide for me,'' Collins
said. ``It's essential for me to continue to write prose ...
there's more freedom in it.''

 &HT;    Jenkins slows down, but not his satire
 &HT;    By Patrick Beach
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The good news is that even though Dan Jenkins
has sworn off all the fun stuff that's bad for you, his fictional
characters have not. (One of the myriad advantages of being a
fictional character is you don't have to watch your cholesterol.)
The usual suspects in his new novel, ``Rude Behavior,'' have been
with him since 1972's ``Semi-Tough.'' And although they're older,
they're unrepentant in their personal habits: They smoke, drink,
inhale slabs of red meat, drive drunk and make ethnic jokes. They
litter.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins, a Fort Worth native who now splits his time between
Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla., and Manhattan, has survived decades of not
dissimilar behavior. Jenkins was one of the handful of star scribes
that made Sports Illustrated a high-flying magazine. ``SI was a big
drinking place and we socialized a lot, and we had huge expense
accounts and ran around the world with rich and famous people and
it was fun,'' says Austin's Bud Shrake, a friend and former
colleague of Jenkins'.
</P>
<P>
   The pace is a little slower for Jenkins these days. He still
writes a column for Golf Digest and covers the major tournaments
for the magazine. Books have come out of him with regularity, too _
15 in all. ``Semi-Tough'' became the cornerstone of a trilogy, and
Jenkins isn't sure he's done with these characters yet. The book
follows Billy Clyde Puckett, now retired from both football and,
more recently, the broadcast booth, in his efforts to win an NFL
franchise for a team he dubs the West Texas Tornadoes. There is a
lot of cussing, a lot of impolite remarks, and a lot of the action
takes place in barrooms. That's how you can tell it's a Jenkins
book. Politically correct it's not, but then satire never is.
People are still hollering about a certain word Mark Twain used
abundantly in ``The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,'' after all.
</P>
<P>
   We caught up with Jenkins at his Florida home last week, the
morning after Mark McGwire's historic 62nd season home run. You
could tell it was a big deal, because Jenkins _ whose attitude
toward baseball can most charitably be described as ambivalent _
watched it. Or at least parts of it. What follows is an edited
transcript of that conversation. Q: Mark McGwire _ did you watch?
Do you care? A: I flipped over every time he came up to bat. I was
watching tennis. So I saw him walk and hit a home run. That was a
great moment, really. I like baseball when they get down to it and
there's something special going on. And I don't care how many
steroids he takes. Q: How do you feel about the new book? A: It
took a little longer to do this one because I had some health
problems, but I like it. It's these characters I've had for a few
years. I started on this book four years ago, and I keep going to
golf tournaments, and then I had some health problems. I had a
bypass, had a gall bladder out and all those things that happen to
guys when they get older. It just delayed getting over to the word
processor. Novels are hard but fun. They're fun because you don't
have to ask anybody anything, unlike journalism. You just make it
up. Q: You've had these characters a long time. A: 1972 with
``Semi-Tough.'' These are characters I know pretty well. I guess
there's a lot of me in all of them. There are certain ideas I like
to express from time to time. There's probably more of me in Big
Ed. Everybody thinks I'm supposed to be Billy Clyde. Q: They're not
exactly politically correct. A: Well they're not supposed to be.
Political correctness is my sworn enemy. But that's fun, though. Q:
Do you worry about being accused of ethnic insensitivity, or has it
happened so often you don't notice any more? A: I never worried
about that. You may find this hard to understand, but I believe
this book is more politically correct than people think. The women
are always smarter and the black guys always win. One of the nicest
compliments I ever got was when ``Semi-Tough'' came out and I got a
note from Alex Haley, who said, ``I want you to know this is the
most anti-racist book I've ever read.''I'm used to being called a
racist. I know that going in. But I usually get pretty good
reaction from people I consider intelligent. I hope people buy it
because it's funny. Q: Was the section on how to tamper with
airplane lavatory smoke detectors so you can sneak cigarettes taken
from direct experience? A: I don't smoke any more. I had to give it
up. But I started thinking, If I did smoke, what would I do?
Although I did know a Hollywood guy, an agent, who told me to take
the cellophane and the Scotch tape and put it over the smoke
detector in the john. Q: Speaking of Hollywood, you've had some
close calls. How does a writer survive out there? A: You can't. If
they offer you money, take it. And you have no control. Bud Shrake
and I have had a lot of dealings with Hollywood. It's been fun, but
it's also been agony and you just never win. They keep giving you
money for development, and you just think, (use) me again. Give me
another $100,000 to not make my book into a movie. But the thing
about it is, it's all such a committee deal out there. The only
time the movie is yours is in the first draft. But they've never
shot a first draft of anything in the history of Hollywood. Q:
After so many decades and pieces, how is it you have anything to
say about golf? A: I do a monthly column and the four majors
(tournaments) and that keeps me off the streets. I get to go to the
things and hear lines I can steal for my books. I've now been to
more major championships that anybody that lived, I'm certain. I've
been to 47 straight Masters. Q: A few of the old guard like Frank
DeFord have returned to Sports Illustrated. Would you ever consider
that? A: When I left, I left. No, I'd never even consider it. It's
not run by intelligent human beings any more. It's not a writer's
magazine, it's an editor's magazine. We always thought we were
doing journalism when we were there. I don't know what they think
they're doing now. They target a younger audience. It's got that
comic book look to it. Q: So what do you read? A: I read the New
Yorker, I take Vanity Fair, I read almost anything that'll help me
impeach Clinton, I take the New York Times _ Maureen Dowd is my
favorite writer in America. I read a lot of World War II stuff,
anything I can get my hands on about the Civil War, I read all the
James Lee Burkes and all the detective writers for fun, but I read
for recreation. I re-read a lot too, people like Raymond Chandler.
I don't read literature. You'll never catch me with a Cormac
McCarthy in my hand, or Updike. I looked at that Modern Library
list (the controversial list of the 20th c entury's 100 best novels
written in English) and figured I'd read about 11 of them and
hadn't heard of about 20 of them. Q: How much are you on the road?
A: Well, I go to those golf tournaments, and we have an apartment
in New York, and we go back to Fort Worth. I travel more than most
people. The 23 or 24 years I worked for SI, I was gone every other
week. Having traveled all my life, it doesn't seem like I'm
traveling at all. Q: Did the road take its toll on you physically?
A: I think it did, but I'm 67 years old. I've had bypass, I've had
hernia operations, dental implants, eye problems, all that stuff
catches up with you. It kind of hit me all at once. You pay for
your sins _you pay for your fun, really. So I'm leading a clean
life now, got my golf game back now where I can break 80. Life is
good. All I miss is cigarettes. Q: People still think you live in
Texas, even though it's been decades. A: Ten years after I left the
(Dallas) Times-Herald, guys still talked about how I had a column
there. Most people don't leave, and they don't think anybody else
leaves. Q: What's the next book? A: I've read so many bad golf
books lately. They're all full of zen. I'm gonna write a thin,
funny golf novel. I wrote one comic golf novel, ``Dead Solid
Perfect,'' but it was before the golf boom. And somewhere down the
line I'd like to write a memoir. Q: Thanks for the time. Any
parting shots? A: Nah. If you need anything else, just make it up.

 &HT;    Going outside always beats going online
 &HT;    By Emily J. Minor
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Are you tired?
</P>
<P>
   Does your back hurt?
</P>
<P>
   Feel like you're in a funk?
</P>
<P>
   Well, it might be more than just the Monday morning blues.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if you spent hour upon hour at the computer over the
weekend _ and which one of us out there didn't? _ you could have a
bigger problem than just wishing it were still Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   I'm talking about the latest rage and, no, it has nothing to do
with Bill Clinton's feelings for Ken Starr.
</P>
<P>
   It's Internet depression. And, in case you think I'm lying,
there's a $1.5 million study out there to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   About four years ago, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University
selected 98 families from the Pittsburgh area, families that had
never used the Internet. Or at least not very much.
</P>
<P>
   The study paid for a computer, an extra phone line and Internet
connection in each of these homes. And then they sat back for three
years and watched the families' on-line wanderings.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, the researchers measured everyone's mental
standings through a variety of psychological tests. And guess what?
</P>
<P>
   People who use the computer a lot have an increased amount of
depression.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a horrid depression. We're not saying you'll be fine
one day, suicidal the next. But people who day after day, year
after year, used the Internet felt sad and isolated. They were in a
funk.
</P>
<P>
   Now, sometimes people forget about a little something I like to
call common sense and I think that's what happened with the folks
who just got done spending $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   See, I am the mother of a computer-loving 7-year-old. And I
could have given you similar results for a lot less money.
</P>
<P>
   My findings?
</P>
<P>
   Kids who use the computer have a glazed look. They practically
forget to use the bathroom. They throw a fit when you tell them to
turn off the computer, now, and do homework. And at the dinner
table, they talk about that little Pac-Man guy instead of the cool
fort they built out back after school.
</P>
<P>
   A Virginia psychologist who specializes in on-line mental health
_ I love that _ has this to say about the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Internet has the potential to imbalance people's
lives in ways they don't expect,'' says Dr. Leonard Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes' job is fascinating. He watches the effects of computers
on humans. And here's what worries the doctor:
</P>
<P>
   When you're with someone in real life, you can naturally take a
little break from that someone. It kind of happens innately, like
when your husband's on your nerves. You leave the room.
</P>
<P>
   That's the real world.
</P>
<P>
   But in the virtual world, you can have solitude and contact at
the same time. When someone's on your nerves _ say, your virtual
lover _ you don't have to leave the room. You're already alone! And
that's a bizarre interpersonal thing (``thing'' being the true
medical term) that people like Dr. Holmes are studying.
</P>
<P>
   But don't get caught up in all that clinical mumbo-jumbo. Just
remember.
</P>
<P>
   Balance is good.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving the room when your husband is on your nerves is better.
</P>
<P>
   And building a fort outdoors after school is best.
</P>
<P>
   Now give me my $1.5 million.

 &HT;    ``Silent strike''
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Gov. George Bush, with his background as a
baseball owner, should understand. If you want to compete you have
to pony up.
</P>
<P>
   If all that matters to you is keeping your payroll down, if you
look at players as expendable and interchangeable, you can watch
your franchise make a beeline for the basement. You can watch your
star players bolt for free agency.
</P>
<P>
   That's what's happening in Texas schools, in a development
framed in terms that a baseball team owner in the '90s should
appreciate: The Texas State Teachers Association calls it a
``silent strike.''
</P>
<P>
   No, this isn't guys with in gold chains around their big necks
driving off in their BMWs to tough it out on the hundred thousand
in that last paycheck. This is teachers saying goodbye to their
chosen profession, or at least to pursuing it in Texas public
schools. Unprecedented numbers of teachers are reported to be
declaring free agency or retiring outright.
</P>
<P>
   What's a school to do? In lingo a '90s baseball owner should
understand, schools are having to turn to what the strike-torn
major leagues got to know as ``replacement players'' _
non-certified teachers in classes they aren't qualified to teach.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, ya bums. You get the slop you pay for. You expect a scab
pitcher to throw 94 mph fastballs?
</P>
<P>
   With an election approaching, you need a radar gun to clock
candidates in their zest to demonstrate their claim on education as
an issue. Bush is one of those on the campaign trail talking about
increasing teachers' pay with some of the projected $3.7 billion
state surplus.
</P>
<P>
   It's interesting to hear this now. During the 75th Legislature,
way back in 1997, you heard no such urgency about teacher pay from
Bush _ or John Sharp, or Rick Perry, or just about anyone else _
though the issue was no less urgent.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the modest teacher pay raise that did emerge in '97
came only after someone influential and with backbone, someone like
state Sen. Bill Ratliff, R-Mount Pleasant, pointed out that
lawmakers were about to renege on a 1995 promise to teachers.
</P>
<P>
   In the '95 session the legislature dropped the state's merit pay
plan for teachers and agreed to implement a teacher-pay ``escalator
clause'' _ meaning that if the state increased spending on
education, it had to increase its salary base accordingly. Leaders
like State Sen. Teel Bivins, R-Amarillo, chair of the Senate
Education Committee, tried to weasel out of any raise by saying
that no additional dollars were being spent on education, hence no
escalation.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though it appeared as excruciating as yielding a
kidney stone, our lawmakers did raise the state base pay for
teachers. This little flashback should put today's ``urgency'' in
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's opponent for governor, Garry Mauro, is saying he would
give Texas teachers a $6,000 across-the-board raise to bring the
state up from its rank of 38th nationally in average pay up to the
middle of the pack, costing about $3.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Bush says he'd send $1 billion to school districts to spend as
they wish on teacher pay or class sizes, and would reduce property
taxes for school districts to the tune of $2 billion. The
assumption with the latter move is that school districts would have
more wiggle room to raise revenue to meet their needs.
</P>
<P>
   Under his proposal, the onus would be on local school boards to
raise the money the state otherwise might spend on schools, and to
take the subsequent heat.
</P>
<P>
   One must ask whether the property-tax wrinkle is meant to
benefit the players on the field, the educators, or if it's
something ultimately to comfort those in the luxury boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Would Texas be anywhere close to the national average in teacher
pay with this proposal? Bet you a McGwire home run ball it
wouldn't.

show
 &HT;    By Jeff Houck
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service

<P>
   More than 30 years after it first arrived on TV, Hollywood
Squares is making a comeback. The show, which begins airing tonight
in syndication (7:30 p.m., WPTV-Channel 5), will follow the
familiar format of contestants playing tick-tack-toe as they try to
figure out whether celebrities are giving them the correct answer
to trivia questions, or whether they are lying through their teeth.
</P>
<P>
   To celebrate America's facination with game shows (there's even
an entire cable TV channel dedicated to game shows!) join us for
our own game and take a peek at their kooky past.

   2. Before the host reads a question, each player chooses a game
piece (either the head of Monty or Wink) and takes turns flipping a
coin to advance around the board. Flip heads, move one space. Flip
tails, move two spaces. Give an incorrect answer, move one space
back.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   `WE WERE THE SHOW FOR THE CELEBS TO DO'
</P>
<P>
   A new version of Hollywood Squares is about to hit the air this
week. Peter Marshall, the show's host during its original 15-year
run, says he's a little apprehensive about his baby. He wasn't too
crazy about the show's second run from 1986 to 1989 with John
Davidson as host.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it's going to be OK,'' Marshall said. ``I didn't like
the second one too much. Instead of making it a game show with some
humor, they made it a comedy show with some questions.''
</P>
<P>
   He does, however, like Squares' new host, Tom Bergeron. (The new
show begins airing at 7:30 p.m. today on WPTV-Channel 5 in West
Palm Beach and on WFOR-Channel 4 in Miami.)
</P>
<P>
   And if anyone knows about hosting a game show, it's Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   He's back on the air hosting the movie-trivia game show The Reel
to Reel Picture Show on the newly launched PAX TV network, but from
1966 to 1981, Marshall was at the helm of Squares, one of the most
successful daytime shows in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were the show for the celebs to do during that time. Us and
the Tonight show,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At its core, the show answered the question: What would happen
if you combined a 40-foot-tall tic-tac-toe game with the atmosphere
of a cocktail party? Contestants would try to decide if a celebrity
was answering a trivia question correctly or trying to bluff.
</P>
<P>
   A correct guess would grant them a square on the tic-tac-toe
board.
</P>
<P>
   The guests _ from the snide Paul Lynde in the center square to
regulars Wally Cox, George Gobel, Charley Weaver and Rose Marie _
were usually witty with their comebacks and their answers to
Marshall's trivia questions. And often the contestants couldn't
tell if the answers they heard were gospel truth or a
straight-faced bluff.
</P>
<P>
   The show wound up turning B-grade Hollywood castaways and
character actors into household names before it eventually
attracted the big stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``My philosophy was that we should build the stars,'' Marshall
said. ``Some of the biggest stars were the dullest guests. Groucho
Marx didn't understand the show's function. He thought he had to do
a monologue. He didn't get that it should be the question, the joke
or the answer, and get out in less than 45 seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   There were some classic moments. Like the time actor Jack
Palance fell asleep during the game.
</P>
<P>
   And when an earthquake hit during the middle of a taping.
Everyone fled from the studio except Paul Lynde, who stayed seated
in his square on the set.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a cameraman to my right who stood up on a riser,''
Marshall said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the quake hit, he jumped off the riser, ran off the set,
out of the studio and we never saw him again.''
</P>
<P>
   `PRICE' WAS RIGHT FOR STAMBAUGH, ONE OF FIRST TV GAME SHOW
MODELS
</P>
<P>
   The irony isn't lost on Carolyn Stambaugh.
</P>
<P>
   Living in a small apartment on New York City's East Side in
1956, she'd hop on a crosstown bus to get to the Hudson Theater on
West 48th. Once there, she'd spend the entire day as a model on The
Price is Right, wearing luxurious mink coats and diamond jewelry,
lounging on expensive furniture and showing off swanky cars and
boats.
</P>
<P>
   Then at the end of the day she'd get back on a bus or in a cab
and go back to her little apartment. The job earned her $12,000 a
year _ not bad for the time, but nothing like today's huge
salaries.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a high-profile job tacked on to the top of a resume
filled with modeling and beauty pageant achievements that ranged
from the cover of Ladies Home Journal to being crowned Orange Bowl
queen.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Charlotte, N.C., she moved to the Palm Beaches when she
was 12 and has lived here on and off ever since. She started her
career after studying at the Palm Beach School of Modeling, showing
Worth Avenue fashions at the Everglades Club. Now, she lives in
Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   From there, her agent got her the TV job in New York that would
elevate her career. (She was Carolyn Stroupe back then, but later
married Palm Beach dentist Dr. Reginald Stambaugh.) For that first
year of The Price is Right, she was a television pioneer of sorts,
along with fellow model Beverly Bentley. They were the Vanna Whites
of their time, posing gracefully and elegantly running their hands
over the merchandise. Every game show hostess since has been using
that same technique.
</P>
<P>
   ``The director gave us a great piece of advice,'' she said. ``He
told us to move as if we were moving through oil. That way, the
camera could follow us and it would look nice and smooth. And, you
know, he was right.''
</P>
<P>
   The Price is Right went on to become the longest-running daytime
game show in television history, first with the likable Bill Cullen
as host and then with dapper Bob Barker.
</P>
<P>
   The big difference between the early days of the show and
Barker's version, says Stambaugh, is that her show was live every
day on NBC. You couldn't just stop the tape machine when something
went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stage hands would, for example, roll out a stove on a
dolly and they'd walk away,'' she remembered. ``You'd go to show it
and sometimes the merchandise would fall down cockeyed and you'd
still have to go on showing it as if nothing happened. The audience
loved that.''
</P>
<P>
   And unlike the Price is Right models today who think nothing of
posing in tiny bathing suits, Stambaugh says she refused to pose in
lingerie or anything skimpy. ``I felt it was important to keep my
dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   Stambaugh left the show before the end of 1957 to do other
modeling work, including some for a beer company. After modeling,
she got her master's degree in mental health counseling.
</P>
<P>
   The mother of four children, Stambaugh, 65, said she's been
blessed with success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any good things that have come to me have done so because God
has been very good to me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   HOW WINSTON MARTINDALE BECAME `WINK'
</P>
<P>
   Of all the arcane facts about game shows crammed into David
Schwartz's brain, perhaps the most valuable is the answer to this
long-pondered question: How does a guy get a name like Wink
Martindale?
</P>
<P>
   Apparently the Winkster was hosting a show in 1964 for NBC
called What's This Song? Then known around Los Angeles as Winston
Martindale, or Win for short, he tweaked it a little bit more. As a
kid, he'd been known as Wink, so he picked it up for a professional
moniker as well.
</P>
<P>
   It's this kind of minutiae that has made Schwartz a human
Smithsonian of game show trivia. His book The Encyclopedia of TV
Game Shows, co-written with Steve Ryan and Fred Wostbrock, is a
must read for anyone obsessed with the details of The Dating Game
or the nuttiness of The Newlywed Game. The book, filled with gobs
of information on more than 500 shows, is set to be updated in a
third edition early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz, who has parlayed his knowledge into a job as a
librarian and historian for The Game Show Network, says the lure is
powerful.
</P>
<P>
   ``People always love to play games, whether it's Hollywood
Squares or Jeopardy!. People keep coming back because they are so
very simple to play, and they can become instantly involved with
them. I mean, Wheel of Fortune is nothing more than an elaborate
game of hangman.''
</P>
<P>
   So with all this flotsam floating through his head, there have
to be some favorites, right?
</P>
<P>
   Favorite host: Nobody in particular, but Bill Cullen of To Tell
The Truth and The Price is Right fame is at the top. He hosted more
than 20 shows, more than any other star. ``He could do any kind of
game show and make it work. He was the great, common, everyday
host.''
</P>
<P>
   Favorite show: Concentration. ``I had all the home games and I
watched it all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Favorite game show moment: ``I remember a time on Classic
Concentration when Alex Trebek (the host) let his hair down when
they were doing a `Summer of Love' week, saluting Woodstock and all
that. They had Alex in his long hair and love beads and giving away
classic cars on the show. It was definitely a different side of
Alex than what we see on Jeopardy!.''
</P>
<P>
   `PICTURE' SO BAD, GLEASON APOLOGIZED
</P>
<P>
   For every wildly successful show like Jeopardy! and Wheel of
Fortune, there are dozens of stinkers like You're in the Picture.
</P>
<P>
   That show involved four celebrities sitting behind a picture in
a frame 7 feet high and 10 feet wide. They would then put their
heads through porthole cutouts and try to guess what actions their
characters were performing in the picture.
</P>
<P>
   Even with Jackie Gleason as host, the 1961 show tanked
miserably, lasting only one day.
</P>
<P>
   One day.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Gleason sat on a chair on an empty stage,
apologized for the first broadcast and spent the program just
talking to the audience. It was one of the biggest bombs in TV
history.
</P>
<P>
   If a Museum of Bad Television ever opens, Picture could join
these less than stellar efforts:
</P>
<P>
   _ Gaters _ ESPN's outdoor show had participants performing gags
such as catching oversized pretzels on a plunger and using a
slingshot with plastic balls to hit paper plates in the air.
Winners received T-shirts and caps.
</P>
<P>
   _ Made in America _ Hans Conreid, the voice of Snidely Whiplash
in the Dudley Do-Right cartoons, hosted this 1964 bomb. A celebrity
panel tried to guess how the guests, who were all millionaires,
made their fortunes. If the guest stumped the panel, the $600 prize
was donated to charity. The show lasted a month.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bedroom Buddies _ Three couples, either married, engaged or
just living together, competed in this adult-oriented game. On the
program, couples had to prove how well they knew their mate. One
round of ``romantic choices'' was played, in which each couple was
given a question like, ``What was your most exciting encounter?''
One mate had to guess what his or her partner said from between two
choices. The show lasted four weeks.

   Not many people have noticed a new kind of investment account
that gives families a way to save big chunks of money for college
and to defer paying taxes on the earnings.
</P>
<P>
   It looks like a sweetheart of a deal, but is it? It turns out
that this is a decision each family will have to make for itself.
</P>
<P>
   The new accounts are called savings trusts or ``529 plans,''
after the section of the federal tax law that set them up.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how they work: A parent, grandparent or even a friend can
set up an account for a child. There are no income limitations on
who can participate. You can put up to $50,000 a year in some of
the plans, although anything over $10,000 a year will force you to
consider the possibility of paying gift taxes. The maximum an
account can accumulate is slightly over $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   You have to pay current income taxes on the amount you
contribute. But earnings are sheltered until you withdraw them for
college expenses. Then they are taxed at the child's rate, not the
contributor's. You can use the money for expenses _ including room
and board _ at any accredited post-secondary institution in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   States like the plans because the program is likely to be
popular and because at least some of these savings will end up
benefiting public colleges in the state that sponsors a given plan.
</P>
<P>
   But many financial advisers advise families to think carefully
before pouring their savings into a 529. Here are some potential
problem areas:
</P>
<P>
   -- You can't control your own investments. These plans are
managed by state governments, and the government picks both the
managers and the investment products your money will go into. It
could be certificates of deposit, bonds, stocks or some mixture.
</P>
<P>
   Investing in the most conservative investments could be a major
mistake, said Alan McKnight, a certified financial planner in
Atlanta. ``Obviously you need an investment that is going to beat
the inflation in college costs,'' he said. ``If you are in CDs or
something else with low returns, you are not necessarily going to
make any headway with your savings.''
</P>
<P>
   -- You might be able to do better on your own. Index or
tax-managed mutual funds, for example, might give you a competitive
return without too great a tax penalty.
</P>
<P>
   -- If your child doesn't go to college, or if you take the money
out for any reason other than college expenses, you will have to
pay both income tax and a penalty. ``It really sort of handcuffs
people,'' McKnight said.
</P>
<P>
   -- This is a new product line, so the plans have little or no
track record to examine.
</P>
<P>
   There are several reasons why 529 plans have not gotten much
attention until now. One is that they are new _ made possible in
the 1997 Taxpayer Relief Act and made more attractive by subsequent
rule-making.
</P>
<P>
   Another is that Georgia doesn't have one. But more than 20 other
states do, and at least four of them will open accounts for
out-of-state residents. They are Montana, New Hampshire, New York
and Utah.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to look into 529 plans, the best place to start is
on the Internet. Start at www
</P>
<P>
   .collegesavings.org/online.htm, where you will find a nearly
up-to-date listing of state-sponsored savings plans, and links to
them. The link ``information clearinghouse'' gives more resources.
</P>
<P>
   Look over several of the plans, and call or write for more
information. Note that the details in each of these plans vary. The
minimum contribution may be different, for example. You may want to
check out which state agencies are involved in setting up the plan,
and you certainly will want to know something about the money
manager.
</P>
<P>
   A crucial difference will be the kinds of investments allowed in
each state's plans. As with any other major investment, you need to
be sure you're getting what you want.
</P>
<P>
   On the conservative end, the Montana plan puts your money into
something called CollegeSure certificates of deposit, which are
issued by a bank in Helena, Mont.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire accounts will be managed by Fidelity Investments,
the giant mutual fund company. The money goes into one of seven
investment portfolios. Each will hold a mix of stocks, bonds and
money market investments, and the mix will become more conservative
as the child nears college age.
</P>
<P>
   New York picked TIAA-CREF as its manager, and the investment
rationale is similar to Fidelity's.
</P>
<P>
   Utah's selections include a Vanguard bond fund and the Vanguard
Index 500 fund.

 &HT;    COLUMN: The time of year when subs get eaten alive
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ The woolly worms have begun wiggling their
way across our country roads, signaling winter's imminence with its
pall of short, gray days and serious lack of things to do once the
ironing is finished and the soaps have lost their suds. Vistas of
bleak and aimless lives loom ahead. Soon it'll be cabin fever time.
</P>
<P>
   But there's hope on the horizon. How about a change of pace this
winter? Why not consider being a sub? No, not the kind with salami,
cheese and special sauce; I'm talking about the kind that surfaces
in the principal's office about 7:30 on Monday morning looking
dazed but determined.
</P>
<P>
   School districts everywhere are hurting for substitute teachers.
The pay's not bad and there are no papers to grade. All you have to
do is show up, decipher the absent teacher's lesson plan, and
locate the nearest restroom. Piece of cake.
</P>
<P>
   But it takes some preparation. Here's what you do:
</P>
<P>
   First, drive around your district and check out the schools to
kind of get an idea what you might be getting into. If the grass is
over the tops of the kids' combat boots and the bulletin board out
front is advertising flak jackets instead of sock hops, skip it.
Same with barred windows. Graffiti on the doors, particularly if
it's misspelled, is not a good sign either. And if more than a
third of the cars in the parking lot lack wheels, keep moving.
</P>
<P>
   However, don't let rows of BMWs with an occasional Range Rover
thrown in fool you. They are not an indication of the caliber of
staff you'll be working with. Those belong to the kids.
</P>
<P>
   Once you have reconnoitered and lined up a few possibles, call
the school and find out what they pay. If their first offer makes
you laugh out loud, go ahead and cross them off your list, because
schools aren't big on haggling. Remember, though, a school that
let's teachers drink coffee in the classroom is worth a couple of
bucks less than what you might have been expecting.
</P>
<P>
   Next you have to decide whether you want to limit your duty to
the elementary or the high schools. There's a big difference.
</P>
<P>
   Elementary scenario: Timmy screams, ``Teacher! Teacher! Johnny
just threw my Mighty Mouse lunchbox out the window.'' Teacher asks
Johnny why he did that. Johnny says, ``Because.'' Teacher tells
Johnny he's going to have to go to the principal's office. Johnny
bursts into tears and wets his pants.
</P>
<P>
   High school scenario: Frangipani points to a tattooed kid
nicknamed ``Bad Bubba'' and yells, ``Hey teach! Bubba just threw
Elwood out the window.'' Teacher asks Bad Bubba why he did that.
Bubba tells teacher to mind her own business because he knows where
she lives.
</P>
<P>
   Before I hired on as a full-time middle school English teacher,
I did some subbing. It was OK_ particularly in my home district. A
good bunch of kids with only the expected one or two who would do
their best to act like the lead ape in a sequel to ``Godzilla Goes
to School'' and try the patience of the saintliest of subs.
</P>
<P>
   But subbing is not something the uninitiated would want to
blunder into without a few tips from the pros. Here goes:
</P>
<P>
   1. Let the kids pass notes as long as it doesn't interfere with
the lesson. Should you feel obliged to intercept one, for heaven's
sakes don't read it. It'll curl your hair and even the four-letter
words will be misspelled.
</P>
<P>
   2. No matter how persuasive the argument, do not allow the kids
to convince you it's OK to leave for lunch 15 minutes early _ even
on pizza day.
</P>
<P>
   3. Only one at a time in the restroom because the next thing you
know, you'll be reading ``Moby Dick'' to an empty classroom.
</P>
<P>
   4. Don't believe the stories of what they did to their last sub.
</P>
<P>
   5. And for pity sakes don't mess with a seating chart. No one is
going to answer to the right name anyway. Take a headcount and if a
few are missing don't make a big deal of it. Enjoy. The old adage
``the more the merrier'' does not apply in classrooms _ at least
not for teachers.
</P>
<P>
   6. Don't aim for the impossible. If Freddy insists he always
lies on the floor when he writes, let him. Efforts to whip him into
shape would be pointless. Just be sure he's not where you have to
step over him at any time. Particularly if you happen to be wearing
a dress.
</P>
<P>
   There's more, but you'll figure it out on your own. Meanwhile,
ditch those wintertime blahs.
</P>
<P>
   Get out there and be a sub!
</P>

 &HT;    Planetary rotation confounds clocks
 &HT;    By Dick Stanley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ University of Texas astronomers want you to know
exactly why time will linger for a second _ but only for a second _
on the last second of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   It galls these scientists whenever they hear or read that the
standstill is necessary to compensate for tidal forces that are
slowing down the Earth's rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety-nine articles out of 100 will say that, and it's wrong,
wrong, wrong, wrong,'' said Peter Shelus, a research astronomer at
UT's McDonald Observatory in West Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Shelus particularly worries about this because he specializes in
time. He manages the observatory's Laser Ranging Operations, and he
will be attentive on the last second of Dec. 31 when time stands
still long enough for the world's official timekeepers to insert an
extra second into the year. They'll do it to get their precise
atomic clocks into sync with the planet's somewhat unreliable
rotation.
</P>
<P>
   One extra second is all that the ominous-sounding Directorate of
Time _ actually a division of the U.S. Naval Observatory in
Washington _ needs to get the Coordinated Universal Time clocks up
to snuff.
</P>
<P>
   This leap second, as it is called, is similar to the day added
during leap years to get the calendar in line with the planet's
journey around the sun. This year's leap second will be the 22nd
extra-second adjustment decreed by the International Bureau of
Weights and Measures in Paris, France, under international
agreements.
</P>
<P>
   The last leap second was added on June 30, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Leap seconds are necessary because the atomic timepieces are far
more precise than the roughly 24-hour day dictated by the planet's
rotation. Traditionally, time was set by the rotation of the planet
because people became accustomed to the passage of the sun across
the sky. Early clock makers used pendulums to set time's rate, but
they are affected by humidity and faulty mechanisms. But the
planet's rotation, which is affected by the tides and such things
as the globe's friction with its atmosphere and the sloshing of the
liquid metal at its core, is consistent to only a mere few
thousandths of a second per day.
</P>
<P>
   To be more precise, scientists arbitrarily chose to mark time by
the reliable vibrations of cesium atoms. They defined the solar
second as 9.162770 billion atomic vibrations. Atomic clocks
calculate the passage of time by measuring the vibration of cesium
atoms, which are accurate to within a few billionths of a second
per day.
</P>
<P>
   Most people wouldn't miss a second, or even two, but Shelus said
the world's space agencies, for example, would quickly notice the
loss. When a satellite is moving through its orbit at several miles
a second, a second can go a long way. Complicating things is the
Earth's movement around the sun at 14 miles a second.
</P>
<P>
   But the leap second is something of a dinosaur and may
eventually be discarded. Increasingly, jetliners, ships and even
sport fishermen navigate the planet with electronic instruments
taking signals from a constellation of satellites called the Global
Positioning System. Each satellite carries its own cesium atomic
clock.
</P>
<P>
   So enjoy this year's extra second. There may not be a second
chance.

 &HT;    Detroit bank has married home equity and credit card debt
 &HT;    By Gene Tharpe
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Will you, credit card, take this home equity line as your legal
debt to hold and pay?
</P>
<P>
   Millions of Americans owe billions of dollars to credit cards
and home equity lines. Now, a Detroit-based bank has married the
two types of debts.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan National Bank last month announced its Equi-Money VISA
Gold, a credit card secured by the cardholder's equity in his or
her home.
</P>
<P>
   That means the card's credit limit is determined by the home
equity amount, which could be $10,000, $25,000 or more _ money
that's quickly available to the cardholder.
</P>
<P>
   ``The customer reaction has been overwhelming,'' said Robert
Darmanin, a bank spokesman. But Gerri Detweiler, author of ``The
Ultimate Credit Handbook,'' warns that consumers should be ``very,
very careful'' in using such a card.
</P>
<P>
   The credit/equity card, which is currently available only to
Michigan residents, comes with certain advantages, but one very big
disadvantage: You could lose your home.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike regular bank cards or credit cards secured by savings
accounts, fail to pay your bills on this card and the bank could
foreclose on your home.
</P>
<P>
   With bank cards, if you fail to pay, the lender can cut off your
credit, employ debt collectors to seek payment, and report you to
credit bureaus, but they cannot foreclose on your home. With
secured cards, they can keep the savings you posted as collateral,
but not your home.
</P>
<P>
   Darmanin, however, says home foreclosure is not likely to be a
danger for people who are issued the credit/equity cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not offering these cards to just anyone,'' he said.
``They will be offered to people who have bought homes, have built
up equity, and have demonstrated they can handle credit
responsibily.''
</P>
<P>
   The cards' two major advantages are that the interest will
generally be tax-deductible, and the interest rates, depending on
the amount of credit, will range from prime to prime plus 3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Detweiler, formerly director of Bankcard Holders of America, a
consumer group, said the tax deductibility of the interest would be
limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, you would have to itemize deductions on your tax return
to claim the interest, and then you would need total deductions
above the standard deduction to claim any of the interest,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely would not use the card to pay for shopping or
meals or anything except perhaps a well-thought-out purchase, such
as improvement to boost the value of your home.''
</P>
<P>
   Detweiler said she had heard that some other banks were thinking
about issuing credit(backslash)equity cards, but she did not know
which banks.

 &HT;    Shopping for cars made easy on InternetBy John Ghirardini
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the most unpleasant tasks known to man is shopping for a
car. For most of us, this endeavor ranks only slightly above root
canals.
</P>
<P>
   Some studies have shown more than 60 percent of consumers
flat-out hate the car shopping and buying process. First there's
all the schlepping around to various dealers spread all over the
metro area. Then there's the compromise on a model that doesn't
have quite all the features or options you'd like. Last, there's
the negotiations with the smooth salesperson who often could make a
shark feel uncomfortable _ at least during the times your offer
isn't being ``taken to my manager.''
</P>
<P>
   Once you've signed on the dotted line, there's always the
nagging feeling you've been taken anyway.
</P>
<P>
   That's been eased some by the car dealers who maintain a
no-haggle set price, but what if you don't want a Saturn?
</P>
<P>
   Next time, let your mouse do the shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Several sites on the World Wide Web are devoted to helping
consumers with everything from negotiating a price to actually
completing the purchase.
</P>
<P>
   As the average price for new vehicles has hit $20,000 over the
last few years, the used-car market has mushroomed into a $365
billion behemoth. More than 40 million used cars changed hands last
year; new-car sales were about 15 million, according to a study
done this year by Leiberman Research Worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   AutoConnect (http://www.autoconnect.com) is one of the new breed
of ``cyber middlemen'' _ online retail portals that connect buyers
and sellers. In the case of AutoConnect, the service is free to
both.
</P>
<P>
   The site features a comprehensive and detailed database of
nearly 500,000 used vehicles, searchable by make, model, type
(truck, car or van, for instance), price, Blue Book value and
geographic proximity. When a shopper finds the '39 Nash or '92
Mercedes of his or her dreams, AutoConnect gives them several ways
to contact the dealer or private seller directly. The site also
features photos of many of the vehicles, side-by-side comparisons,
articles on insurance and maintenance, and calculators for figuring
out loan payments or comparing loan vs. lease.
</P>
<P>
   AutoConnect's primary focus is on used vehicles, but comparison
information and dealer lists are available for new-car shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   If you've got a yen for a brand-new set of wheels, here are a
couple of other sites to check out:
</P>
<P>
   AutoVantage (http://www.cuc.com/ctg/cgi-bin/AutoSavings
</P>
<P>
   /home?ref &QC; ). The site maintains information from a network of
2,300 dealers, and can steer you to the best deal for buying or
leasing in your neck of the woods.
</P>
<P>
   Auto BuySmart (http://www.autobuysmart.com/howitwrk
</P>
<P>
   .htm) is a new-car buying service that basically does all the
work and haggling for a $295 fee _ cheap compared with the price of
a car and reduction of wear and tear on your psyche.
</P>
<P>
   If you decide to fight the good fight yourself, go into the
battle forearmed. Take a look at the Beat the Car Salesman site
(http://www.beat-the.com
</P>
<P>
   /beat-the-car-salesman/), which bills itself as ``the car
salesman's worst nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   The site is actually the online companion to a book by the same
name, but contains valuable information in its own right.
</P>
<P>
   Ladies and gentlemen, start your engines.

 &HT;

 Includes color slides and black and white photos of Matt Groening. 
 By IVOR DAVIS 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Without ``The Simpsons,'' many evoted fans would indeed find the
TV world a wasteland.
 &HT;    The funniest, hippest, most irreverent series on the box is
entering its 10th season, making it the longest-running comedy
series and the longest-running animated series in TV history.
 &HT;    It's shown in over 70 countries and the top names in Hollywood
and sports, from Bette Midler to Magic Johnson, line up to do
voice-over appearances in the lives of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and
Maggie.
 &HT;    Now ``Simpsons'' creator Matt Groening (his last name rhymes
with complaining) has come up with a new animated show premiering
on Fox early in 1999 _ a science-fiction offering called
``Futurama.''
 &HT;    ``It comes from having grown up reading science fiction,''
Groening explains. ``My older brother Mark had a huge collection of
books and magazines and I loved those covers. I thought it would be
really neat to take some of the conventions of science fiction and
have fun with them in a 'Simpsons'-style way.''
 &HT;    Groening is visible in any Hollywood crowd. He's the one who
looks like a computer nerd, maybe the last man in Hollywood who
believes it's more important to tone your funny bone than your abs.
 &HT;    On this day he's wearing a down-home Western shirt buttoned up
to the neck, well-worn cowboy boots and uncool green pants.
 &HT;    While the folks in ``Futurama'' are obviously descendants of the
Simpson family, they are more than just Homer and Marge in
spacesuits, says Groening. ``The characters have big eyeballs and
overbites a la 'Simpsons.' However, it's not a 'Simpsons'
spinoff,'' he says. ``The Simpsons live in this fictional town with
the equivalent of a Dairy Queen and a Denny's. On 'Futurama' it's
the same thing but we're doing the whole universe. And so it
requires a bit more planning, which is why it took three years to
put this thing together.''
 &HT;    Groening hopes his characters will become as beloved (if that's
the word for Bart and his crew) as the Simpsons. For him they're
already like family:
 &HT;    ``The three main characters are Fry, a guy from our time who
gets frozen on New Year's Eve, 1999 and wakes up a thousand years
in the future.
 &HT;    ``Female interest is added with the lovely Leela who has one eye
in the middle of her forehead but that doesn't mean she's not a
babe.
 &HT;    ``Then there's Bender. He's our robotic Homer. He's just lovably
corrupt a la Homer. Loves his vices. I think he's the first robot
in science fiction who shoplifts.''
 &HT;    Although he deals with the likes of Fox boss Rupert Murdoch (who
will do a guest spot in the new ``Simpson'' season), Groening comes
from the manic world of comics, where he's still most comfortable.
He was virtually unknown beyond that little milieu until his ``Life
in Hell'' strip debuted in 1977. It runs in 250 newspapers world
wide.
 &HT;    The comic strip led to ``Life in Hell'' books which lead to the
Simpsons, who first appeared on Fox as part of ``The Tracey Ullman
Show,'' and jetted Groening into quite another league.
 &HT;    Despite his success, he still lives more like an artist than a
Hollywood tycoon, in a house in the upscale bohemian precincts of
the canals of Venice, Calif., with his wife Deborah and his two
small sons, Homer and Abraham.
 &HT;    ``Futurama'' takes place a thousand years from now and the way
the Simpsons are going they might still be around then. ``I don't
know how long 'The Simpsons' will run,'' Groening laughs. ``It's
surprised me that it's gone on this long. But I love the show and I
want us to go out on top. I want to go out doing great shows.''
 &HT;    Not that there's been any falling off in the Simpson's quality
over the years. ``The coming season,'' Groening insists, ``is as
good as any we've ever done or better. We've got a bunch of new
writers now who tell me they grew up watching the show. They're
creating original stories that not only don't repeat what we've
done before they also don't repeat anything I've seen on
television.''
 &HT;    He reads a synopsis of a forthcoming episode: ``Keeping a secret
proves difficult for Homer when he lands a personal-assistant job
working for Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.''
 &HT;    Does Groening worry that ``Futurama'' may pale by comparison
with ``The Simpsons''?. ``I think we'll deliver the goods,'' he
says. ``On 'Futurama' we have the luxury of looking back at the
whole history of 'The Simpsons' and picking out what worked and
trying some of that and some new stuff.''
 &HT;    He will also, he says, try for the something-for-everybody humor
that distinguishes ``The Simpsons'' from other TV comedies. ``Most
TV shows don't reward you for paying attention,'' he says. ``But on
'The Simpsons' if you really do that there's stuff hidden in the
backgrounds. I love the idea that we put in jokes the kids don't
get.''

 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Without ``The Simpsons,'' many evoted fans would indeed find the
TV world a wasteland.
 &HT;    The funniest, hippest, most irreverent series on the box is
entering its 10th season, making it the longest-running comedy
series and the longest-running animated series in TV history.
 &HT;    It's shown in over 70 countries and the top names in Hollywood
and sports, from Bette Midler to Magic Johnson, line up to do
voice-over appearances in the lives of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and
Maggie.
 &HT;    Now ``Simpsons'' creator Matt Groening (his last name rhymes
with complaining) has come up with a new animated show premiering
on Fox early in 1999 _ a science-fiction offering called
``Futurama.''
 &HT;    ``It comes from having grown up reading science fiction,''
Groening explains. ``My older brother Mark had a huge collection of
books and magazines and I loved those covers. I thought it would be
really neat to take some of the conventions of science fiction and
have fun with them in a 'Simpsons'-style way.''
 &HT;    Groening is visible in any Hollywood crowd. He's the one who
looks like a computer nerd, maybe the last man in Hollywood who
believes it's more important to tone your funny bone than your abs.
 &HT;    On this day he's wearing a down-home Western shirt buttoned up
to the neck, well-worn cowboy boots and uncool green pants.
 &HT;    While the folks in ``Futurama'' are obviously descendants of the
Simpson family, they are more than just Homer and Marge in
spacesuits, says Groening. ``The characters have big eyeballs and
overbites a la 'Simpsons.' However, it's not a 'Simpsons'
spinoff,'' he says. ``The Simpsons live in this fictional town with
the equivalent of a Dairy Queen and a Denny's. On 'Futurama' it's
the same thing but we're doing the whole universe. And so it
requires a bit more planning, which is why it took three years to
put this thing together.''
 &HT;    Groening hopes his characters will become as beloved (if that's
the word for Bart and his crew) as the Simpsons. For him they're
already like family:
 &HT;    ``The three main characters are Fry, a guy from our time who
gets frozen on New Year's Eve, 1999 and wakes up a thousand years
in the future.
 &HT;    ``Female interest is added with the lovely Leela who has one eye
in the middle of her forehead but that doesn't mean she's not a
babe.
 &HT;    ``Then there's Bender. He's our robotic Homer. He's just lovably
corrupt a la Homer. Loves his vices. I think he's the first robot
in science fiction who shoplifts.''
 &HT;    Although he deals with the likes of Fox boss Rupert Murdoch (who
will do a guest spot in the new ``Simpson'' season), Groening comes
from the manic world of comics, where he's still most comfortable.
He was virtually unknown beyond that little milieu until his ``Life
in Hell'' strip debuted in 1977. It runs in 250 newspapers world
wide.
 &HT;    The comic strip led to ``Life in Hell'' books which lead to the
Simpsons, who first appeared on Fox as part of ``The Tracey Ullman

 &HT;    Despite his success, he still lives more like an artist than a

the canals of Venice, Calif., with his wife Deborah and his two
small sons, Homer and Abraham.
 &HT;    ``Futurama'' takes place a thousand years from now and the way
the Simpsons are going they might still be around then. ``I don't
know how long 'The Simpsons' will run,'' Groening laughs. ``It's
surprised me that it's gone on this long. But I love the show and I
want us to go out on top. I want to go out doing great shows.''
 &HT;    Not that there's been any falling off in the Simpson's quality

INTERNET AWASH WITH SPECULATION ABOUT CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIN McCORMICK  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The release of the Whitewater independent
counsel's report on President Clinton has the Internet buzzing with
sordid discussions, lurid speculation and debate about the merits
of punishing a public figure for a private sexual affair.
</P>
<P>
   One Internet betting pool has offered up to $5,000 to the person
who can correctly guess the date on which President Clinton might
leave office.
</P>
<P>
   An on-line chat group encouraged users to vote on which of 27
outcomes would seal the president's future, offering choices that
included impeachment and Clinton suffering a heart attack, and thus
gaining public sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   And members of an on-line support group for people suffering
from depression frantically exchanged messages about where they
could find Kenneth Starr's report on Clinton's sexual adventures.
</P>
<P>
   As the scathing report hit the World Wide Web Friday, thousands
of Internet users responded by pouring their outrage, their
anguish, their support and, more prevalently, their cynicism onto
the information superhighway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having just read it, Clinton should resign immediately,'' one
user said in a message posted to a discussion group on current
news.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looks to me like Starr's a Rush Limbaugh type, who thinks the
prez is a naturally evil person who can be brought down with
unsubstantial allegations,'' another Internet user wrote to a stock
investors newsgroup.
</P>
<P>
   And then there were the smart alecks, who seemed to outnumber
those with serious comments 10-1.
</P>
<P>
   One member of a discussion group suggested Clinton try to
portray his sexual promiscuity as an illness that might fall under
the Americans with Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can NOT impeach Clinton. It's very simple,'' the pundit
wrote in a newsgroup on politics. ``Clinton clearly has a sexual
addiction. That is a psychological disorder, and therefore a
disability. ... And you can not fire someone for having a
disability.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the Web serve as an ultrafast method of conveying
information about the Clinton scandal, said Internet journalist
David Weir, it also offered users a chance to vent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is a place where people feel they can talk,''
said Weir, managing editor of the on-line magazine Salon. ``It's a
way for people to process their emotional response to big stories.
We saw that when Princess Diana died, as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet also abounds with chances to bet on Clinton's
future, although White House advisers have said Clinton would never
resign because of the Monica Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Judgement Day Betting Pool'' invites bets of $10 on which
day will be the president's last day in office and get a chance to
win up to $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Directions for the Internet pool, sponsored by a group called
the New Irish Sweepstakes, explained that, if Clinton ``gets off
scot-free'' and remains in office, his entire term, anyone who
picked the date Jan. 20, 2001, would win $27.
</P>
<P>
   If he left office earlier, winners would get more.
</P>
<P>
   Another Web pool _ Clinton's Last Day Contest _ costs nothing
and offers a plaque for the winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Mr. Clinton stays till the normal end, all the names that
predicted (this) will be put in a dark blue beret and one name will
be chosen (to) get the plaque,'' the site's instructions say.
</P>
<P>
   One political newsgroup asked readers to pick one of 27
scenarios for how Clinton's term will end. These ranged from
impeachment, to Clinton suffering no repercussions whatsoever, to
bizarre possibilities like diversionary attacks on foreign nations.
</P>
<P>
   Choice No. 26 posed a scenario in which news anchor Katie Couric
interviews Chelsea Clinton on the ``Today Show,'' makes Chelsea cry
on camera and then the ``public sympathy saves Clinton.''

STUDIES INDICATE CLINTON'S VIEWS ON SEX FAR FROM UNIQUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CRAIG MARINE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As the nation reacts to the Whitewater
independent counsel's excruciating details of the president's
16-month sexual affair, it appears that Bill Clinton's definition
of sex is more widely held than Americans might think.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony before a federal grand jury, the president
``maintained that there can be no sexual relationship without
sexual intercourse, regardless of what other sexual activities may
transpire. (Clinton) stated that `most ordinary Americans' would
embrace this distinction.''
</P>
<P>
   While that may strike some people as absurd, two surveys at
least partially bear him out. Dr. Stephanie Sanders, associate
director of the renowned Kinsey Institute in Indiana, cited some
relevant information.
</P>
<P>
   ``We conducted a survey in 1991 that specifically asked that
question, whether people would say they had `had sex' with someone
if the most intimate behavior was oral-genital contact. Sixty
percent of the people answered `no.'''
</P>
<P>
   A survey of college students conducted by Playboy magazine and
published in its October 1996 issue showed that 54 percent of the
women responding did not view oral sex as ``real'' sex, although 52
percent of men did.
</P>
<P>
   Determining where the sexual relationship between Clinton and
Monica Lewinsky falls in relation to the sexual practices of most
Americans is tricky.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Social Organization of Sexuality: Sexual Practices in the
United States,'' a landmark study released in 1994 by researchers
from the University of Chicago and State University of New York at
Stony Brook, found that white educated people who identify
themselves as liberals are the most likely to masturbate and have
oral sex.
</P>
<P>
   As to what was ``appealing,'' heterosexuals overwhelmingly
preferred intercourse. Watching a partner undress was a distant
second, followed by oral sex.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who are married, 75 percent of men said they had
been faithful to their spouses.
</P>
<P>
   Of those in short-term relationships, 29 percent of men and 23
percent of women report fellatio usually or always.
</P>
<P>
   Vibrators were used by 2 percent of both men and women, while
``other sex toys'' were used by 1 percent of men and 2 percent of
women.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, it is the ``other sex toy'' that is likely to ruffle
the most feathers. Yet Dr. Bernie Zilbergeld, an Oakland-based sex
therapist and author of ``The New Male Sexuality,'' has a different
take on Clinton's use of his cigar as a sex prop, as reported in
the independent counsel's report.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that was an incredibly loving and sensitive thing to
do,'' Zilbergeld said. ``He was showing her he cared about her and
valued her essence. I didn't know he had it in him.''
</P>
<P>
   Zilbergeld said he knew his opinion may be in the minority.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (San Francisco) Bay area has always been at the forefront
of sexual liberalism,'' he said. ``This is a long way from Kansas
or Arkansas. A lot of people, if they don't engage in a particular
practice themselves, react to it with outrage. At the same time,
they are excited by the details. They may have been on the computer
in their barn saying, `Oh my God, isn't that horrible? Scroll
faster!'''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Louanne Cole Weston, a therapist, concurs _ to a degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still a lot of people out there whose idea of sex
involves a little kissing, maybe some fondling, the man gets on top
and it's over when he's done,'' she said. ``These people are going
to be genuinely shocked by the oral sex aspects of the
relationship, let alone the cigar.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it is also true that people engage in all sorts of sexual
behaviors everywhere in this country. I know sex therapists in Des
Moines who have people lined up around the block, who are doing
everything imaginable,'' Weston said. ``The difference is in the
community standards, the freedom people have to speak openly about
their behavior without being ostracized.''

In any case, nature provided 11 fingers, perhaps because it would
take more than two hands to count all the region's charms.
</P>
<P>
   The supply of wineries to visit, inns to settle down in and
historic Main Streets to stroll in the Finger Lakes seems
inexhaustible _ especially in the fall foliage season. So an autumn
tour of the region requires some choices.
</P>
<P>
   One suggestion: stick to the biggest lakes, Seneca and Cayuga,
which are in the middle and are each about 35 miles long. Views
from either side of these, with little sightseeing boats passing
between sharply rising hillsides, conjure up a miniature Lake
Geneva (or, in the case of 632-foot-deep Seneca, Loch Ness).
</P>
<P>
   Along 19th-century streets in towns like Geneva, Corning,
Hammondsport and Skaneateles, old brick storefronts have lost some
of their right angles. But they wear their years with dignity and
an honesty typical of a region where farm stands work on the honor
system.
</P>
<P>
   Foliage season is usually mid-September to mid-October. For
updates, call Finger Lakes National Forest at (607) 546-4470. The
region is about six hours from New York City via the Thruway to
Exit 16, and Route 17.

   Through Nov. 1, ``Warp and Weft,'' Navajo weaving from the 1870s
to the 1970s, will be at the Rockwell Museum, 111 Cedar St.,
</P>
<P>
   Corning. The 1893 red-brick Romanesque Revival building has a
large permanent collection of Western art, including Remington and
Bierstadt, and more than 2,000 pieces of art glass by Frederick
Carder, a founder of Steuben Glass. Open Monday to Saturday 9 a.m.
to 5 p.m., Sunday noon to 5 p.m. Admission: $5, seniors $4.50, ages
6 to 17 $2.50; (607) 937-5386.

<P>
   Samuel Langhorne Clemens spent summers in Elmira and is buried
there in Woodlawn Cemetery. What would Mark Twain have thought
about a popular Elmira activity: flying without a motor?
</P>
<P>
   The surrounding flat lands are blessed with thermals ideal for
gliders. Sept. 19 is Community Soaring Day and Kite-Citement at the
Harris Hill Gliderport, off Route 17. Glider rides are $30 (free
for disabled children), or learn kite-making; (607) 734-3128.
</P>
<P>
   This one is a real no-brainer: the Great Canandaigua Scarecrow
Contest. About 75 locally made straw persons compete to see which
can scare the most birds off Main Street in Canandaigua, from Sept.
26 through Oct. 10. Free; (716) 396-0300.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The sun-washed hillsides of the Finger Lakes were discovered by
winemakers in the mid-1800s. Now, there are dozens of vintners
along the major lakes, which provide a tempering effect on the cold
climate. Whites and sparkling wines are the region's forte.
</P>
<P>
   Route 14 on Seneca's western shore is lined with wineries, but
off the main road, Castel Grisch on Route 28 above Watkins Glen,
offers a less-trafficked view of the lake amid Rhineland trappings.
Open daily 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; (607) 535-9614.
</P>
<P>
   On Seneca's east shore, Wagner Winery, Route 414 in Lodi, has
beer tastings, too. Open 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily, (607) 582-6450.
</P>
<P>
   For wine-tour maps, contact the Seneca Lake Winery Association,
(315) 536-9996; the Cayuga Wine Trail, (800) 684-5217, or the Keuka
Lake Wine Route, (800) 440-4898.
</P>
<P>
   The views of the cascades in Watkins Glen State Park are
literally breathtaking, if you start the 1.5-mile trail from the
bottom, on Franklin Street in Watkins Glen.
</P>
<P>
   As you ascend the 832 steps to the top of the 650-foot glen, you
pass along, over and under 18 waterfalls (runoff from the rocky
walls can leave the trail slick). Park on village streets and walk
in free. A shuttle ($2.50) lets you start at the top; (607)
535-4511.
</P>
<P>
   Less splashy are the falls in Fillmore Glen State Park _ named
after a not-so-splashy President, Millard Fillmore. A reproduction
of the tiny rudimentary cabin in which he was born in 1800, five
miles away, is off the parking lot ($4 a car). The 1.8-mile trail
through the surrounding woods should afford some great leaf
watching. Open dawn to dusk on Route 38 in Moravia; (315) 497-0130
</P>
<P>
   Among the floating excursions for leaf fanciers are Captain
Bill's Seneca Lake Cruises, aboard the Stroller IV, a jaunty boat
from the 1930's decked out in Philippine mahogany.
</P>
<P>
   In foliage season, 50-minute tours depart every other hour
starting at 11 a.m. Fare: $7.50, ages 2 to 12, $3.50. Boats leave
from the foot of Franklin Street in Watkins Glen; (607) 535-4541.
</P>
<P>
   The modest-sized Sciencenter, 601 First St., just off Route 13
north of Ithaca, is full of hands-on displays that will teach and
entertain young children. Your little Indiana Jones can dig for
real fossils. Open Tuesday to Saturday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Sunday
noon to 5. Admission: $4.50, ages 4 to 12 $3.50; (607) 272-0600.
</P>
<P>
   Don't let memories of all those duplicate housewarming gifts
keep you from the Corning Museum of Glass and Glass Center, 151
Centerway, Corning, (607) 974-8271. A head of Amenhotep II of
Egypt, made between 1436 and 1411 B.C., is the earliest known glass
portrait, and a cut-glass table from 1878 weighs more than half a
ton. There's not a casserole in sight until you reach the gift
shop. Open daily 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission: $6, seniors $5, ages 6
to 17 $4.
</P>
<P>
   The Farm Sanctuary, eight miles west of Watkins Glen, off Route
23, is a 175-acre refuge for abused livestock. It's filled with
cows, chickens and pigs. Admission is free; guided tours on
weekends in September and October cost $2, ages 4 to 12, $1; (607)
583-2225.
 &UR; WHERE TO STAY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Radisson, 125 Denison Parkway East, Corning, (607) 962-5000,
fax (607) 962-4166, looks like a concrete bunker plopped at the
foot of graceful Market Street. But the 177-room hotel, with an
indoor pool, is a stroll from the Corning and Rockwell museums.
Rooms are comfortable and contemporary, with about half redone last
winter in dark-green tones. Rates from $139.
</P>
<P>
   True to its name, the Ramada Geneva Lakefront, 41 Lakefront
Drive, Geneva, (800) 990-0907, fax (315) 789-4351, is on the
northern tip of Seneca Lake. Its 148 rooms are most notable for the
views (91 face the water). There's an indoor pool. Rates: $109 to
$139 till Oct. 1, $89 to $109 after.
</P>
<P>
   Budget: For a traditional roadside motor lodge, try the
Longhouse Lodge Motel, Route 14 at Abrams Road, Watkins Glen,
telephone and fax (607) 535-2565. The 25 rooms were redone last
summer, and 21 have rockers outside the doors to enjoy the hillside
Seneca Lake view, while 4 are higher up the hill in a separate
house. A VCR, with movies, rents for $5. Rates: $68 to $88, with
Continental breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Similar is the Best Western Marshall Manor, Route 14,
Horseheads, telephone and fax (607) 739-3891, conveniently situated
between Seneca Lake and Elmira. Families can make fast getaways in
the morning since the 40 clean, simple rooms have sinks inside and
outside the bathrooms. Rates: $63 to Oct. 10, $52 after, with
Continental breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Luxury: Geneva on the Lake, 1001 Lochland Road (Route 14),
Geneva, (800) 343-6382, fax (315) 789-0322, is modeled after an
Italian Renaissance villa, with 26 rooms and 4 more in a
contemporary town house. A parterre garden leads to the lakeside
pool.
</P>
<P>
   The Library Suite, decorated with Stickley furniture, has a
coffered ceiling and fireplace, and the shelves lining the walls
contain books from the collection of the estate's original owners.
Rates: $133 to $525, with Continental breakfast, bottle of wine and
fruit basket.
</P>
<P>
   A soft-pink wedding cake of a house built in 1851 is now the
Rose Inn, 813 Auburn Road (Route 34), Ithaca; (607) 533-7905, fax
(607) 533-7908. A spiral staircase of Honduran mahogany coils
majestically up to a cupola.
</P>
<P>
   Among the main house's 15 rooms, decorated with period
furniture, are four suites with whirlpool baths. The grounds
include a pretty little formal garden. Rates: $100 to $275, with
full breakfast.
 &UR; WHERE TO EAT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cafe Alfresca, 45 Shethar St., in Hammondsport, at the southern
end of Keuka Lake, overlooks the village green and its gingerbread
bandstand, an ideal place to enjoy one of the delicious warm panini
sandwiches, soups, salads or thin pizzas _ all $4 to $4.95. If
there is an autumn chill, move inside to a rocking chair and sip a
giant cappuccino ($3.25).
</P>
<P>
   Works by local artists adorn the walls, and there's live music
Saturday nights (open 7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. other days). A meal for
two with drinks: $20; (607) 569-2009.
</P>
<P>
   Framboise, 9 East Genesee St., is an airy storefront with tall
windows looking out onto the center of Skaneateles, southwest of
Syracuse. Dried and fresh flower arrangements adorn the tables in
the two dining areas.
</P>
<P>
   Appetizers include spring rolls in orange-cranberry sauce with a
pile of steamed julienned vegetables; cioppino, a fish stew made
with tomatoes; or chicken Maasdam _ a breast stuffed with
asparagus, roasted peppers and cream cheese and wrapped in puff
pastry _ are among the entrees. Three-course dinner for two with
wine: about $65; (315) 685-7196.
</P>
<P>
   Tables in the publike London Underground, 69 East Market St.,
Corning, are amply spaced. Get past the endless menu descriptions _
``local ostrich sirloin with stone-ground mustard glaze and Vidalia
onion compote,'' for example, followed by ``basil-infused chicken
breast with sauce fines herbes, bowtie pasta and a trio of sauteed
peppers'' _ and the food speaks for itself. Dinner for two with
wine: $75; (607) 962-2345.
</P>
<P>
   The Sherwood Inn, a stately historic inn at 26 West Genesee St.,
Skaneateles, has a formal dining room and a tavern; in the latter,
the Fruit Fantasia ($8.95) is a generous pile of fresh fruit,
chicken or tuna salad, date-nut bread and sherbet; in the dining
room, the accent is on standards like steak and prime rib, with
dinner for two with wine about $90; (315) 685-3405.
</P>
<P>
   While dining in the rear sun room of the Thendara Inn and
Restaurant, 4356 East Lake Road (Route 364), Canandaigua, we saw
one couple wed beside the lake, while a few tables away, another
toasted their 50th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   Among the appetizers is brie en croute with portobello
mushrooms; for main courses, there's herb-encrusted swordfish with
ginger lemongrass sauce or marinated grilled chicken breast with
gazpacho salsa. Addlepated service was a discordant note. Dinner
for two with wine: $90 to $100. Closed Monday and Tuesday after
Oct.1. Reservations recommended; (716) 394-4868.

 &HT;    The Internet is finally a viable tool for enthusiasts who like
to plan their own travel. Many Web-based services are now capable
of accepting credit cards for purchases, and the proliferation of
faster modems has meant that glacial waits for downloads are now
largely a thing of the past.
 &HT;    Here are some of the better sites around for those who want to
get somewhere fast.
 &HT;    ----
 &HT;    There's been a proliferation of Web-based travel agencies, many
of which are now routinely used by business travelers. But leisure
travelers who are savvy enough can use them to their own advantage
and sidestep airline reservationists and conventional travel
agents.
 &HT;    Virtually all of them have some sort of fare-finder that enables
the traveler to enter flights and come up with fare and carrier
options in short order. In addition to airfare, the following sites
allow the traveler to book a car rental and a hotel as well.
 &HT;    Start with BizTravel.com (www.biztravel.com), which has become a
favorite of business travelers. It allows user to create very
detailed traveling profiles of themselves and manage their
frequent-flier programs. It has a good, fast fare-finder and has a
wide-ranging data base of hotels and car-rental agencies as well.
 &HT;    Microsoft Expedia (www.expedia.com) is one of the best-known
on-line travel agencies around, with a good fare finder and a
pretty sophisticated search engine that allows users to look for
the best-priced flights and scroll through scheduled flights
easily.
 &HT;    Flifo (www.flifo.com) makes it easy to set up a detailed
itinerary. The fare-finder is speedy and the free ticket delivery
is a bonus.
 &HT;    Preview Travel (www.previewtravel.com), the preferred travel
service for America On-Line (AOL) members, is also one of the best
and the fastest for leisure travelers. Users have access to a
responsive fare-finder that ranks flights not only by price but
also provides aircraft model and up-to-the-minute availability of
seats in all classes.
 &HT;    The Trip.com (www.thetrip.com) is an all-purpose travel site
that allows users to not only book flights but to track them as
well. Waiting for someone to arrive at the local airport? This site
gives real-time locations of flights enroute, something no airline
toll-free number can do.
 &HT;    Travelocity (www.travelocity.com) was one of the first on-line
travel agencies and is linked to SABRE, one of the systems used by
professional travel agents. But it's easier to use than its parent
and is quite good at finding low fares.
 &HT;    There's also 1travel.com (1travel.com), which has a somewhat
less sophisticated fare-finder than the others and still requires a
phone call to complete a transaction. What makes this site
noteworthy is that it provides consolidator flights, a boon for
anyone looking for discounted airfares to Europe and Asia.
 &HT;    For hotels alone, two discount hotel brokers who can help
travelers ease the sting of big-city hotel prices are Hotel
Reservations Network (www.180096hotel.com) and Quikbook
(www.quikbook.com).
 &HT;    Some of the airline's own Web sites are useful for rooting out
deals. The leading site must be American Airlines' (www.aa.com),
which began offering Net SAAver fares a couple of years ago. These
are last-minute, round-trip deals that are posted every week to
subscribers via e-mail. International deals are listed on Mondays,
domestic deals on Wednesdays. The e-mail subscription is free.
 &HT;    This site is a clearinghouse for unsold tickets, most of which
originate at the airline's hub cities of Chicago, Dallas and Miami.
These deals are good for long weekend travel from either Thursday
to Monday or Friday to Monday or Tuesday.
 &HT;    American also offers discounted first-class fares every week and
usually has additional short-lived deals from American Airlines
Vacations.
 &HT;    Other airline sites worth a look are U.S. Airways
(www.airways.com) and Continental (www.flycontinental.com) for
weekly e-mail specials.
 &HT;    Both TWA (www.twa.com) and Cathay Pacific
(www.cathaypacific(TILDE)air.com) send them out periodically. The
latter, of course, still has what is probably the greatest airfare
deal of the year, an $899 Asia Pass that includes round-trip
airfare from New York to Hong Kong and unlimited travel to the 18
cities that Cathay serves within a 30-day period, including Bali
(Indonesia), Bangkok (Thailand) and Seoul (Korea).
 &HT;    For anyone who's contemplating mountain biking in the Lake
Geneva region of Switzerland or hiking in the Rockies, there's
GORP, the Great Outdoors Recreation Pages (www.gorp.com), with
traveler's tales about biking, hiking and fishing and listings of
dozens of adventure-travel companies.
 &HT;    Thinking about going around the world? High Adventure Travel
(www.highadv.com) offers dozens of sample itineraries and allows
users to plan their own world jaunt on-line.
 &HT;    Council Travel (www.ciee.org) and Air Brokers International
(www.airbrokers.com) are also good sources for would-be
round-the-world travelers _ or for anyone who'd like to dream about
such a trip.

 &HT;    
 By GENE AND ADELE MALOTT 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    What could possibly be more romantic than an island cruise on
board a Greek caique?
 &HT;    Beverly Shaver of El Cerrito, Calif., and her 32 fellow
Elderhostelers visualized that the tiny vessel scheduled to take
them around the Aegean to explore the fabled Cyclades Islands would
be a combination of the Bounty (as in Mutiny) and a Sultan's
barque. Even the ship's name _ the Zeus III _ conjured idyllic
images.
 &HT;    ``Of course the reality, when we first glimpsed her bobbing at
the Pireaus mooring, resembled neither Bounty nor barque,'' Shaver
says. ``One-hundred-sixteen feet long, she was a chunky blend of
Manhattan Island ferry and tugboat-with-mast painted red and
white.''
 &HT;    From Piraeus, the port for Athens, the Zeus set a course due
east, sailing on a serene sea _ no seasick stomachs here. Forty
nautical miles and four hours out, it glided into snug St. Nicholas
Bay on the tranquil little island of Kea.
 AN UNTAINTED WORLD  
 &HT;    Modern Kea is a typical Cycladic village with small sugarcube
houses lining narrow, winding, stone-paved streets. Here one can
find the unspoiled little Grecian paradise always promised in
brochures, Shaver says, and which is so seldom delivered. Here, as
on almost all the Cyclades, are 2,000-year-old ruins and sparkling
beaches for snorkeling and swimming.
 &HT;    The passengers' first dinner aboard the Zeus consisted of
chicken broth thickened with rice and eggs, prawns with rice,
artichokes and broad beans in oil with dill and lemon. The feast
was topped off with honey-and-nut cake with custard filling.
 &HT;    These Elderhostelers were now pretend-patrons of the Zeus'
gourmet restaurant. A deckhand named Demos, who only hours earlier
was seen wearing greasy overalls and cursing a jammed winch, was
transformed into a dignified, cummerbunded waiter. Passengers and
crew would treat one another with the formal politeness due their
respective, changeable roles.
 &HT;    Captain Voul-garikis urged everyone to try Retsina, the famed
liqueur. But of course, they agreed, eager to have the whole
glorious Greek experience.
 &HT;    Retsina, Shaver found, was clearly an acquired taste.
``Retsina,'' said the group wag, ``tastes like pure turpentine
that's been strained through a fisherman's sock.''
 &HT;    A pattern was quickly established. Zeus passengers were hooked
on listening to lectures, reading Greek novels and exploring the
wonders of the island. Watching the sun set became a ritual, and
dogged efforts were made to master Greek dancing.
 THE SALON CLASSROOM  
 &HT;    In the mornings, the salon became a classroom where
anthropologist Akis Papataxiarchis held forth for several hours
each day before reaching the next port.
 &HT;    Staying almost always in sight of land, the Zeus scudded from
island to island _ places such as Tinos, Delos, Ios, Mykonos,
Naxos, Paros, Thira.
 &HT;    Sleeping in ports through the nights, Elderhostelers saw the
darkness studded with flickering lanterns as fishermen speared
octopus and squid off the rocks. They wakened each morning to the
cries of gulls, the clop of mules on quayside planks and the sound
of limp octopuses being slapped against wharf pilings by young
Greek boys working to tenderize the meat, Shaver says.
 &HT;    Delos, one of the smallest of the Cyclades, was the most famous
of all in ancient times. Legendary birthplace of Apollo, it
attracted hordes of pilgrims bearing gifts and became the treasury
for the Delian League.
 &HT;    Now Delos stands deserted and uninhabited, strewn with the
bleached bones of ruined temples, mansions, baths and splendid
mosaics _ all guarded by the celebrated lean and hungry stone
lionesses.
 &HT;    On picturesque Mykonos prices in the bustling boutiques are
unsettling _ about 30 percent higher than in less touristed Naxos
and Tinos.
 &HT;    There are 365 churches on Mykonos, a church for every 10 people.
It is said that sailors swore to build a chapel to their patron
saints if the men survived the perilous storms at sea and were
delivered home safely. The churches stand as the survivors'
promises fulfilled.
 &HT;    The most spectacular stop, Shaver remembers, was Santorini, now
called Thira. The Zeus sailed close to the huge, black, forbidding
caldera of an exploded volcano. Sometime in the Bronze Age the
volcano erupted, wiping out the flourishing Minoan culture of Crete
and burying the ancient Thira under tons of debris.
 &HT;    The modern town of Thira is 900 feet straight up above the
little dock where tenders deposited visitors. A few intrepid
tourists tried to ascend in the old, traditional way _ by mule. But
most, upon taking a look at the bony, weak-looking mules, opted to
take the gleaming steel funicular that carries visitors painlessly
up the cliff.
 THE VOYAGE HOME  
 &HT;    On the last night, the Zeus glided back toward the mainland and
anchored at Kea, much like the ancient galleons had done _ and for
the same reason: The winds were gusting dangerously.
 &HT;    Shaver fondly recalls that final night on board the Zeus, as
voices grew loud and heavily sentimental: ``Akis stretched out and
and held forth about the hunger in the Greek soul, the terrible
angst that is part of the Greek heritage.
 &HT;    ``And our most verbal Elderhosteler responded by waxing eloquent
about the indelible impact of standing in Cycladic fields strewn
with columbine and anemones, pondering the stories the stones could
tell, feeling the breeze stirring the embers of past
civilizations.''
 &HT;    The study cruise described was packaged for Elderhostel by
International Study Tours Inc., one of many overseas learning
programs offered year-round through Elderhostel. For more
information, contact Elderhostel, 75 Federal St., Boston, Mass.

 By GENE AND ADELE MALOTT 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    What could possibly be more romantic than an island cruise on
board a Greek caique?
 &HT;    Beverly Shaver of El Cerrito, Calif., and her 32 fellow
Elderhostelers visualized that the tiny vessel scheduled to take
them around the Aegean to explore the fabled Cyclades Islands would
be a combination of the Bounty (as in Mutiny) and a Sultan's
barque. Even the ship's name _ the Zeus III _ conjured idyllic
images.
 &HT;    ``Of course the reality, when we first glimpsed her bobbing at
the Pireaus mooring, resembled neither Bounty nor barque,'' Shaver
says. ``One-hundred-sixteen feet long, she was a chunky blend of
Manhattan Island ferry and tugboat-with-mast painted red and
white.''
 &HT;    From Piraeus, the port for Athens, the Zeus set a course due
east, sailing on a serene sea _ no seasick stomachs here. Forty
nautical miles and four hours out, it glided into snug St. Nicholas
Bay on the tranquil little island of Kea.
 AN UNTAINTED WORLD  
 &HT;    Modern Kea is a typical Cycladic village with small sugarcube
houses lining narrow, winding, stone-paved streets. Here one can
find the unspoiled little Grecian paradise always promised in
brochures, Shaver says, and which is so seldom delivered. Here, as
on almost all the Cyclades, are 2,000-year-old ruins and sparkling
beaches for snorkeling and swimming.
 &HT;    The passengers' first dinner aboard the Zeus consisted of
chicken broth thickened with rice and eggs, prawns with rice,
artichokes and broad beans in oil with dill and lemon. The feast
was topped off with honey-and-nut cake with custard filling.
 &HT;    These Elderhostelers were now pretend-patrons of the Zeus'
gourmet restaurant. A deckhand named Demos, who only hours earlier
was seen wearing greasy overalls and cursing a jammed winch, was
transformed into a dignified, cummerbunded waiter. Passengers and
crew would treat one another with the formal politeness due their
respective, changeable roles.
 &HT;    Captain Voul-garikis urged everyone to try Retsina, the famed
liqueur. But of course, they agreed, eager to have the whole
glorious Greek experience.
 &HT;    Retsina, Shaver found, was clearly an acquired taste.
``Retsina,'' said the group wag, ``tastes like pure turpentine
that's been strained through a fisherman's sock.''
 &HT;    A pattern was quickly established. Zeus passengers were hooked
on listening to lectures, reading Greek novels and exploring the
wonders of the island. Watching the sun set became a ritual, and
dogged efforts were made to master Greek dancing.
 THE SALON CLASSROOM  
 &HT;    In the mornings, the salon became a classroom where
anthropologist Akis Papataxiarchis held forth for several hours
each day before reaching the next port.
 &HT;    Staying almost always in sight of land, the Zeus scudded from
island to island _ places such as Tinos, Delos, Ios, Mykonos,
Naxos, Paros, Thira.
 &HT;    Sleeping in ports through the nights, Elderhostelers saw the
darkness studded with flickering lanterns as fishermen speared
octopus and squid off the rocks. They wakened each morning to the
cries of gulls, the clop of mules on quayside planks and the sound
of limp octopuses being slapped against wharf pilings by young
Greek boys working to tenderize the meat, Shaver says.
 &HT;    Delos, one of the smallest of the Cyclades, was the most famous
of all in ancient times. Legendary birthplace of Apollo, it
attracted hordes of pilgrims bearing gifts and became the treasury
for the Delian League.
 &HT;    Now Delos stands deserted and uninhabited, strewn with the
bleached bones of ruined temples, mansions, baths and splendid
mosaics _ all guarded by the celebrated lean and hungry stone
lionesses.
 &HT;    On picturesque Mykonos prices in the bustling boutiques are
unsettling _ about 30 percent higher than in less touristed Naxos
and Tinos.
 &HT;    There are 365 churches on Mykonos, a church for every 10 people.
It is said that sailors swore to build a chapel to their patron
saints if the men survived the perilous storms at sea and were
delivered home safely. The churches stand as the survivors'
promises fulfilled.
 &HT;    The most spectacular stop, Shaver remembers, was Santorini, now
called Thira. The Zeus sailed close to the huge, black, forbidding
caldera of an exploded volcano. Sometime in the Bronze Age the
volcano erupted, wiping out the flourishing Minoan culture of Crete
and burying the ancient Thira under tons of debris.
 &HT;    The modern town of Thira is 900 feet straight up above the
little dock where tenders deposited visitors. A few intrepid
tourists tried to ascend in the old, traditional way _ by mule. But
most, upon taking a look at the bony, weak-looking mules, opted to
take the gleaming steel funicular that carries visitors painlessly
up the cliff.
 THE VOYAGE HOME  
 &HT;    On the last night, the Zeus glided back toward the mainland and
anchored at Kea, much like the ancient galleons had done _ and for
the same reason: The winds were gusting dangerously.
 &HT;    Shaver fondly recalls that final night on board the Zeus, as
voices grew loud and heavily sentimental: ``Akis stretched out and
and held forth about the hunger in the Greek soul, the terrible
angst that is part of the Greek heritage.
 &HT;    ``And our most verbal Elderhosteler responded by waxing eloquent
about the indelible impact of standing in Cycladic fields strewn
with columbine and anemones, pondering the stories the stones could
tell, feeling the breeze stirring the embers of past
civilizations.''
 &HT;    The study cruise described was packaged for Elderhostel by
International Study Tours Inc., one of many overseas learning
programs offered year-round through Elderhostel. For more

GEORGE WALLACE, 79; LED OPPOSITION TO SEGREGATION
</HEADLINE>
  By TOM BENNETT 
 c. 1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   George Wallace, the four-term governor of Alabama who dominated
its politics for a quarter-century and waged a historic third-party
presidential campaign in 1968, died of respiratory and cardiac
arrest Sunday night at Jackson Hospital in Montgomery. He was 79
and lived in Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace was a Southern populist and opportunist. When millions
still despised or admired him for his 1963 segregationist stand at
the University of Alabama, he had long since discarded that
political stance, and moved on.
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama, where he was a folk hero, a generation grew up
having known only brief periods when the governor's mansion was not
occupied by a Wallace _ George or his first wife Lurleen. He was
governor in 1963-67, 1971-79 and 1983-87. She served a partial term
as governor in 1967-68 when by law he could not succeed himself.
</P>
<P>
   Early in his political career, in the 1940s, Wallace was labeled
liberal when he backed Gov. James E. ``Big Jim'' Folsom, who sought
more opportunities for blacks a decade before the civil rights
movement. But Folsom's popularity dimmed after the U.S. Supreme
Court outlawed school segregation, and Wallace dropped him cold.
Wallace went on to win the governorship in 1962 and declare in his
1963 inaugural address, ``Segregation now! Segregation tomorrow!
Segregation forever!''
</P>
<P>
   He reversed again to espouse moderate views in 1974, then came
full circle in 1982, winning the governorship for the fourth and
last time with 90 percent of the black vote and declaring
segregation to be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Age and lingering pain from a 1972 assassination attempt kept
Wallace from seeking a fifth term as governor in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   George Corley Wallace Jr. was born Aug. 25, 1919, in the Barbour
County town of Clio in the black belt of southeast Alabama. He was
the oldest son of George C. ``Sag'' Wallace Sr., a farmer, and
Mozelle Smith Wallace. Barbour County has the nickname ``Home of
Governors,'' having produced seven.
</P>
<P>
   The young Wallace was a state Senate page at 16. At the
University of Alabama, he was freshman class president and two-time
state bantamweight boxing champion. To make ends meet, he worked at
various times as a busboy, taxi driver, dogcatcher and magazine
salesman, and received a law degree in 1942.
</P>
<P>
   He enlisted in the Army Air Force, but washed out of pilot
school after contracting spinal meningitis. On furlough, he married
Lurleen Burns, a clerk at the Kresge's store in Tuscaloosa. While
in flight engineer school, they lived in a converted chicken house
in Alamagordo, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   Stationed in the Mariana Islands, Wallace plotted a political
career. From that far western Pacific outpost, he wrote letters to
Alabama Gov. Chauncey Sparks, and sent Christmas cards to surprised
Barbour County voters.
</P>
<P>
   Aboard a B-29 superfortress, Wallace flew 19 bombing missions
over Japan. He was discharged from the Air Corps in 1945 with a 10
percent disability related to a nervous condition resulting from
combat fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   Stateside, he hitchhiked to Montgomery to see Sparks, and got a
job as an assistant attorney general. Wallace ran for and won a
seat in the state Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   As an alternate delegate to the 1948 Democratic Convention,
Wallace, then in his first liberal period, did not join the
Dixiecrat walkout protesting a civil rights plank in the platform.
</P>
<P>
   He was reelected to the statehouse in 1950, but later quit,
complaining that he was not allowed to play a strong enough role in
guiding the legislative program. In 1952, he was elected a judge of
the Third Judicial District serving Barbour, Dale and Bullock
counties.
</P>
<P>
   In 1954, Wallace, still a judge, was his mentor Jim Folsom's
south Alabama campaign manager. But with that year's decision by
the U.S. Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education, all other
matters shrunk in importance, and race became the only political
issue in the South. Folsom as governor invited Harlem attorney Adam
Clayton Powell to the governor's mansion for a drink. Wallace and
others deserted Folsom.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace entered the 1958 gubernatorial race along with Folsom,
state Attorney General John Patterson and 11 others. Borrowing from
a boyhood hero, Gov. Bibb Graves, who had styled himself ``The
Little Colonel,'' Wallace called himself ``The Little Judge'' and
still later improved it to ``The Fighting Little Judge.''
</P>
<P>
   All 13 candidates were segregationists, but Patterson gained an
edge as the most irreconcilable of all. He led Wallace in the
primary, 196,859 to 162,435. A run-off followed, and Wallace
labeled Patterson the Ku Klux Klan candidate. Wallace's gambit
failed: Patterson crushed him, 315,353 to 250,451, and went on win
general election.
</P>
<P>
   In a dubious hallmark of Alabama history, Wallace said in his
election postmortem: ``Patterson out-niggered me, and, boys, I'm
not going to be out-niggered again.''
</P>
<P>
   In January 1959, events played into Wallace's hands. The U.S.
Civil Rights Commission demanded to see voting records of his
judicial district, and he refused to release them.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Frank M. Johnson Jr., Wallace's former law
school classmate, ordered Wallace to release the voting records.
Wallace refused and was cited for contempt. When he said he would
turn over the records only to a grand jury, Johnson cited him for
criminal contempt. Wallace made a secret night visit to Johnson's
Montgomery home, entering through the back door, and attempted to
negotiate, but Johnson refused.
</P>
<P>
   In court, Wallace's lawyers pled him guilty. Johnson upstaged
them, ruling that Wallace had complied and turned over voter
records, and acquitted him. Their one-upmanship continued as
Wallace now insisted he was guilty, and stumped the state calling
Johnson a liar.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace entered the 1962 governor's race pledging to stand in
the schoolhouse door before permitting integration. He out-polled
state Sen. Ryan De Graffenreid in the primary, 207,062 to 160,704,
and in a run-off won, 340,730 to 269,122. He swamped independent
Frank P. Walls in the general election by a 50-1 margin.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-OBIT-WALLACE-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; (UNDATED: 50-1 margin.) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At his swearing-in, Wallace stood on a star on the Capitol steps
marking the spot where Jefferson Davis had been sworn in as
Confederate president. One of the most infamous declarations in
Southern demagoguery followed. Wallace said: ``In the name of the
greatest people that have ever trod this earth, I draw the line in
the dust and toss the gauntlet before the feet of tyranny and I
say, Segregation now! Segregation tomorrow! Segregation forever!''
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge ordered the University of Alabama to admit
blacks Jimmy Hood and Vivian Malone. Earlier, there had been
violence at the University of Mississippi when James Meredith
enrolled. U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy came to
Montgomery hoping to stave off further violence. Wallace met
Kennedy, but not before ordering a wreath placed over the Jefferson
Davis star to keep Kennedy from walking on it.
</P>
<P>
   Hood and Malone arrived on the Tuscaloosa campus June 11, 1963.
Wallace and federal officials played out a drama fulfilling
Wallace's stand pledge, and saving face for all while avoiding
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace selected a door and stood there behind a lectern. U.S.
Assistant Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach and the students
approached. Wallace threw up a hand. Katzenbach handed him a
cease-and-desist order, and started to speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need your speech,'' Wallace said.
</P>
<P>
   Katzenbach withdrew. The students were taken to dorm rooms. The
Alabama National Guard was federalized. A second confrontation
occurred later, this time at the registration center. Wallace again
stood in a door. A National Guard officer asked him to step aside;
he did. By the time the blacks were registered, Wallace was being
driven back to Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   (Hood dropped out after six weeks. Malone graduated, and later
headed the Atlanta-based Voter Education Project.)
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1963, Wallace delayed the openings of schools in
four cities which had been ordered desegregated. Wallace used the
National Guard to prevent registration of blacks. President Kennedy
responded by federalizing the guardsmen and ordering them to their
barracks. The schools were desegregated.
</P>
<P>
   As this was occurring, on Sept. 15, 1963, the 16th Street
Baptist Church in Birmingham was bombed. Four black children died.
Wallace denounced the bombing, but Kennedy implied some culpability
on the part of Wallace when he said that it was regrettable that
public disparagement of law and order had encouraged violence which
had fallen on the innocent.
</P>
<P>
   His stand had made Wallace a national figure. He entered the
1964 presidential race as a Democrat, challenging President Lyndon
Johnson and hoping to win enough electoral votes to throw the
election into the House of Representatives. There, he hoped, he
would gain concessions on civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace won 33.8 percent in the Wisconsin primary, 29.8 percent
in Indiana, and 42.7 percent in Maryland. But supporters failed to
place Wallace electors on the Georgia, Mississippi and South
Carolina ballots. The death blow to his candidacy was the
Republicans' nomination of conservative Sen. Barry Goldwater.
Wallace withdrew.
</P>
<P>
   His role in the historic 1965 Selma March was largely as a
symbol of all that the marchers despised in their campaign for the
right to vote. Blacks launched a voter registration drive in Selma
in January of that year, and Atlanta's Martin Luther King Jr.
announced plans to march to Montgomery. Wallace said the march will
not be tolerated, and troopers turned back 700 blacks March 7. But
a federal judge enjoined state officials from interfering, and the
historic march occurred March 21-25.
</P>
<P>
   The state Constitution forbade a governor to succeed himself.
Wallace ran Lurleen and she won the primary in June 1966 with
480,841 votes, more than nine opponents combined. She crushed
Republican Jim Martin in the general election, 537,505 to 262,943.
</P>
<P>
   Her election eliminated the last vestige of opposition to the
Wallaces. At the Capitol, he ran the state from an office across
the hall from hers. But their reign was halted when Lurleen died of
cancer in May 1968 after 18 months in office, and Lt. Gov. Albert
Brewer became governor.
</P>
<P>
   George Wallace sought the presidency again in 1968, this time as
a third-party candidate. He collected 3 million signatures and got
on the ballot in all 50 states under varying party names American
Independent, Georgia Wallace, American, Conservative, George C.
Wallace and Courage Parties. Former Georgia Gov. Marvin Griffin was
a stand-in vice-presidential candidate to meet requirements in four
states, then was replaced by former Air Force Gen. Curtis E. LeMay.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic candidate Humphrey and labor attacked Wallace, and he
also was hurt when it was revealed that, before he was added to the
ticket, LeMay had advocated bombing the North Vietnamese ``back
into the stone age.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace got 9,90l,151 popular votes, finished third behind
Richard Nixon and Humphrey and carried Georgia, Alabama, Arkansas,
Louisiana and Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   He met the incumbent, Brewer, in a bitter 1970 primary campaign
for governor. Wallace trailed, 428,146 to 416,443, but won a
run-off, 559,832 to 525,951. He buried John Cashin of the black
National Democratic Party of Alabama in the general election,
637,046 to 125,491.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1971, Wallace married Cornelia Ellis Snively, 19
years his junior, a beautiful divorcee who was Folsom's niece and
who once had performed in the water-ski show at Florida's Cypress
Gardens.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace became a Democrat again to run for president in 1972. He
reeled off primary victories in Florida, Alabama, Tennessee and
North Carolina, and finished second in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and
Indiana. Maryland was next.
</P>
<P>
   On May 15, 1972, Wallace was walking among supporters at a
Laurel, Md., shopping center when he was shot several times and
critically wounded. Secret Service agents seized Arthur Bremer, a
young drifter who was later tried, convicted and sentenced to
prison.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the hospitalized Wallace won the Maryland and
Michigan primaries. But he was in a hospital bed for seven weeks,
and eventually underwent four major operations, several minor
surgical procedures and suffered various complications. Confined to
a wheelchair, he went to Miami and addressed the Democratic
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later he won the governorship of Alabama in a
landslide victory. (The state constitution now permitted him to
succeed himself.) Wallace, courting the black vote, defeated Gene
McLain in the Democratic primary, 536,235 to 249,695, and
overwhelmed Republican Elvin McCary in the general election,
497,574 to 88,381.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, Wallace decided on one more presidential race and
faced, among others, Georgia's Jimmy Carter. The major test was the
Florida primary. Wallace's longtime slogan had been ``Send a
message to Washington,'' but Carter urged voters to ``Send a
president, not a message.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter won in Florida and later defeated Wallace in North
Carolina. Wallace withdrew, and stunned his old backers by
endorsing Carter. Former Georgia Gov. Lester Maddox ran for
president under the American Independent Party banner, and won
170,531 votes.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace's seven-year marriage to Cornelia ended in divorce in
January 1978.
</P>
<P>
   He could not run for a third term and left office in January
1979. The law forbade a pension but he was awarded an
$18,000-per-year honorarium.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1981, Wallace married Linda Lee Taylor, 29 years his
junior, a divorcee and country music singer who had been Lisa in a
singing duo, Mona and Lisa, that performed during his political
campaigns. (They divorced in 1987.)
</P>
<P>
   Wallace put on a new face to run for governor once again in
1982. ``Segregation is wrong,'' he said. Montgomery black leader
E.D. Nixon said Wallace ``has done more for black folks than any
other governor in the last 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace topped George McMillian in the 1982 primary, 425,469 to
296,271, and won a run-off, 512,203 to 488,444. In the general
election, Wallace received 90 percent of the black vote as he
defeated Montgomery mayor Emory Folmar, 650,538 to 440,815.
</P>
<P>
   He was inaugurated a fourth time and the official program for
the event called him a lifelong champion of the less fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   Tuskegee University awarded him an honorary degree in 1985.

ENGLISH LOSES HOLD ON HONG KONG SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ The last major bastion of English dominance in this
former colony crumbled last week, when the new school year began.
For the first time in this overwhelmingly Chinese city, the vast
majority of students will now be educated in Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Teaching students in their native language is hardly novel. But
in a city whose colonial history shaped it as an international
entrepot, the switch has sparked emotional hand-wringing and
politicized debate.
</P>
<P>
   The Education Department says most of Hong Kong's 57,000
teachers are not qualified to teach in English, and that switching
to Chinese is a pragmatic response to declining academic standards.
Proponents say it is logical that children will develop better
academically and socially if they learn in their mother tongue.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the local government is making the change to prove
its patriotism and kowtow to Beijing, which regained sovereignty of
Hong Kong in July 1997. The demise of English in schools, they say,
will undermine students' job prospects and Hong Kong's role as an
international center of commerce.
</P>
<P>
   But advocates of the switch note that while teaching in Chinese
is being mandated only now, the movement began a decade ago under
British rule.
</P>
<P>
   In the period since the handover, observers have watched
anxiously for changes to the legal system and civil liberties and
signs of meddling by Beijing, but few have emerged. Instead,
language _ perhaps more than any other issue _ has polarized a
community that prides itself on how little has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the educational arguments, how people view
``mother-tongue teaching'' depends largely on whether they think
Hong Kong's key to success lies within its bicultural past or its
future as a Chinese city.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, English was important because Hong Kong was a
colony, but now we are a part of China and we must know Chinese,''
said Charles Yip, 40, whose daughter is enrolled at Pui Ching
Middle School, one of only 26 schools here that has always taught
in Chinese. ``China is getting more important in the world, and if
we act as a bridge between China and the West, we must know China
better.''
</P>
<P>
   English will still be taught, but as a foreign language. Critics
say that once English is used less, it will fade, and Hong Kong
will lose its edge as a bridge to the West and a regional base for
multinationals.
</P>
<P>
   When the government announced last spring that only 114 of Hong
Kong's 400 secondary schools _ those with the best-scoring students
_ could continue to teach in English, angry callers flooded radio
talk shows, denouncing the creation of a ``two-tiered'' educational
system. Students at schools that ``lost out'' wept openly on
campuses.
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey by Caritas Community Center found only 4 percent
of parents polled preferred their children to study in Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Schools that were forced to switch have seen their enrollment
drop, and some parents are opting for private schools rather than
public and state-funded religious schools that now must teach in
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   After 156 years of colonial rule, it's easy to see why parents
think children must know English to succeed. Although 98 percent of
the population speaks the local Cantonese dialect and almost no one
uses English at home, English has been the language of law,
government, and business. Local universities teach in English, and
the best jobs require English.
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, however, the territory's laws have been
translated into Chinese, and judges have started hearing some cases
in Cantonese. Chinese is now the official language, and civil
servants and legislators are using Chinese more, even though the
law says English can still be used.
</P>
<P>
   Yet schools have clung to teaching in English, even though for
years, only about 7 percent of high school students have scored a C
or better in English on the standardized exams. In the exams graded
last month, only 44 percent of students who took the easier English
test passed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Yeung Yok-wah, principal of Concordia Lutheran School at
North Point, which is being forced to switch this year, laments
that ``two different status of people are being created by the
government.'' In the past, his students, who are among the
lower-scoring pupils in the district, have managed to get jobs as
branch managers for international banks or English-speaking tour
guides. ``If we're only using Chinese, we cannot create these kinds
of people for the community. And students from elite schools won't
accept those jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Ann Yeung, 39, says her son Toby cried for a week when he found
out that his campus, St. Francis Xavier's School in Tsuen Wan,
would be forced to use Chinese. She worries he'll have a harder
time getting into college, or adjusting to coursework in English if
he does attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't even want to tell others where he's going to
school, because he's afraid of being laughed at as a second-class
citizen,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A senior education officer, P.K. Chiu, acknowledges that many
parents share Yeung's view, but says that on the contrary, the new
system will raise the lot of low-achieving pupils. ``Imagine a
student who can't write a complete sentence. English is a foreign
language for us. Children speak Cantonese at home, with friends, in
stores. ... How can they listen and communicate in English
effectively?
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are taught in Chinese, teaching and learning are more
enjoyable. And they'll have more spare time to put into efforts in
learning English as a second language,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yip Bun-bun, 15, a fourth-year student at Hong Kong Sam Yuk
Secondary School, hates learning in English because she barely
understands what teachers say and can't read her textbooks. ``It's
a waste of time to teach in English, because teachers always have
to repeat themselves in Chinese. ... I just memorize terms without
knowing their pronunciation or meaning, and I forget them very
easily.''
</P>
<P>
   Her principal, Kavin Yeung, agrees. Over the past five years,
his school has been making the transition to mother-tongue
education by choice. Last year, all his first-year secondary school
pupils learned in Chinese, and their marks in Chinese, English, and
math rose 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he acknowledges the transition has been difficult.
Educators who have taught in English for years say one summer is
too little time to learn a specialized vocabulary, plan lessons,
and read new texts in a new language. The Education Department says
it has published glossaries and held retraining courses, and faults
schools for not preparing for the transition.
</P>
<P>
   At Pui Ching, where Chinese has been used since the school was
founded in 1889, principal Cheng Sing Yip says the idea that
learning Chinese holds back high-achieving students is a myth. His
school is one of the best on Hong Kong; graduates have attended
Harvard, Yale, and Oxford universities, and 99 percent of his
students passed their five best subjects in this year's Certificate
of Education exam. But he admits that only 71.5 percent passed the
English exam, and only 13 students scored a C or above.
</P>
<P>
   Yeung Sik-wing, 16, one of Pui Ching's top students, scored A's
in seven subjects but received a D in English. ``We don't have
enough opportunity to talk English, listen English, and writing,''
she said, stumbling over her grammar before switching to Chinese.
``If I had a chance to choose again, I might choose an
English-medium school. ... (But) after the return to China, the
Hong Kong government is making us resemble China more.''
</P>
<P>
   Her principal agrees that there are political overtones to the
new policy, but he sees the change as positive. ``The British tried
to create the belief that only English is important, and that
influenced students, parents, and teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't forget,'' he added, ``in the future, Chinese will be the
language of business here and throughout Asia. This is only 1998.
Give it time.''

IN LAWLESS LAND, LONE CRUSADER FINDS THE MISSING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Yury Chudakov got kidnapped in the usual way. The
police sergeant was manning a roadblock in southern Russia's
strife-torn and crime-ridden Caucasus badlands when a car stopped
and the driver asked him for help.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, Chudakov was overwhelmed and hustled into the car
by several gunmen. They drove him over the border into separatist
Chechnya, a breakaway republic still reeling from Russia's failed
and bloody campaign to end an armed rebellion. It is a
poverty-stricken and lawless place 1,000 miles south of Moscow
where taking hostages for ransom has become a profitable business.
A ransom note followed, demanding a sum none of Chudakov's friends
or loved ones could pay.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of people have disappeared in recent months in southern
Russia, and neither the Kremlin, which has all but lost control of
Chechnya and neighboring regions, nor squabbling local authorities,
who never really had control, have been able to do anything about
it. Chudakov was just one more prisoner of the Caucasus whom no one
expected to see again.
</P>
<P>
   No one, that is, except Vyacheslav Izmailov, a former army major
who has made freeing hostages and prisoners of war his business.
</P>
<P>
   One day recently, Izmailov left his Moscow office and headed
down to the hardscrabble villages just across Chechnya's eastern
border, a place where most Russians would never go. Five days
later, Izmailov emerged with Chudakov. As usual with the dozens of
people Izmailov has freed _ he lost count after 60 last year _ no
ransom was paid.
</P>
<P>
   It should be noted that this Russian Rambo is no muscle-bound
fighting machine, nor does he free hostages by means of brute force
and derring-do. Izmailov, 43, balding and somewhat pudgy, holds
negotiations with kidnappers and makes deals with Chechen families
whose relatives are being held prisoner in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are Russian authorities particularly grateful for what
Izmailov does. In June, Russia's Defense Ministry forced him to
resign from the army. In July, one of President Boris Yeltsin's
senior aides, deputy chief of staff Yevgeny Savostyanov, said
Izmailov should be ``flogged'' for what he has done.
</P>
<P>
   Considering that over 1,200 Russian servicemen are still
officially listed as missing in action in Chechnya, and hundreds
more Russian troops, police and civilians, including Yeltsin's
personal representative to Chechnya, have been kidnapped in the
region since the war ended in 1996, the Kremlin's hostility toward
someone who is trying to find these people may seem strange.
</P>
<P>
   But Izmailov long ago earned the Kremlin's wrath with his frank
criticism of the way Moscow prosecuted the war. His column in the
local weekly Novaya Gazeta, appearing under the headline ``The
Forgotten Brigade,'' contained often scathing commentary of
atrocities committed by the Russian military against civilians.
When Russian troops withdrew from Chechnya in early 1997, Izmailov
began writing about the missing servicemen written off and
forgotten by the army like so many lost tanks.
</P>
<P>
   In a society that has shown remarkably little public concern for
the ongoing tragedy on its southern borders, Izmailov stands out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia's constitution says individuals have priority over the
state,'' Izmailov said in a recent interview. ``That provision is
not observed. I see my job as demonstrating that this country is
made up of people with rights.''
</P>
<P>
   A 27-year veteran who served in Afghanistan, Izmailov was
working at a draft board in 1994 when the fighting in Chechnya
broke out. When news of the first casualties of soldiers he had
helped induct started coming in, Izmailov put in for a transfer to
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided I couldn't serve that way anymore, sending boys to
their death,'' Izmailov said. In March, 1995, at the height of the
fighting, Izmailov got his wish and was transferred to Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the Russian Army was trying to isolate the Chechen
rebel fighters by signing ``peace accords'' with civilians in
Chechen villages. Despite the accords, the villages would come
under fire by Russian troops. The Russian Army promised to punish
those responsible, but investigating officers rarely treated the
inquiries seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Izmailov did. The Chechens were amazed when Izmailov sent in
reports detailing atrocities by Russian units and naming the guilty
Russian servicemen.
</P>
<P>
   As a gesture of gratitude, the Chechens helped Izmailov secure
the release of Russian prisoners. After that, Izmailov gained the
reputation among the Chechens as a Russian officer who could be
trusted. During the final battle for Grozny, the Chechen capital,
in August 1996, Izmailov drove around in a tank with no helmet, so
that Chechen commanders could recognize him, picking up the wounded
and dead of surrounded Russian units.
</P>
<P>
   That trust has served Izmailov after the war. Chechens with
family members being held prisoner in Russia supply him information
concerning the whereabouts of Russian hostages in the
Connecticut-sized region. In return, Izmailov works with
prosecutors to try to secure more lenient treatment for the Chechen
prisoners, in some cases securing prisoners' release.
</P>
<P>
   Some have criticized Izmailov, suggesting that his deal-making
encourages Chechens with relatives in Russia accused of criminal
offenses to take hostages as a bargaining chip to secure their
release.
</P>
<P>
   Izmailov admits that in some cases, Chechen families with
relatives in Russian prisons have purchased hostages from
professional kidnappers. He recently helped free a 13-year-old
orphan from one such family, in return for a promise to help
release a Chechen accused of extortion in the Siberian city of
Omsk.
</P>
<P>
   The strain of three straight years in the business of freeing
prisoners is starting to take its toll.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are thousands of hostages, and no one is doing
anything,'' Ismailov said. ``I'm trying to show our authorities
that we and the Chechens have to work together. But they didn't
understand it before, and they haven't figured it out yet.''

DELAHUNT'S MISSION ON JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: FAIRNESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bill Delahunt is one of my favorite freshman
congressmen mostly because, at 57, he's like a freshman in college
who has already done a tour in the Marines and spent a couple of
years working construction.
</P>
<P>
   In short, he's fresh but he's been around, as a legislator but
more important as the veteran district attorney from Norfolk
County, Mass, adjacent to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The other reason is that he doesn't say a whole lot _ not
because he doesn't have anything to say, but because he seems to be
a public official more inclined to pick his spots than chase every
microphone he sees. The result is that when he does talk the
natural reaction is to listen.
</P>
<P>
   And, finally, it's worth noting that as a freshman member of the
House Judiciary Committee, Delahunt has become something of a pal
to another _ but far less in shape _ member with white hair _ the
committee's chairman, Henry Hyde, Republican of Illinois. That
makes the few things Delahunt has to say in public about
you-know-what especially worth paying attention to. Everybody
knows, but hardly anybody says it often enough, that something as
solemn as impeachment is never going to move forward much more than
an inch without some block of President Clinton's own partisans
going along; Delahunt will be one of the Democrats to watch.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, he spoke up more than he has of late as the House
prepared to vote to dump nearly 500 pages of independent counsel
Kenneth Starr's narrative material on its membership and, more
important, the public, and to begin reviewing some 2,000 more pages
of raw material for similar distribution over the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   For what it's worth _ much more than a little _ Delahunt did not
think a necessarily nonpartisan process had gotten off to a smooth
start.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, he did not like what amounted to an abdication of
congressional responsibility to Starr in the decision to instantly
release, on his say-so, his report, but to agree to treat at least
some of the raw evidence that accompanied it as confidential, also
on his say-so alone.
</P>
<P>
   For another, he joined with many of his Democratic colleagues in
protesting the absence of notice and time to respond to the
president and his lawyers, citing the provision made as courtesies
to such investigative targets of the past as Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   And that, he said, tends to exacerbate the third, and
inevitable, impact of Starr's referral _ which as a former
prosecutor Delahunt is greatly experienced in dealing with.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will clearly be prejudicial to the president's defense,''
he said. ``If the independent counsel has done his job, the case he
has constructed will be a persuasive one ... And, at least at the
federal level, they have no obligation to apprise the jurors of
exculpatory evidence. The case will seem airtight, yet until the
evidence has withstood cross-examination and the allegations have
been proven, they remain nothing more than allegations.''
</P>
<P>
   Delahunt was not arguing that Starr's report should be
repressed; no one was. The only question, he said, ``is when and
how it should be done,'' which is where the question of
``fundamental fairness'' becomes relevant.
</P>
<P>
   So far, so bad, in Delahunt's view.
</P>
<P>
   And from here on, there is a danger that all this will become
worse.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment there is a great frenzy here _ primarily over the
sexual details in the Starr document. But after a few weeks, and
assuming Clinton can politically survive the initial avalanche of
disclosure, there will be questions about what the Judiciary
Committee is going to do.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that after all this posturing about how serious
everything is, how solemnly obligations are being undertaken,
Hyde's committee intends to do _ nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Delahunt told me that there simply isn't time to go through an
impeachment inquiry between now and when a new Congress takes
office after the new year and the current Congress leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   However, he did say that Hyde intends to try to decide in the
time left this year the threshhold question of whether there should
be an inquiry, based on study of and debate over the Starr document
and the president's detailed response to it.
</P>
<P>
   One would hope that at the very least the committee would do
that. Otherwise, the judicious reticence of Republicans like Hyde
and Democrats like Delahunt risks appearing pointless.
</P>
<P>
   After all, how can this be a terribly serious, pressing matter _
whether the president is fit to continue in office _ and then have
nothing at all done about for four months?
</P>
<P>
   Answers yet to come.

PARENTS FACE UNEASY TASK OF EXPLAINING CLINTON AFFAIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KATHERINE SELIGMAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Thanks to President Clinton's affair and a
special prosecutor's detailed report about it, parents may face
unsettling, precocious questions about sexual situations from young
children.
</P>
<P>
   Psychologists and experts in child development say the rush of
media attention may expose children to more than they can digest,
but can also be used as a valuable learning experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good opportunity for parents to talk about their
values,'' said Anne Bernstein, a family psychologist in Berkeley,
Calif., and author of ``Flight of the Stork: What Children Think
(And When) About Sex and Family Building.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things you do when you talk about sex is you give
information, and you discuss values,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   William Damon, head of Stanford University's Center on
Adolescence, said the issues that emerged from the Clinton scandal
gave parents a chance to talk not just about sexuality but also
about honesty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The funny thing about these kinds of events is that they're
wonderful learning opportunities if adults handle them the right
way,'' he said. ``This is how moral learning happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that it's important to pay attention to a child's
level of knowledge before attempting explanations. None interviewed
said censoring the news would be advisable or useful, even if it
were possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think just pretending it's not going on is a way to
deal with it,'' said Tom Spencer, head of the Child Study Center at
San Francisco State University. ``Some of their friends will talk
about it. I always believe they should get the truth at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Spencer advises parents to be careful listeners and give
age-appropriate answers to questions. Children under age 9 probably
won't be aware of the lurid details contained in the report, but
they may have general questions, psychologists say. Most said to
meet the questions directly, without giving unsolicited information
or details.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, you're not going to talk to an 8-year-old about
oral sex, and he won't ask questions about it,'' Damon said. ``If
he does, it's because he's heard the phrase somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, you might talk to a child that young about loyalty in
marriage, honesty and the importance of telling the truth in a
relationship, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Beverly Mills, who writes a nationally syndicated column ``Child
Life,'' said she and her husband had decided to start a discussion
with their two children, 7 and 9, by saying at the dinner table,
``It seems like the president is having a lot of trouble now.''
</P>
<P>
   Her 9 year-old son wanted to know ``what does it mean?''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband responded that ``the president has made some
inappropriate choices, and he apparently has lied. You're really
not supposed to lie, and he's in a lot of trouble now.''
</P>
<P>
   For her two children that was enough, though Mills said her
husband had ``the complete discussion'' about sex with their
9-year-old this year probably because of ``the Monica Lewinsky
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of kids will know the details of sex sooner thanks to
President Clinton,'' she said. ``It's unfortunate, but I think it
still needs to come from the parents and not from the kids on the
playground. And it doesn't necessarily have to be as graphic as you
think it does.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What's important, Mills said, is to build a foundation with
children, to have them understand they can bring up any issue,
whether it's sexuality or honesty, so that when ``the big oral sex
discussion'' surfaces, it won't be as difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Middle-school children are probably the ones who'll find the
latest details most embarrassing and difficult to talk about,
psychologists say. Their discomfort might show up in the form of
jokes or laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Glen Elliott, head of child and adolescent psychiatry at the
University of California at San Francisco, said parents might steer
the discussion into one about ``how public figures get into this
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A 13-year-old will like to talk about this and will have
strong feelings,'' he said. ``I don't think one needs to go into
great detail about sex. The topic has more to do with what happens
when someone does something they're not supposed to have done.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Krikorian, a school district psychologist in Palo Alto,
Calif., said it was fortunate that the report on Clinton, presented
to Congress by Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth Starr, had
come out on Friday so children could hear about it at home.
</P>
<P>
   Older teens, Elliott said, may be the ones most likely to refuse
to talk about the developments in the White House affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're more likely to respond cynically,'' he said. ``They're
beginning to disrespect adults anyway, and it's an opportunity to
show that.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the news shaking their view of government, Damon doesn't
think most teens revere the president regardless of the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Presidents don't have that kind of cache anymore,'' he said.
``Kids don't think of the president as a hero. They pick someone
from sports or entertainment. ... The presidential link (to the
scandal) isn't adding a lot of sauciness to this. That's why I
think a lot of kids won't look it up on the Internet. If they do,
they won't find anything they don't know about or can't find on 10
zillion other Web sites.''

LEARNING FROM JOHN GLENN'S `EXPERIMENT OF ONE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At 77, Sen. John Glenn still has the military bearing, piercing
gaze, and even the boyish grin that Americans of a certain age
recall from 1962, when he became the nation's first space hero. But
next month he will assume a less exalted role: by his own
description, he'll be the first guinea pig in a pioneering venture
that might be called space gerontology.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 29, Glenn is scheduled to blast off with eight other
humans in the space shuttle Discovery for nine days of experiments.
Some of them, he notes, may shed light on the curious similarities
between aging and the physiologic effects of space travel _ muscle
wasting, bone deterioration, sleep disturbances, balance problems,
immune system decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we determine in the human body what turns these systems on
and off, not only will we benefit future astronauts but we will
have made a great step forward in benefitting the old and frail
here on Earth,'' says the once and future astronaut.
</P>
<P>
   Really? Can Earthbound elders expect to benefit from this
brand-new field? Will we indeed learn, as Glenn and the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration promise, about the mechanisms
of aging and how to counteract them?
</P>
<P>
   Scientists, including those involved in the experiments on Glenn
and his colleagues, have much more modest expectations of the
gerontologic yield of STS-95, as NASA terms this fall's mission.
Tellingly, NASA has ``no specific plans to fly other older
astronauts'' to build on the data Glenn will provide, says David
Liskowsky, chief life sciences program scientist for the mission.
</P>
<P>
   However, scientists and nonscientists are unanimous when it
comes to the symbolic value of sending a 77-year-old human into
space.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some feeling this is being done purely for PR
reasons, but I think that's unfair,'' says Dr. Reubin Andres of the
National Institute on Aging's gerontology research center in
Baltimore. ``Clearly we're not going to be able to calculate a mean
value and a standard deviation from an experiment of one, but that
doesn't mean anecdotal information is useless. The fact that he's
77 is simply a plus and adds an interesting dimension to the whole
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The real value of Glenn's venture, many observe, is to bring
home the point that some septuagenarians (and those even older) are
capable of extraordinary feats. ``This is one more step in
challenging the stereotypes about aging,'' says Frank Bailey,
northeast regional director of the American Association of Retired
People. ``It instills a renewed sense of excitement about the
possibilities for folks his age.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is not whether you're going to get scientific data
on the effects of microgravity on the processes of aging _ you
ain't,'' Andres adds. ``But nature is providing us with Sen.
Glenns. We want to study them, and if we're lucky and we design our
experiments carefully, we may learn something.''
</P>
<P>
   The experiments Glenn and his fellow crew will carry out aboard
STS-95 are not specifically designed to test the effects of aging,
but the scientists hope Glenn's age will at least provide glimmers
of how an elder responds to conditions of space.
</P>
<P>
   ``The participation of one elderly individual has limited
scientific value,'' says Dr. Linda Shackelford, an orthopedic
surgeon at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston who is measuring
changes in bone metabolism among the STS-95 astronauts. ``But it
may lead the way for more studies like this one, not only in space
but on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Shackelford is trying to develop, for instance, specific
exercise prescriptions that maintain and even build bone among
bedridden individuals on Earth, a project with obvious relevance to
astronauts on long-duration space station missions of the next
decade as well as to millions of frail elders.
</P>
<P>
   The two major human experiments on the mission _ NASA calls them
``primary payload experiments'' _ concern muscle wasting and
changes in sleep patterns, two problems that plague all astronauts
and most if not all elders on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``When humans go into space they lose about 10 percent of body
weight, even on short flights, and it's much more than water
weight,'' reports Arny A. Ferrando of the University of Texas
Medical Branch at Galveston, who is running the muscle wasting
study. Microgravity, or weightlessness, ``is only a partial
explanation,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrando's hypothesis is that the stress of space flight
contributes to muscle wasting, mediated by hormones such as
cortisol and insulin. ``Under conditions of stress, the body
mobilizes all its resources to survive, and the breakdown of muscle
protein as an energy source is one of the primary survival
mechanisms,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   During STS-95, Ferrando will track protein ``turnover,'' as the
process of muscle building and breakdown is called, in Glenn and
fellow crew member Pedro Duque of Spain. They will ingest pills of
a distinctive isotope of the amino acid alanine and inject
themselves with another protein building block called 3-methyl
histidine. Ferrando will track the amino acid levels in the
astronauts' blood and urine and correlate it with their hormone
levels. The astronauts' strength levels and muscle mass will also
be measured before and after the flight.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrando expects that Glenn's results will be different from the
35-year-old Duque's. ``Even though John Glenn is in fantastic
shape, I think the stress will probably affect him more, and it
will take longer for him to recover from it,'' Ferrando predicts.
``But you never know. His physiology may not act like a typical
elder's physiology.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, in the sleep experiment, Glenn may not turn out to be
typical. Unlike many older individuals, Glenn says, he has never
had trouble sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Charles A. Czeisler of Boston's Brigham and Women's
Hospital, who is running the sleep study, says its primary purpose
``is to find out how sleep is different in space and on the
ground,'' not to investigate how elders respond in space.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know sleep disruption becomes more common as people get
older, and disturbed sleep is very common in space flight. We don't
know if the two will be additive,'' Czeisler says. Specifically,
scientists already know that astronauts' breathing patterns change
in conditions of weightlessness, ``and breathing abnormalities are
one of the most common causes of sleep disorders among the
elderly.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most potentially useful aspect of the sleep studies
is to see if melatonin _ a much-touted but largely unproven
hormonal sleep aid _ improves the astronauts' sleep, a continuation
of an experiment begun in April on the Neurolab shuttle mission.
``If melatonin improves sleep they will sleep longer and better,
and that should hopefully translate into better cognitive
performance,'' says NASA's Liskowsky.
</P>
<P>
   It will be interesting if Glenn responds differently to
melatonin than the other crew member in that experiment, Dr. Chaiki
Mukai, 46. But ``whether or not we can learn anything about
melatonin from one older person is a question,'' Czeisler cautions.
</P>
<P>
   Other STS-95 experiments will measure changes in heart rate and
blood pressure, immune function, and recovery of normal balance
mechanisms, during and after the flight. Everyone will be
interested to see if Glenn differs on any of these measures from
younger astronauts, even if the results can't be generalized to
less typical 77-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the results, they're sure to be overshadowed by the
mere fact of Glenn's return to space at such an advanced age. As
Andres put it: ``He's a genuine American hero _ and we need them.''

IN FASHION RACE, US SCORES ONE OVER EUROPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUZANNE C. RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the fashion industry, no matter how heated the rivalries, one
thing has remained constant: European designers without exception
are the first to unveil their seasonal collections, followed by the
Americans. It's an almost sacred tradition, but a lot of US
designers hate it.
</P>
<P>
   That's why starting Monday, , in a history-making shakeup in the
industry, a group of renegade New York-based designers, led by the
likes of Helmut Lang, Calvin Klein, and Donna Karan, has decided to
defy tradition and unveil their spring collections first _ weeks
ahead of Versace, Armani, and Chanel.
</P>
<P>
   The in-your-face move could generate more global respect for New
York, as industry insiders for years have contended that many
American designers don't create women's clothing trends, they copy
them _ from the Europeans. By showing first in New York this week,
said Debra Greenberg, president of Louis, Boston, ``Now they have
to stand on their own. ... They'll be taken more seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   For consumers, the change will likely have little effect, other
than providing an earlier signal of what to expect when spring
clothes appear in stores in February.
</P>
<P>
   But the breakaway fashion week is opening a huge rift within the
American design community, mostly because it was organized at the
last minute in July and August. While more than 15 designers will
present their women's spring collections over the next few days,
including Nicole Miller, Mark Eisen, and Vivienne Tam, more than 40
others, like Ralph Lauren, Bill Blass, and Oscar de la Renta, are
waiting _ for logistical reasons _ until the traditional New York
fashion week, this year Nov. 2-6.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these designers say they aren't opposed to showing
before Europe in theory. But in reality, with a month's notice or
so, they couldn't cut short their production schedules by seven
weeks. They're irritated, they say, because designers like Klein
didn't wait until the next season so the industry could present a
unified front.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a catastrophe. It's an absolute mess,'' said Boston
designer Alfred Fiandaca, who plans to present his collection in
his Manhattan store during the last week of October. ``This is not
a time for us to be pulling shenanigans. The fashion market hasn't
been that strong. (Buyers and the press) have other priorities. ...
They don't have the budgets to come into New York and put
themselves up at hotels twice in one season.''
</P>
<P>
   Said New York designer Donald Deal, who plans to show in early
November, ``I'm a real practical guy. Literally, when you change a
calendar, it requires preparation. We were not able to secure our
fabrics and embroideries and mount a show in such short notice. ...
It was just not possible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some designers contend the move to show their lines earlier has
nothing to do with reputation _ it's all strictly business. Because
designers are selling in more markets globally, they have more
goods they need to produce for spring, and thus they need more time
to do it, they say. What's more, by the time retailers return from
Europe in November, they say, the stores have already seen the
season's trends and many have committed much of their budgets to
the likes of Prada, Chanel, and Missoni.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we wait (till November), it's very difficult to get the
goods into the store on time (for February),'' said Patti Cohen, a
senior vice president for Donna Karan International. ``We've been
having trouble with deliveries, like a lot of companies,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   A number of critics believe ego has more to do with the early
shows than anything else. ``It's ridiculous,'' said Boston designer
David Josef, whose clothes are sold in Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman
Marcus. ``We're (hardly) done with summer and here they are
presenting spring clothes. ... I think they're doing it for the
press. I've never heard of a retailer who came back (from Europe)
and said `I spent all my money.'''
</P>
<P>
   Josef plans to unveil portions of his spring collection in
November and later, in January. He expects stores to stock it by
February.
</P>
<P>
   The Council of Fashion Designers of America, which organizes the
semi-annual New York shows, said it has tentatively moved up the
fall shows to mid-February, instead of late March _ thus unifying
the US industry once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great idea to show before the Europeans. It just needs
to be planned so we don't all look like fools scurrying around,''
said Deal, who believes this time he'll be ready to show earlier
than the traditional March time frame.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be a great way for us to hit our stride and show
that this is what we are, this is what we're doing. ... As a
community, to be able to hit the world first with our ideas, has a
bigger bang than at the end.''

BEWARD `NEGATIVE-OPTION' MAILINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA WEN AND BRUCE MOHL  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Companies offering products in the mail always want you
to accept and pay. And in an effort to maximize their success, they
are increasingly using dubious methods to convince themselves that
you wanted what they sent.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, if you say yes, you want it; and if you say no, you
don't. But if you do nothing _ because you were too busy to respond
or chucked the notice in the trash _ some aggressive marketers read
the inaction as a ``yes.''
</P>
<P>
   It's called ``negative option'' mailings, and it assumes you
want something unless you negate or stop it. And when the company
simply gets silence, they start sending you the unwanted products
and the bills. The first offer is often presented as free, when
there are strings attached.
</P>
<P>
   ``This marketing ploy is gaining in popularity,'' said Leslie
Davies, managing attorney for consumer protection at the state
attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   It's illegal for someone to expect you to buy something simply
because they didn't hear from you. Any purchase contract has to be
two-way, with an offer from the company and your actual acceptance
of it. So next time you get an unsolicited product, consider it a
gift; you don't have to pay or return it.
</P>
<P>
   Negative-option mailings are acceptable, however, if you agree
to this setup as part of an ongoing relationship. For example, you
join a book club in which you agree to buy a certain number of
books unless you stop the orders. Or you agree to automatic annual
renewals of an auto club unless you stop it.
</P>
<P>
   A negative-option system, consumer advocate Edgar Dworsky said,
must be disclosed in ``clear and conspicuous'' language. Clever
marketers, however, are finding ways to make it seem like you
agreed to something long term.
</P>
<P>
   Take the case of Jack Hurley, a computer executive in the South
End who is finding himself the confused _ and now angry _ recipient
of several CDs he never ordered.
</P>
<P>
   Last February, Reader's Digest got Hurley's name from an outside
mailing list and sent him a ``complimentary'' CD called ``Stardust
Moods'' and a coin set, according to the company.
</P>
<P>
   Hurley's initial mailing came with a notice saying that Hurley
could keep it as a gift, and ``if you don't send anything back to
us, we'll send you the next one.''
</P>
<P>
   In May, having not heard form Hurley, Reader's Digest sent him a
``Candlelight Classics'' CD, with a bill for $21.
</P>
<P>
   Hurley couldn't remember ordering the CD, but, afraid it was
just a memory lapse, he sent them a check. Last July, Reader's
Digest sent him another CD and another bill.
</P>
<P>
   By now, Hurley was getting upset. When we inquired, Reader's
Digest spokeswoman Donna Pierpont acknowledged that Hurley never
agreed to enter into a long-term relationship to receive these
products. The company, based in Pleasantville, N.Y., simply assumed
he would indicate if he didn't want them anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Pierpont said of consumers, ``You need to let us know if you
don't want to continue with these services.''
</P>
<P>
   Davies of the attorney general's office said in cases such as
these, Hurley would have been wise to simply keep all the things
coming his way, and, to stop future mailings, inform Reader's
Digest that he wants off this list.
</P>
<P>
   He would have been under no obligation to pay, because he never
asked to receive the CDs.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of James and Bernice Johnson of Reading, they
apparently didn't read the fine print from American Family
Publishers, which said their purchase of one cookbook amounted to
being part of a ``continuity product.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple started receiving notices that a cookbook was waiting
for them and would be sent, unless they sent back the post card
within a month stating they didn't want it. ``Quickly, I wrote on
each side of the card `I DON'T WANT THIS!''' James Johnson said in
his letter to us.
</P>
<P>
   These tactics prey on those who may easily feel intimidated into
paying a bill, partly out of fear it may affect their credit
rating. Davies said the state takes seriously all cases in which
consumers are duped into giving up money and can prosecute any
``unfair and deceptive'' practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The companies may be trying to trick someone into thinking
they bought something,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Unwanted loan checks &LR;  &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After reading our column last month about the illegality of
sending unsolicited credit cards in the mail, Ann Grace of Pelham,
N.H., asked whether unsolicited loan checks might also violate
federal law.
</P>
<P>
   She had just received a $5,000 loan check from Fleet Bank, and
said she was ``beyond furious'' because she sees these checks as
gimmicks that prey on the financial vulnerable. (People get instant
cash by depositing them in any bank, then get a coupon book later
to repay the loan.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's crazy,'' she said. ``It gets people into
financial trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   While he can understand consumer concerns, Anthony Ricko, head
of compliance with the Federal Reserve Bank in Boston, said the
loan checks are considered legal as long as the solicitation states
in ``clear and conspicuous'' language its financial terms, such as
the annual percentage rate and payment rules. He said the rules
prohibiting unsolicited credit cards in the mail do not apply to
loan checks.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Deirdre Cummings, consumer program director for the
Massachusetts Public Interest Research Group, said federal
regulations should be revised to ban these loan checks. She said
the regulations were written at a time when this marketing tactic
didn't exist.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The pork price was too fat &LR;  &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A 72-year-old Boxford man won a personal consumer victory in his
battle with the meat scales at the Stop &AMP; Shop in Danvers. He said
he was ``mad as a hornet'' after discovering that the 10 pounds of
pork loins he bought from the Stop &AMP; Shop in Danvers on July 31
actually weighed 33 percent less than the package indicated _ and
that he was overcharged.
</P>
<P>
   The man's complaint that day brought in Norman St. Hilaire,
Danvers' sealer of weights and measures. The inspector found that a
random selection of meat indicated the store's scales were off.
Most packages weighed 33 percent less than the store's price/weight
sticker indicated.
</P>
<P>
   After conducting an investigation, St. Hilaire concluded that
the meat workers were allowing a meat tray to come into contact
with the scale, causing what he called ``an accidental
overweighing.''
</P>
<P>
   Under a new law signed by Acting Governor Paul Cellucci last
month, portions of which go into effect in mid-November, inspectors
such as St. Hilaire would have the power to issue traffic
ticket-like fines to stores that are found with inaccurate scales.
</P>
<P>
   St. Hilaire said he subsequently conducted two surprise checks
of the scales last month and found them to be accurate. Regina
Harrington, Stop &AMP; Shop acting manager in Danvers, said the meat
scales were ``corrected immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the Boxford man, who asked to remain anonymos, he
demanded a full refund and wondered how many other consumers were
overcharged.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't know this unless you're a suspicious, cheap man
like me,'' he said.

THE NEW LOOK: FROM LUMPY TO FRUMPY
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   Here I am in a store dressing room trying on a gray pleated
skirt that falls almost to my ankles. The effect is strange.
</P>
<P>
   I'm reminded of one of those crocheted toilet-paper holders, the
kind with the doll torso in the middle and a huge skirt sticking
out horizontally all around. I brace myself for the rear reflection
in the three-way mirror. I look like I'm trying to bring back the
farthingale.
</P>
<P>
   This season fashion is giving us longer skirts, baggy tops, flat
shoes. I was thrilled when I first heard the news. ``The frumpy
look is in!'' I thought. I always knew (I told myself) that if I
waited long enough, fashion would double back and meet me halfway.
What a fool I am. Why do I bother? Why not just wear sackcloth and
ashes? Actually, this season no one would notice the difference if
I did just that. That's how ugly these new clothes are.
</P>
<P>
   The arbiters of fashion don't call the new look ``frumpy.''
Depending upon which magazine you read, it's ``sumptuous,''
``luxe,'' ``voluminous,'' ``carefree,'' ``comfortable,''
``insouciant,'' ``body-skimming,'' ``dressed down,'' ``relaxed,''
even ``chunky.'' But never ``frumpy.'' It doesn't sell.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's no denying that's what I look like in this skirt.
Frumpy. Actually, much worse than frumpy. Dumpy. Frumpy and Dumpy,
the eighth and ninth dwarfs could have been hiding out just below
my waistline, judging by my reflection in the mirror. Hips are my
problem, but when are they not? To wear the new longer skirts it
helps to have no hips. For that matter, to wear the old shorter
skirts it helps to have no hips. Let's face it, to wear anything at
all, it helps to have no hips.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, the new longer, fuller skirts should hide all
those unsightly lumps. But, as every woman knows, when it comes to
fashion, there's a chasm between theory and practice. Someone like
me, who'd hoped to send her hips into hibernation under longer
skirts, may find the style only emphasizes the breadth of her
bottom. Flat shoes, de rigeur with the new length, don't help.
</P>
<P>
   There are certain advantages to wearing long skirts. They're
warmer. You don't have to shave your legs so often. Stockings or
pantyhose aren't an absolute must. On the minus side, you run the
risk of tripping on the hem and killing yourself. But the biggest
drawback of all to the new long skirts is that you have to buy
them. And then you have to buy all the other new stuff that goes
with them.
</P>
<P>
   Gray is this season's color. In the stores, ranks of gray
garments dominate. Every shade of gray. Dove gray. Gunmetal gray.
Masterpiece Theatre governess gray. Charcoal gray. Granite gray.
Airstream gray. Russian Blue gray. Gray is the new black. Or maybe
it's the new brown, because brown was the new black last year.
</P>
<P>
   What's the fascination with gray? Fashion has decreed that gray
is the must-have color, probably because consumers don't have
anything gray in their closets. In her book, ``The Language of
Clothes,'' Alison Lurie observes that gray clothing can ``suggest
that one is mysterious, ambiguous, puzzling.'' Maybe gray reflects
the New Ambiguity, which seems to be our national mood these days.
</P>
<P>
   I am in the dressing room again, hiding in a huge,
hip-concealing mottled-gray sweater, an alleged bargain at $280.
``Gray is a hard color to wear,'' the saleswoman says.
</P>
<P>
   She stares at my face intently. ``You need to adjust your
makeup,'' she says. ``Go brighter.''
</P>
<P>
   It comes as a relief to know that I'm not bright enough to wear
this hideous, overpriced sweater. (Memo to self: Stop reading
fashion magazines. It only confuses you.)

TOMCAT IN LOVE 
By Tim O'Brien. Broadway Books. 347 pp. $26. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Thomas Henry Chippering is the kind of smooth talker who
politely asks you a question about yourself, then interrupts 30
seconds in to tell you his life story. His intellect is vast but
untamed and deluded; his self-image waffles between grandiosity and
whiny despair. He stands 6 feet 6 inches and, at age 49, has
achieved the status of full professor of linguistics, but neither
dimension has helped him to stand tall in his own life. The tics
and neuroses that sustain him are considerable. Each morning he
shaves all over (``Thomas H. Chippering, a la buff, is a sight not
soon forgotten,'' he informs us); he enjoys waxing semiotic about
almost everything, and he thinks of women as either delectable
takeout items or predators (one of his seminars is entitled
``Methodologies of Misogyny''). Oh, and he's a war hero, at least
on paper. During a year in Vietnam in 1969, his job was to process
citations for valor in action _ and by the end of his tour, he had
himself a Silver Star.
</P>
<P>
   A comic-obsessive, in other words, and Tim O'Brien's answer to
Humbert Humbert, mad and talented and loathsome and sometimes
demonically engaging. As the increasingly unreliable narrator of
``Tomcat in Love,'' Chippering has the challenging task of
remaining compelling (as a voice, anyway) throughout the story of
his own foibles and noisome acts. In large part he fulfills that
promise, if for no other reason than O'Brien's singular ability to
scan for truth on the most pocked horizon. The author has also
distanced himself from Chippering enough to make our antihero
bombastic and even ludicrous, revealing the gritty insights of this
novel by the professor's error rather than example.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of most of his wayward acts lies Chippering's love
for Lorna Sue, his childhood sweetheart and recently divorced wife
who has remarried and moved to Tampa. Through the (allegedly)
cuckolded voice that opens this tale, we start to gather the shards
of anguish that have led to his demise: the young love that began
in Owago, Minn., in the 1950s; the looney Zylstra family that
spawned both Lorna Sue and her zealously protective brother,
Herbie; the shadowy hint of church burnings and other early
violence that underscore what Chippering might call the pathology
of attachment. There's also that tour of duty in Vietnam, which is
woven throughout the novel with coy but successful manipulation: We
will bear Chippering's insufferable rationales for as long as we
must, if only to find out what happened three decades ago at a
firebase in Quang Ngai.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the narrative genius of Tim O'Brien, who told us how to
tell a true war story with his 1990 work, ``The Things They
Carried.'' ``Tomcat in Love'' bears hints of this mastery _ nobody
but O'Brien could have written some of the opening vortexes about
passion and meaning _ but the novel hasn't the depth or stylistic
beauty of ``The Things They Carried,'' or even the spooky range of
his last novel, ``The Lake in the Woods.'' It's an eminently
readable novel (Chippering's carefully chronicled descent into
mayhem ensures that), but a disturbing one, even when it's meant to
be funny. O'Brien's humor is often a manic, knife-at-the-throat
humor, and it's a little like listening to Lenny Bruce in his last
years. Worse is the occasional feeling of contrivance in the
authorial distance between O'Brien and his character. One minute
Chippering is being mercilessly lampooned, then he starts fondling
an undergraduate during office hours, and you feel you're reading
soft porn over his shoulder. The creative compassion is just a
little too close.
</P>
<P>
   So: Thomas Chippering, c'est moi, and all that. ``Tomcat in
Love'' does succeed in getting to you: O'Brien knows cold the
spiraling insularity of obsession, and he drives home the
universality of an unhinged heart with a long footnote, or literary
aside, from Chippering to a fictional second-person (and female)
reader. If a middle-aged, love-starved lech can go to such lengths
to wreak vengeance on an old flame _ well, watch out, honey, and
don't take the high road just yet. It could, and may, happen to
you.
</P>
<P>
   This stance waffles between structural finery and tiresome high
jinks; even as I admired O'Brien's highwire acts, I grew
exasperated with the indulgences visited upon Chippering, whose
speculations about language and symbolism too soon become an
embarrassment of riches. His voice is perfectly modulated, roaming
the nightlands between love and madness, but the women who cavort
into his path are cardboard creations _ either perky young vultures
with ponytails or Viking earth-moms with firm mattresses and hot
oatmeal. They exist, in other words, to serve Chippering, or rather
to serve O'Brien's plot advancement of our modern anti-hero's
tilting at windmills. Even Lorna Sue, the ice queen at the end of
the journey, is more fantasy than fact, poised between reptilian
gloom and the sum of her own pathologies. Within the guise of
paranoid slapstick, which ``Tomcat in Love'' often suggests, this
is probably acceptable, but not very enticing.
</P>
<P>
   What Chippering and his creator share is an admiration for ``the
looping circuitry of a well-told tale,'' and here ``Tomcat in
Love'' follows the narrative mountain path that O'Brien has claimed
as his home terrain. Roaming between Minnesota in the 1950s and the
jungles of Vietnam, between a broken man's efforts at vengeance and
the unsullied memories that preceded them, Chippering's confession
propels you, even unwillingly, into its comi-tragic darkness. This
momentum is achieved not by empathic concern or even suspense (the
story's giveaway is fairly obvious, 50 pages in) but by the
splendidly controlled orator who holds us captive. Thomas
Chippering may be ``imperious, vain, cruel, thoughtless, pious,
glacial, sullen, short-tempered, narcissistic, sarcastic, callous,
unfaithful, and unloving'' _ all of which he calls Lorna Sue _ but
he is wickedly realized. The agility and intelligence that created
this pathos-ridden romantic make one marvel at Tim O'Brien's gifts,
even as you roll your eyes at his excesses.

 By MICHAEL KENNEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``A constitutional crisis is one of the less-desirable methods
of promoting a novel,'' says novelist Richard North Patterson with
only the slightest hint of displeasure.
</P>
<P>
   So far _ at least _ Patterson's publisher isn't using the
independent prosecutor's report on the Clinton-Lewinsky affair to
promote ``No Safe Place,'' but it wouldn't be much of a reach.
</P>
<P>
   In the just-published novel, a young senator is challenging the
incumbent vice president in the year 2000 California presidential
primary. In the final week of the campaign, a newsmagazine learns
that, several years before, the then-married senator had an affair
with a young reporter. By an unfortunate chance, she has now been
assigned to cover the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Although the main action takes place in California, the book
opens with a series of shootings at a Boston abortion clinic and
includes a romantic tryst on Martha's Vineyard (where Patterson has
a summer house).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather not have the constitutional crisis,'' said
Patterson while in Boston this month, ``but seeing that we are in
this situation, I'm glad I wrote it.''
</P>
<P>
   Published by Knopf barely two weeks ago, the novel landed in the
No.10 spot on yesterday's New York Times bestseller list and is
expected to climb to No.5 on next Sunday's list, with 400,000
copies already in print.
</P>
<P>
   ``No Safe Place'' is Patterson's ninth novel, but a departure
from his trademark legal thrillers.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson is a laid-back 51, well-tanned after a summer on the
Vineyard, where the embattled President Clinton also summers.
During his Vineyard stay, Clinton received a copy of Patterson's
book from a mutual friend.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson turned to writing some 20 years ago to escape from the
too-many-nights-away grind as a securities lawyer in Birmingham,
Ala. Home after his third business trip in a week, he roughed out a
legal thriller that was published as ``The Lasko Tangent,'' winning
the Edgar award as the best first suspense novel in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   But when his fourth novel, ``Private Screening,'' in 1985 turned
out to be a publishing disappointment, Patterson went back to
lawyering.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years later, transplanted to San Francisco, he took up
writing again, partly as a matter of pride, he says. And with a new
publisher, Knopf, the result, ``Degree of Guilt,'' was a solid
success, with a first printing of 250,000 copies _ 241,500 more,
Patterson joked at the time, than any of his four previous books.
</P>
<P>
   But after a string of successes with legal thrillers in the John
Grisham and Scott Turow mode _ most recently ``Silent Witness'' in
1997 _ Patterson decided to try a political thriller, using as a
model ``Advise and Consent,'' the classic political novel by the
late Allen Drury.
</P>
<P>
   It was to be about ``politics in the post-Clinton era,''
Patterson said _ not realizing that what he thought would be the
``post-Clinton'' era in which ``everybody will know everything''
may already have arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson researched ``No Safe Place'' as the latest political
era was dawning. Former President George Bush had written to
Patterson after reading ``Degree of Guilt,'' and Patterson traded
on that to ask his help.
</P>
<P>
   Bush not only invited Patterson _ with his wife, Laurie
Anderson, and their 4-year-old son, Chase _ for a weekend at Bush's
summer home in Kennebunkport, Maine, but introduced the author to
Republican political insiders such as Ron Kaufman. Through Kaufman
and others, Patterson attended the 1996 GOP national convention and
spent several days traveling with Bob Dole's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually,'' he laughed, ``my Democratic friends said, `Hey,
time for some equal time here.'''
</P>
<P>
   Patterson is already well into his next book. It will be set in
his native Midwest _ he grew up around Cleveland and got his law
degree at Case Western University there _ and involves a group of
powerful developers trying to build a baseball park in an
inner-city neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson has talked with developers, economists, proponents,
and opponents of ballpark projects. Maybe more to the point, he
said, ``We've had three grisly ballpark fights in San Francisco.''

REPORT SAYS LEWINSKY SOUGHT `DREAM JOB' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER
 &HT;    c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the end, when all that remained of their secret
affair were memories of steamy phone calls and hushed rendezvous
near the Oval Office, Monica S. Lewinsky is said to have insisted
President Clinton grant her a final wish as consolation: her
``dream'' job in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, allegedly wary of a jilted paramour revealing their
potentially explosive affair, enlisted officials at the highest
levels of government and a trusted personal adviser, Vernon Jordan,
to meet the former White House intern's requests, according to
independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr's report.
</P>
<P>
   To Starr, the effort constitutes obstruction of justice, a
possibly impeachable offense.
</P>
<P>
   But to Lewinsky, the job search was something the president owed
her, and it never seemed to be enough. Even as Clinton prepared for
a summit last November with Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo,
Lewinsky sent Clinton a note by courier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a moron,'' she wrote. ``I know that what is going on
in the world takes precedence, but I don't think what I have asked
you for is unreasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``This is so hard for me. ... I need you right now
not as president, but as a man. PLEASE be my friend.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the public attention to their alleged sexual dalliances,
Clinton and Lewinsky exhausted much of their time together, in
personal encounters and dozens of phone calls, focusing on
Lewinsky's employment status, which gradually deteriorated with
their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Yet through it all, Clinton allegedly played an active role in
trying to keep Lewinsky happy, an extraordinary distraction for a
chief executive on behalf of an entry-level worker.
</P>
<P>
   The effort could smack of sexual harassment if Lewinsky, by her
own testimony and correspondence, were not so aggressive in
launching the relationship and trying to sustain it.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's workplace woes began not long ago after her affair
with Clinton began in November 1995. She had ascended from an
internship to a paid position dealing with correspondence in the
White House office of legislative affairs the same month.
</P>
<P>
   But by April 1996, as complaints from the Secret Service about
her frequent visits to the Oval Office created suspicions among
senior staffers about her relationship with Clinton, Lewinsky was
transferred to the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   When Lewinsky informed him of her transfer on Easter Sunday, the
president became upset, according to Starr's report.
</P>
<P>
   The report alleges that Clinton told Lewinsky she could have a
job on his 1996 campaign if she did not like the Pentagon job, then
any position she wanted after the election.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter that Lewinsky never sent, Starr's report said, she
wrote to Clinton: ``I was so sure that the weekend after the
election you would call me to come visit and you would kiss me
passionately and tell me you couldn't wait to have me back. You'd
ask me where I wanted to work and say something akin to `Consider
it done,' and it would be.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton allegedly had no physical contact with Lewinsky for
nearly a year, but he repeatedly called at her home. And she
testified that she told him before and after several episodes of
phone sex that she hated her Pentagon job.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the runup to their last alleged sexual encounter in
March 1997, Lewinsky pressed Clinton for a White House job. And he
allegedly dispatched several staffers to work on it. According to
Clinton's secretary, Betty Currie, the president ``was pushing us
hard.'' She testified it was the only time he instructed her to try
to get someone a White House job.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Currie and other aides resisted. And on July 3, 1997,
Lewinsky sent him a note that chastised him for breaking his
promise to get her a White House job and, for the first time,
``obliquely threatened to disclose their relationship,'' according
to Starr's report.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton testified he took the threat seriously.
</P>
<P>
   By last September, Lewinsky was asking Clinton for work at the
United Nations in New York. Currie quoted Clinton as saying: ``Oh,
that's no problem. We can place her in the UN like that.'' UN
Ambassador Bill Richardson interviewed Lewinsky at her Watergate
apartment, and he offered her a job in October.
</P>
<P>
   But Lewinsky rejected the idea, gave Clinton a wish list of
public-relations firms she hoped to join in New York, and suggested
he recruit Jordan, a Washington power broker, to help.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky showed Jordan the wish list several days later. ``Mr.
Jordan said that he had spoken with the President about her and
that she came `highly recommended,''' according to Starr's report.
``Concerning her job search, Mr. Jordan said: `We're in
business.'''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan arranged interviews with Lewinsky at three companies in
New York. And Jordan, who has said publicly that he was helping
Lewinsky as he had many other young people, kept Clinton updated on
her progress. She interviewed at two firms Dec. 18, but the next
day she received a subpoena to testify in Paula Jones's lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's legal woes soon multiplied. And a new job never again
seemed to be a top priority.

POLITICAL FAULT LINES SHIFT AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It changed when the farmers, landowners,
shopkeepers, and dreamers rebelled against their British rulers. It
changed when it dedicated itself to social justice during the Civil
War and, again, during the civil rights movement. It changed when
it grasped for economic justice during the Great Depression and the
New Deal. And it changed when it confronted grave constitutional
questions during the Watergate scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the long-awaited, long-dreaded _ and notably lurid _
report by independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr finally available on
both Capitol Hill and in every living room in the land, with the
wheels of impeachment ready to be set in motion, America is
changing again.
</P>
<P>
   Of these latest alterations, many will be stark, some will be
subtle. Many are utterly predictable, some wildly not. But a number
of them are already apparent _ even amid the frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   The changes involve the relationship between the Democrats and
the Republicans, as well as what we expect of a president. The
rules for judging character are being rewritten. So, too, the rules
governing just how far we will allow our leaders to stray from what
most of the body politic believes is right. Changed, too, is how
and how much the populace will be told about the underside of
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of how the great capital drama turns out _ will
Congress rise to the institutional challenge, will President
Clinton survive, will the Republicans increase their majorities in
the House and Senate _ the scandal is bound to be a political and
cultural touchstone, a marker in America's story, an episode, like
Watergate, where the rhythms of national life, and, certainly
national political life, are altered.
</P>
<P>
   True, a sex scandal may not seem as momentous as war and
revolution. But watch for the terrain to shift along these lines:
</P>
<P>
   The nature of partisanship. &UR;  &LR; In political folklore, the
Watergate years that culminated in the resignation of President
Nixon were an era of wild, strident partisanship. It is true that
Nixon inspired unusual passion from his critics, but the Watergate
period was in many ways much less partisan than this decade, when
members of Congress have grown far more partisan even as the public
has grown far less so.
</P>
<P>
   Now this faction-riven Congress faces its ultimate test: Can it
approach the impeachment question with dispassion and
nonpartisanship? Even the president's most virulent critics in the
GOP acknowledge that they cannot permit the House decision on
whether to impeach the president to appear partisan. This episode
has the potential of ripping apart an already divided Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The role of the presidency. &UR;  &LR; More than in any other democratic
nation, the president is the central figure in American national
life. Clinton Rossiter, the presidential scholar, called him ``the
one-man distillation of the American people,'' a notion Democratic
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman cited when he delivered his reproach to
Clinton on the Senate floor Sept. 3.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of American influence abroad, the growth of the
federal government, and the growth of the mass media all have
served to enhance the presidency in the 20th century. Now that the
most intimate details of the private sexual comportment of the
president have been made public, there is danger that the office
itself, so often put on a pedestal by Americans, may tumble to
earth.
</P>
<P>
   Edmund Burke called society the ``decent drapery of life,'' and
even in our time it has been a leader's responsibility to keep that
drapery on. Now that the whole world has a mental image of the
president undraped, there is the real possibility that the
presidency might shed some of its mystery and, along with it, its
power.
</P>
<P>
   The endurance of elections. &UR;  &LR; Americans elected Clinton to the
White House not once but twice, the first time after he had
acknowledged, in a celebrated television interview, that his
marriage had not been perfect. His wandering eye, moreover, has
been a staple of late-night television comedians for years.
</P>
<P>
   Now Congress is contemplating starting the impeachment process,
which finishes with a trial in the Senate and a vote on the
president's survival. Implicit in that process is the premature
ending of a president's term. Democrats and some Republicans
already are having second thoughts about that, arguing that a
legislative process such as impeachment should be averted except in
the most extreme examples of presidential misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of this argument will determine whether we, as a
country, are ready to allow the findings of an independent counsel
to remove from office a president who was put there by the votes of
millions of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The question of character. &UR;  &LR; The great unresolved question in
American civic life is the relationship between private conduct and
public character. It wasn't resolved in 1987, when Gary Hart, the
former Democratic senator from Colorado, was forced to abandon his
presidential campaign after reporters staked out a condominium
where he visited with a young model. Nor was it resolved in 1991,
when Clinton, in a breakfast with Washington reporters, sought to
ameliorate his reputation as a womanizer.
</P>
<P>
   Now the question, which has been a flashpoint in various
campaigns, will get its full airing in relation to a sitting
president whose policies are immensely popular with the public. In
philosophy and literature, the connection between the private and
the public may have a poetic appeal. In political science, we may
find it does not.
</P>
<P>
   The wiring of politics. &UR;  &LR; On Friday, for the first time ever, an
important document of state was available to the general public at
the very same instant it was provided to the press. In Watergate
and Iran-Contra, the last two big Washington scandals, important
reports were provided to reporters who, in turn, prepared their
summaries and, in a few cases, reprinted edited excerpts.
</P>
<P>
   Not this time. The Starr report flew onto the Internet, and
though there were monumental inconveniences, any American who
wanted to see what reporters were seeing had a chance to do so. In
the past, the press played a mediating role between the public and
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Now a citizen may feel less need for the filter that reporters
and editors provide. Or, depending on one's experience in trying to
download a huge government document and then synthesizing the
material, there might be new appreciation for journalists.
</P>

   The Clinton scandals have convulsed Washington and mostly bored
the rest of the country, a vivid display of the distance between
the capital and the people.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, politics is the leading industry, if you don't
count punditry. In the rest of the country, it is only one of many
conversation topics, and almost certainly not as compelling as Mark
McGwire or the new advances in gender selection or the effort to
move the killer whale or even the beginning of the school year.
</P>
<P>
   But, as summer ends, a Washington obsession has become a
constitutional crisis. The furor may be a test of Clinton, or of
the Congress, or of the special-prosecutor law, but it is also a
test of the public's interest in what used to be called public
affairs.

AT 67, SHE HASN'T GIVEN UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX

<TEXT>
<P>
   Former astronaut Jerrie Cobb didn't know her friend Sen. John
Glenn was going back into space until March, when she returned to
the United States to get her bush plane tuned up. ``We don't get
much news in the Amazon,'' she explains.
</P>
<P>
   The news gave her heart. Cobb hopes it may reopen a door that
slammed shut in 1962, when NASA cancelled its female astronaut
program. Cobb was the first female recruit or, as Time magazine
called her in 1960, ``the first astronautrix (measurements:
36-27-34).''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe there's hope for me to go up at the age of 67,'' Cobb
said last week before returning to her life's work _ flying
medicines, seeds, and supplies to indigenous Amazon tribes. ``You
never give up a dream. In the back of my mind, I always felt it was
my destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Even a discouraging meeting last week with NASA administrator
Daniel S. Goldin has not deterred her. ``He was very gracious,''
she reports. ``But the answer was a very definite no. But that
doesn't mean I'm going to give up.''
</P>
<P>
   Cobb has impressive support: the National Organization of Women,
American Association of University Women, women pilots' groups,
senators and congressmen, former Apollo astronaut Buzz Aldrin,
21,000 citizens who have signed petitions to NASA.
</P>
<P>
   Her qualifications have never been in doubt. When NASA recruited
her in 1959, she had logged twice as many flight hours as John
Glenn and set four world aviation records for speed, distance, and
altitude. She had passed astronaut screening tests and recruited 25
other women for the program when NASA appointed her a
``consultant'' and cancelled the program.
</P>
<P>
   A congressional hearing on the cancellation went well the first
two days, but then John Glenn and fellow astronaut Scott Carpenter
took the stand. ``The men go off and fight the wars and fly the
airplanes and come back and help design and build and test them,''
Glenn testified. ``The fact that women are not in this field is a
fact of our social order.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Glenn's testimony effectively killed Cobb's chances
of following him into space, she still considers him ``a friend of
mine.'' She recently appealed to him for support (so far without a
response) in her campaign to follow him this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we can learn anything from sending any one
person up,'' Cobb says. ``And face it, most older people are women
anyway. It would make better sense and better science to send a
woman up.''

HEY, TEACHER, WATCH WHAT YOU SAY! 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the school year begins, forgive teachers if they have their
minds on the courtroom instead of the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Around the country, recent legal rulings have had a chilling
effect on teachers' ability to speak freely to their students.
</P>
<P>
   There is always a tension between school boards' and
administators' need, on the one hand, to set the curriculum and, on
the other, teachers' ability to chose the method they find best to
make a point, answer a question, or illuminate a world. But now,
many teachers and education specialists say several recent court
decisions increase that tension by stifling innovative classroom
efforts at a time when a national debate on the quality of our
schools _ and their need to be more creative _ is being waged.
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina, for example, a high school drama teacher was
transferred after producing a play in which one character is a
lesbian and another is pregnant out of wedlock; in St. Louis, a
high school writing teacher was fired for letting students write
and perform plays laced with expletives; and in Colorado, a high
school teacher was fired for showing his class Bernardo
Bertolucci's film ``1900.''
</P>
<P>
   In each case, the most recent decisions _ including two of them
in federal appelate courts _ have gone against the teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``At bottom is a question about what kind of teachers we want _
those who are confident and experimental, or those who avoid
anything that could conceivably offend,'' says Jay Heubert,
associate professor of education at Teachers College at Columbia
University, and an adjunct professor of law. ``If we are looking
for dynamic teachers, we can't expect them to act like sheep. There
just aren't too many dynamic sheep around.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, there is no US Supreme Court decision that
clearly defines the free speech rights of teachers in the
classroom, but that may change soon. The high court could decide as
early as next month whether to take the case of Peggy Boring, the
North Carolina drama teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Boring's situation: She was the drama teacher at the
Charles D. Owen High School in Asheville, when, in fall 1991, she
selected the play ``Independence'' by Lee Blessing for four
advanced students to perform in a statewide competition. The play
centers on a dysfunctional, single-parent family _ a divorced
mother and her three daughters, of which one is a lesbian and one
pregnant out of wedlock.
</P>
<P>
   The school had a policy that generally required advance parental
approval before ``controversial materials'' were used. Boring
sought and received parental consent and notified the principal
that the group would perform ``Independence.''
</P>
<P>
   The play won 17 of a possible 21 regional awards, but when it
was performed in front of an English class (where consent forms had
been previously distributed) at the student actors' own school, a
parent complained to principal Fred Ivey. After reading the play,
Ivey said the group could not perform it. The parents of the four
students pleaded with Ivey and he agreed the play could be
performed in the finals. It won second place. But, at the end of
year, Boring was transferred to a junior high school.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy erupted into the local newspaper. A group of
ministers took out an advertisement condemning the selection of the
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was dumbfounded,'' Boring says, ``I felt I had followed what
I thought was a judicious and prudent process. ... I lived in the
community for years and they had dealt with me for years _ and then
to claim I am immoral and corrupting students.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Buncombe County Board of Education upheld her transfer,
Boring sued, lost, appealed, and eventually had the lower court
overturned. Then the school board appealed and won, both before a
panel of three judges from the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth
Circuit, and in a 7-to-6 decision before the full circuit, located
in Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is so important for teachers and that is why I am
perservering in this,'' Boring said. ``I know what it is like to be
a pariah. You hear among colleagues that they are afraid to do
anything. Certainly, it is better to err on the side of safety than
controversy, but if you draw the line too far on the side of
safety, you end up with materials that are not conducive to
discussion or abstract thinking skills.''
</P>
<P>
   In St. Louis, veteran teacher Cecilia Lacks was fired for
permitting students to use profanities in creative writing
assignments. She went to court and won, but the school district
appealed to US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, which
reversed the decision and dismissed the case in June, saying, ``A
school district does not violate the First Amendment when it
disciplines a teacher for allowing students to use profanity
repetitiously and egregiously in their written work.''
</P>
<P>
   Lacks argued that she thought the ``no profanity'' policy in the
school applied to student conversations, not graded work. And to
restrict the students' writing would run counter to the district's
teaching style, she argued. Indeed, according to court documents,
``The Ferguson-Florissant District serves as a national center for
the dissemination of literature supporting the `student-centered'
method, which admonishes teachers to avoid stifling students'
natural voices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guidelines distributed to teachers by the district stated:
`Don't tell writers what should be in their (creative) writing or
worse, write on their pieces. ... Resist making judgments about the
writing.'''
</P>
<P>
   Lacks, who is white, in a school where most of her students, the
principal, and the assistant superintendent are black, claims she
also was a victim of racial discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The Appeals Court, however, found that the ``no profanity''
policy did not have an exemption for creative writing, and Lacks
could be fired.

 UNDATED: ... could be fired.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lacks is appealing the ruling to the full Eighth Circuit Court.
</P>
<P>
   Because there is no Supreme Court decision on the free speech
rights of teachers in classrooms, says Heubert, ``lower courts have
been trying to interpret what the First Amendment means in the
classroom.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, they are relying on a 1988 Supreme Court
decision that addressed the issue of students' free speech rights
in school. The court found that the Hazelwood School District in
Missouri acted appropriately in censoring two articles from a
student newspaper which nevertheless had a front-page disclaimer
saying the articles reflected the opinion of students and not the
school.
</P>
<P>
   But the high court, in a 5-to-3 decision, found that the
newspaper could be perceived to ``bear the imprimatur of the
school'' and administrators could act to regulate student speech,
``so long as their actions are reasonably related to legitimate
pedagogical concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Boring case, the majority of the Fourth Circuit Court
found that any decision by school officials that relates to the
curriculum ``is by definition a legitimate pedagogical concern.''
</P>
<P>
   State courts are also coming down hard against teachers who
stray from the strict confines of their curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado, the state's highest court in June reversed an
appeals court decision and, by a 4-to-3 margin, found that Alfred
Wilder could be fired for showing ``1900'' to his logic and debate
class of 17- and 18-year-olds in spring 1995. The 1976 film, at 255
minutes long, covers 45 (according to court documents) years of
life and social conflict in the Emilia region of Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The majority found that Wilder was required to obtain approval
before showing the film ``due to its controversial matter ...
extensive nudity, oral sex, masturbation, profanity, cocaine abuse,
and graphic violence.'' The dissenting opinion called Wilder's
firing ``arbitrary, capricious, and legally impermissible.'' As to
the film, the minority found it ``generational, epic, artful.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilder, out of his teaching job and living in New Hampshire, has
yet to appeal further.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Edwin Delattre, a member of the state Board of Education and
dean of the Boston University School of Education, says teachers
should expect oversight of their classrooms and their methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any sound school department draws teachers to a conception
that they have a place in a community of learners, where if you go
on your own, or pander to students, you will make a buffoon of
yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Academic freedom and the First Amendment does not protect
people from unprofessional behavior. The field is replete with
high-quality materials that can be used, and you don't have to be
on the borderline and inflame. Why do things that distract when you
have so much material that doesn't?''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of what teachers can do in the classroom has hit close
to home.
</P>
<P>
   Toby Kling Ward, a high school teacher in Belmont, was not given
tenure after she engaged biology students in a discussion about the
abortion of fetusus that had been diagnosed with Down syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1993 decision, the US Court of Appeals for the First
Circuit found that teachers could have their speech restricted if
it related to pedagogical concerns _ as in the Hazelwood case about
students' rights. But the court, which is located in Boston, found
that Hazelwood must be viewed considering the students' age and
sophistication, the context and manner of the presentation, and a
teacher must be given notice of what conduct is prohibited.
Teachers cannot be punished by the school board for ``speech that
it never prohibited. ... Few subjects lack controversy. If teachers
fear retaliation for every utterance, they will fear teaching,''
the court said.
</P>
<P>
   That ruling stands in stark contrast to the Boring case, where
the appeals court took a much narrower approach to what is allowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be very wise for teachers, administrators, school
boards, and even communitities to discuss the question'' of
teachers' free speech rights, says Heubert.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be an appropriate topic for collective bargaining
because it bears very heavily on what teachers can and cannot do.
Teachers are walking around not knowing what they can say and what
they can't, and the uncertainty is educationally
counterproductive.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of the few recent rulings that supported the rights of
teachers, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled in 1996
that Joyce T. Hosford was unfairly suspended by Sandwich school
officials and not rehired because she explained the meanings of
certain vulgarities.
</P>
<P>
   Hosford, then a special-needs teacher of seventh-graders, was
talking about idioms and words with double meanings when a student
asked about certain swear words. She gave their definitions and
admonished the students not to use them.
</P>
<P>
   In a decision by Charles Fried, the SJC found, ``that the
discussion she led was designed precisely to bring out into the
open the reasons why such language is immature and inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Hosford, now working elsewhere as a speech pathologist, says,
``The fact that I was really quite sure that what I had done was
appropriate, given the students and the situation, doesn't mean I
didn't second-guess myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fear that it instills can really limit your ability to
deal well in a classroom situation,'' Hosford says. ``Teachers are
on the front lines in the classroom every day and you never know
what is going to come up. If you can't address it in a
constructive, educational way because you afraid, then you are
doing a disservice to the students.''

HIS MORAL AUTHORITY IS GONE _ HE SHOULD BE, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   First came the cagey nondenial denials (``There is not a sexual
relationship''). Then came the blunt falsehoods (``I did not have
sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinski''). After that, the
long months of evasion (``This investigation is going on. And ... I
just think as long as it's going on, I should not comment on the
specific questions''), coupled with the aggrieved appeals for
sympathy (``I'm the only guy in the history of the country they've
spent $40 million investigating.'')
</P>
<P>
   At the end of July there was jaunty bravado (``I am looking
forward to the opportunity, in the next few days, of testifying'').
On Aug. 17 came the surly, grudging confession (``I did have a
relationship with Miss Lewinsky that was not appropriate. ... It's
nobody's business but ours.'') All the while, a noisy chorus
supplied a drumbeat of accusation (``this vast right-wing
conspiracy that has been conspiring against my husband'') and
character-assassination (``Mr. Starr ... is a sex-obsessed person
who's out to get the president'').
</P>
<P>
   Only now _ when his repertoire of verbal acrobatics is
exhausted, when his ingratiating manner and lawyerly smoothness
have failed, for once, to charm the public into indulging him yet
again _ are there unadorned apologies. Only now, when nothing else
has worked, does the president plead for forgiveness. Only now is
he sorry.
</P>
<P>
   But sorry in Bill Clinton is like sorry in a wife-beater. Today
he shows contrition and humbleness, tomorrow he hurts her again.
How many more times is Clinton going to be allowed to hurt the
public that put him in the White House?
</P>
<P>
   The president's supporters have argued from the outset that his
sexual indiscipline is not a legitimate political issue. Voters
knew about his zipper problem and elected him anyway. Titillating
details aside, they demand, what does the independent counsel's
report tell us about him that we didn't already know?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: It tells us just how far gone in degeneracy _ sexual,
ethical, and legal _ this president is. It tells us that the
Lewinski scandal is not about a zipper problem. It is about a
recklessness problem. An exploitation problem. A dishonesty
problem. A degradation problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's agree that adultery ought not automatically disqualify a
person from seeking high public office,'' writes Bill Bennett in
``The Death of Outrage'' (Free Press), an eloquent new book on the
sophistry of Clinton's defenders. ``But let's agree, too, that at
some point adultery will often reveal to us something important
about a person's (and a president's) character and judgment; his
prudence and judiciousness; his honor and trustworthiness; his
governing ability and stability.''
</P>
<P>
   For one instant last week, Clinton's mask of contrition slipped,
revealing just how irremediable his corruption is. As part of his
apology offensive, he met with his Cabinet secretaries and asked to
be forgiven for having deceived them in January. But when Health
and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala disputed his implication
that policies and programs matter more than decency, the true
Clinton slipped out.
</P>
<P>
   ```She said''' _ this is from The Washington Post _ ```something
like, ``I can't believe that is what you're telling us, that is
what you believe, that you don't have an obligation to provide
moral leadership,''' one participant recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ```She said something like, ``I don't care about the lying, but
I'm appalled at the behavior.'' And frankly, he whacked her, let
her have it .... The president told Shalala that if her logic had
prevailed in 1960, Richard M. Nixon would have been elected
president instead of John F. Kennedy. ... After that, no other
Cabinet member had anything critical to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Such is the caliber of this president.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's report sets Clinton's antics with Lewinski in a context
of crimes and misdemeanors: perjury, obstruction of justice,
witness tampering, and so on. But the American people are not bound
by the terminology of the criminal code in judging their president.
When they voted for Clinton, it was on the understanding that he
had repented his sexual betrayals and would sin no more. A bargain
was struck; Clinton went on ``60 Minutes'' and promised, in
essence, that what he had done in the past he would not do in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   But he did do it in the future. And he did it not once, not
discreetly, but repeatedly and egregiously. In the Oval Office, no
less. With a 22-year-old intern, no less. This was no momentary
lapse. It was aggressive, reckless philandering _ exactly the
behavior he had sworn would never recur. Clinton's breach of faith
was not just with his family. He betrayed the nation, and disgraced
his office in the process.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people trusted Clinton. They believed him when he said
Gennifer Flowers was a liar. When he said Paula Jones was a liar.
When he said the Arkansas state troopers were liars. When he said
Kathleen Willey was a liar.
</P>
<P>
   But no one except his most purblind fans believed that Monica
Lewinski was a liar. She made it clear, finally, to all those who
had given him the benefit of every doubt: He was the liar, and had
been all along.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing Clinton says now _ certainly not his frantic apologies _
can restore his moral authority. The true nature of his character
is public knowledge. Everyone knows what history's verdict will be:
that he was a moral nihilist who couldn't be trusted, whose crudest
appetites led him into corruption and scandal, who became, in the
end, a national dirty joke.
</P>
<P>
   By his own contemptible deeds, not the least of which is the
vicious smearing of his critics, Clinton has forfeited the public's
trust. And when, in John Adams's words, that ``trust is insidiously
betrayed or wantonly trifled away, the people have a right to
revoke the authority that they themselves have deputed.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is unfit for office. All that remains to be decided is
the time and manner of his departure.

 By CARL ZIMMER 
 c.1998 Discover magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Justin Kalesto doesn't want to wake up. A woman is calling his
name, but he turns his head deeper into his pillow. He is 12 years
old, and from Mangbangau, a village deep in remote southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Justin's sunken abdomen curves inward like a bowl. His nostrils
are clogged with bacteria and dried mucus and the skin around his
closed eyes puffs out, giving him the face of a frog.
</P>
<P>
   Justin has become home for hundreds of thousands of whip-shaped
parasites called trypanosomes. They have fed on his blood and made
their way into his brain. Generally the human victim of such an
invasion sinks into an irritable haze, slips into a coma and dies.
Hence the name of the disease: sleeping sickness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know where you are?'' a woman asks in English, and a
Sudanese nurse translates. He nods and says, ``Tambura,'' the name
of the town where this hospital is located. The woman tries to bend
his head, but it's too stiff _ his entire back is rigid as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone comes in and you can't bend their head,'' the
woman says to the Sudanese men and women standing with her by the
cot, ``get a doctor immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Her name is Mickey Richer. She is a short 53-year-old woman with
a gray mop of hair, dressed in a T-shirt and pale-blue surgical
pants. She prescribes shots of steroids and says, ``OK, Justin, see
you later.'' He offers no response, not even a glance.
</P>
<P>
   There are 102 other patients at the Tambura County Hospital
being treated today for advanced sleeping sickness.
</P>
<P>
   Justin is one of an estimated 9,000 to 12,000 in Tambura County
who are sick with the disease _ 20 percent of the population. And
he is only one of perhaps hundreds of thousands who have become
infected recently in southern Sudan and its neighbors, the Central
African Republic and the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly
Zaire).
</P>
<P>
   Once considered a disease fading into oblivion, sleeping
sickness is raging again, particularly here. In all of southern
Sudan, Richer is running the only program to fight the disease, and
she is able to save only a handful of lives.
</P>
<P>
   Richer was already in her 40s when she began working in places
like Tambura.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted to do Third World work; that's why I went to
medical school,'' she says. ``I thought I'd be a pediatrician for
one or two years and then move on. I loved the kids so much I
stayed around for 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   She finally left her practice in Denver in 1987 to spend a year
in northern Sudan, working in a camp for refugees driven there by
recurrent famines.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward she went to the prestigious Liverpool School of
Tropical Medicine and then returned to Africa with the
International Medical Corps, a Los Angeles-based group of doctors
and nurses who bring medical care to places wrecked by war and
disaster, such as Angola, Bosnia and Burundi.
</P>
<P>
   When Richer first came to Tambura in 1994, she didn't know she
was landing in the middle of an epidemic. Her job was to resurrect
the county hospital, abandoned during the ongoing civil war. But it
didn't take Richer long to notice the parasites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a few people with sleeping sickness in 1994,'' she
remembers, ``and in 1995 I treated 19 patients.''
</P>
<P>
   The single-celled trypanosomes that cause sleeping sickness
spend their time cycling between humans and tsetse flies. They
linger in the gut of the fly, absorbing amino acids and other
molecules that the fly gets by biting mammals. After about 10 days
the trypanosomes move into the fly's salivary glands.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare for their new home, the parasites cloak themselves in
a coat made of millions of copies of a single sugary molecule.
</P>
<P>
   Our immune cells fashion antibodies that correspond to this
molecule's shape, and the antibodies enable the immune system to
kill the parasite in huge numbers.
</P>
<P>
   But some individual trypanosomes take evasive action. They shut
down the genes they use to build their coat and turn on a new set
in their place. They can then build a new surface molecule, one
similar enough to the old one to do the job but which no longer
matches the antibodies.
</P>
<P>
   Now invisible, the parasite thrives while the immune system
starts a new eradication campaign from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   But trypanosomes have hundreds of coat-coding genes that they
hold in reserve, and they can easily continue to slip away from the
body's attack. As they wear out the immune system, the parasites
feed on their host's blood.
</P>
<P>
   Months or years can pass before some of them cross the barrier
that protects the brain.
</P>
<P>
   When Richer came to Tambura, there hadn't been a major outbreak
of sleeping sickness since the late '70s, and at first she simply
dealt with cases as they came in. But the number steadily grew: The
19 patients she treated in 1995 became 87 the following year.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Richer estimated that in Tambura County, 20 percent of
the people were infected. Back in 1988, she calculated, the rate
had been no more than .5 percent. Over the course of nine years it
had multiplied 40 times.
</P>
<P>
   If a person tests positive for sleeping sickness, there is only
one way to know if the trypanosomes have reached the brain, and
that is to perform a spinal tap.
</P>
<P>
   If the patient is lucky, and no parasites are found in the
cerebrospinal fluid, he or she will be treated with a drug called
pentamidine. After 10 daily injections, most of them are cured.
</P>
<P>
   People with parasites in their cerebrospinal fluid have a much
harder future ahead of them. Pentamidine is useless for these
people. In their advanced condition they need stronger stuff _ a
nasty potion known as melarsoprol.
</P>
<P>
   Melarsoprol is, essentially, a poison. It is almost 20 percent
arsenic. If the melarsoprol should seep out of the vein, it kills
the surrounding tissue, creating a swollen, painful mass of flesh.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least the therapy has to be stopped for a few days,
and at worst the arm may have to be amputated.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Carsello, a nurse from San Francisco, has been teaching the
nurses at the hospital how to administer melarsoprol and deal with
its side effects.
</P>
<P>
   The adult patients bow their heads and clench their teeth as the
drug hits their veins. The screaming children have to be pinned
down.
</P>
<P>
   Melarsoprol works its cure quickly. However, it can cause
trouble quickly too. In a small fraction of patients such as Justin
Kalesto, the brain suddenly swells. Other patients come out of
their comas in a psychotic state.
</P>
<P>
   Richer and Carsello remember some of the nicer psychotics
fondly: the girl who danced through the yard all day, the boy who
escaped from the hospital, went to a compound where care workers
lived, took 21 empty yellow plastic jerricans and stacked them
meticulously next to his bed.
</P>
<P>
   ----
</P>
<P>
   The next day Justin is still alive. In fact, the swelling of his
head and neck has gone down, his nose is clean, and when Richer
comes to examine him he is propped on his elbows, slowly drinking
broth out of a bowl. He still doesn't want to smile or talk, but
Richer is glad to see he's better. It means he'll probably be
cured.
</P>
<P>
   Richer's original plan was to stop the epidemic by wiping out
the disease throughout Tambura County. It called for screening
every village, testing everybody in the ones hardest hit,
identifying the patients' stage of the disease, treating them and
following them up for two years to make sure they didn't relapse.
</P>
<P>
   The price tag came to $2.4 million for the first year.
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance at the U.S.
Administration for International Development agreed to come up with
money, but only $1 million _ enough to screen and treat 20,000
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government said, `I'm sorry, it's a million. You can find
and treat as many people as you can with a million, but that's it,
you're not getting any more,''' Richer says. ``I cried and fought
and yelled and screamed and kicked. I said to them, `God, how can I
pick which 20,000?'''
</P>
<P>
   According to Valerie Newson Guarnieri, senior regional team
leader for USAID's Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance, stopping
the outbreak was beyond their focus on primary health care in
southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal was to address the major causes of morbidity and
mortality, things like malaria, diarrhea, respiratory infections.
Sleeping sickness was not part of that strategy,'' she says. ``We
were willing to contribute to get the disease back down to endemic
levels, but we just don't have the resources to eradicate the
disease. We hoped our initial input would help bring other donors
to the table.'' It didn't.
</P>
<P>
   As of April, Richer's staff had screened more than 10,000
people, and they'd treated more than 1,500 of them. Only four
people out of 700 in the first stage of sleeping sickness died, and
20 out of 800 stage 2 patients. About 10 percent of stage 1
patients have relapsed, and 25 percent to 35 percent of stage 2
patients. Some of them can be treated with alternative drugs, but
others can't be helped.
</P>
<P>
   Richer has in fact managed to keep this corner of Tambura County
healthy, but she doesn't feel much sense of victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not deluding myself that by treating 1,500 patients we've
done anything with the epidemic. Probably not. There are probably
12,000 infected people out there, and still a lot of people left
for those tsetse flies to bite. But you've got to start
somewhere.''

   The single-celled trypanosomes that cause sleeping sickness
spend their time cycling between humans and tsetse flies. They
linger in the gut of the fly, absorbing amino acids and other
molecules that the fly gets by biting mammals. After about 10 days
the trypanosomes move into the fly's salivary glands.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare for their new home, the parasites cloak themselves in
a coat made of millions of copies of a single sugary molecule.
</P>
<P>
   Our immune cells fashion antibodies that correspond to this
molecule's shape, and the antibodies enable the immune system to
kill the parasite in huge numbers.
</P>
<P>
   But some individual trypanosomes take evasive action. They shut
down the genes they use to build their coat and turn on a new set
in their place. They can then build a new surface molecule, one
similar enough to the old one to do the job but which no longer
matches the antibodies.
</P>
<P>
   Now invisible, the parasite thrives while the immune system
starts a new eradication campaign from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   But trypanosomes have hundreds of coat-coding genes that they
hold in reserve, and they can easily continue to slip away from the
body's attack. As they wear out the immune system, the parasites
feed on their host's blood.
</P>
<P>
   Months or years can pass before some of them cross the barrier
that protects the brain.
</P>
<P>
   When Richer came to Tambura, there hadn't been a major outbreak
of sleeping sickness since the late '70s, and at first she simply
dealt with cases as they came in. But the number steadily grew: The
19 patients she treated in 1995 became 87 the following year.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Richer estimated that in Tambura County, 20 percent of
the people were infected. Back in 1988, she calculated, the rate
had been no more than .5 percent. Over the course of nine years it
had multiplied 40 times.
</P>
<P>
   If a person tests positive for sleeping sickness, there is only
one way to know if the trypanosomes have reached the brain, and
that is to perform a spinal tap.
</P>
<P>
   If the patient is lucky, and no parasites are found in the
cerebrospinal fluid, he or she will be treated with a drug called
pentamidine. After 10 daily injections, most of them are cured.
</P>
<P>
   People with parasites in their cerebrospinal fluid have a much
harder future ahead of them. Pentamidine is useless for these
people. In their advanced condition they need stronger stuff _ a
nasty potion known as melarsoprol.
</P>
<P>
   Melarsoprol is, essentially, a poison. It is almost 20 percent
arsenic. If the melarsoprol should seep out of the vein, it kills
the surrounding tissue, creating a swollen, painful mass of flesh.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least the therapy has to be stopped for a few days,
and at worst the arm may have to be amputated.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Carsello, a nurse from San Francisco, has been teaching the
nurses at the hospital how to administer melarsoprol and deal with
its side effects.
</P>
<P>
   The adult patients bow their heads and clench their teeth as the
drug hits their veins. The screaming children have to be pinned
down.
</P>
<P>
   Melarsoprol works its cure quickly. However, it can cause
trouble quickly too. In a small fraction of patients such as Justin
Kalesto, the brain suddenly swells. Other patients come out of
their comas in a psychotic state.
</P>
<P>
   Richer and Carsello remember some of the nicer psychotics
fondly: the girl who danced through the yard all day, the boy who
escaped from the hospital, went to a compound where care workers
lived, took 21 empty yellow plastic jerricans and stacked them
meticulously next to his bed.
</P>
<P>
   ----
</P>
<P>
   The next day Justin is still alive. In fact, the swelling of his
head and neck has gone down, his nose is clean, and when Richer
comes to examine him he is propped on his elbows, slowly drinking
broth out of a bowl. He still doesn't want to smile or talk, but
Richer is glad to see he's better. It means he'll probably be
cured.
</P>
<P>
   Richer's original plan was to stop the epidemic by wiping out
the disease throughout Tambura County. It called for screening
every village, testing everybody in the ones hardest hit,
identifying the patients' stage of the disease, treating them and
following them up for two years to make sure they didn't relapse.
</P>
<P>
   The price tag came to $2.4 million for the first year.
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance at the U.S.
Administration for International Development agreed to come up with
money, but only $1 million _ enough to screen and treat 20,000
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government said, `I'm sorry, it's a million. You can find
and treat as many people as you can with a million, but that's it,
you're not getting any more,''' Richer says. ``I cried and fought
and yelled and screamed and kicked. I said to them, `God, how can I
pick which 20,000?'''
</P>
<P>
   According to Valerie Newson Guarnieri, senior regional team
leader for USAID's Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance, stopping
the outbreak was beyond their focus on primary health care in
southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal was to address the major causes of morbidity and
mortality, things like malaria, diarrhea, respiratory infections.
Sleeping sickness was not part of that strategy,'' she says. ``We
were willing to contribute to get the disease back down to endemic
levels, but we just don't have the resources to eradicate the
disease. We hoped our initial input would help bring other donors
to the table.'' It didn't.
</P>
<P>
   As of April, Richer's staff had screened more than 10,000
people, and they'd treated more than 1,500 of them. Only four
people out of 700 in the first stage of sleeping sickness died, and
20 out of 800 stage 2 patients. About 10 percent of stage 1
patients have relapsed, and 25 percent to 35 percent of stage 2
patients. Some of them can be treated with alternative drugs, but
others can't be helped.
</P>
<P>
   Richer has in fact managed to keep this corner of Tambura County
healthy, but she doesn't feel much sense of victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not deluding myself that by treating 1,500 patients we've
done anything with the epidemic. Probably not. There are probably
12,000 infected people out there, and still a lot of people left
for those tsetse flies to bite. But you've got to start
somewhere.''

   ``I saved the most interesting case for last,'' said Molly
Wilson, the resident who'd been on call the night before.
</P>
<P>
   As the attending physician that month, the most senior doctor on
the service, it was my job to make sure the children in the
Infants' Unit got the best care possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``This baby's name is Jarret Fox,'' Molly continued. ``He's a
3-month-old who was admitted last night for dehydration. His mom
says Jarret was happy and healthy a week ago. Then, on Tuesday, he
seemed to lose interest in nursing. He just stopped sucking, his
mother says, and he hasn't eaten anything since.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That can't be right,'' I responded. ``Three-month-olds don't
just suddenly stop nursing and starve themselves until they get
dehydrated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I didn't believe it either at first, but the mother
keeps telling the same story: She's been trying to force-feed him
since Wednesday but hasn't had any success. Yesterday she brought
him to her pediatrician. He said Jarret was about 5 percent
dehydrated. He also said the kid was much floppier than he'd been
the last time he'd seen him. So he sent him in for rehydration and
a full evaluation.''
</P>
<P>
   The part about the increased floppiness made my heart sink. It
suggested a condition I hoped this baby didn't have.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have any ideas about a diagnosis?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I can think of is spinal muscular atrophy,''
Molly said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I'm thinking, too,'' I replied. ``I hope we're
wrong. Let's go see him.''
</P>
<P>
   Put simply, a diagnosis of the infantile form of SMA is a death
sentence. A relatively rare inherited disease in which the nerves
that control movement mysteriously degenerate and disappear, it is
the childhood equivalent of the better-known (but no better
understood) amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   As the nerves vanish during the first months of life, a child
with SMA grows progressively weaker. After initial problems with
feeding, the infant loses the ability to move its arms and legs.
Breathing also becomes difficult.
</P>
<P>
   With time, the child becomes more and more hungry for air until
finally, by about the first birthday, he or she dies. The cause is
usually pneumonia, a common infection in lungs that aren't getting
enough air.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ms. Fox,'' Molly said as we approached Jarret's crib, ``this
is Dr. Marion. He's our attending pediatrician.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry we have to meet under these circumstances,'' I said.
Barefoot, clad in a peasant blouse and bell-bottom jeans, her long,
straight hair parted down the middle, Jarret's mom looked like a
long-lost refugee from the Summer of Love.
</P>
<P>
   At my request, Ms. Fox spilled out the short tale of her son's
life. After an uncomplicated pregnancy, Jarret had been born at his
parents' home. He was the couple's second child: their daughter,
Jessica, now 3 years old, was ``healthy as a horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Although his birth was attended only by a midwife, Jarret was
examined on the first day of life by the family's pediatrician (the
only one in the area who practiced homeopathic medicine and made
house calls) and declared to be in excellent health. His mother
could think of nothing unusual about her son's newborn period.
</P>
<P>
   The infant had been seen by the pediatrician on a regular
schedule. He'd received his immunizations and had been growing and
developing normally.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fox explained that her family were strict vegetarians who
ate only whole, natural foods. She assured me that Jarret had had
nothing but breast milk.
</P>
<P>
   But four days ago this idyllic existence had ended. Jarret had
simply refused to nurse.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just wouldn't latch onto my breast,'' she said sadly.
``Nothing I did got him interested. It was like a switch had been
turned off in his brain and he wouldn't do it anymore. Just like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Has he been hungry?'' I asked, less certain now about the
diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first he was,'' she said. ``That first day, he cried and
cried. It was pathetic. But since then, he's just been lifeless,
like he just doesn't care anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell me again, when did you first notice this change in
Jarret?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tuesday afternoon,'' Ms. Fox replied. ``When he woke up from
his nap. He's usually starving when he wakes up. But that day, I
couldn't get him to take my breast for anything.''
</P>
<P>
   I nodded. ``And your 3-year-old. Tell me, how does she get along
with Jarret? Does she help you take care of him?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, she's crazy about him,'' Ms. Fox replied with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since Jarret's exclusively breast-fed, she hasn't ever fed
him, has she?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, we'd never let her. But she always pretends to feed him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But as far as you know, she's never actually fed him?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely not,'' Ms. Fox replied. ``My husband and I are
always at the table supervising. We'd never let Jess put anything
in the baby's mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   I nodded and continued: ``Ms. Fox, what does Jessica have for
breakfast?''
</P>
<P>
   The mother, somewhat surprised by the non sequitur, answered
without hesitation: ``A bowl of hot oatmeal and a glass of milk.
Why do you ask?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Does Jessica eat the oatmeal plain, or does she put sugar on
it?'' I asked, already knowing what the answer would be.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, Ms. Fox gave me an angry look. ``Dr. Marion, we eat
only whole, natural foods _ no meat, no processed food, no sugar.
Sugar is poison.''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, no sugar,'' I pushed on. ``But does Jessica use anything
to sweeten her oatmeal?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We allow her to use a teaspoon or two of honey,'' she replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ms. Fox, we have to do some tests, but I think Jarret's going
to be OK. I'm pretty sure he's got botulism.''
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Early that Tuesday morning, the Foxes were all in the kitchen.
Jarret had been placed at the table next to his sister, who was
enjoying a bowl of oatmeal that had been topped with a few dollops
of natural honey, straight from the hive.
</P>
<P>
   The children's parents had perhaps stepped away from the table
to prepare their own breakfasts. Suddenly, Jessica, pretending to
be Jarret's mother, silently offered her brother a spoonful of
cereal.
</P>
<P>
   The infant eagerly accepted the offer, and Jessica, still in
silence, finished off the bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, Jarret took his usual afternoon nap. When he
awoke, his mother found that he could no longer take her breast.
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. Fox continued to answer my questions, I became more
convinced that this scenario (or one like it) had occurred. It had
to have: After hearing the story and seeing Jarret, there was no
other logical explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans believe that when applied to foods, terms like
``pure'' and ``natural'' are synonymous with ``healthy'' and
``nutritious.'' This may be accurate for most foods, but not honey.
</P>
<P>
   Eating honey _ in both natural and processed form _ can lead to
serious disease or even death in infants. Because of the
environment in which it's produced, unprocessed honey often
contains spores of Clostridium botulinum, the bacterium that causes
botulism. The same can be true for processed honey.
</P>
<P>
   In most humans, the spores cause no problems: Immune cells in
the intestinal tracts of older children and adults release proteins
that readily bind to and destroy the toxin. But in children under 1
year of age, infants whose intestinal tracts are still immature,
the C. botulinum survives and starts making toxins. And that spells
big trouble.
</P>
<P>
   If the child is supported through this period _ if he is
tube-fed, provided with oxygen, and placed on a ventilator if
breathing becomes difficult _ he will eventually return to the
state he was in prior to the disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Lab results confirmed the presence of C. botulinum toxin not
only in Jarret's serum and feces but in a specimen taken from the
jar of honey from the Foxes' pantry as well.
</P>
<P>
   As for Jarret, it took him more than five weeks to return to his
prepoisoned state, and his recovery was not without complication.
</P>
<P>
   On the afternoon of his admission to the hospital, his breathing
had become labored, and when a blood-gas analysis revealed signs of
respiratory failure, he was transferred to the icu, where he was
intubated and placed on a ventilator.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks he remained dependent on machines, unable to breathe,
suck or swallow, cry or smile, or move any of his muscles. He
continued to be fed milk pumped from his mother's breast (she
wouldn't allow him to be fed anything else) through the feeding
tube.
</P>
<P>
   Then in early March, his nurse noted what appeared to be a
flicker of movement in his left leg. It was so subtle at first that
she thought she'd only imagined it, but more movement occurred in
the following hours. Slowly but surely, Jarret was regaining
control of his nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few days, he was gradually weaned off the
ventilator. Soon the feeding tube was removed, and he began eating
on his own again, first from a syringe, then from a bottle, and
finally, more than a month after he had entered the hospital,
directly from his mother's breast. Just about back to his old self,
he was discharged in the middle of March.

``Nothing I did got him interested. It was like a switch had been
turned off in his brain and he wouldn't do it anymore. Just like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Has he been hungry?'' I asked, less certain now about the
diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first he was,'' she said. ``That first day, he cried and
cried. It was pathetic. But since then, he's just been lifeless,
like he just doesn't care anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell me again, when did you first notice this change in
Jarret?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tuesday afternoon,'' Ms. Fox replied. ``When he woke up from
his nap. He's usually starving when he wakes up. But that day, I
couldn't get him to take my breast for anything.''
</P>
<P>
   I nodded. ``And your 3-year-old. Tell me, how does she get along
with Jarret? Does she help you take care of him?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, she's crazy about him,'' Ms. Fox replied with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since Jarret's exclusively breast-fed, she hasn't ever fed
him, has she?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, we'd never let her. But she always pretends to feed him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But as far as you know, she's never actually fed him?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely not,'' Ms. Fox replied. ``My husband and I are
always at the table supervising. We'd never let Jess put anything
in the baby's mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   I nodded and continued: ``Ms. Fox, what does Jessica have for
breakfast?''
</P>
<P>
   The mother, somewhat surprised by the non sequitur, answered
without hesitation: ``A bowl of hot oatmeal and a glass of milk.
Why do you ask?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Does Jessica eat the oatmeal plain, or does she put sugar on
it?'' I asked, already knowing what the answer would be.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, Ms. Fox gave me an angry look. ``Dr. Marion, we eat
only whole, natural foods _ no meat, no processed food, no sugar.
Sugar is poison.''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, no sugar,'' I pushed on. ``But does Jessica use anything
to sweeten her oatmeal?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We allow her to use a teaspoon or two of honey,'' she replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ms. Fox, we have to do some tests, but I think Jarret's going
to be OK. I'm pretty sure he's got botulism.''
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Early that Tuesday morning, the Foxes were all in the kitchen.
Jarret had been placed at the table next to his sister, who was
enjoying a bowl of oatmeal that had been topped with a few dollops
of natural honey, straight from the hive.
</P>
<P>
   The children's parents had perhaps stepped away from the table
to prepare their own breakfasts. Suddenly, Jessica, pretending to
be Jarret's mother, silently offered her brother a spoonful of
cereal.
</P>
<P>
   The infant eagerly accepted the offer, and Jessica, still in
silence, finished off the bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, Jarret took his usual afternoon nap. When he
awoke, his mother found that he could no longer take her breast.
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. Fox continued to answer my questions, I became more
convinced that this scenario (or one like it) had occurred. It had
to have: After hearing the story and seeing Jarret, there was no
other logical explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans believe that when applied to foods, terms like
``pure'' and ``natural'' are synonymous with ``healthy'' and
``nutritious.'' This may be accurate for most foods, but not honey.
</P>
<P>
   Eating honey _ in both natural and processed form _ can lead to
serious disease or even death in infants. Because of the
environment in which it's produced, unprocessed honey often
contains spores of Clostridium botulinum, the bacterium that causes
botulism. The same can be true for processed honey.
</P>
<P>
   In most humans, the spores cause no problems: Immune cells in
the intestinal tracts of older children and adults release proteins
that readily bind to and destroy the toxin. But in children under 1
year of age, infants whose intestinal tracts are still immature,
the C. botulinum survives and starts making toxins. And that spells
big trouble.
</P>
<P>
   If the child is supported through this period _ if he is
tube-fed, provided with oxygen, and placed on a ventilator if
breathing becomes difficult _ he will eventually return to the
state he was in prior to the disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Lab results confirmed the presence of C. botulinum toxin not
only in Jarret's serum and feces but in a specimen taken from the
jar of honey from the Foxes' pantry as well.
</P>
<P>
   As for Jarret, it took him more than five weeks to return to his
prepoisoned state, and his recovery was not without complication.
</P>
<P>
   On the afternoon of his admission to the hospital, his breathing
had become labored, and when a blood-gas analysis revealed signs of
respiratory failure, he was transferred to the icu, where he was
intubated and placed on a ventilator.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks he remained dependent on machines, unable to breathe,
suck or swallow, cry or smile, or move any of his muscles. He
continued to be fed milk pumped from his mother's breast (she
wouldn't allow him to be fed anything else) through the feeding
tube.
</P>
<P>
   Then in early March, his nurse noted what appeared to be a
flicker of movement in his left leg. It was so subtle at first that
she thought she'd only imagined it, but more movement occurred in
the following hours. Slowly but surely, Jarret was regaining
control of his nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few days, he was gradually weaned off the
ventilator. Soon the feeding tube was removed, and he began eating
on his own again, first from a syringe, then from a bottle, and
finally, more than a month after he had entered the hospital,
directly from his mother's breast. Just about back to his old self,
he was discharged in the middle of March.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Pity the freshwater mussel, a drab, mud-colored shellfish that
can't get away when its watery home gets polluted. Mussels are the
most endangered of all the animal families in North America, but
most people don't have a clue.
</P>
<P>
   How about the Puritan tiger beetle? The vicious little predator
has been driven from 98 percent of its waterfront habitat in New
England, mostly by people who had no idea they were destroying
beetle burrows underfoot.
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget dragonflies, those prehistoric-looking insects
whose bogs we are increasingly squeezing. Interest in dragonflies
is so low that biologists don't even know how much their numbers
have fallen.
</P>
<P>
   These are some of the unloved endangered species, the slimy, the
inanimate, the repulsive, creatures that don't attract a fan club
the way bald eagles or tigers or panda bears do. Politicians seldom
seek extra money to help such creatures, and when species such as
Sampson's pearly mussel or the blue pike go extinct _ few even know
it.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists believe the public bias toward ``charismatic
megafauna'' _ those popular, often large, warm-blooded animals that
get most of the attention _ is handicapping efforts to stop what
renowned naturalist E.O. Wilson at Harvard University calls the
largest spasm of extinction since the dinosaurs vanished.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's embarrassing,'' says Tim Simmons of the Massachusetts
Natural Heritage and Endangered Species Program, who has only two
part-time employees helping to protect endangered beetles, a
fraction of the 40 staff and volunteers working with the
Massachusetts Audubon Society to protect the much-cuter piping
plovers this summer. He adds:
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger beetles are considerably more threatened than plovers
and eagles. They're not less important, but from a public
perspective, sure they're less important.''
</P>
<P>
   Biologists go back and forth as to which species are most
``important.'' Big predators such as the wolf can serve as a symbol
for a whole landscape, but humble creatures provide nature's
essential services, cleaning up waste and getting eaten by the big
predators. Freshwater mussels, in particular, may be nature's best
barometer of water quality.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing is certain: The vast majority of the 1,082
federally endangered species are more like mussels than wolves,
lacking both a backbone and the ability to move. Moreover, the
uncharismatic species are more likely to vanish: Five of the seven
US extinctions since 1973 are of plants, fish or mussels.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, star power is becoming even more important as the
congressional debate over renewing the controversial Endangered
Species Act drags on. Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, hoping to
fend off efforts to to weaken the law, has begun stressing major
success stories, mostly involving popular endangered species such
as eagles and alligators.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have proved that a strong Endangered Species Act can make a
difference. We don't have to stand by idly and watch our wildlife
go extinct,'' said Babbitt last month in announcing plans to drop
the peregrine falcon from the endangered list.
</P>
<P>
   But the recovery of the falcon, the result of a multi-year,
multi-million dollar campaign that included artificial nests on top
of the Tobin Bridge and the Custom House tower in Boston, is by no
means typical.
</P>
<P>
   The 635 endangered plant species, for example, aren't protected
on private land under the Endangered Species Act, and the US Fish
and Wildlife Service increasingly cuts deals with private land
owners, called habitat conservation plans, to allow building on
some endangered species habitat.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists long ago learned the public's preference for
charismatic animals and have tried to use it to advantage, hoping
that efforts to protect, say, the bison, would help other species
by saving the plains where the buffalo roam.
</P>
<P>
   Activists ``will stick a real tiger in front of you because they
are a magnificent beast and you have a sense that the world is
poorer without them,'' says Chris Leahy, director of the Center for
Biological Conservation at the Massachusetts Audubon Society. ``No
matter what you did to a freshwater mussel, you would have trouble
viewing it as impressive in a physical way. They are pretty
sedentary, pretty brown.''
</P>
<P>
   The piping plover, a small nut-colored shorebird that nests on
popular beaches, may be New England's best example of the virtue of
being cuddly. The plover has come back dramatically through a
massive investment of public and private resources, bringing other
animals along in its wake.
</P>
<P>
   Though off-road vehicle owners objected to the closing of beach
sections while the birds nested, they were no match for the piping
plover in the court of public opinion, says Scott Hecker, director
of the coastal shorebirds program for Audubon.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing more horrifying than the thought of these cute
little piping plovers being run over by a vehicle. They are a
classic charismatic species when presented to the public,'' Hecker
says.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the sustained effort, the number of nesting plovers
has risen from 252 in 1987 to nearly 1,000 this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The success with plovers, in turn, allows Hecker to protect less
charismatic creatures, such as terns, that also need beach space.
Efforts to save the plover even help the tiger beetles by reducing
traffic over their burrows for a few weeks in the spring and early
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortuntely, the plovers fly away, and the beetles are stuck
there in the sand,'' says Simmons, beetle specialist at the state
Natural Heritage Program. New England's only remaining Northeastern
beach tiger beetles are found in one section of Cape Cod, and the
Puritan tiger beetles are found in only two places in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Still, biologists have by no means given up hope as the concept
of ``biodiversity'' gains currency. Though an individual snail may
not inspire awe, people and government agencies are beginning to
appreciate the need to preserve all parts of nature's system,
because each makes a unique contribution to life.
</P>
<P>
   State biologist Pat Huckery, up to her neck in the waters of the
Nissitissit River in Pepperell, pulls out a two-inch-long clam
that, all by itself, tells her she is in an unspoiled place. There
are other indicators, from the graceful overhanging trees to the
colorful wildflowers on the bank, but the presence of this rare
``bog floater'' proves the water is clean.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certain freshwater mussels seem to be much more sensitive to
water quality, and they are the ones to end up'' on the endangered
species lists, says Huckery, the mussel specialist at the state
Natural Heritage and Endangered Species Program.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their name, bog floaters, one of nearly 300 species of
freshwater mussels in North America, actually spend their adult
lives anchored in the mud, their shells open enough to filter tiny
food particles from the water. Dams, acid rain, sewage run-off,
fertilizer from lawns and farms _ anything that can change the
water's chemistry _ can, and often do, imperil the bog floaters.
</P>
<P>
   With 55 percent of North America's freshwater shellfish species
endangered and at least three already extinct, state and federal
governments have launched a concerted effort to turn the tide. In
July, federal and state officials fined the Tennessee Shell Company
$1 million for illegally purchasing thousands of pounds of
shellfish in Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky, and West Virginia for sale
on the export market.
</P>
<P>
   ``While freshwater mussels are not cuddly creatures with
eyelashes, they are hugely important in the biological scheme of
things,'' says H. Dale Hall, acting regional director of the US
Fish and Wildlife Service in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, with the help of a federal grant, Huckery's
team has been studying ways to save freshwater mussels in the
Connecticut River Valley. Unfortunately, the mussel news is not
good: Only nine individual clams of the dwarf wedgemussel species
are known to remain in Massachusetts, and 18 of the 21 freshwater
shellfish species are declining.
</P>
<P>
   But Huckery believes the future of unpopular creatures such as
mussels and dragonflies would brighten if more people appreciated
their subtle charms, such as the way immature mussels hitch a ride
on fish to colonize new areas.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Huckery believes that dragonflies, descended from
ancient insects that had two-foot wingspans, have more star power
than people realize. Stepping gingerly across a thick mat of moss
that has grown on the surface a Gardner pond, she snares a blue
darner dragonfly in her net. Its luminous green eyes can see
virtually 360 degrees at once, she says, watching as its abdomen
swells and shrinks with its breathing.
</P>
<P>
   The sex life of these animals alone ought to inspire some
interest, Huckery says. In the carnal world of dragonflies and
their cousins, the damselflies, partners pinwheel through the air
in tandem, genitals locked, as the male attempts to rid the female
of any rivals' sperm before depositing his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're doing it all the time,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   But the sex appeal of dragonflies, like the wonder of freshwater
mussels, is a tough sell in a national debate in which critics of
the Endangered Species Act are quick to highlight aggressive
efforts to help obscure species. The snail darter, a little fish
whose presence helped stop a big dam project in Tennessee, is often
held up by critics as evidence of regulators run amok.
</P>
<P>
   And environmentalists charge that fear of such criticism has led
the US Fish and Wildlife Service to adopt a highly destructive
policy that promises landowners ``no surprises'' if they take steps
to protect known endangered species. Under the policy, officials
promise not to ask for more protections should other endangered
species turn up on the land in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you move on to these less charismatic species where less is
known about the biology, they are really being set up for a huge
fall,'' says Daniel Hall of the Oregon-based American Lands
Alliance, an environmental group.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with such complaints, the Fish and Wildlife Service is
revising the ``no surprises'' rule.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the uncharismatic animals and plants, says
Hall, that balancing may be at their expense.

BERGERON IS TALKING IN BOSTON AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In the five years since he left Boston, Tom Bergeron
has led a classic now-you-see-him, now-you-don't television
existence.
</P>
<P>
   Bergeron's agile wit enlivened the old ``People Are Talking'' on
WBZ-Ch. 4 as well as ``Fox After Breakfast'' on the Fox network,
but it was not enough to keep those shows from being canceled, nor
to land him the permanent anchor job on ABC's ``Good Morning
America,'' where he was aced out by Kevin Newman.
</P>
<P>
   Bergeron has bounced back, however, and tonight will resurface
on television as the host of a new syndicated version of
``Hollywood Squares.''
</P>
<P>
   Characteristically, the 43-year-old Bergeron is rather jovial
about his odyssey through the network wilderness. ``I call my
post-Boston years my `Serendipity Tour,''' he said. ``I'm just sort
of floating happily from one adventure to another.''
</P>
<P>
   Bergeron's latest ``adventure'' pairs him with executive
producer Whoopi Goldberg, who also will occupy the center square
made famous in the original show by Paul Lynde. In tonight's
premiere, some of the other celebrity players include Rosie
O'Donnell, Jeffrey Tambor, Rita Rudner, and Kathy Najimy. Such
celebrities as Sting, Whitney Houston, Garth Brooks, and Penn &AMP;
Teller are lined up for future guest stints.
</P>
<P>
   To judge by the premiere, though, Bergeron's breezily irreverent
persona will command its own share of the spotlight. However, in
presiding over what he calls ``a star-studded tic-tac-toe game,''
he is aware that he must serve more as ringmaster than entertainer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's up to me to be the `dad' if the contestants start goofing
around,'' said Bergeron. ``I have to draw a line between getting in
the sandbox to play and being the sandbox supervisor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hollywood Squares'' arrived for Bergeron after a highly
publicized setback. A longtime fill-in anchor on ABC's ``Good
Morning America,'' Bergeron was considered a strong candidate to
succeed Charles Gibson. But he was passed over for Newman, the
``Good Morning America'' newsreader. The New York Post headline
hooted: ```GMA to Tom: You're Out!'''
</P>
<P>
   ``In all honesty, I was not at all disappointed,'' said Bergeron
equably. ``It was clear to me that Lisa (McRee) and I didn't have
much chemistry. A show like that needs chemistry.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Bergeron seems ideally suited to a game show, he
insists he never had ``game-show aspirations.'' That changed when
representatives of King World Productions called and said ``We want
to test you with Whoopi'' for a new, ``hip'' version of ``Hollywood
Squares.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg and Bergeron had hit it off when she was a guest on
``Fox After Breakfast,'' and they easily recaptured that chemistry
while taping ``Hollywood Squares,'' according to Bergeron.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a ball together,'' he said. ``With her on board, and
such a strong comedy element, it was a real attractive package.''
</P>
<P>
   The new incarnation of ``Hollywood Squares'' seems like a good
showcase for Bergeron's quick-on-his-feet style. When tonight's
contestant tells him she works as a mobile disc jockey, Bergeron
cracks, ``I was a mobile disc jockey too. I couldn't hold down a
job in any one place.''
</P>
<P>
   Bergeron did begin his career as a disc jockey in 1972 at WHAV
in his hometown of Haverhill, where he was the station's youngest
disc jockey ever. His Boston TV career blossomed in 1982 when he
joined Channel 4 and became host of ``4 Today'' and a pair of
children's shows, ``Rap Around'' and ``Super Kids.''
</P>
<P>
   But he is perhaps best-known locally for his stint as the host
of ``People Are Talking'' from 1987 to 1993 (during which time he
also hosted radio shows on WBZ and WMJX). Glib without being
smarmy, smoothly ranging from substance to fluff and back to
substance again, Bergeron emerged as one of the easiest-to-take TV
personalities Boston has ever had.
</P>
<P>
   When ``People Are Talking'' was canceled, Bergeron went national
with ``Breakfast Time'' on the FX cable channel, which later
migrated to the Fox broadcast network and was renamed ``Fox After
Breakfast.'' But that show was also canceled. Bergeron rebounded
with the guest-host stints at ``Good Morning America'' until Newman
bested him for the role of permanent anchor.
</P>
<P>
   Now Bergeron is pinning his hopes on ``Hollyood Squares.''
(Coincidentally, as Bergeron tries to fill the shoes of Peter
Marshall, host of the old ``Hollywood Squares,'' Marshall has just
had his debut as host of a new game show, ``The Reel to Reel
Picture Show,'' on Pax TV.)
</P>
<P>
   Bergeron says he's pleased he will be back on Channel 4, albeit
in a syndicated show, and says he still misses Boston, recalling
such local touches as the quilt with a ``People Are Talking'' logo
sent to him by a viewer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was watching `Good Will Hunting' and getting homesick,'' he
said. ``If you're accepted by Boston, it's a close, warm, personal
relationship.''

<TEXT>

<P>
   Justin Kalesto doesn't want to wake up. A woman is calling his
name, but he turns his head deeper into his pillow. He is 12 years
old, and from Mangbangau, a village deep in remote southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Justin's sunken abdomen curves inward like a bowl. His nostrils
are clogged with bacteria and dried mucus and the skin around his
closed eyes puffs out, giving him the face of a frog.
</P>
<P>
   Justin has become home for hundreds of thousands of whip-shaped
parasites called trypanosomes. They have fed on his blood and made
their way into his brain. Generally the human victim of such an
invasion sinks into an irritable haze, slips into a coma and dies.
Hence the name of the disease: sleeping sickness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know where you are?'' a woman asks in English, and a
Sudanese nurse translates. He nods and says, ``Tambura,'' the name
of the town where this hospital is located. The woman tries to bend
his head, but it's too stiff _ his entire back is rigid as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone comes in and you can't bend their head,'' the
woman says to the Sudanese men and women standing with her by the
cot, ``get a doctor immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Her name is Mickey Richer. She is a short 53-year-old woman with
a gray mop of hair, dressed in a T-shirt and pale-blue surgical
pants. She prescribes shots of steroids and says, ``OK, Justin, see
you later.'' He offers no response, not even a glance.
</P>
<P>
   There are 102 other patients at the Tambura County Hospital
being treated today for advanced sleeping sickness.
</P>
<P>
   Justin is one of an estimated 9,000 to 12,000 in Tambura County
who are sick with the disease _ 20 percent of the population. And
he is only one of perhaps hundreds of thousands who have become
infected recently in southern Sudan and its neighbors, the Central
African Republic and the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly
Zaire).
</P>
<P>
   Once considered a disease fading into oblivion, sleeping
sickness is raging again, particularly here. In all of southern
Sudan, Richer is running the only program to fight the disease, and
she is able to save only a handful of lives.
</P>
<P>
   Richer was already in her 40s when she began working in places
like Tambura.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted to do Third World work; that's why I went to
medical school,'' she says. ``I thought I'd be a pediatrician for
one or two years and then move on. I loved the kids so much I
stayed around for 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   She finally left her practice in Denver in 1987 to spend a year
in northern Sudan, working in a camp for refugees driven there by
recurrent famines.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward she went to the prestigious Liverpool School of
Tropical Medicine and then returned to Africa with the
International Medical Corps, a Los Angeles-based group of doctors
and nurses who bring medical care to places wrecked by war and
disaster, such as Angola, Bosnia and Burundi.
</P>
<P>
   When Richer first came to Tambura in 1994, she didn't know she
was landing in the middle of an epidemic. Her job was to resurrect
the county hospital, abandoned during the ongoing civil war. But it
didn't take Richer long to notice the parasites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a few people with sleeping sickness in 1994,'' she
remembers, ``and in 1995 I treated 19 patients.''
</P>
<P>
   The single-celled trypanosomes that cause sleeping sickness
spend their time cycling between humans and tsetse flies. They
linger in the gut of the fly, absorbing amino acids and other
molecules that the fly gets by biting mammals. After about 10 days
the trypanosomes move into the fly's salivary glands.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare for their new home, the parasites cloak themselves in
a coat made of millions of copies of a single sugary molecule.
</P>
<P>
   Our immune cells fashion antibodies that correspond to this
molecule's shape, and the antibodies enable the immune system to
kill the parasite in huge numbers.
</P>
<P>
   But some individual trypanosomes take evasive action. They shut
down the genes they use to build their coat and turn on a new set
in their place. They can then build a new surface molecule, one
similar enough to the old one to do the job but which no longer
matches the antibodies.
</P>
<P>
   Now invisible, the parasite thrives while the immune system
starts a new eradication campaign from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   But trypanosomes have hundreds of coat-coding genes that they
hold in reserve, and they can easily continue to slip away from the
body's attack. As they wear out the immune system, the parasites
feed on their host's blood.
</P>
<P>
   Months or years can pass before some of them cross the barrier
that protects the brain.
</P>
<P>
   When Richer came to Tambura, there hadn't been a major outbreak
of sleeping sickness since the late '70s, and at first she simply
dealt with cases as they came in. But the number steadily grew: The
19 patients she treated in 1995 became 87 the following year.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Richer estimated that in Tambura County, 20 percent of
the people were infected. Back in 1988, she calculated, the rate
had been no more than .5 percent. Over the course of nine years it
had multiplied 40 times.
</P>
<P>
   If a person tests positive for sleeping sickness, there is only
one way to know if the trypanosomes have reached the brain, and
that is to perform a spinal tap.
</P>
<P>
   If the patient is lucky, and no parasites are found in the
cerebrospinal fluid, he or she will be treated with a drug called
pentamidine. After 10 daily injections, most of them are cured.
</P>
<P>
   People with parasites in their cerebrospinal fluid have a much
harder future ahead of them. Pentamidine is useless for these
people. In their advanced condition they need stronger stuff _ a
nasty potion known as melarsoprol.
</P>
<P>
   Melarsoprol is, essentially, a poison. It is almost 20 percent
arsenic. If the melarsoprol should seep out of the vein, it kills
the surrounding tissue, creating a swollen, painful mass of flesh.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least the therapy has to be stopped for a few days,
and at worst the arm may have to be amputated.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Carsello, a nurse from San Francisco, has been teaching the
nurses at the hospital how to administer melarsoprol and deal with
its side effects.
</P>
<P>
   The adult patients bow their heads and clench their teeth as the
drug hits their veins. The screaming children have to be pinned
down.
</P>
<P>
   Melarsoprol works its cure quickly. However, it can cause
trouble quickly too. In a small fraction of patients such as Justin
Kalesto, the brain suddenly swells. Other patients come out of
their comas in a psychotic state.
</P>
<P>
   Richer and Carsello remember some of the nicer psychotics
fondly: the girl who danced through the yard all day, the boy who
escaped from the hospital, went to a compound where care workers
lived, took 21 empty yellow plastic jerricans and stacked them
meticulously next to his bed.
</P>
<P>
   ----
</P>
<P>
   The next day Justin is still alive. In fact, the swelling of his
head and neck has gone down, his nose is clean, and when Richer
comes to examine him he is propped on his elbows, slowly drinking
broth out of a bowl. He still doesn't want to smile or talk, but
Richer is glad to see he's better. It means he'll probably be
cured.
</P>
<P>
   Richer's original plan was to stop the epidemic by wiping out
the disease throughout Tambura County. It called for screening
every village, testing everybody in the ones hardest hit,
identifying the patients' stage of the disease, treating them and
following them up for two years to make sure they didn't relapse.
</P>
<P>
   The price tag came to $2.4 million for the first year.
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance at the U.S.
Administration for International Development agreed to come up with
money, but only $1 million _ enough to screen and treat 20,000
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government said, `I'm sorry, it's a million. You can find
and treat as many people as you can with a million, but that's it,
you're not getting any more,''' Richer says. ``I cried and fought
and yelled and screamed and kicked. I said to them, `God, how can I
pick which 20,000?'''
</P>
<P>
   According to Valerie Newson Guarnieri, senior regional team
leader for USAID's Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance, stopping
the outbreak was beyond their focus on primary health care in
southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal was to address the major causes of morbidity and
mortality, things like malaria, diarrhea, respiratory infections.
Sleeping sickness was not part of that strategy,'' she says. ``We
were willing to contribute to get the disease back down to endemic
levels, but we just don't have the resources to eradicate the
disease. We hoped our initial input would help bring other donors
to the table.'' It didn't.
</P>
<P>
   As of April, Richer's staff had screened more than 10,000
people, and they'd treated more than 1,500 of them. Only four
people out of 700 in the first stage of sleeping sickness died, and
20 out of 800 stage 2 patients. About 10 percent of stage 1
patients have relapsed, and 25 percent to 35 percent of stage 2
patients. Some of them can be treated with alternative drugs, but
others can't be helped.
</P>
<P>
   Richer has in fact managed to keep this corner of Tambura County
healthy, but she doesn't feel much sense of victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not deluding myself that by treating 1,500 patients we've
done anything with the epidemic. Probably not. There are probably
12,000 infected people out there, and still a lot of people left
for those tsetse flies to bite. But you've got to start
somewhere.''

   ``I saved the most interesting case for last,'' said Molly
Wilson, the resident who'd been on call the night before.
</P>
<P>
   As the attending physician that month, the most senior doctor on
the service, it was my job to make sure the children in the
Infants' Unit got the best care possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``This baby's name is Jarret Fox,'' Molly continued. ``He's a
3-month-old who was admitted last night for dehydration. His mom
says Jarret was happy and healthy a week ago. Then, on Tuesday, he
seemed to lose interest in nursing. He just stopped sucking, his
mother says, and he hasn't eaten anything since.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That can't be right,'' I responded. ``Three-month-olds don't
just suddenly stop nursing and starve themselves until they get
dehydrated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I didn't believe it either at first, but the mother
keeps telling the same story: She's been trying to force-feed him
since Wednesday but hasn't had any success. Yesterday she brought
him to her pediatrician. He said Jarret was about 5 percent
dehydrated. He also said the kid was much floppier than he'd been
the last time he'd seen him. So he sent him in for rehydration and
a full evaluation.''
</P>
<P>
   The part about the increased floppiness made my heart sink. It
suggested a condition I hoped this baby didn't have.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have any ideas about a diagnosis?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I can think of is spinal muscular atrophy,''
Molly said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I'm thinking, too,'' I replied. ``I hope we're
wrong. Let's go see him.''
</P>
<P>
   Put simply, a diagnosis of the infantile form of SMA is a death
sentence. A relatively rare inherited disease in which the nerves
that control movement mysteriously degenerate and disappear, it is
the childhood equivalent of the better-known (but no better
understood) amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   As the nerves vanish during the first months of life, a child
with SMA grows progressively weaker. After initial problems with
feeding, the infant loses the ability to move its arms and legs.
Breathing also becomes difficult.
</P>
<P>
   With time, the child becomes more and more hungry for air until
finally, by about the first birthday, he or she dies. The cause is
usually pneumonia, a common infection in lungs that aren't getting
enough air.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ms. Fox,'' Molly said as we approached Jarret's crib, ``this
is Dr. Marion. He's our attending pediatrician.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry we have to meet under these circumstances,'' I said.
Barefoot, clad in a peasant blouse and bell-bottom jeans, her long,
straight hair parted down the middle, Jarret's mom looked like a
long-lost refugee from the Summer of Love.
</P>
<P>
   At my request, Ms. Fox spilled out the short tale of her son's
life. After an uncomplicated pregnancy, Jarret had been born at his
parents' home. He was the couple's second child: their daughter,
Jessica, now 3 years old, was ``healthy as a horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Although his birth was attended only by a midwife, Jarret was
examined on the first day of life by the family's pediatrician (the
only one in the area who practiced homeopathic medicine and made
house calls) and declared to be in excellent health. His mother
could think of nothing unusual about her son's newborn period.
</P>
<P>
   The infant had been seen by the pediatrician on a regular
schedule. He'd received his immunizations and had been growing and
developing normally.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fox explained that her family were strict vegetarians who
ate only whole, natural foods. She assured me that Jarret had had
nothing but breast milk.
</P>
<P>
   But four days ago this idyllic existence had ended. Jarret had
simply refused to nurse.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just wouldn't latch onto my breast,'' she said sadly.
``Nothing I did got him interested. It was like a switch had been
turned off in his brain and he wouldn't do it anymore. Just like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Has he been hungry?'' I asked, less certain now about the
diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first he was,'' she said. ``That first day, he cried and
cried. It was pathetic. But since then, he's just been lifeless,
like he just doesn't care anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell me again, when did you first notice this change in
Jarret?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tuesday afternoon,'' Ms. Fox replied. ``When he woke up from
his nap. He's usually starving when he wakes up. But that day, I
couldn't get him to take my breast for anything.''
</P>
<P>
   I nodded. ``And your 3-year-old. Tell me, how does she get along
with Jarret? Does she help you take care of him?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, she's crazy about him,'' Ms. Fox replied with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since Jarret's exclusively breast-fed, she hasn't ever fed
him, has she?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, we'd never let her. But she always pretends to feed him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But as far as you know, she's never actually fed him?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely not,'' Ms. Fox replied. ``My husband and I are
always at the table supervising. We'd never let Jess put anything
in the baby's mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   I nodded and continued: ``Ms. Fox, what does Jessica have for
breakfast?''
</P>
<P>
   The mother, somewhat surprised by the non sequitur, answered
without hesitation: ``A bowl of hot oatmeal and a glass of milk.
Why do you ask?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Does Jessica eat the oatmeal plain, or does she put sugar on
it?'' I asked, already knowing what the answer would be.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, Ms. Fox gave me an angry look. ``Dr. Marion, we eat
only whole, natural foods _ no meat, no processed food, no sugar.
Sugar is poison.''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, no sugar,'' I pushed on. ``But does Jessica use anything
to sweeten her oatmeal?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We allow her to use a teaspoon or two of honey,'' she replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ms. Fox, we have to do some tests, but I think Jarret's going
to be OK. I'm pretty sure he's got botulism.''
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Early that Tuesday morning, the Foxes were all in the kitchen.
Jarret had been placed at the table next to his sister, who was
enjoying a bowl of oatmeal that had been topped with a few dollops
of natural honey, straight from the hive.
</P>
<P>
   The children's parents had perhaps stepped away from the table
to prepare their own breakfasts. Suddenly, Jessica, pretending to
be Jarret's mother, silently offered her brother a spoonful of
cereal.
</P>
<P>
   The infant eagerly accepted the offer, and Jessica, still in
silence, finished off the bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, Jarret took his usual afternoon nap. When he
awoke, his mother found that he could no longer take her breast.
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. Fox continued to answer my questions, I became more
convinced that this scenario (or one like it) had occurred. It had
to have: After hearing the story and seeing Jarret, there was no
other logical explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans believe that when applied to foods, terms like
``pure'' and ``natural'' are synonymous with ``healthy'' and
``nutritious.'' This may be accurate for most foods, but not honey.
</P>
<P>
   Eating honey _ in both natural and processed form _ can lead to
serious disease or even death in infants. Because of the
environment in which it's produced, unprocessed honey often
contains spores of Clostridium botulinum, the bacterium that causes
botulism. The same can be true for processed honey.
</P>
<P>
   In most humans, the spores cause no problems: Immune cells in
the intestinal tracts of older children and adults release proteins
that readily bind to and destroy the toxin. But in children under 1
year of age, infants whose intestinal tracts are still immature,
the C. botulinum survives and starts making toxins. And that spells
big trouble.
</P>
<P>
   If the child is supported through this period _ if he is
tube-fed, provided with oxygen, and placed on a ventilator if
breathing becomes difficult _ he will eventually return to the
state he was in prior to the disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Lab results confirmed the presence of C. botulinum toxin not
only in Jarret's serum and feces but in a specimen taken from the
jar of honey from the Foxes' pantry as well.
</P>
<P>
   As for Jarret, it took him more than five weeks to return to his
prepoisoned state, and his recovery was not without complication.
</P>
<P>
   On the afternoon of his admission to the hospital, his breathing
had become labored, and when a blood-gas analysis revealed signs of
respiratory failure, he was transferred to the icu, where he was
intubated and placed on a ventilator.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks he remained dependent on machines, unable to breathe,
suck or swallow, cry or smile, or move any of his muscles. He
continued to be fed milk pumped from his mother's breast (she
wouldn't allow him to be fed anything else) through the feeding
tube.
</P>
<P>
   Then in early March, his nurse noted what appeared to be a
flicker of movement in his left leg. It was so subtle at first that
she thought she'd only imagined it, but more movement occurred in
the following hours. Slowly but surely, Jarret was regaining
control of his nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few days, he was gradually weaned off the
ventilator. Soon the feeding tube was removed, and he began eating
on his own again, first from a syringe, then from a bottle, and
finally, more than a month after he had entered the hospital,
directly from his mother's breast. Just about back to his old self,
he was discharged in the middle of March.

</P>
<P>
   ``But as far as you know, she's never actually fed him?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely not,'' Ms. Fox replied. ``My husband and I are
always at the table supervising. We'd never let Jess put anything
in the baby's mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   I nodded and continued: ``Ms. Fox, what does Jessica have for
breakfast?''
</P>
<P>
   The mother, somewhat surprised by the non sequitur, answered
without hesitation: ``A bowl of hot oatmeal and a glass of milk.
Why do you ask?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Does Jessica eat the oatmeal plain, or does she put sugar on
it?'' I asked, already knowing what the answer would be.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, Ms. Fox gave me an angry look. ``Dr. Marion, we eat
only whole, natural foods _ no meat, no processed food, no sugar.
Sugar is poison.''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, no sugar,'' I pushed on. ``But does Jessica use anything
to sweeten her oatmeal?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We allow her to use a teaspoon or two of honey,'' she replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ms. Fox, we have to do some tests, but I think Jarret's going
to be OK. I'm pretty sure he's got botulism.''
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Early that Tuesday morning, the Foxes were all in the kitchen.
Jarret had been placed at the table next to his sister, who was
enjoying a bowl of oatmeal that had been topped with a few dollops
of natural honey, straight from the hive.
</P>
<P>
   The children's parents had perhaps stepped away from the table
to prepare their own breakfasts. Suddenly, Jessica, pretending to
be Jarret's mother, silently offered her brother a spoonful of
cereal.
</P>
<P>
   The infant eagerly accepted the offer, and Jessica, still in
silence, finished off the bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, Jarret took his usual afternoon nap. When he
awoke, his mother found that he could no longer take her breast.
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. Fox continued to answer my questions, I became more
convinced that this scenario (or one like it) had occurred. It had
to have: After hearing the story and seeing Jarret, there was no
other logical explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans believe that when applied to foods, terms like
``pure'' and ``natural'' are synonymous with ``healthy'' and
``nutritious.'' This may be accurate for most foods, but not honey.
</P>
<P>
   Eating honey _ in both natural and processed form _ can lead to
serious disease or even death in infants. Because of the
environment in which it's produced, unprocessed honey often
contains spores of Clostridium botulinum, the bacterium that causes
botulism. The same can be true for processed honey.
</P>
<P>
   In most humans, the spores cause no problems: Immune cells in
the intestinal tracts of older children and adults release proteins
that readily bind to and destroy the toxin. But in children under 1
year of age, infants whose intestinal tracts are still immature,
the C. botulinum survives and starts making toxins. And that spells
big trouble.
</P>
<P>
   If the child is supported through this period _ if he is
tube-fed, provided with oxygen, and placed on a ventilator if
breathing becomes difficult _ he will eventually return to the
state he was in prior to the disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Lab results confirmed the presence of C. botulinum toxin not
only in Jarret's serum and feces but in a specimen taken from the
jar of honey from the Foxes' pantry as well.
</P>
<P>
   As for Jarret, it took him more than five weeks to return to his
prepoisoned state, and his recovery was not without complication.
</P>
<P>
   On the afternoon of his admission to the hospital, his breathing
had become labored, and when a blood-gas analysis revealed signs of
respiratory failure, he was transferred to the icu, where he was
intubated and placed on a ventilator.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks he remained dependent on machines, unable to breathe,
suck or swallow, cry or smile, or move any of his muscles. He
continued to be fed milk pumped from his mother's breast (she
wouldn't allow him to be fed anything else) through the feeding
tube.
</P>
<P>
   Then in early March, his nurse noted what appeared to be a
flicker of movement in his left leg. It was so subtle at first that
she thought she'd only imagined it, but more movement occurred in
the following hours. Slowly but surely, Jarret was regaining
control of his nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few days, he was gradually weaned off the
ventilator. Soon the feeding tube was removed, and he began eating
on his own again, first from a syringe, then from a bottle, and
finally, more than a month after he had entered the hospital,
directly from his mother's breast. Just about back to his old self,
he was discharged in the middle of March.

HIGH CRIMES AND SLEAZY DEMEANOR 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Never mind high crimes, misdemeanors and cigars
that sometimes aren't just cigars. These are my eight grounds for
the impeachment of Bill Clinton:
</P>
<P>
   1) For saying ``I have sinned'' with tears in his eyes at a
prayer breakfast with such ``pastoral counselors'' as the Rev.
Jesse Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   2) For writing his own sappy prayer, which ended: ``Let the
words of my mouth and the meditations of my heart and, in the end,
the work of my hands, be pleasing.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeeech. He should just sit on his hands, shut up and talk to God
silently.
</P>
<P>
   3) For forgetting Monica Lewinsky's name after a brief breakup.
Never call a woman ``Kiddo'' unless you're Humphrey Bogart.
</P>
<P>
   4) For telling Monica, after she asked coyly where he got a
certain necktie, ``Some girl with style gave it to me.''
</P>
<P>
   With lines like that, a guy could cut a swathe through a trailer
park like an Arkansas tornado.
</P>
<P>
   5) For giving a speech to some Irish folks and Democratic
bigwigs right after the Starr report appeared and acting like
nothing had happened _ and then quoting Ted Kennedy and saying, ``I
like to borrow Senator Kennedy's lines whenever I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Like what? ``She was driving?''
</P>
<P>
   6) For celebrating holidays like New Year's Eve, Presidents Day
and Easter Sunday with Monica moments. Easter? Aren't there a bunch
of kids rolling eggs on the lawn right outside the window?
</P>
<P>
   By the way, Clinton and Lewinsky began their affair on the
second day of Newt Gingrich's government shutdown. Hey, there was
nothing else to do.
</P>
<P>
   7) For sticking to that ridiculous argument that oral sex isn't
sex. The president even testified that he thought ``any person, any
reasonable person'' would think the same thing. Yeah, it's just
Beltway call-waiting.
</P>
<P>
   8) For talking on the phone with members of Congress while
Monica was servicing him. One conversation was about deploying
troops to Bosnia. This guy is such a policy wonk he can talk
foreign affairs right in the middle of a domestic affair.
</P>
<P>
   Bosnia is lucky it didn't get a sudden launch of cruise
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   There's more to my bill of particulars against unparticular
Bill, but let's talk about the other jerks who have helped set a
team record in American tackiness.
</P>
<P>
   Is stupidity a high crime or a misdemeanor? Either way, this is
the case against Monica:
</P>
<P>
   1) For telling 11 people about her relationship with the
president. Didn't Bill brief her on the don't ask, don't tell
policy?
</P>
<P>
   2) For asking the president: ``Is this just about sex ... or do
you have some interest in trying to get to know me as a person?''
</P>
<P>
   3) For falling in love with Bill Clinton. But then, we can't
fault her for an irrational attachment shared by so many voters.
</P>
<P>
   4) For thinking she might become his wife. Did she have any idea
who she'd be up against?
</P>
<P>
   And now for Kenneth Starr, that righteous avatar of traditional
values who dumped salacious material all over the Internet and the
news media. What a guy. These are my articles of impeachment for
his smug little butt:
</P>
<P>
   1) For sprinkling more sex scenes in his report than you can
find in a whole shelf of paperbacks at a wanker bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   2) For presenting those sex scenes in a style colder than
clinical. Legalese meets sleaze. It's ugly, ugly stuff. I don't
know about you, but I have to purify my system by reading
``Candy.''
</P>
<P>
   3) For making us think about what our sex lives would look like
in a report to Congress. Well, some of our sex lives might look
like a blank piece of paper. That's even worse than being portrayed
sucking on incriminating Tiparillos.
</P>
<P>
   4) For describing encounters between Bill and Monica, and then
tacking on things like ``Mrs. Clinton was in Athens, Greece.''
That's rubbing it in a bit, don't you think?
</P>
<P>
   5) For spending four years and about $50 million on this. A
couple of sailors could do better on weekend liberty with $50.
</P>
<P>
   6) For trying to kill my mother. She shouldn't read this stuff.
</P>
<P>
   As you can see, I am leaving the issue of high crimes and
misdemeanors to the high criminal experts in Congress. The scandal
has come down to low slime and misbehavior.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before I read Starr's report to Congress and was overwhelmed by
his multimillion-dollar peep show, I fully intended to write a
high-road column. I wandered around the campus at the University of
California at Berkeley talking to students. In teacher Lydia
Chavez's journalism class, I found young grad students wondering
how some tawdry sex and lies led to talk of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Queena Kim said that a professor had asked, ``Aren't you excited
to wake up and read the news? And the students are like, `Not
really.'''
</P>
<P>
   Julie Roller said that she had watched tapes of the Watergate
hearings, and had been moved by the gravity and power of those
events. ``It was so exciting to watch it unfold,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Every age gets the scandal it deserves, I guess. This isn't the
age of Walter Cronkite anymore, but the age of Jerry Springer.
</P>
<P>
   Once we had Watergate. Now we have a scandal better covered by
Penthouse and Cigar Aficionado than Woodward and Bernstein.

DELAHUNT'S MISSION ON JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: FAIRNESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bill Delahunt is one of my favorite freshman
congressmen mostly because, at 57, he's like a freshman in college
who has already done a tour in the Marines and spent a couple of
years working construction.
</P>
<P>
   In short, he's fresh but he's been around, as a legislator but
more important as the veteran district attorney from Norfolk
County, Mass, adjacent to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The other reason is that he doesn't say a whole lot _ not
because he doesn't have anything to say, but because he seems to be
a public official more inclined to pick his spots than chase every
microphone he sees. The result is that when he does talk the
natural reaction is to listen.
</P>
<P>
   And, finally, it's worth noting that as a freshman member of the
House Judiciary Committee, Delahunt has become something of a pal
to another _ but far less in shape _ member with white hair _ the
committee's chairman, Henry Hyde, Republican of Illinois. That
makes the few things Delahunt has to say in public about
you-know-what especially worth paying attention to. Everybody
knows, but hardly anybody says it often enough, that something as
solemn as impeachment is never going to move forward much more than
an inch without some block of President Clinton's own partisans
going along; Delahunt will be one of the Democrats to watch.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, he spoke up more than he has of late as the House
prepared to vote to dump nearly 500 pages of independent counsel
Kenneth Starr's narrative material on its membership and, more
important, the public, and to begin reviewing some 2,000 more pages
of raw material for similar distribution over the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   For what it's worth _ much more than a little _ Delahunt did not
think a necessarily nonpartisan process had gotten off to a smooth
start.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, he did not like what amounted to an abdication of
congressional responsibility to Starr in the decision to instantly
release, on his say-so, his report, but to agree to treat at least
some of the raw evidence that accompanied it as confidential, also
on his say-so alone.
</P>
<P>
   For another, he joined with many of his Democratic colleagues in
protesting the absence of notice and time to respond to the
president and his lawyers, citing the provision made as courtesies
to such investigative targets of the past as Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   And that, he said, tends to exacerbate the third, and
inevitable, impact of Starr's referral _ which as a former
prosecutor Delahunt is greatly experienced in dealing with.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will clearly be prejudicial to the president's defense,''
he said. ``If the independent counsel has done his job, the case he
has constructed will be a persuasive one ... And, at least at the
federal level, they have no obligation to apprise the jurors of
exculpatory evidence. The case will seem airtight, yet until the
evidence has withstood cross-examination and the allegations have
been proven, they remain nothing more than allegations.''
</P>
<P>
   Delahunt was not arguing that Starr's report should be
repressed; no one was. The only question, he said, ``is when and
how it should be done,'' which is where the question of
``fundamental fairness'' becomes relevant.
</P>
<P>
   So far, so bad, in Delahunt's view.
</P>
<P>
   And from here on, there is a danger that all this will become
worse.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment there is a great frenzy here _ primarily over the
sexual details in the Starr document. But after a few weeks, and
assuming Clinton can politically survive the initial avalanche of
disclosure, there will be questions about what the Judiciary
Committee is going to do.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that after all this posturing about how serious
everything is, how solemnly obligations are being undertaken,
Hyde's committee intends to do _ nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Delahunt told me that there simply isn't time to go through an
impeachment inquiry between now and when a new Congress takes
office after the new year and the current Congress leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   However, he did say that Hyde intends to try to decide in the
time left this year the threshhold question of whether there should
be an inquiry, based on study of and debate over the Starr document
and the president's detailed response to it.
</P>
<P>
   One would hope that at the very least the committee would do
that. Otherwise, the judicious reticence of Republicans like Hyde
and Democrats like Delahunt risks appearing pointless.
</P>
<P>
   After all, how can this be a terribly serious, pressing matter _
whether the president is fit to continue in office _ and then have
nothing at all done about for four months?
</P>
<P>
   Answers yet to come.

AFTER THE POPCORN SEASON, FALL'S ANNUAL DELUGE OF MOVIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OK, OK. We see you staggering back, hand to head, yelling ``Too
much information!'' Still, a handful of titles do jump out from the
150 or so films due between now and Christmas. So do a handful of
stars from among the usual suspects. Not all the pairings will
involve the usual man-woman duets. Take ``Stepmom,'' the rueful
comedy starring Susan Sarandon and Julia Roberts, due at Christmas.
Sarandon will play the disapproving ex-wife of Ed Harris, who has
remarried the younger but less domestically adept Roberts. Another
pair of high-profile actresses, Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman,
are on the same side in ``Practical Magic'' (Oct. 9), playing
sisters who not only are witchy, but are witches.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Meryl Streep, twice. In ``One True Thing''
(Friday), based on Anna Quindlen's novel, she'll play a mom dying
of cancer trying to live with an ambitious journalist daughter
(Renee Zellweger) caring for her and a selfish academic husband
(William Hurt). Later, we'll see her as the eldest sister in the
'30s Irish family in ``Dancing at Lughnasa,'' drawn from Brian
Friel's play.
</P>
<P>
   You will have noted the n-word _ novel _ already. It's the
source, as usual, of most of the fall's high-profile entries.
</P>
<P>
   Several have been simmering for years, starting with Toni
Morrison's ``Beloved'' (Oct. 16), starring Oprah Winfrey as an
escaped slave alongside Danny Glover, under Jonathan Demme's
direction. ``The Thin Red Line'' (Dec. 25) finds Terrence Malick
ending a few decades of seclusion to guide Sean Penn, John
Travolta, Aidan Brody, Nick Nolte, George Clooney, and a bunch of
other A-list grunts through James Jones's story about GIs battling
to take Guadalcanal from the Japanese. Jones himself will be a
major presence in ``A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries,'' based on
the autobiographical novel by his daughter, Kaylie, starring Kris
Kristofferson as it keeps up with the Joneses in Paris and the
United States (Sept. 25).
</P>
<P>
   ``A Civil Action'' (Dec. 25), filmed in Massachusetts and based
on Jonathan Harr's nonfiction bestseller, toplines Travolta as the
lawyer fighting two corporations accused of toxic pollution by
eight Woburn families stricken with leukemia. Nolte will be seen as
a rural cop cursed with a history of family violence in
``Affliction,'' based on Russell Banks's novel (late December or
January). ``A Simple Plan'' (Oct. 9) adapts Scott Smith's dark
novel about brothers (Bill Paxton and Billy Bob Thornton) finding a
crashed plane stuffed with drug money.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Dreams May Come'' (Oct. 2), from Richard Matheson's New
Age novel, finds Robin Williams literally going through heaven and
hell to rejoin his wife, played by Annabella Sciorra, in the
afterlife. Williams plays a doctor for the fifth time in ``What
Dreams May Come,'' and for the sixth time in ``Patch Adams'' (Dec.
25), the twist this time being that he's a former suicidal mental
patient who, upon being healed, heads for med school. It wouldn't
be a new season without a new movie stemming from Stephen King.
``Apt Pupil'' (Oct. 23) finds Ian McKellen's Nazi war criminal
teaching naive teen Brad Renfro all the wrong things. McKellen will
also be seen next month in ``Gods and Monsters'' as James Whale,
the British director of ``Frankenstein'' and ``The Invisible Man.''
Penn also has a second film, portraying a Hollywood player
alongside Kevin Spacey in the long-delayed film of David Rabe's
``Hurlyburly'' (Dec. 25).
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Branagh will be busy, too, as he heads (by alphabetical
fortune) the cast of the new Woody Allen movie ``Celebrity''
(November). Allen presciently signed Leonardo DiCaprio to play a
Hollywood flavor of the month before DiCaprio broke out in
``Titanic.'' Famous people playing famous people is nothing new to
Allen, but this time he expands the concept by casting NBA star
Anthony Mason to play an NBA star. Bra-nagh's other outing will be
``Theory of Flight,'' in which he plays an offender sentenced to
community service, helping Helena Bonham Carter cope with a
neurological disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Predictable star-casting peaks as Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan follow
``Sleepless in Seattle'' with another romantic comedy, ``You've Got
Mail'' (Dec. 18), a version of the Ernst Lubitsch classic ``The
Shop Around the Corner,'' but with an Internet twist. He's a
chain-bookstore marketer squeezing her one-woman bookshop, and they
fall in love on the Web. Val Kilmer and Mira Sorvino take on a more
unorthodox concept in ``At First Sight'' (Nov. 20), as he plays a
blind man and she plays his sighted lover. The relationship genre
also yields the season's most intriguing title, ``Dancing About
Architecture'' (Dec. 18) _ as in the adage ``Talking about music is
like dancing about architecture.'' Its offbeat casting stars Gena
Rowlands and Sean Connery as a long-married couple facing a crisis.
We can't leave ``Shakespeare in Love'' (Dec. 25) off the
relationship-movie list. It stars Joseph Fiennes, Gwyneth Paltrow,
Ben Affleck, Geoffrey Rush, and Judi Dench.
</P>
<P>
   Mayhem of the non-domestic kind will be plentiful, too. But
first, perhaps, we ought to call attention to Brad Pitt's role in
``Meet Joe Black'' (Nov. 13), in which he plays Death. Not the grim
reaper, but the party animal as first depicted in the film of which
this is a remake, ``Death Takes a Holiday.'' Death won't take a
holiday in the season's other eagerly awaited remake, ``Psycho''
(Dec. 4), with Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche in the Tony Perkins and
Janet Leigh roles and Gus Van Sant standing in for Alfred
Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   On the theory that there's something about Cameron Diaz, big
plans are being made for ``Very Bad Things'' (Nov. 20) with its
gruesome party-from-hell theme. ``John Carpenter's Vampires'' (Oct.
30) will add you know what to the Halloween season. The gore level
will be maintained by ``I Still Know What You Did Last Summer''
(Nov. 20), in which the traumatized high-schoolers are stalked on a
tropical island.
</P>
<P>
   Will Smith will return opposite Gene Hackman in the
spy-intrigue-laden ``Enemy of the State'' (Nov. 25). In ``Ronin''
(Sept. 25), Robert De Niro, Stellan Skarsgard, Jonathan Pryce, and
Jean Reno play big guns on the loose in Paris with only a script by
David Mamet and direction by John Frankenheimer. ``Soldier'' (Oct.
22) gives Kurt Russell the sci-fi Western field all to himself.
Stephen Frears has set his Western, ``The Hi-Lo Country'' (Dec. 18)
in postwar New Mexico, as he charts the decline of the Western
frontier against a story involving Woody Harrelson and Billy Crudup
competing for the favors of Patricia Arquette.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Hollywood won't be making nice with a spate of
family-themed movies. New family-film icon Eddie Murphy will return
in ``Holy Man'' (Oct. 9), about a merger between religion and a
home shopping network. DreamWorks and Disney will square off with
dueling insects. DreamWorks promises ``Antz'' (Oct. 2), with Woody
Allen as the voice of a lowly drone wooing queen Sharon Stone.
Disney's ``A Bug's Life'' (Nov. 20), from the ``Toy Story'' wizards
at Pixar, rallies the voices of Kevin Spacey, Julia Louis-Dreyfus,
and Denis Leary in a rebellion by ants against grasshoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Later (Dec. 18), DreamWorks will unveil its ambitious ``Prince
of Egypt,'' the Moses story, with animated influences ranging from
the Book of Exodus to Cecil B. DeMille. Also due: ``Babe: Pig in
the City'' (Nov. 20), in which the popular animatronic porker goes
urban to save the farm. Touchy-feely creature comfort is promised
in the ``Mighty Joe Young'' remake (Dec. 18). The eco-friendly ape
is no ``Godzilla,'' promise the producers. On the other hand, the
hope is for at least a mini-rampage in ``Bride of Chucky.''

RETIREE SHOULD AVOID TEMPTATION FOR BIG CHANGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. In a column earlier this month you suggested a portfolio
consisting of Vanguard GNMA, Vanguard Short-Term Bond, and Vanguard
Corporate High-Yield funds.
</P>
<P>
   I am 80 and keep physically active. My wife and I own our home
and thoroughly enjoy our life here on Cape Cod, after moving here
26 years ago. My investment holdings are $110,000 in Vanguard GNMA,
$33,000 in Vanguard Intermediate-Term U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury, $20,000 in Vanguard Wellington, $40,000 in Van Kampen
Merritt Municipal Trust, $30,000 in Stratton Monthly Dividend REIT
(which I am in the process of closing) and $20,000 in a 7.5 percent
U.S. Treasury Bill. I am interested in the portfolio you outlined.
</P>
<P>
   In view of my holdings, which provide revenue for our living
expenses, would you suggest that I move to the three Vanguard
funds?
</P>
<P>
   R.H., Osterville
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Speaking broadly, your portfolio is already designed pretty
much along the lines I suggested in that previous column -- a core
holding in Ginnie Maes, balanced at either end by holdings that
offer greater and lesser risk. Using an assumption that the money
that came out of Stratton Monthly Dividend has been parked in a
money market fund, I estimate your overall portfolio average yield
at 5.91 percent. That's less than the 6.5 percent-plus target for
the portfolio I wrote about before, but your portfolio has some
compensating advantages -- the tax-free status of the municipals
(which I have assumed are in the Van Kampen American Capital
Municipal Income fund) and the principal growth potential of
Vanguard Wellington.
</P>
<P>
   First off, I have a question: are you sure your tax status makes
the municipal bond fund an advantageous holding. With a 5.4 percent
tax-free yield, it's not providing much of a drain on the overall
yield, but it achieves this high yield -- high for a municipal bond
fund anyway -- by holding a long-term portfolio and by holding a
higher-than-average position (22 percent as of the last Morningstar
Mutual Funds report) in non-rated, or junk munis.
</P>
<P>
   You might analyze your tax situation and determine whether you
might put this money in a taxable bond fund with a higher yield,
ending up ahead even after paying the tax liability.
</P>
<P>
   The portfolio to which you refer was suggested in response to a
person who sought the highest possible yield consistent with a
reasonable risk level. From the tone of your letter, it sounds to
me as though you're fairly comfortable with your income stream as
it is, so I don't think wholesale changes are in order. Even with
this year's disappointing results (up 2.7 percent year-to-date as
this is written) Vanguard Wellington should produce some capital
growth, which was not a realistic feature of the portfolio I
suggested in the previous column.
</P>
<P>
   So unless you find that the tax-free holding isn't doing all
that much for you, my only suggestion involves that $30,000 that is
coming out of the Stratton Monthly Dividend REIT holding. If you
were to add that money to the Vanguard GNMA position, it would
bring the overall portfolio yield up to 6.09 percent; if you were
to put it in Vanguard Corporate High-Yield, the portfolio average
yield would advance to 6.39 percent. If you're considering the
latter option, you should note that high-yield bonds tend to
reflect movements in both the stock and bond markets. Like all bond
funds, they will gain or lose value inversely with changes in
interest rates; like stocks, they will lose value quickly when the
stock market goes into a tailspin. During August Vanguard
High-Yield Corporate Bond fund lost 3.9 percent, and as this is
written it has fallen to the point that its year-to-date total
return is but .8 percent. So making that move will broaden your
exposure to stock market swings beyond the 62 percent of the
Vanguard Wellington portfolio that's in equities.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I would like to have $25,000 a year income when I retire at
age 65 in three and a half years. I anticipate $850 monthly from
Social Security and a pension with $528 a month for life or a
$67,332 lump sum. I have a total of $233,020 saved, of which
$158,598 is in IRAs and a 401(k) account. Of this, all but $23,227
is in stocks or stock funds. In addition, I have $36,832 in common
stocks in taxable accounts. The balance of my savings is in bank
savings and U.S. Savings bonds. My only debt is $6,200 on my house,
which is worth about $90,000 with a 7 percent interest rate. Should
I pay this off or keep paying it monthly? Should I sell it and
invest the money?
</P>
<P>
   B.R., Cedar Park, Texas
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I know absolutely nothing about the Texas real estate market,
but my suspicion is that you'd be best off keeping the house.
Consider this math: If you sold the house and paid a typical
Realtor's fee, it would bring in $84,600. After paying off the
mortgage balance, and ignoring your other closing costs, you would
have $78,400. If there were no tax liability and that sum were
invested in a bond fund yielding 6.5 percent, it would bring you
$424 a month. Is such a sum sufficient to pay the rentals of a
similar lodging, even adding in the amount you are paying each
month on real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance? My suspicion
is that the answer is no. Moreover, as a homeowner, you would not
have to worry about the prospect of rent increases.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, I suggest you not only keep the house, but also prepay
the mortgage. You have in excess of $20,000 in low-interest money
market funds at banks and credit unions, which would certainly be
well placed in replacing a 7 percent mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   But my more pressing advice is a response to a question you
didn't ask: Is yours a good portfolio for a person 42 months away
from retirement? I think the answer is no. You have a total of 71.6
percent of your total savings in stocks and stock funds, which
strikes me as a very high percentage. I suggest you reduce your
stock market exposure to a maximum 50 percent of your total
savings, and I would be more comfortable if you were to cut it to
40 percent. This could be achieved without immediate tax effects by
simply transferring many of the tax-deferred holdings into
fixed-income holdings. A typical fixed-income portfolio I often
recommend ( discussed in the letter above) consists of 50 percent
in a good GNMA fund, with the remaining funds evenly divided
between a short-term bond fund and a high- yield bond fund. If you
were to follow my suggestion of a total 40 percent stock position,
you would reduce the equity position in the tax-deferred accounts
to $56,376; if you chose to keep half the funds in stocks, the
figure would be $79,678.
</P>
<P>
   Finally another question you didn't ask: Would I get better
returns from money market fund in a mutual fund family than I'm
getting at the bank and credit union? You bet.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Since April of 1995 I have invested $4,750 in American Funds'
Investment Company of America for my eight-year-old grandson.
June's quarterly statement shows the account's value to be $6,608.
I purchased the first shares through a Pittsburgh bank while on
vacation, and did not realize that there is a 5.75 percent sales
charge deducted every time a deposit is made. What is your opinion
of withdrawing these funds and depositing them in the Stein Roe
Young Investor fund?
</P>
<P>
   D.S., San Diego
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. If the sales charge, or ``load'' is your primary motivation
for making a switch, there's nothing to gain by switching. As you
noted, the 5.75 percent load on Investment Company of America is
charged at the front end, so the money has already been spent, and
you wouldn't recover it by selling. So it would seem to me that
your better move, if you are convinced you don't want to pay any
more sales charges, is to leave the current holdings in Investment
Company of America and begin a second account with Stein Roe Young
Investor.
</P>
<P>
   There are other reasons, in my opinion, to stick with the fund
you have -- as a value- oriented large-cap fund, it provides more
stability in a shaky market than Stein Roe Young Investor. For
example, year-to-date it has a 3.9 percent total return as this is
written; Young Investor shows a 1.5 percent year-to-date loss. The
latter fund's portfolio is dominated by growth-oriented large cap
funds. Over a three-tear period it has nicely outstripped
Investment Company of America, with average annual returns of 18.61
percent compared to 15.33 percent, according to Morningstar's
latest figures. But since I anticipate no return to the frothy
growth markets of 1996 and 1997, I would be more comfortable with
Investment Company of America.
</P>
<P>
   Although Stein Roe Young Investor fund has a $2,500 minimum
initial investment for most accounts, the level is reduced to
$1,000 for uniform gift to minors accounts, and further reduced to
$100 if you sign up for an automatic investment plan into which at
least $50 an month will flow.

BEWARD `NEGATIVE-OPTION' MAILINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA WEN AND BRUCE MOHL  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Companies offering products in the mail always want you
to accept and pay. And in an effort to maximize their success, they
are increasingly using dubious methods to convince themselves that
you wanted what they sent.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, if you say yes, you want it; and if you say no, you
don't. But if you do nothing _ because you were too busy to respond
or chucked the notice in the trash _ some aggressive marketers read
the inaction as a ``yes.''
</P>
<P>
   It's called ``negative option'' mailings, and it assumes you
want something unless you negate or stop it. And when the company
simply gets silence, they start sending you the unwanted products
and the bills. The first offer is often presented as free, when
there are strings attached.
</P>
<P>
   ``This marketing ploy is gaining in popularity,'' said Leslie
Davies, managing attorney for consumer protection at the state
attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   It's illegal for someone to expect you to buy something simply
because they didn't hear from you. Any purchase contract has to be
two-way, with an offer from the company and your actual acceptance
of it. So next time you get an unsolicited product, consider it a
gift; you don't have to pay or return it.
</P>
<P>
   Negative-option mailings are acceptable, however, if you agree
to this setup as part of an ongoing relationship. For example, you
join a book club in which you agree to buy a certain number of
books unless you stop the orders. Or you agree to automatic annual
renewals of an auto club unless you stop it.
</P>
<P>
   A negative-option system, consumer advocate Edgar Dworsky said,
must be disclosed in ``clear and conspicuous'' language. Clever
marketers, however, are finding ways to make it seem like you
agreed to something long term.
</P>
<P>
   Take the case of Jack Hurley, a computer executive in the South
End who is finding himself the confused _ and now angry _ recipient
of several CDs he never ordered.
</P>
<P>
   Last February, Reader's Digest got Hurley's name from an outside
mailing list and sent him a ``complimentary'' CD called ``Stardust
Moods'' and a coin set, according to the company.
</P>
<P>
   Hurley's initial mailing came with a notice saying that Hurley
could keep it as a gift, and ``if you don't send anything back to
us, we'll send you the next one.''
</P>
<P>
   In May, having not heard form Hurley, Reader's Digest sent him a
``Candlelight Classics'' CD, with a bill for $21.
</P>
<P>
   Hurley couldn't remember ordering the CD, but, afraid it was
just a memory lapse, he sent them a check. Last July, Reader's
Digest sent him another CD and another bill.
</P>
<P>
   By now, Hurley was getting upset. When we inquired, Reader's
Digest spokeswoman Donna Pierpont acknowledged that Hurley never
agreed to enter into a long-term relationship to receive these
products. The company, based in Pleasantville, N.Y., simply assumed
he would indicate if he didn't want them anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Pierpont said of consumers, ``You need to let us know if you
don't want to continue with these services.''
</P>
<P>
   Davies of the attorney general's office said in cases such as
these, Hurley would have been wise to simply keep all the things
coming his way, and, to stop future mailings, inform Reader's
Digest that he wants off this list.
</P>
<P>
   He would have been under no obligation to pay, because he never
asked to receive the CDs.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of James and Bernice Johnson of Reading, they
apparently didn't read the fine print from American Family
Publishers, which said their purchase of one cookbook amounted to
being part of a ``continuity product.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple started receiving notices that a cookbook was waiting
for them and would be sent, unless they sent back the post card
within a month stating they didn't want it. ``Quickly, I wrote on
each side of the card `I DON'T WANT THIS!''' James Johnson said in
his letter to us.
</P>
<P>
   These tactics prey on those who may easily feel intimidated into
paying a bill, partly out of fear it may affect their credit
rating. Davies said the state takes seriously all cases in which
consumers are duped into giving up money and can prosecute any
``unfair and deceptive'' practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The companies may be trying to trick someone into thinking
they bought something,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Unwanted loan checks &LR;  &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After reading our column last month about the illegality of
sending unsolicited credit cards in the mail, Ann Grace of Pelham,
N.H., asked whether unsolicited loan checks might also violate
federal law.

<P>
   A 72-year-old Boxford man won a personal consumer victory in his
battle with the meat scales at the Stop &AMP; Shop in Danvers. He said
he was ``mad as a hornet'' after discovering that the 10 pounds of
pork loins he bought from the Stop &AMP; Shop in Danvers on July 31
actually weighed 33 percent less than the package indicated _ and
that he was overcharged.
</P>
<P>
   The man's complaint that day brought in Norman St. Hilaire,
Danvers' sealer of weights and measures. The inspector found that a
random selection of meat indicated the store's scales were off.
Most packages weighed 33 percent less than the store's price/weight
sticker indicated.
</P>
<P>
   After conducting an investigation, St. Hilaire concluded that
the meat workers were allowing a meat tray to come into contact
with the scale, causing what he called ``an accidental
overweighing.''
</P>
<P>
   Under a new law signed by Acting Governor Paul Cellucci last
month, portions of which go into effect in mid-November, inspectors
such as St. Hilaire would have the power to issue traffic
ticket-like fines to stores that are found with inaccurate scales.
</P>
<P>
   St. Hilaire said he subsequently conducted two surprise checks
of the scales last month and found them to be accurate. Regina
Harrington, Stop &AMP; Shop acting manager in Danvers, said the meat
scales were ``corrected immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the Boxford man, who asked to remain anonymos, he
demanded a full refund and wondered how many other consumers were
overcharged.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't know this unless you're a suspicious, cheap man
like me,'' he said.

AIKMAN'S FORAYS SURE TO BE SECOND-GUESSED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ OK, let the second-guessing begin. In fact, let's hear
it from any of you volunteers out there. Be the first to step right
up and tell Troy Aikman what he should have done.
</P>
<P>
   Like run out of bounds. Or at least give it a safety slide.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman, his left arm in a sling, his right hand holding an ice
bag on a broken left collarbone, said after Sunday's game that he
was expecting to hear a loud second-guess chorus from Fort
Worth-Dallas precincts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will probably be the same people who last week were so
pleased with my running,'' he added, forcing a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Awaiting a bus ride to the airport and the team flight home,
Aikman admitted he was in considerable pain. Actually, the Dallas
Cowboys had a postgame locker room full of hurt, but most of it
involved broken pride instead of broken bones.
</P>
<P>
   An embarrassing defensive breakdown in the first half led to a
42-23 victory for the Denver Broncos. In this case, however, losing
the game is minor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care about the game,'' said receiver Michael Irvin.
``But why did it have to be Troy we lost?''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it didn't have to be Aikman, if he had played it safe
there in the second quarter. ``But please introduce me to the man
brave enough to tell Troy he shouldn't have done what he did,''
said owner Jerry Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Second guess this:
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were going to win today it was going to have to be in a
shootout,'' said Aikman. ``It's the second quarter, and even though
we're down (28-14), we had our offense going. I was still planning
on winning this game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had run out of bounds on the play before (for a three-yard
gain), and when that side of the field opened up for me again, I
was going for it. I knew I had five yards, but I needed a couple
more to move the sticks. I wanted to move those sticks.''
</P>
<P>
   Broncos' linebacker Bill Romanowski appeared to have Aikman cut
off short of the first down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started to slide,'' said Aikman, ``but then I thought I
could duck in behind (Romanowski). That's when I made the dive,
trying to get the first down.''
</P>
<P>
   Two Denver defenders came down on Aikman, but he thinks the
collarbone gave way when he hit the ground, or before he took the
hits.
</P>
<P>
   Recovery time for Aikman was estimated at four to eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``A normal person, it would be eight weeks before they'd play
again,'' said Cowboys team doctor Robert Vandermeer. ``But Troy,
knowing him, it will be four weeks, and he will be asking to come
back before then.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Four weeks, and that's maximum,'' stressed Aikman. ``It's not
like I'm out for the season. Lets keep this thing going, and I'll
be back ... quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never talked much to (Aikman) about running out of bounds
on plays like that,'' said head coach Chan Gailey. ``Now I wish I
had. Now he wishes I had.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Aikman's most enjoyable season in years has now been
temporarily delayed almost before it got started. ``What is kinda
devastating right now is that I really like what we're doing as a
team, and on the offensive side, I think we've got a chance to be
good,'' said Aikman. ``It's no secret I've been excited about a lot
of things that have been happening with Chan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to see that end for even one game. Again,
however, the season is not over for me, and certainly not for this
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the offense Gailey brought to Dallas involved Aikman
moving around more in the backfield. If he's moving around,
opportunities to scramble are going to surface. Aikman running the
football helped jump-start the offense in the win over Arizona. And
the Denver defensive coaches admitted it gave them a new worry for
Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
   But if Aikman is scrambling, does he increase the odds on being
injured? Of course. The sword cuts both ways, particularly when you
mix in Aikman's competitive nature.
</P>
<P>
   Losing Aikman for maybe a month of games is an awful blow to the
Cowboys, but injury risks for a quarterback is part of life in the
NFL. Crying doesn't help, and to the credit of the Cowboys they
stayed competitive with Denver until late in the fourth quarter.
Afterward, however, reality settled upon the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never like to see Troy run,'' admitted Irvin. ``Every time
it happens, I'm out there saying, `no, no, no.' At home, my wife
and kids are also saying, `no, no, no.' They know, like I know,
that Troy is our money man.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvin then paused and added, ``I'm not very good at talking
about this stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   For what it's worth, Aikman offered a postgame second-guess of
himself. ``Knowing what I know now, I'd have run out of bounds,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, with Aikman, it might not be wise to take that as
the gospel.

WHEN IT COMES TO DEFENSIVE WOES, SEVERAL ARE TO BLAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Dallas Cowboys safety Darren Woodson said it was the
players' fault, plain and simple.
</P>
<P>
   Secondary coach Mike Zimmer, in no uncertain terms, blamed
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Team officials were overheard muttering words such as
``embarrassing'' and ``pitiful'' under their breath and that was
``before'' quarterback Troy Aikman was knocked out with a broken
left collar bone.
</P>
<P>
   Guess what: Each and every one of them was right on the money.
</P>
<P>
   Total defensive ineptitude in the first half allowed the Broncos
to make a mockery of the ``Team of the '90s'' Sunday at Mile High
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, by sending Aikman to the sidelines with his arm in a
sling for the next four to six weeks, the Broncos might have put
the Cowboys six feet under for the season as well.
</P>
<P>
   If this was Dallas' first real test of 1998, consider it an
abject and total failure.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the offense, even under backup Jason Garrett, wasn't
shabby, but let head coach Chan Gailey's own words spell out the
grim reality for you.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't score enough points to win,'' Gailey said tersely
after his first loss as an NFL head coach. ``If your defense isn't
stopping them, you have to score more points than they do. That's
the objective of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You win as a team and you lose as a team. You don't shuffle
the blame to one side or the other; you accept it and go on to the
next one.''
</P>
<P>
   While the loss of Aikman, injured at the end of another
happy-feet scramble _ what are you gonna do, he's a competitor _
loomed as potentially devastating in the long term, the irony was
his departure midway in the second quarter had very little to do
with the final outcome on a balmy Colorado Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Not unless he could have tackled Denver tailback Terrell Davis
or covered tight end Shannon Sharpe.
</P>
<P>
   He shouldn't feel bad. Nobody else could either.
</P>
<P>
   Davis broke open a 7-7 game with stunning back-to-back
first-quarter touchdown runs of 63 and 59 yards and Broncos
quarterback John Elway, toying with the Cowboys' defense, hit
Sharpe with touchdown passes of 39 and 23 yards as the Broncos
scored five touchdowns in five first-half possessions.
</P>
<P>
   The 35 points was the most ever surrendered by a Cowboys' team
in a half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised they moved the ball on our defense as well as
they did today,'' Gailey said. ``I thought they did a good job of
spreading us out and creating a lot of one-on-one matchups. John's
got a great vision of the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We let'em break two big runs. That really is something we have
not done too much of and you try to keep that from happening. Long
runs are what get you. You at least want to make them work their
way down the field in those situations to give yourself a better
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Broncos had put up 35 first-half points, the Cowboys
had no chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my fault. The whole deal's my fault,'' a flushed Zimmer
declared in the postgame locker room. ``I take all the blame on
this one. It's not (defensive coordinator Dave) Campo and it's not
the players. It's me. The players did what they were supposed to
do. I just didn't put them in the right situation to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Easy, Zim. There's plenty of blame to go around here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd seen that set they lined up against us, we'd practiced
it, but we lost our composure,'' Zimmer said. ``We outsmarted
ourselves because they got in one set in a bunch of different ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got Sharpe down the middle on that (first touchdown) when
we had a guy bust an assignment, and then we completely lost our
composure after that and couldn't get it back.''
</P>
<P>
   In the hectic bedlam of Mile High, Zimmer said he couldn't
settle his secondary down until the team got into the locker room
at halftime. And by then, the game was gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got nervous because we wanted to shut'em down,'' Zimmer
said. ``They had us totally out of sync and completely flustered.
</P>
<P>
   ``When guys are unsure about what's going on, they start to
think and you can't think when you're playing football. It's a
reaction game. They're out there thinking, `What if they do this
and what if they do that?' In the second half we made a couple of
other adjustments and added one more check and we did better, but
it was too late.''
</P>
<P>
   Campo said the halftime changes were minimal. It was more a case
of getting the players calmed down and refocused.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't do a whole lot different,'' he said. ``In the first
half we were doing stuff out there that we hadn't done all training
camp. We just got flustered and that surprised me because I didn't
think another team could do that to us.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just Mike personality, wanting to take all the blame,
but this is a team game.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodson couldn't have agreed more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the coaches, it's the players,'' he said. ``I give
all the credit to the Broncos.''
</P>
<P>
   I'd give the man a cigar except the way the Cowboys played
defense Sunday, it would probably slip through his fingers and
score.

BEWARD `NEGATIVE-OPTION' MAILINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA WEN AND BRUCE MOHL  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Companies offering products in the mail always want you
to accept and pay. And in an effort to maximize their success, they
are increasingly using dubious methods to convince themselves that
you wanted what they sent.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, if you say yes, you want it; and if you say no, you
don't. But if you do nothing _ because you were too busy to respond
or chucked the notice in the trash _ some aggressive marketers read
the inaction as a ``yes.''
</P>
<P>
   It's called ``negative option'' mailings, and it assumes you
want something unless you negate or stop it. And when the company
simply gets silence, they start sending you the unwanted products
and the bills. The first offer is often presented as free, when
there are strings attached.
</P>
<P>
   ``This marketing ploy is gaining in popularity,'' said Leslie
Davies, managing attorney for consumer protection at the state
attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   It's illegal for someone to expect you to buy something simply
because they didn't hear from you. Any purchase contract has to be
two-way, with an offer from the company and your actual acceptance
of it. So next time you get an unsolicited product, consider it a
gift; you don't have to pay or return it.
</P>
<P>
   Negative-option mailings are acceptable, however, if you agree
to this setup as part of an ongoing relationship. For example, you
join a book club in which you agree to buy a certain number of
books unless you stop the orders. Or you agree to automatic annual
renewals of an auto club unless you stop it.
</P>
<P>
   A negative-option system, consumer advocate Edgar Dworsky said,
must be disclosed in ``clear and conspicuous'' language. Clever
marketers, however, are finding ways to make it seem like you
agreed to something long term.
</P>
<P>
   Take the case of Jack Hurley, a computer executive in the South
End who is finding himself the confused _ and now angry _ recipient
of several CDs he never ordered.
</P>
<P>
   Last February, Reader's Digest got Hurley's name from an outside
mailing list and sent him a ``complimentary'' CD called ``Stardust
Moods'' and a coin set, according to the company.
</P>
<P>
   Hurley's initial mailing came with a notice saying that Hurley
could keep it as a gift, and ``if you don't send anything back to
us, we'll send you the next one.''
</P>
<P>
   In May, having not heard form Hurley, Reader's Digest sent him a
``Candlelight Classics'' CD, with a bill for $21.
</P>
<P>
   Hurley couldn't remember ordering the CD, but, afraid it was
just a memory lapse, he sent them a check. Last July, Reader's
Digest sent him another CD and another bill.
</P>
<P>
   By now, Hurley was getting upset. When we inquired, Reader's
Digest spokeswoman Donna Pierpont acknowledged that Hurley never
agreed to enter into a long-term relationship to receive these
products. The company, based in Pleasantville, N.Y., simply assumed
he would indicate if he didn't want them anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Pierpont said of consumers, ``You need to let us know if you
don't want to continue with these services.''
</P>
<P>
   Davies of the attorney general's office said in cases such as
these, Hurley would have been wise to simply keep all the things
coming his way, and, to stop future mailings, inform Reader's
Digest that he wants off this list.
</P>
<P>
   He would have been under no obligation to pay, because he never
asked to receive the CDs.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of James and Bernice Johnson of Reading, they
apparently didn't read the fine print from American Family
Publishers, which said their purchase of one cookbook amounted to
being part of a ``continuity product.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple started receiving notices that a cookbook was waiting
for them and would be sent, unless they sent back the post card
within a month stating they didn't want it. ``Quickly, I wrote on
each side of the card `I DON'T WANT THIS!''' James Johnson said in
his letter to us.
</P>
<P>
   These tactics prey on those who may easily feel intimidated into
paying a bill, partly out of fear it may affect their credit
rating. Davies said the state takes seriously all cases in which
consumers are duped into giving up money and can prosecute any
``unfair and deceptive'' practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The companies may be trying to trick someone into thinking
they bought something,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Unwanted loan checks &LR;  &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After reading our column last month about the illegality of
sending unsolicited credit cards in the mail, Ann Grace of Pelham,
N.H., asked whether unsolicited loan checks might also violate
federal law.
</P>
<P>
   She had just received a $5,000 loan check from Fleet Bank, and
said she was ``beyond furious'' because she sees these checks as
gimmicks that prey on the financial vulnerable. (People get instant
cash by depositing them in any bank, then get a coupon book later
to repay the loan.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's crazy,'' she said. ``It gets people into
financial trouble.''
</P>

OPERA HITS THE HIGH NOTE WITH KIDS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Because I have subscribed to the San Francisco
Opera each season since 1981 and always attend the annual Examiner
Opera in the Park concerts, many of my friends and colleagues
assume I've been an opera fan all my life.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, I was 23 before I saw my first live opera _ Verdi's
``La Traviata'' at the New York City Opera _ and I walked out at
the first intermission.
</P>
<P>
   I hadn't a clue what was going on onstage, I found the music
brittle and alienating and I was ... bored. Twenty-five years
later, you would need a large cruise missile to keep me from my
seat in the War Memorial Opera House or from the lawn in front of
the stage Sunday in Golden Gate Park.
</P>
<P>
   How does a person make such a 180-degree turn? Well, I believe
that opera _ like great jazz and poetry _ is imbued with magical
properties. Expose yourself to it (the right way), put out just a
little effort, allow yourself to truly open to its mystical powers,
and the odds are you will understand what all those centuries of
shouting have been about.
</P>
<P>
   Since '81, I have compared opera to sports, religion, drugs and
love. Sometimes it's like all four rolled into one. Also, I am fond
of ``explaining'' operaphilia with this Gustav Mahler observation:
``All theater is an insane asylum; opera is the ward for the
incurables.''
</P>
<P>
   So what is ``the right way'' to expose yourself to opera? Not
the way I chose when I was 23, which was to drink too much scotch
before dinner and walk in cold, as if I were about to plop down and
turn on a TV.
</P>
<P>
   The best and easiest way to enter the transcendental realm is to
ask someone who loves opera to open the door and switch on the
lights for you. (If you happen to be in love with that person, the
process will be a cakewalk. Remember, ``If music be the language of
love, play on.'')
</P>
<P>
   For young people who are fortunate enough to live in the age of
supertitles and in the San Francisco Bay area, there is a totally
painless (and pretty cool) way to begin to explore opera. Thanks to
the San Francisco Opera Guild, the Opera Center and the opera's
education director, Ernest Garcia, about 37,000 students from
grades 3 through 12 are introduced to opera each year.
</P>
<P>
   Programs range from Interactive Opera, in which grade school
kids create their own opera with the help of a professional singer,
to High School Night, where teen-agers doll up and attend a full,
final dress rehearsal.
</P>
<P>
   One recent night, some 1,700 high school kids filled the Opera
House's grand tier and dress circle. At least three wore rhinestone
tiaras and one his father's tux. For more than three hours they
watched Puccini's action-packed story of a Chinese princess named
``Turandot.''
</P>
<P>
   More accustomed to the sounds of Sublime and Third Eye Blind,
the students applauded in all the right places _ including the
moment when the hero melts the angry ice princess with a kiss _ and
cheered like opera vets when the final glorious notes sounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've spent my career in arts education, and what I saw the
other night was the most massive conversion I've ever seen,'' said
Susan Stauter, the artistic director for high schools in the San
Francisco Unified School District. ``The phone has not stopped
ringing and kids keep coming up to teachers in the halls saying, `I
didn't know I liked the opera!' It was an epiphanous evening.''
</P>
<P>
   Stauter said teen-agers were ``still discussing `Turandot' in
intense terms'' as the week wound down.
</P>
<P>
   ``They related to all of it,'' she said. ``They understand the
importance of a first kiss, they liked that he (Richard Margison)
got the girl (Gabriele Schnaut). And little Liu (Svetla Vassileva)
_ they related on a very emotional level to her.
</P>
<P>
   One boy said, `Hey, this is a multicultural experience.' He got
that this was an Italian opera about China'' _ with Germans,
Canadians, Italians, Russians and Americans singing.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Stauter said, the students are clamoring to learn more
about Puccini, production designer David Hockney's art _ and opera.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been on a natural high for days now,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Massive conversion? A natural high? The profundity of a first
kiss? Didn't I tell you opera is like religion, drugs and love? As
for sports, I don't want to gloat but, the night those 1,700 teens
were getting lost in ``Turandot,'' guess what Mark McGwire was
doing in St. Louis?
</P>
<P>
   So, kids. Welcome to the insane asylum. You're gonna love this
ward.

backing President Clinton more strongly than men, despite the Starr

Clinton, is distinctly cool to him. Monica Lewinsky says the
president suggested that he and Hillary might divorce following
their White House years. Did he mean it? By MARIANNE MEANS.

 &HT;    Forgiveness ``too late'' for Clinton?
 &HT;    By Dan Moffett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   As graphic details of President Clinton's indiscretions became
public Sept. 11, his supporters and detractors found themselves
joined in disappointment over what they were learning.
</P>
<P>
   Some tried to forgive, but for others it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our responsibility as Christians is to restore him as soon as
possible,'' said Rev. Reuben Jackson of the Mount Carmel Missionary
Baptist Church in Jupiter. ``This is a terrible thing, but then sin
is a terrible thing. We look at him as a president, but we also
must look at him as a human being. We must forgive.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Leonid Feldman of Temple Emanu-El in Palm Beach believes
the nation must repent as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sickened by the stickers that said, `It's the Economy,
Stupid,' '' he said, referring to Clinton's 1992 campaign platform.
``We have all sinned because we have lost our values. We chose a
president we knew was a liar and not a moral man. In Judaism we
definitely believe in forgiveness. But we all need to be forgiven.
We need to be concerned about much more than the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   At Howley's restaurant in West Palm Beach, Anna McIntosh is a
ranking member of the retirees' breakfast club that has met there
for nearly two decades, attempting to solve the world's problems.
The consensus at Howley's rear table is that Clinton should go.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he had any guts, he'd retire,'' McIntosh said. ``How can we
believe him about anything anymore? I think what's disappointing is
that people don't seem to care about morals any more as long as
they're making money.''
</P>
<P>
   At Rooney's Public House on Clematis Street in West Palm Beach,
bartender Mike Griffin, born in County Mayo, uses a measure of
Irish wisdom to sort through the turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say that to confess a fault freely is the next thing to
being innocent of it,'' Griffin said. ``He has not done that. He
has not been fo

   CLINTON _ NEW YORK _ President Clinton today addresses the two
main threats to his presidency. In a speech on the world financial
crisis to the Council on Foreign Relations, he will try to show

shoring up his political support among his allies. (Deans, Cox News

 By ELAINE RUTH FLETCHER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israeli youths watch more MTV than any other group
of teen-agers in the world. McDonald's has opened 56 outlets in the
country, with more on the way. Superstores like Toys R Us, Ace
Hardware and Tower Records are swallowing up orange groves and
kibbutzim that were once the visual trademarks of the young state.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the Mediterranean climate, more and more Israeli
execs are aping the dress habits and work styles of the American
corporate world _ forgoing the traditional afternoon siestas and
demanding that shirt-sleeved employees don business suits.
</P>
<P>
   The signs of Israel's rapid Americanization stand in sharp
contrast to the images shown on television news _ Jewish settlers
rampaging through the Arab markets of Hebron and black-coated
ultra-Orthodox politicians passing judgment in religious-secular
disputes. For many Israelis, the new American corporate presence is
a welcome symbol of Israel's own aspirations to achieve the
American dream of individual freedom, material success, economic
efficiency and political stability.
</P>
<P>
   Still, how deeply rooted is this cultural transformation? Will
Israel's increased Americanization also lead to a more democratic,
pluralistic and tolerant society? And what values are young
Israelis digesting with their MTV and Big Macs?
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, many of the cultural messages aren't the most
positive ones _ and often the media or corporate outlets themselves
portray only a part of what America is supposed to represent.
</P>
<P>
   Take MTV. For many young Israelis, this is the ultimate symbol
of America today, a youthful, free and sexually daring society.
America's MTV society is also multicultural and multiracial. Since
the multicultural images portrayed on the channel today are
generally African, Hispanic and Asian, MTV-style tolerance doesn't
have much impact on its young Israeli viewers, for whom the issue
is Jewish-Arab relations, says Sam Lehman-Wilzig, an
American-Israeli media expert from Bar Ilan University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israelis have a tendency to distinguish between
multiculturalism around the world, which they understand in
abstract terms, and the Arab-Israeli conflict, which they see as a
security conflict _ a different kettle of fish,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, Lehman-Wilzig adds, there is growing evidence that young
Israelis _ exposed to heavy doses of American films, sitcoms and
videos _ are more self-centered, more prone to alcohol or drug use
and more likely to resort to violence than previous generations of
Israelis _ even though the strength of the Israeli family tends to
mitigate the negative impacts.
</P>
<P>
   Or take another American issue, environmentalism. In the United
States, even corporations like McDonald's, which symbolizes the
throwaway culture, have been belatedly pressed into the campaign to
preserve the planet, creating extensive recycling and environmental
awareness campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, however, while a whopping 56 restaurants have opened
here in just five years, the chain is mum on such topics. It's not
surprising. The introduction of American fast-food chains has
helped spur the transformation of Israel from a conservationist
society _ where everyone went grocery shopping with reusable bags _
into a throwaway culture of plastic and disposables. Israelis today
generate more household waste per capita than any other country
except the United States and Canada _ and they recycle almost
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Most worrisome for Americans, scarce water supplies are being
poisoned with waste from dumps built using technologies from the
1950s _ a factor that is sure to exacerbate tensions between Israel
and its Arab neighbors over control of the region's water sources.
</P>
<P>
   Against this cultural Americanization of Israel, there is the
countervailing influence of the Orthodox and ultra-Orthodox groups,
who today represent 20 to 30 percent of Israel's population _ and
whose numbers are growing. They are the Israelis who often don't
even own a television, and who may not be able to afford to
purchase American-style hamburgers _ or who refuse to do so,
because they may not be kosher.
</P>
<P>
   Many study in yeshivas, and ape the dress styles of Jews of the
18th century. Their kids sing folk songs, Middle Eastern music or
Klezmer tunes _ and know nothing of MTV. Increasingly, in Israel's
westward-looking culture, these Orthodox groups are seen as the
country's last repositories of cultural authenticity and social
solidarity _ even if the culture they represent is intolerant,
insular and increasingly anti-democratic. Americans who are deeply
concerned about making peace between Jews and Palestinians, and
promoting democracy in countries like Israel, need to ask what kind
of values they are exporting to a rapidly changing Israeli society.
</P>
<P>
   Israel, like its Arab neighbors, is in the throes of a cultural
struggle between traditionalism and modernity. It is a struggle
between religious fundamentalism and intellectual liberalism, a
struggle between a Western emphasis on individualism and a more
Eastern sense of social solidarity. The outcome of the cultural
struggle will have a profound impact on the direction of Israeli
society _ and ultimately on the regional peace process.
</P>
<P>
   As long as Western, i.e. American, culture is represented
overwhelmingly in terms of its gross commercialism and
media-sponsored hedonism, then the moral high ground in Israeli
terms will reside with the ultra-Orthodox and the religious
nationalists. Western culture, meanwhile, will increasingly be
reduced to the slogans and easy icons of the food, clothes and
music products that youths here so readily consume. Neither
prospect seems to bode well for the future of a country in which so
much American prestige and political clout are invested.
</P>
<P>
   American corporations that are becoming increasingly active in
Israel should do more to promote values on which everyone can agree
_ cultural tolerance, environmentalism and democracy, or even
employee exercise and health.
</P>
<P>
   Such corporate initiatives are still so rare here that they are
sure to generate broad publicity for any company involved. One good
example is the photo campaign conducted last year by the Italian
housewares and apparel company, United Colors of Benetton. Benetton
sent internationally renowned photographer Oliviero Toscani to
Israel, the West Bank and Gaza to photograph examples of
cooperation, communication and fellowship between Israelis and
Palestinians. The campaign's attempt to portray moments of positive
contact between Jews and Arabs was followed here with great
interest, debate and curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that when American companies move into a
country like Israel, they are not just marketing their products,
but American culture as a whole. When corporations promote, even in
a cautious way, values like tolerance, democracy or environmental
awareness, they have done a great deal.
</P>
<P>
   If MTV, which plans to sponsor an hour a day of local
MTV-Israel, opts to air video clips of Arab singers, or mixed
Jewish-Arab performing groups, it'll have a major long-term impact
on the prospects for peace in the region _ more so than any
presidential peace initiative, or Middle East shuttle mission.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask any Israeli teen-ager.

 &HT;    HOW I SPENT MY BALTIC VACATION: A little bit of home half a
world away
 &HT;    Eds: Last in a series of reports from Russia and the Baltics.

   ``If you suffer from spinal column and joint, peripheral nervous
and digestive systems, coronary heart and gynecological diseases,
you will be successfully treated here.'' _ Brochure promoting the
healing mineral waters and mud baths of Druskininkai, Lithuania.
</P>
<P>
   DRUSKININKAI _ It's been that way for more than 200 years, so
who am I to say otherwise?
</P>
<P>
   Heaven knows I feel better just being here. For a fact I feel
right at home.
</P>
<P>
   Druskininkai, located 75 miles southwest of Lithuania's capital
city of Vilnius, is a community surrounded by pine forests, lakes
and rivers, same as my little hometown of Lufkin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   They even barbecue, though with birch instead of hickory or
mesquite.
</P>
<P>
   Big improvement over Lufkin: No traffic is allowed for blocks in
every direction at the center of the town.
</P>
<P>
   My kind of place. My kind of folks.
</P>
<P>
   Not that we can understand a word the other is saying.
</P>
<P>
   English isn't spoken here, other than ``yes'' or ``no.'' Mostly
no.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to check into the hotel, I asked if they took Visa.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' the desk clerk said.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Express?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How about 100 dollar bills?'' I said with a wink and a grin.
</P>
<P>
   He winked back. ``No,'' he said, grinning.
</P>
<P>
   That's when I knew I was in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   But not for long. I managed to find a bank that would accept
American money in exchange for their two-bit Lithuanian litas,
valued at four to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not complaining. Prices are cheap. In the Baltic's major
cities, I'd been paying at least $100 a night for a hotel room.
Here it's half of that for a suite with full kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when I tried to tip a waitress five litas, she refused.
Too much, she indicated.
</P>
<P>
   That's mainly how we communicate, by indicating.
</P>
<P>
   I even have trouble ordering a meal. What I do is take whatever
they offer. Maybe it's better that way, not knowing. I know for a
fact that a favorite dish is fried pig's ear.
</P>
<P>
   On this particular day I stopped at a grocery store for a loaf
of bread, a hunk of cheese and a bottle containing some of their
healing water. This particular brand, Alus Darykla, has been brewed
hereabouts since 1902. ``5.4 percent alk.,'' the label said. Just
about right, I'd say.
</P>
<P>
   The bread was black and of sufficient density to anchor a small
rowboat. The yellow cheese was tasty enough. At least I thought so.
</P>
<P>
   I offered a piece to a passing dog. The dog passed on it.
</P>
<P>
   I further studied the label on the cheese. I wondered what the
Lithuanian word for ``cheese'' is. I wondered what the Lithuanian
word for ``candlewax'' is.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. The sun was warm, the air was cool. I'd parked myself
on a park bench next to Druskininkai's Orthodox church, a wooden
structure built in 1865, painted a bright blue and trimmed in
white, and glorious with its crown of onion domes.
</P>
<P>
   A believer stopped outside the door to make the sign of the
cross three times, each time bowing from the waist and touching the
earth with her fingers. It touched my heart.
</P>
<P>
   The older ladies passed. I smiled and tipped my cap. They
returned my smile.
</P>
<P>
   The younger ladies passed. I smiled and tipped my cap. They
quickened their pace.
</P>
<P>
   When I left, I left the remaining food and drink behind, a gift
for man or bird or beast.
</P>
<P>
   My kind of place. My kind of folks.

 &HT;    SHORTTAKES: IRS image damaged
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometime during the glasnost era, as everyone dedicated himself
to the freshly arrived principles of democracy, some KGB delegates
in the Russian parliament got it all wrong by proposing to toss
anyone opposing free speech in the clink previously reserved for
poets. The poor fellows were just trying to humanize the KGB the
only way they knew.
</P>
<P>
   Our Internal Revenue Service has been in the penalty box for
these many months after congressional hearings portrayed the agency
as at least insensitive to the fiscal pain of others. The IRS swore
it would never do a lot of these things again, and would be warmer,
more open, consumer-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS kept its head down, presumably contemplating the
complexities of niceness. Until the other day, when Mark McGwire
prepared to hit his 62nd homerun. Speculation rose that if a fan
caught the ball, and gave it to McGwire, the IRS would levy a gift
tax of 40 percent of a presumed value of $1 million. It would be
just the luck of some bag lady to careen fragrantly into the
ballpark and catch the home run in her shopping cart while in a
generous mood. Contemplating this fantasy was more than most people
could bear.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that the IRS actually threatened such mind-boggling
chintziness _ it now says it won't _ but that it was careful not to
deny it. For the IRS to even hint that it would not collect a tax
just sitting there was like asking the KGB to forswear socking a
kulak in the snoot. Months of work out the window! The IRS is
reportedly putting out a book of CPA jokes to repair its damaged
image.

in the Russian parliament got it all wrong by proposing to toss
anyone opposing free speech in the clink previously reserved for
poets. The poor fellows were just trying to humanize the KGB the
only way they knew.
</P>
<P>
   Our Internal Revenue Service has been in the penalty box for
these many months after congressional hearings portrayed the agency
as at least insensitive to the fiscal pain of others. The IRS swore
it would never do a lot of these things again, and would be warmer,
more open, consumer-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS kept its head down, presumably contemplating the
complexities of niceness. Until the other day, when Mark McGwire
prepared to hit his 62nd homerun. Speculation rose that if a fan
caught the ball, and gave it to McGwire, the IRS would levy a gift
tax of 40 percent of a presumed value of $1 million. It would be
just the luck of some bag lady to careen fragrantly into the
ballpark and catch the home run in her shopping cart while in a
generous mood. Contemplating this fantasy was more than most people
could bear.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that the IRS actually threatened such mind-boggling
chintziness _ it now says it won't _ but that it was careful not to
deny it. For the IRS to even hint that it would not collect a tax
just sitting there was like asking the KGB to forswear socking a
kulak in the snoot. Months of work out the window! The IRS is
reportedly putting out a book of CPA jokes to repair its damaged
image.

   SCI-MULLIS-DNA (Undated) _ Kary Mullis won the Nobel Prize for
his inventions known as the polymerase chain reaction or PCR, used
for amplifying chosen sections of DNA. It has quickly become an
essential tool for biologists, DNA forensics labs, and almost
anyone else who needs to study the genetic material. But science
has been just one of the keen interests in Mullis's life, competing
with psychedelic drugs and women. Nowadays he is pursuing his
writing and venting his contempt for corrupt science in his highly
unorthodox ways. By Nicholas Wade. (2200 words)

   SCI-NURSE-STUDY (Undated) _ More than 20 years ago, a doctor
curious about the effects of long-term oral contraceptive use sent
questionnaires to 370,000 registered nurses. The answers he and
colleagues have since received have turned into the largest and
longest study ever of a group of women. This massive scientific
effort has only begun to pay dividends. With many of the original
participants now entering their 60s and 70s, the study promises to
bequeath an even greater wealth of knowledge, much of it otherwise
unattainable, about how a lifetime of choices in food, drink,
exercise and medications can translate into protection from or
increased risk of deadly and debilitating diseases. By Carol Kaesuk
Yoon. (2000 words)

   SCI-NASA-SMALL (Undated) _ NASA has been shifting focus away
from costly, large satellites and space probes, touting a number of
successes with smaller, less expensive craft that exemplify its new
``faster, better, cheaper'' philosophy of doing business. From its
highly successful Pathfinder mission, which left a small robot
rover crawling about Mars, to new probes heading for asteroids and
comets, and small satellites measuring tropical rainfall or
atmospheric gases on Earth, the space agency says it has ample
evidence the streamlined approach is working. By Warren E. Leary.

   SCI-GENOME-CHALLENGE (Undated) _ In response to the free-market
challenge of Bruce Venter, government scientists on the Human
Genome Project say they will finish mapping the human blueprint in
2003, two years earlier than planned. That would still be two years
behind Venter's target date of 2001, but the government scientists
say that by that time they will have, more accurately than their
rival, sequenced the gene-rich portions of the human genome. By
Nicholas Wade.

   SCI-WEDDING-BUTTERFLIES (Undated) _ Basking in their first
moment of nuptial bliss, brides and grooms around the country are
exiting churches, showered not with rice or confetti, but
surrounded instead by the fluttering gossamer wings of hundreds of
butterflies. The releases are the latest fashion at weddings, and
are now even taking flight at memorial services, grand openings,
divorces and prison releases. But while some view the release of
butterflies as an uplifting celebration of natural beauty, many
others _ including conservationists, scientists and amateur
butterfly enthusiasts _ see it as a misguided practice that poses
serious risks to the wild butterfly population and compromises
scientists' ability to study phenomena like the annual migration of
the monarch butterfly. By Carol Kaesuk Yoon. (1800 words)

   SCI-THUNDERCLOUDS (Undated) _ A new Earth satellite, launched
last fall, captured a series of radar images of skyscraper-like
thunderclouds rising more than 11 miles into the atmosphere from
the center of Hurricane Bonnie on Aug. 22. So powerful were the
forces producing the clouds that they actually punched through the
upper boundary of the troposphere, the dense lower layer of the
atmosphere, by one to three miles. By William K. Stevens.

   MIAMI _ Sure, lurid details of President Bill Clinton's alleged
sexual exploits have riveted the world this past week. But few can
amuse _ or bemuse _ the masses like Latin American presidents when
it comes to affairs of the heart.
</P>
<P>
   Argentine President Carlos Menem once locked his wife out of the
presidential palace. Peru's President Alberto Fujimori once locked
his in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Presidents in Latin America have certainly had their share of
affairs,'' said Eduardo Gamarra, who heads the Latin American and
Caribbean Center at Florida International University. ``This kind
of thing is considered to be a badge of honor, not dishonor.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Latin American presidents like to be pictured with
wives and children, just like their U.S. counterparts, political
mistresses are part of the accepted political landscape.
</P>
<P>
   And first ladies are, in general, expected to be like children:
seen, and not heard.
</P>
<P>
   Latin presidents have faced scandals so lascivious that they
make the case involving former White House intern Monica Lewinsky
look like Clinton was merely late for a formal dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Take Fujimori, who separated from his wife of 20 years, Susana
Higuchi, in August 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Their bitter arguments became public in a most sensational
manner during the campaign leading up to the presidential election
of 1995, with Higuchi publicly accusing Fujimori of being corrupt
and of overlooking the needs of Peru's poor.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Fujimori even locked his charismatic wife into the
presidential palace for four days, during which time Higuchi leaned
out of a fourth-story window and shouted allegations against her
husband to tickled journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually she launched her own opposition party and sued her
husband for ``psychological violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Their divorce became final in 1995, but not before she told
reporters that he was lousy in bed.
</P>
<P>
   But afterwards, Fujimori's became even more popular with voters,
both men and women.
</P>
<P>
   In Argentina, a similar soap opera unfolded in 1990 when Menem _
often called the region's master of machismo _ ordered soldiers to
remove his wife of 30 years, Zulema, from the presidential palace
just a year after he was first elected.
</P>
<P>
   She was ejected from their residence after staunchly criticizing
her husband's social policies to anybody who'd listen.
</P>
<P>
   Argentine television later showed his wife and children being
turned away from the doors of the palace by security officers.
</P>
<P>
   Menem _ who's called himself ``a seducer, not a womanizer'' _
has not only been accused of chronic infidelity, but of corruption,
wife abuse, and of having ties to drug smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   During one particularly titillating press conference, Menem
declared that, contrary to Madonna's claims in Vanity Fair
magazine, he had not leered at her breasts during a dinner party.

   But he's survived nicely, thanks to low inflation, a balanced
budget, and years of economic stability.
</P>
<P>
   The late Chilean President Salvador Allende didn't even live
with his wife until they both moved into the presidential palace
after his election in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   And he never hid his long relationship with a personal
secretary, Mirian Contreras, who was constantly at his side, both
publicly and privately.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Larry Birns, who heads the Council on Hemispheric Affairs in
Washington, D.C., said this explains why Latin Americans so are
completely befuddled over why Americans are so worked up over
Clinton's dalliance with an intern.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of thing happens so regularly in Latin America that
the Clinton scandal would be pretty mild by comparison,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Birns said that sex and politics have been intertwined in Latin
America since the days of Simon Bolivar.

   It's the garbage can that got glamour. Since its introduction
two years ago, the Umbra company's Garbo can, in black, white and
translucent colors, has moved from a best seller at such humble
retailers as Linens and Things and Bed, Bath and Beyond to become a
celebrity of the design world. It has been celebrated in the
Italian design press from Domus to Interni, the Milan-based
magazine on whose current cover it appears, and this fall it will
get its own ads in Vogue.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a heady trip for a humble object of high-impact virgin
polypropylene that retails for $10 or $12. With nearly a million
copies of Garbo and its smaller sister Garbino sold, Umbra is
offering the cans in 17 new colors this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The name was important to the can's appeal. It was born in a
brainstorming session, said Paul Rowan, who founded and runs the
Buffalo, N.Y.-based Umbra with Les Mandelbaum. The name Toss was
tossed about. The ideas of romantic curves and Hollywood were
raised. Then a salesman, whose name no one remembers, pronounced
the word Garbo.
</P>
<P>
   Designed by Karim Rashid, 38, who was born in Cairo, grew up in
Britain and the United States, studied in Italy and worked in
Canada, Garbo has an international following. Rashid calls his
style ``sensuous minimalism,'' and the lines of, say, the metal
salt and pepper shakers and candlesticks he designs for Nambe
suggest a similar fluidity.
</P>
<P>
   But Garbo's shape also grew from Rashid's scrupulous study of
the markets and methods of the waste-container business. When he
travels, he visits malls and grocery stores to see competing
products _ the less expensive, the more closely he looks. He visits
factories to makes himself an expert on the molding methods that
create Garbo.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Garbo's sensual shapes come less from any natural model
than from the methods of the factory floor. The shape began with
Pilot Fineliner drawings in Rashid's sketchbooks and progressed
through images rotated, spun and varied on the computer, where
Rashid does most of his work. The shapes are deceptively simple. A
circle is pulled up and out to form the walls. At the top, ``the
saddle, or butterfly cut, makes it look elliptical,'' Rashid said,
and provides a natural place for the ``negative space'' of handles.
``It's a play on geometry,'' he added. The rounded interior bottom
also makes for easier cleaning, a detail Rashid is proud of.
</P>
<P>
   Garbo is almost a cartoon of how to make an easy-to-mold shape.
It's a model of the means of its own manufacture _ of little
interest to the buyer who sees simply graceful forms but of much
interest to the guys at the factory _ and to Rowan. When he speaks
of Garbo, he exudes pride in its sales, but there was even more
satisfaction in his voice when he said, ``the productivity of the
tool is very high.''
</P>
<P>
   Rashid has one worry about Garbo: that its success will
overshadow his work in furniture (at Totem, a store in Manhattan's
Tribeca) and lighting. ``I'd hate to think it might be like a hit
song that ends up on VH1 15 years later,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Garbo was joined by the smaller Garbino after Umbra found that
Japanese and some European buyers considered the five-quart-plus
version too big. Now, Garbino outsells Garbo. Just arrived are
Garbanzo, a swing-top kitchen garbage can, and Garbowl, a fruit
bowl with lines similar to the original.
</P>
<P>
   But people like Garbo so much they use it for other purposes.
Umbra now describes it as an alternative storage medium. A worker
at Umbras Buffalo factory uses Garbos as horse feeders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen it used in Soho galleries as an umbrella stand,''
Rashid said. People put flowers in it. And customers find that
Garbino, with its round bottom full of ice, functions well as a
Champagne bucket.

THE SEX IS IMPEACHABLE 
</HEADLINE>
  By HERBERT STEIN 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I don't think the sexual peccadillo aspect of the thing is
trivial or irrelevant, as some high-minded people are telling us. I
think what he perjured himself about is important.
</P>
<P>
   If he just perjured himself about the score of his golf game no
one would care much. And if he perjured himself to protect the
secrecy of some planned national security operation, we would
forgive him. Eisenhower lied about whether we had a spy plane
flying over the Soviet Union--although not under oath.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton lied to protect himself against public reaction to
what I am old enough to consider revolting behavior.
</P>
<P>
   So, what is to be done? Have you read the 25th Amendment to the
Constitution lately? It prescribes a process for removing a
president who is incapable of performing the duties of his office.
</P>
<P>
   I think Clinton has become incapable. He can no longer speak to
anyone and expect to be believed and taken seriously. It is as if
he had developed a major speech impairment. He is suffering from
clinical depression, congenital falsehood and priapism. (You can
look it up.)
</P>
<P>
   So, what else is new?

CLINTON AND THE MEANING OF ``IS''  
</HEADLINE>
  By TIMOTHY NOAH 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Years from now, when we look back on Bill Clinton's presidency,
its defining moment may well be Clinton's rationalization to the
grand jury about why he wasn't lying when he said to his top aides
that with respect to Monica Lewinsky, ``there's nothing going on
between us.''
</P>
<P>
   How can this be? Here's what Clinton told the grand jury
(according to footnote 1,128 in Starr's report):
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on what the meaning of the word 'is' is. If the--if
he--if 'is' means is and never has been, that is not--that is one
thing. If it means there is none, that was a completely true
statement....Now, if someone had asked me on that day, are you
having any kind of sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky, that is,
asked me a question in the present tense, I would have said no. And
it would have been completely true.''
</P>
<P>
   The distinction between ``is'' and ``was'' was seized on by the
commentariat when Clinton told Jim Lehrer of PBS right after the
Lewinsky story broke, ``There is no improper relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   It turns out Bill Clinton really is a guy who's willing to think
carefully about ``what the meaning of the word 'is' is.'' This is
way beyond slick. Perhaps we should start calling him,
``Existential Willie.''

THE SEX IS UNIMPEACHABLE 
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID PLOTZ 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   So this is what $40 million buys these days: A two-buck
Harlequin with a stalker for a heroine and a cad for a hero.
</P>
<P>
   The report effectively confirms Clinton's basic defense:
Whatever wrongs he committed were simply those required to cover up
a dumb affair, not grotesque crimes against the state.
</P>
<P>
   The first tactical error is telling Americans only what they
already know. The second is telling the story through Monica. This
makes for fantastic reading--the report is mesmerizing, emotionally
wrenching--but bad evidence. This tale indicts Clinton more for his
romantic failures than for his legal ones. His crimes are against
Monica.
</P>
<P>
   The most telling line of the report is a Linda Tripp quotation
buried in a footnote: Monica had a ``photographic memory of the
relationship.'' The report is that memory, and it is exactly what
men imagine that their ex-girlfriends do: Compile an elaborate,
complete dossier of every moment of the relationship and of every
single thing you did wrong. This is romance as seen through the
eyes of an obsessive, loving, insecure twit.
</P>
<P>
   So what are readers left with? Too much detail and too little.
We learn everything about Clinton's sexual habits, but the report
excludes inconvenient characters. Linda Tripp, Lucianne Goldberg
and erratic mother Marcia Lewis are virtually absent from the
narrative. Starr doesn't explain how Lewinsky came to the attention
of Jones' lawyers, hardly mentions Tripp's sleazy taping and
doesn't discuss Tripp's planned book deal.
</P>
<P>
   Starr also diminishes the role of Clinton's aides to make the
president look worse. By painting aides such as John Podesta and
Sidney Blumenthal--who were not born yesterday--as innocent,
wronged dupes, Starr keeps the focus on what he sees as the
singularity of evil: Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But Starr doesn't seem to realize that what he is reporting is
not really evil. It is more mundane: everyday selfishness, weakness
and venality, and the efforts to hide it.
</P>
<P>
   Monica was right: Clinton is just a Big Creep. He can rest easy
because the report--thin on public crime and fat on private
squalor--makes him safe from impeachment. But it also makes him
impossible to take seriously again.

SENATORS TO STRIP OFF ANTI-ENVIRONMENTAL RIDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First
Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is

 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   
 c. 1998 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The current Senate Interior Appropriations bill is piled high
with more than a dozen anti-environmental riders. These riders are
intended to carve out exceptions to environmental law or lower the
level of environmental protections for public lands. ``Mugging the
environment,'' The New York Times called the process _ carried out
in the darker recesses of Capitol Hill, hidden from public view.
</P>
<P>
   A few senators will step into the light this week and introduce
amendments to strip off the worst of these riders.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., the ranking Democrat on the Senate's
Environment and Public Works Committee, will lead the charge
against the environment muggers. He plans to introduce an amendment
to strip eight riders from the Interior spending bill.
</P>
<P>
   One of the provisions in the Baucus amendment clashes with his
fellow senator from Montana, Republican Conrad Burns. Burns added a
rider that would terminate the ongoing public process of grizzly
bear reintroduction into the Selway-Bitterroot wilderness area of
Idaho and Montana. The Burns rider eliminates the state-level
public discussion and process to create a successful grizzly bear
plan. The Baucus amendment will strip off that rider _ in effect,
leaving grizzly recovery plan in the hands of those citizens living
closest to the recovery area.
</P>
<P>
   The Baucus amendment, if passed by the full Senate, will peel
off a rider that would prevent the National Park Service from
enforcing regulations to protect wildlife and to phase out
commercial fishing in Glacier Bay National Park in Alaska.
Commercial fishing is prohibited in all national park units.
</P>
<P>
   The Baucus amendment would pluck off a rider that would
authorize the construction of a $30-million road through the middle
of the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. The road is
opposed by 56 Native Alaskan villages in the region, taxpayer
groups and sportsmen.
</P>
<P>
   Baucus also targets a rider that would override the Endangered
Species Act in managing the Columbia River dams and ecosystem _
thereby severely restricting efforts to restore endangered and
threatened Pacific salmon.
</P>
<P>
   And four riders that would profoundly impact our national
forests could be scraped off by the Baucus amendment:
</P>
<P>
   1. Tongass National Forest rider that requires the U.S. Forest
Service to offer 240 million board feet of timber a year for sale,
or allows the timber companies to sue the USFS. It also requires
the agency to pay local communities 25 percent of the value of the
timber not harvested.
</P>
<P>
   2. A rider that would prevent the USFS from using prescribed
fire to remove brush until all commercial timber has been cut from
the area. The economic value of the stronger, fire-resistant trees
would cause them to be the first to be logged. The loss of these
trees undermines the point of a prescribed burn to restore balance
in the ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
   3. A rider that would prevent the USFS from removing dangerous
and environmentally damaging roads until all roads that were
created by illegal off-road vehicles have been closed or upgraded.
Many of these unauthorized roads are unrecorded and an inventory
would cause lengthy delays in the process.
</P>
<P>
   4. A rider that would prevent the USFS from updating plans to
manage national forests.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., will introduce an amendment to
reduce taxpayer subsidies for timber sales and logging roads. A
rider on the Interior spending bill would increase these subsidies
by well over $24 million.
</P>
<P>
   An amendment by Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., targets a rider that
prevents the Secretary of the Interior from updating environmental
regulations governing hardrock mining on public lands.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 requires the
secretary of interior to ``take any action necessary, by regulation
or otherwise to prevent unnecessary or undue degradation on the
federal lands.'' The rider interferes with this law and puts a
moratorium on any revisions to the regulations. Taxpayers are
paying for cleaning up abandoned hardrock mines to the tune of $70
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment offered by Sen. Max Cleland, D-Ga., will restore
the $6.4 million from funds appropriated in the fiscal year 1998
for the acquisition of lands within the Cumberland Island National
Seashore. The money comes from royalty payments from offshore
drilling and is put into the Land and Water Conservation Fund. The
$6.4 million is an overdue payment on a purchase agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Sens Bob Graham, D-Fla., and Dirk Kempthorne, R-Idaho, will seek
to increase the level of funding for the operations and maintenance
of National Wildlife Refuges to the level requested in the
president's budget.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., will act to restore funding to
the Land and Water Conservation Fund. States use money from this
fund to purchase new recreational areas.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed amendments do not solve all the environmental
problems with the Senate Interior spending bill. For instance,
drastic cuts in funds for the Florida Everglades jeopardizes the
restoration plan. So far no senator has stepped forward to rectify
the situtation.
</P>
<P>
   If some of the key pro-environment amendments do not pass, the
president may veto the Interior Appropriations bill. In the last
Congress, Republicans attempted to eviscerate environmental law
using riders to appropriations bills _ but the public knew who was
to blame when Clinton vetoed them and brought federal agencies to a
halt.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the president's current problems, the public will
not be fooled into blaming him for a veto that blocks any serious
move to gut environmental protections. More than 70 percent of the
American public support strong environmental laws.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Basking in their first moment of nuptial bliss, brides and
grooms around the country are exiting churches, showered not with
rice or confetti, but surrounded instead by the fluttering gossamer
wings of hundreds of butterflies. All but unheard of just a few
years ago, butterfly releases are the latest fashion at weddings,
not to mention at memorial services, grand openings, divorces and
prison releases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beautiful flight of the butterflies as they ascended _ it
captured the beauty and the spirit of the day,'' said Dr. Patricia
Heaman of White Haven, Pa., who ordered a ``mixed bouquet'' of
several species of butterflies for the garden wedding last month of
her nature-loving daughter. ``It just seemed like the natural
culmination to a natural event.''
</P>
<P>
   But while some view the release of butterflies as a celebration
of natural beauty, many others _ including conservationists,
scientists and amateur butterfly enthusiasts _ see it as a
misguided practice that poses serious risks to wild butterfly
populations and compromises scientists' ability to study phenomena
like the annual migration of the monarch butterfly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really such a disgusting development,'' said Dr. Jeffrey
Glassberg, president of the North American Butterfly Association in
Morristown, N.J. ``Environmentally, it's the worst thing you could
do at your wedding.''
</P>
<P>
   With confetti and rice frowned upon as environmentally
incorrect, many couples choose butterflies as a green alternative.
Dr. Robert Michael Pyle, the founder of the Xerces Society, an
insect conservation organization based in Portland, Ore., and an
outspoken critic, said: ``It's getting absolutely mad. People are
making these butterflies into baubles.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite such objections, the butterfly breeding business is
unlikely to go away soon. About 60 companies are in operation, many
having sprung up in the last year or two, said Dr. Robert Flanders,
senior entomologist at the U.S. Department of Agriculture in charge
of regulation of butterfly releases. Tens of thousands of
butterflies are being sold each season, with monarchs the most
popular for weddings, at $10 each or $100 a dozen.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists say the most serious threat to wild populations is
the potentially rapid spread of disease. Sonia Altizer, disease
ecologist at the University of Minnesota in St. Paul and one of the
few scientists studying monarch diseases, said, ``In natural
populations, there are all sorts of parasites present that aren't a
problem until you do captive breeding at high densities in close
quarters.''
</P>
<P>
   With dealers shipping the butterflies by overnight mail all
around the country, a localized outbreak of disease could spread
quickly. She added, ``I'm definitely not in favor of releases.''
</P>
<P>
   But breeders interviewed are adamant that their colonies are
clean. They say they regularly check for the best-known malady of
monarchs: a devastating parasite named Ophryocystis, which can wipe
out whole colonies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We run an extremely tight ship,'' said Jacob Groth, a recent
college graduate who studied business and now owns one of the
largest of the new companies, Swallowtail Farms, in Carmichael,
Calif. ``When diseases do come through, they are caught immediately
and destroyed. A butterfly operation can't last too long if it's
sending out diseased butterflies.''
</P>
<P>
   But most diseases of monarchs, scientists say, remain unknown or
little understood, so that even the most conscientious breeders
cannot diagnose or even recognize them.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Ms. Altizer said, many people raise caterpillars on
drugs that can suppress diseases caused by protozoa and bacteria
but not eliminate them. When such apparently healthy butterflies
are released, they can act as carriers, spreading disease.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, new diseases continue to appear. Dr. David
Marriott, founder of the Monarch Program, a non-profit research and
education organization based in Encinitas, Calif., said he receives
inquiries every week from various callers about diseases that are
killing off monarchs. While most breeders have learned to deal with
Ophryocystis, now another disease is plaguing those who are trying
to raise monarch butterflies. Marriott said that he suspects it is
a protozoan parasite known as Nosema.
</P>
<P>
   Breeders point out that critics lack any hard data that shows
releases have damaged wild butterflies. ``If I saw definite proof
that shows this is hurting them, I would've stopped in a minute,''
said Rick Mikula, who sells butterflies through his company, Hole
in Hand, in Hazleton, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   But such proof will be difficult if not impossible to come by,
given that once the butterflies are released, they are
indistinguishable from wild butterflies. If commercial butterflies
are spreading disease or corrupting scientific studies, they will
probably do so without anyone ever knowing.
</P>
<P>
   With so many human-raised butterflies in the wild, researchers
say it is already impossible to know whether butterflies they catch
in the wild are from that area or from a wedding that took place
nearby. Releases make it impossible to confidently study migration
routes, the incidence of disease or such basic things as where
different species of butterflies can be found. Unfortunately for
biologists, the two most commonly released butterflies, monarchs
and painted ladies, are two of the few butterflies that actually
have a migration pattern to study.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unnecessarily muddling the biology of the monarch
butterfly,'' said Dr. Lincoln Brower, a biologist at Sweet Briar
College in Virginia who has worked on monarchs for 20 years and
published articles arguing against the release of monarchs.
</P>
<P>
   In this battle, which both sides say is getting uglier, breeders
find little that is compelling in such arguments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chance of finding a butterfly that's been released is not
enough to where it's worthwhile putting a bunch of people out of
business and ruining something that is so special to a lot of
people,'' Groth said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Though butterfly enthusiasts, teachers and scientists have moved
small numbers of butterflies and released them for years, the USDA
began to get involved only when commercial releases began to boom a
few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Flanders has been criticized for regulations that breeders
describe as ``overbearing'' and that conservationists say are too
liberal. He tries to be conservative in what he will permit,
Flanders said. In order to ship butterflies across state lines for
release, breeders must obtain a permit from USDA. Nine species are
permitted for release.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something irretrievable can happen,'' said Flanders, referring
to the devastating effects of events like the inadvertent
introduction to the United States of gypsy moths, an insect which
has decimated forests at various times. ``If I make the wrong
decision, it could impact this society for many centuries.''
</P>
<P>
   Breeders prefer to focus on the brighter side of things.
</P>
<P>
   Balloons, confetti and birdseed are today viewed as just so much
littering. Rice is not only difficult to clean up, but some fear
that birds can be harmed when the rice they eat expands. The ads
for breeders use phrases like ``ecologically sound'' and ``enhance
the environment'' when describing butterfly releases.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to get into a green business,'' said Gordon Laatz,
who left the telecommunications business last year to begin
breeding butterflies as Painted Sky Butterflies in West Bloomfield,
Mich. ``We might take two dozen butterflies out and then put five
or six thousand back into the environment and give them a chance to
replenish their numbers. I think it's alarmist to say we shouldn't
do it just because we don't know what the consequences are.''
</P>
<P>
   Most important, breeders say, are the many stories they hear of
customers changed forever by a profound experience with released
butterflies. Chris Hundley of Magical Beginnings in Los Gatos,
Calif., who along with his partner was formerly in the computer
business, said: ``The thing I like best is the emotions, reactions
and how much a butterfly can touch somebody. Butterflies are just
so happy.''
</P>
<P>
   While there are a few fairly large businesses, most breeders
work out of their garages or back bedrooms, with little overhead,
and sell via the World Wide Web. Most people attribute the rapid
growth of this cottage industry to Mikula, a former machinist who
several years ago began giving seminars on raising butterflies.
While Mikula said his seminars are more for butterfly lovers than
entrepreneurs, many breeders and scientists say it has been his
descriptions of the money to be made that have gotten so many
started. A Web page advertisement for Mikula's next seminar, which
costs $195 for one day, describes butterfly farming as ``a
lucrative business opportunity.'' It adds, ``Be prepared to be sold
out at least a year in advance, every year.''
</P>
<P>
   Swallowtail Farms, Groth said, expects to sell nearly 10,000
monarch butterflies this season, priced from $7 to $9 each, double
their sales from last year. John White, marketing director for
Butterfly Celebration, of Shafter, Calif., which sells painted lady
butterflies, said, in just a few years, they had already catered
nearly 4,000 events.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone loves butterflies at weddings.
</P>
<P>
   Rita Bloom, a wedding coordinator at Creative Parties in
Bethesda, Md., described a wedding ceremony in which guests were
asked to release butterflies. ``It was horrendous,'' she said.
``Some people didn't even want to touch them. There were black
crows flying up overhead and people were convinced they were there
for the butterflies. They were brown and looked like moths. Half
were dead or dying. It was a disaster, an absolute disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Flanders said new legislation before Congress
could create much stiffer penalties for rogue breeders, helping to
enforce regulations in what is now largely an honor system.
Individual states are clamping down as well. Arizona, Flanders
said, has banned shipments of butterflies for release into the
state.
</P>
<P>
   But for the moment, more butterflies continue to flitter off in
front of dewy-eyed wedding guests, and conservationists continue to
stew.
</P>
<P>
   Groth was optimistic. ``These scientists are all focusing on
protecting the monarch as if it were a helpless, weak little
creature,'' he said, ``It's hardy. It does just fine on its own.''
</P>
<P>
   But Brower, told of this argument, responded, ``That's probably
what people said about the passenger pigeon 100 years ago.''

CLAMOR OVER CLINTON'S INDISCRETIONS DIVIDES BAPTISTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rev. Paige Patterson, the recently elected president of the
Southern Baptist Convention, has joined the ranks of religious
conservatives calling for the resignation of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   That's not surprising. Neither is it surprising that other,
less-conservative Baptists disagree with Patterson.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's own minister, the Rev. Rex Horne, pastor of Immanuel
Baptist Church in Little Rock, Ark., called the president's
admitted sexual indiscretions with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky ``indefensible and inexcusable.''
</P>
<P>
   But those actions, he added, are not unforgivable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pray the president will find the grace of God which comes
upon confession of sin and the peace which comes from a restored
relationship with our Lord,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson, the former Texan who spearheaded a conservative
revolution among Baptists and now is president of Southeastern
Baptist Theological Seminary in Wake Forest, N.C., said Clinton
should resign for his own good and the good of the nation he
serves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here is a man whose personal life and home and spiritual life
are in disarray,'' he told Baptist Press, the denomination's news
service. ``And no man walking through those kinds of things is in a
position to lead anything.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who used to sing in the choir and play the
saxophone at the Little Rock church where he is a member, has been
increasingly asking for forgiveness for his admitted wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   His pleas even extended to a group of religious leaders he
invited to a White House breakfast Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But Patterson and other religious conservatives, including
Richard Land, head of the Southern Baptist Ethics and Religious
Liberty Commission, say Clinton can no longer be an effective
president or a good role model for the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Stirring more controversy, Albert Mohler, conservative president
of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Ky., even
urged Clinton's church to publicly discipline him.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can President Clinton claim to be a Southern Baptist and
persist in this public display of serial sin? Only because the
congregation which holds his membership has failed to exercise any
semblance of church discipline,'' Mohler wrote in a column for
Religious News Service.
</P>
<P>
   Mohler's words caused Mark Wingfield, editor of the ``Western
Recorder,'' the Baptist news magazine for Kentucky, to reply that
Mohler is interfering with the affairs of a local Baptist church.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Mohler apparently thinks he knows more about how a certain
Arkansas church ought to handle its business than that church
itself knows,'' Wingfield wrote.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most revered Baptist traditions has been the
principle that local congregations are autonomous and govern their
own business without interference from a church hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Hemphill, president of Southwestern Baptist Theological
Seminary in Fort Worth, also says Clinton should resign so that he
can repair the damage done to his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I care for President Clinton as an individual, and he needs to
have the time and seclusion to deal with these critical issues,''
Hemphill said.
</P>
<P>
   More moderate religious leaders say the calls for Clinton's
resignation have a political base.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. C. Welton Gaddy, a Southern Baptist and former Fort
Worth pastor who now is executive director of the Interfaith
Alliance, a Washington-based organization formed to combat
religious conservatives, said those asking Clinton to resign are
using ``personal tragedy to advance partisan political agendas.''
</P>
<P>
   Joan Brown Campbell, general secretary of the National Council
of Churches, called for forgiveness of the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``In such a painful time, the Clinton family deserves our quiet
support. Our churches invite all people to join us in private and
caring prayers,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The prayers and the criticism fall along distinct political
lines. And that's not surprising, either.

POSTAL BOUNDARY CREATES GREAT DIVIDE BETWEEN NEARBY HAMLETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MacCORMACK  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DRYDEN, Texas _ As the crow flies, the eight people who live in
this West Texas hamlet are just 20 miles east of Sanderson, the
seat of Terrell County.
</P>
<P>
   But to mail a letter from Sanderson to Dryden, the letter would
travel 1,200 miles.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for this postal oddity lies in ZIP code boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Sanderson, population 1,012, is in the El Paso ZIP code zone, so
all mail dropped there goes west for processing.
</P>
<P>
   And because Dryden is in the San Antonio postal zone, all mail
from there heads east.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, a letter mailed from Sanderson _ ZIP code 79848 _ to
Dryden _ 78851 _ passes through El Paso, San Antonio and Del Rio
before it's delivered 20 miles from where it was posted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Years ago, we could put something in the mail in Sanderson,
and it would reach Del Rio the next day. Now it takes five to seven
days for mail to get from Sanderson to Del Rio,'' said Marsha
Monroe, the Terrell County attorney.
</P>
<P>
   For locals, this postal equivalent to the Continental Divide is
overcome by ingenuity and persistence.
</P>
<P>
   Fax machines and Federal Express service are very popular in
Sanderson. And there also is the daily mail shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband ranches in that area. He doesn't leave town without
taking mail to Dryden,'' Monroe said. ``The lady who drives the
school bus also carries mail for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if nothing else is available, we call the courthouse or
the wool house looking for a rancher going east.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone from my office is going to Dryden, we call the bank
and the title company to see if they have any mail to take over,
and they do the same for us,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At the old Dryden Mercantile, which sells fossils, ram's heads,
beer and snacks and also houses the post office, a steady stream of
motorists arrives each morning, bearing mail heading east.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent day, Mike Hill and his 3-year-old cowpuncher son,
Hayden Claude Hill, rolled in shortly before noon with a land
payment bound for Houston, more than 350 miles east of Dryden.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes six or eight days from Sanderson. From here it takes
two or three days,'' Hill said as he finished his paperwork on the
steering wheel of his truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mail issue is part of life here,'' Hill said. ``I've got a
ranch north of here. I come by five times a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Dudley Harrison, the executive of Terrell County, said he fought
for years to get postal authorities to restore the connection with
Dryden. But postal officials in El Paso and San Antonio said the
issue is beyond appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much mail are you talking about? Who in Sanderson writes
to Dryden?'' asked Manny Martinez, the network transportation
manager in El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   ``There used to be an 18-wheeler that went from San Antonio to
Sanderson when Sanderson was a booming town, but now that it's died
down to almost nothing _ a ghost town _ they discontinued that
route,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Gossage, a postal network specialist in San Antonio, said
he ultimately gave up the struggle to connect the two towns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel really bad for them. It's the county seat, and it's a
unique situation,'' he said. ``I did everything I could, but it was
not to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Gossage said, ZIP code boundaries have to fall
somewhere, and it was just Sanderson's bad luck that the West Texas
divide fell where it does.
</P>
<P>
   To make a special accommodation, he said, would require changing
routes and ZIP codes and wouldn't be cost-effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you gave me the power to fix it, I could do it, but it
would cost $20,000 a year and someone would gripe spending that on
14 letters a week,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he said, it used to be worse. Until a couple of years
ago, all mail from Sanderson east was routed from El Paso to Dallas
to San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Even under the current system, he said, a letter mailed from
Sanderson to Dryden should take only two days to arrive.

 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIN WHANG and SHERRY JOE CROSBY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Melissa Perea is like most teen-age girls:
gregarious, into fashion, dreading school and worrying about boys.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike most of her peers, the 16-year-old was born with a
port wine stain, a condition that left a splotch on the left side
of her face. And unlike many with port wine stains, Melissa doesn't
cover it with makeup and has chosen not to have it removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get a couple of stares, and people might ask, but it doesn't
bother me,'' said the Van Nuys teen-ager, who recently started her
junior year at Notre Dame High School in Sherman Oaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think of it as a problem. I think of it as a special
thing that makes me unique,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her self-acceptance makes her stand out in the crowd, not only
among her peers at Kaiser Permanente Craniofacial Clinic's first
``Back-to-School Blowout,'' a program designed for returning high
school and college patients, but also among her peers at school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teens are very self-conscious of their appearance,'' said
Andrew Wexler, a plastic surgeon at the Kaiser Permanente
Craniofacial Clinic. ``They're at a time in their life where
they're going through a tremendous amount of bodily changes.
They're interested in the opposite sex, they're very concerned with
their appearance, and for a child growing up with a facial
deformity, that can be very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   That's where the clinic's back-to-school program comes in. The
program, held last month at Kaiser's West Los Angeles facility,
included a discussion about handling the many challenges of facial
disorders, from growing up to dating.
</P>
<P>
   The clinic, which was founded in 1972, serves nearly 1,000
patients from all over Southern California who have a deformity of
the skull or face caused by birth defect, trauma or disease.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa's favorite part of the daylong program was the fashion
clinic, in which stylists for celebrities volunteered to introduce
the latest looks to the participants. Makeup artists provided
demonstrations on how to camouflage blemishes. But Melissa chose to
indulge only in a new outfit and a salon haircut.
</P>
<P>
   Typically reddish or violet in color, port wine stains occur
when there is a proliferation of capillaries in one area; the
condition causes the area to become significantly darker than the
person's complexion. Most facial port wine stains are present at
birth and can be greatly improved with plastic surgery, cosmetics
or laser treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Some people with the condition also experience excessive growth
of other tissue in the stained area because of the extra supply of
blood. In Melissa's case, it has increased the amount of bone
growth in her jaw, leaving her face asymmetrical.
</P>
<P>
   But neither malformation fazes Melissa anymore.
</P>
<P>
   She recalls when she considered surgically removing the
birthmark two years ago. She decided not to go through with the
painful treatment and recovery after her friends told her that
removing the stain meant getting rid of a part of her. She decided
to keep the stain.
</P>
<P>
   Wexler said the teen is unlike most of his patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see the beauty radiating from inside,'' Wexler said.
``She puts it together so well, she is able to radiate her own
inner personality and charm. She's beautiful despite her facial
differences. That's what I've always admired about Melissa.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us have perfect, creamy skin _ except for a few cover
models,'' Wexler added. ``You can look at a teen-ager who's got a
pimple on his nose, and it kills his whole week, or you can look at
someone like Melissa ... a very secure, wonderful person.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, she is preparing for a bone reconstructive surgery
scheduled for late October that can reduce her overgrown jawbone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready for it,'' she says of the surgery that will prevent
her from attending school for up to six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's been remarkable,'' says Karen Perea, Melissa's
stepmother. ``She's taught us all a lesson that she's made it a
goal to focus on the beauty from within. That's more than I was
taught when I was growing up.''

FACTS BEHIND THE BLEMISH
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ever notice a small red fleck somewhere on your
skin? Not a freckle or a scar, but a cherry mark?
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people have one or another hanging around,'' said Dr.
Andrew Wexler, a plastic surgeon with the Kaiser Permanente
Craniofacial Clinic. ``That's probably the lowest end of the scale
of a vascular oddity.''
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the scale are port wine stains that can
cover the entire face, head and neck.
</P>
<P>
   Wexler shared his expertise on the condition that affects many.
</P>
<P>
   What is a port wine stain?
</P>
<P>
   A port wine stain is one of a group of relatively common
vascular malformations. It involves the capillaries, the smallest
blood vessels in the body. When there's an abnormal growth of many,
many capillaries in an area, it causes a reddish or violet
pigmentation _ which explains its common name, ``port wine stain.''
</P>
<P>
   What causes it?
</P>
<P>
   It is not known what in the genetic code makes these capillaries
grow in this way. But it does not seem to have a hereditary
component; it's not passed from one generation to another.
</P>
<P>
   Will the birthmark shrink or grow over time?
</P>
<P>
   The size of the discolored area will grow proportionately with a
child's growth. If the stain covers, say, 10 percent of the baby's
face, in adulthood, the stain will still cover only 10 percent of
the face. So, it gets bigger, but it covers the same area.
</P>
<P>
   Is there a treatment for the condition?
</P>
<P>
   A ``tunable dye laser'' treatment can erase the stain fairly
successfully. It basically coagulates the blood vessels through the
skin, blanching out the discoloration.
</P>
<P>
   Cosmetics also can camouflage the stain.
</P>
<P>
   Will new port wine stains show up later in life?
</P>
<P>
   Areas affected by abnormal capillaries exist at birth; you won't
grow any new abnormal capillaries. But those areas can become more
prominent later on in life, particularly if they've been
laser-treated or operatively removed. The surgery can change
pressure in that vascular bed, which may shunt more blood into
other abnormal capillary areas.

NILE'S STYLES: EGYPT'S IMAGES PROVE ENDURING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - It has been 2,000 years since Egypt ceased to exist as
a world power, yet Egypt is all around us.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, Mighty Isis.
</P>
<P>
   It is in our culture, in our movies, in our TV shows, in our
literature, in our pockets.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, take out a dollar bill and look at the back. What
do you see?
</P>
<P>
   A pyramid.
</P>
<P>
   Go to the nation's capital and what do you see? The Washington
Monument, which is modeled on an Egyptian obelisk.
</P>
<P>
   Watch Michael Jackson's 1992 video for ``Remember the Time'' and
you see the singer dressed up in the striped ``nemes'' headdress of
a Pharaoh sharing his first screen kiss with supermodel Iman.
</P>
<P>
   The Bangles told us to ``Walk Like an Egyptian.'' When we were
old enough to walk into a drugstore for protection, it was Ramses
that offered it to us. And when women want to get rid of unwanted
hair, they can use a depilatory product called Cleopatra's Secret.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's the Luxor hotel in Las Vegas or the pack of Camel
cigarettes, the images of ancient Egypt are all around us.
</P>
<P>
   There are DeMille-sized visions of slaves piling stone on stone
to make the pyramids; there is the autocrat Pharaoh, looking a lot
like Yul Brynner, his life slathered in gold; there is the
bandage-wrapped mummy, later a baleful Boris Karloff, a
pre-Christian version of the Resurrection.
</P>
<P>
   You hardly can have a big-budget futuristic sci-fi movie without
its Egyptian component. There is ``Stargate,'' ``The Fifth
Element,'' ``Raiders of the Lost Ark.'' They all have their ancient
priests and hidden tombs.
</P>
<P>
   It might be said that ancient Egypt holds the same place in
popular culture that ancient Greece holds in high culture.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, you've never seen a Three Stooges short that takes on
pre-Socratic philosophers. But every male in America can remember
1939's ``We Want Our Mummy,'' in which the three search for the
tomb of the midget King Rootin-Tootin.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, 1939 was a great year for cinema.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt has held its place in the popular imagination of the West
for 2,000 years. It began with ancient Rome, which built temples to
Egyptian gods.
</P>
<P>
   In the Middle Ages, they told stories about Israel and the
Pharaoh; in the Renaissance, they painted many canvases on the
theme of the ``flight into Egypt'' of the holy family fleeing the
wrath of Herod.
</P>
<P>
   The 19th century used Egypt _ as they used much of the ancient
world _ as an excuse to paint seductive dancing girls.
</P>
<P>
   And our own century is in some ways the ``century of Tut.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of our obsession with ancient Egypt rests on four ancient
personalities, four Egyptian symbols and two major discoveries.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest Egyptian craze began with Cleopatra, who had a
famous love affair _ or political alliance _ with Julius Caesar,
followed by a famous love affair _ or political alliance _ with
Mark Antony. There is so much fable in the stories that it is
impossible to extract simple fact from them.
</P>
<P>
   Cleopatra remained the center of Europe's Egypt of the
imagination for a very long time.
</P>
<P>
   In Geoffrey Chaucer's ``Legend of Good Women,'' Cleopatra has
the first place as the woman who sacrifices her life for love.
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare has her in ``Antony and Cleopatra.'' Later writers
saw her less as victim and more as temptress. More recent writers
have her as feminist hero and savvy politician.
</P>
<P>
   There are literally hundreds of novels about Cleopatra written
in European languages, hundreds more paintings and dozens of films.
From Theda Bara to Rhonda Fleming to Liz Taylor, these vamps and
tramps have given us Cleos dressed up in their best Hollywood camp
and kitsch.
</P>
<P>
   The second important pillar of Egypt in the West is the Pharaoh
of Exodus. We cannot be sure which Pharaoh this might be, nor just
how much of the story in the Bible can be verified historically.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the part of Egypt that most fascinated Europe during
medieval times. Old Testament stories frequently are depicted in
the stained-glass windows of cathedrals.
</P>
<P>
   In the early part of the 19th century, painters loved the vast
sublimity of the seven plagues of Egypt, and there are paintings by
such luminaries as William Turner and such subluminaries as John
Martin, who actually makes Cecil B. DeMille look like a
miniaturist.
</P>
<P>
   There has always been a Hollywood-like underbelly in pop
culture.
</P>
<P>
   Turn to Cecil B. DeMille's ``Ten Commandments'' _ either the
silent of 1923 or the bloated Charlton Heston epic of 1956 _ to
make hash of history and chowder of the Bible. Look for Heston
wearing a wristwatch while standing on a rock.
</P>
<P>
   The third major figure is Tutankhamen, whose grave was
discovered in 1923. Tutmania swept America and Western Europe from
then until the Depression hit six years later. There were scarab
rings, Tut nickel cigars, hieroglyphic dresses and dining chairs
designed to look like Egyptian thrones. Babies were named Tutter
for boys and Tuttie for girls.
</P>
<P>
   Tutmania picked up again in 1976 after the blockbuster art
museum show called ``The Treasures of Tutankhamen'' toured the
country, leaving lines of people down the street outside every
museum it hit.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Martin performed his ``funky'' Tut parody on ``Saturday
Night Live'' and had a hit novelty number. ``Now if I'd known/
They'd line up just to see him,/ I'd taken all my money/ And bought
me a museum. King Tut.''
</P>
<P>
   The fourth personality is that of the enigmatic king who
immediately preceded Tut, who is most widely known as Akhenaten.
Born Amenhotep IV _ or Amenophis _ the Pharaoh broke 1,500 years of
artistic and religious tradition and attempted to institute a
version of monotheism as state religion. He also changed his name.
</P>
<P>
   Akhenaten worshiped the solar disc instead of the dozens of
local and state deities of the past. As soon as he died, the old
gods were reinstated by Tutankhamen.
</P>
<P>
   Sigmund Freud wrote a book trying to prove that Moses influenced
the king. Michael Curtiz, director of ``Casablanca,'' in 1954 made
a film called ``The Egyptian,'' which glamorized that period in
Egyptian history.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, minimalist composer Philip Glass wrote an opera
titled ``Akhenaten,'' which is sung entirely in a synthetic
language imitating ancient Egyptian. Some would say it also was
written in a synthetic style imitating music, but that's beside the
point.
</P>
<P>
   The symbols that we have include:
</P>
<P>
   1. The pyramids and sphinx _ They survive everywhere in pop
culture. Arizona's Gov. George W. P. Hunt is buried under a pyramid
in Phoenix's Papago Park. You also can rent a room in the Luxor
hotel, the laser-tipped kitsch pyramid in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, there were people who believed that pyramids could
sharpen razor blades. It was called pyramid power, and some people
thought that home-appliance pyramids could replace refrigerators
for the preservation of meat.
</P>
<P>
   2. Mummies _ From Karloff to Abbott and Costello, mummies
inhabit our fright-flick subconscious, like zombies, only older and
well wrapped. When mummy shows turn up at museums, the line forms
to the right.
</P>
<P>
   Mummies also captivate us for being an ancient attempt at
understanding life after death.
</P>
<P>
   3. Hieroglyphs _ Ancient Egypt remains a noisy culture. There is
chatter written around almost every painted or carved figure in
Egyptian art. They tell us who we are looking at and even how we
are supposed to feel about them. The wiggle of a line of water, the
stare of a hieroglyphic eye and the stroke of a feather. They all
have meaning that we now can read and understand, making for the
feeling of a direct line of communication between us and 3,000
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   4. The Ankh _ The looping symbol of life was taken by the Coptic
Christians as their cross and it has survived down to our time as a
popular amulet. There are still many people who wear them around
their necks.
</P>
<P>
   As for the discoveries that fueled our obsession with Egypt, we
already have mentioned Howard Carter's opening of King Tut's tomb
in 1923.
</P>
<P>
   But even more important than that was expansion of Napoleon into
Egypt in 1798. He ultimately was defeated by the British navy, but
his expedition also took with him 167 scholars who got a serious
look at the antiquities of the Nile for the first time. They were
dumbfounded by what they saw.
</P>
<P>
   The most influential of these academics was the artist Domenique
Vivant Denon, who made sketches of the ruins, statues and
hieroglyphs that he saw. The book of his drawings is still in
print.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was treading the soil of a land covered since immemorial
times with a veil of mystery,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   When the drawings hit Europe, it set off the first great modern
Egyptian craze. English poet Robert Southey wrote, ``Everything
must now be Egyptian; the ladies wear crocodile ornaments, and one
must sit on sphinxes in a room hung with mummies and the long-nosed
hieroglyphical men who are enough to make children afraid to go to
bed.''
</P>
<P>
   And when the French finally opened the Suez Canal in 1869, it
was Giuseppe Verdi who provided the music, with his Grand Opera and
Kitschfest ``Aida.'' It provided the standard for Egyptian music at
least until the exotic dancer Little Egypt shook her booty in the
coochie-coochie dance at Chicago's World's Columbian Exposition in
1893.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure you all can remember her tune, often sung to the words
``Oh, they don't wear pants in the southern part of France.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that's it. &QL;

HOT IDEA: PCS THAT FIT OUR LIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID HOYE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - You want the next ``killer app''?
</P>
<P>
   I got the next killer app . . . right here.
</P>
<P>
   It's an idea that's bumped around in my head for a few years.
But I think it's time has come.
</P>
<P>
   Killer app, as you may or may not know, refers to ``killer
application.'' Computer industry people use the phrase to refer to
something that helps drive the market.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if someone came out with a piece of software that
cleaned house and cooked dinner while you were at work, and
required a Pentium II-450 running Windows NT 5.0 and 128 megabytes
of RAM, that would be a killer app.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because millions of people would want the software, and, to
make it run, they'd have to upgrade their machines accordingly,
thus driving the market.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not my idea.
</P>
<P>
   My idea resurfaced the other day as I sat in a small room with
my 4-year-old son, Patrick, waiting for the World's Greatest
Pediatrician (a k a Dr. Schwartz) to examine Patrick's sore foot,
the latter a result of an ill-advised climb up a pantry shelf in
search of a Fruit Roll-Up.
</P>
<P>
   As I gazed around the examining room, and tried to interest
Patrick in the cowboy motif so he'd stop spinning around on the
doctor's stool, I couldn't help but notice a full-sized desktop
computer perched, somewhat precariously, on one end of the Formica
counter.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to see why doctors need access to computers. Everybody
does these days. Clearly, though, that machine was not built for
that spot.
</P>
<P>
   Now, this doesn't reflect badly on the doctor's office. You see
the same thing everywhere. There's basically one computer design in
this world, and we're stuck with it, no matter where, or under what
conditions, we need such a machine.
</P>
<P>
   Look around. Ever watch an automobile mechanic, his hands all
greasy, try to type in your credit card number on the repair shop's
computer? Ever try to fit a PC on a child's desk in his bedroom?
Ever wish you could fit a computer on the kitchen counter so you
could watch the kids do their homework or so you could use one of
those recipe programs?
</P>
<P>
   Why can't somebody make computers that fit?
</P>
<P>
   OK. So here's my idea: It's called the home server. You sell
people a powerful PC. They plunk it down in the den. Then, they use
it to run an assortment of computer appliances spread all over the
house.
</P>
<P>
   In the kitchen, you could have a small countertop terminal built
with washable plastic, like toasters and blenders. In the kid's
room, you could have a terminal that not only fits on a desk, but
looks like an elephant or a space ship. In the garage, you could
have a touch-screen terminal so your dirty hands don't gunk up a
keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   You could take the idea and use it in small offices, giving
professionals the access to the computing power they need without
the trouble of dealing with the computer itself.
</P>
<P>
   The examples could go on and on.
</P>
<P>
   The point is, all this is possible today. And I think it would
make a heck of a killer app.
</P>
<P>
   Now don't go writing me nasty e-mails, telling me this is just a
rehash of somebody's ``house of the future'' concept. I've heard
all that. And I've seen the software that allows people to automate
their homes using computers.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not really talking about that.
</P>
<P>
   My idea is, simply, to give people computers that fit into their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   Think about it: Desktop PCs now have more power than any of us
really need. Why not put them to work running a small network in
your home?
</P>
<P>
   All we need is for some computermaker to get on the stick, as it
were.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it's time for a non-computer company to get into the
game. Black &AMP; Decker? Hamilton Beach? Whirlpool? Hello? You guys
listening?
</P>
<P>
   Make us some computer appliances that can hook up to a PC (or a
Macintosh) in the home! Sell them at Target or Kmart. Include two
or three, along with cables and software, in a ``home server kit.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago at the COMDEX computer trade show, I asked
Eckhard Pfeiffer about all this. He's the CEO at Compaq, one of the
world's largest computer manufacturing companies.
</P>
<P>
   It was a pleasant interview, conducted in midtrot, as Pfeiffer
and his support staff ran between buildings at the Las Vegas
Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
   I don't remember exactly how I phrased it, but I asked Pfeiffer
why companies like Compaq couldn't make computers that better fit
our lives.
</P>
<P>
   He looked over his shoulder at me and said, ``We're working on
it.''
</P>
<P>
   At least I think that's what he said. He speaks with an accent,
you know. He might actually have said, ``I'd like a bratwurst.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, I think the home server/computer appliance idea is a
concept whose time has come. Maybe not next week, but certainly
before that big desktop machine falls and gives Dr. Schwartz a sore
foot. &QL;

STUDY PREDICTS TOUGH TIMES FOR SILICON VALLEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVID ARMSTRONG  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Silicon Valley's economy could crash like a
burned-out computer system, falling into recession by next year
from the effects of the 14-month-old Asian fiscal crisis, according
to a study by the Santa Monica-based Milken Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The study, ``The Asian Crisis Tsunami,'' says that San Jose will
be hit hardest of any metropolitan area in California. ``Real
personal income growth in the San Jose metropolitan area will be
zero next year. In a pessimistic scenario, it will decline by 1.5
percent in 1999 and 1.7 percent in 2000,'' said a consensus
scenario sketched out in the report, which was released Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the slump, according to the study by the
7-year-old nonprofit think-tank headed by former junk-bond king
Michael Milken, is Silicon Valley's reliance on high-technology
exports to Asia. Cash-strapped Asian economies, battered by
currency devaluations, do not have the money to buy the high-tech
gear, according to the 48-page report.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Milken report, about 75 percent of California's
total exports to Asia in 1997 were high-tech, including a
breathtaking 95.7 percent of exports from San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   The report draws on statistics and studies by sources such as
the California Trade and Commerce Agency, the International
Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the U.S. Department of Commerce.
It was written by Ross C. DeVol, the Milken Institute's director of
regional studies.
</P>
<P>
   DeVol, who joined the Milken Institute in January, is former
senior vice president of regional economics for Wharton
Econometrics Forecasting Associates in Philadelphia, where he
covered the California economy.
</P>
<P>
   DeVol said in a telephone interview that he was surprised by the
extent of the state's reliance on exports to Asia. ``When I started
it, I didn't realize how important Asia is, particularly to the Bay
Area,'' he said, ``especially San Jose, where 25 percent of
personal income is linked to exports to Asia, the highest
percentage in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The Milken report encompasses three possible scenarios _
``optimistic,'' ``consensus'' and ``pessimistic'' _ outlining
intensifying degrees of pain to California's economy. DeVol said
the consensus or pessimistic scenarios were most likely. In the
pessimistic scenario, China devalues its currency, the yuan, and
471,000 California jobs could be lost.
</P>
<P>
   The report notes that in the second quarter of this year,
exports of California manufactured goods to Japan fell 18 percent
from the same period in 1997, with exports to South Korea falling
38.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Entertainment, tourism, real estate and foreign investment are
all being hurt, according to the report, but the most vulnerable is
high-tech: electronic and electrical supplies, industrial machinery
and computers, transportation equipment, and instruments and
related projects.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Selfridge, senior vice president for international banking
at the Santa Clara-based Silicon Valley Bank, said the broad
outlines of the report conformed to what his bank was seeing with
its clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japan and South Korea particularly are major markets for this
area,'' Selfridge said. Fallout from the crisis in Asia, he added,
``is already working its way into the semiconductor industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Although California's trade with North American Free Trade
Association partners Canada and Mexico is robust, DeVol cautioned
that it might not be that way for long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canada is a major exporter of commodities,'' he said, ``and
commodity prices are falling because of the Asia crisis. Mexico is
the object of attention from speculators, driving down the value of
the peso vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar.''
</P>
<P>
   DeVol said that increased trade with Europe could provide a
partial answer to troubles in Asia and Latin America. ``They are
far behind us in high-tech,'' DeVol said of Europe, ``and they want
to acquire our technology. Europe is the largest major market
that's growing.''
</P>
<P>
   Selfridge agreed, observing that ``Europe has been a vital trade
partner for technology. High-tech exports to Europe grew 16 percent
_ by $1.2 billion _ in the first six months of 1998. But Asia
slumped 12 percent _ $3.7 billion _ at the same time. So it doesn't
quite offset the drop we've seen.''
</P>
<P>
   DeVol said state and local governments could be hurt by
declining trade, too, since tax revenue forecasts are drawn from
expectations of bullish growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``People need to take a close look at those tax revenues,'' he
said.

PLUMMER POURS HIMSELF INTO `BARRYMORE' ROLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Like the proverbial ``office flirt'' and the
``honest politician,'' the ``debonair drunk'' has fallen on hard
times lately.
</P>
<P>
   For every Dean Martin suavely knocking back cocktails while
crooning ``Amore,'' there's a thousand obnoxious barroom bores who
never know when to shut up. Stylish inebriation is no longer
fashionable _ if indeed it ever was.
</P>
<P>
   So there's a touch of sheer, anachronistic pleasure in watching
actor Christopher Plummer's marvelously reckless bad-boy portrayal
of fellow actor and legendary lush John ``Jack'' Barrymore at the
Ahmanson Theatre. In fact, Plummer's Tony Award-winning performance
is so intoxicating, it drowns out the slightly stale, predictable
taste of William Luce's high-spirited play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barrymore'' is set in the last month of the actor's life,
which fizzled out prematurely in 1942 when he was 60. Luce's
premise is that the booze-addled yet still waspish Barrymore has
rented a New York theater, where he's making a halfhearted stab at
rehearsing ``Richard III'' with the help of an unseen prompter,
Frank (John Plumpis).
</P>
<P>
   By the 1940s, Jack was a broken parody of his handsome, majestic
younger self. But as Plummer inhabits him, he's also a brilliantly
engaging raconteur with a trunkful of lewd limericks and wittily
self-mocking ``thea-tuh'' anecdotes sandwiched between spot-on
impersonations of everyone from W.C. Fields and a foul-mouthed
parrot to Barrymore's famous siblings Ethel and Lionel.
</P>
<P>
   Boisterously orchestrated by director Gene Saks, the party
starts from the moment Jack lets out a devilish backstage cackle
and staggers out singing ``I Got a Gal in Kalamazoo.'' Naturally,
he's brought his trusty black bag of libations (to help him
``loosen up,'' you understand), which he dips deeper into as the
evening wears on and the emotional cracks bubble up in his
party-hearty facade.
</P>
<P>
   To Frank's mounting frustration, it's quickly obvious that Jack
is far more interested in reliving old pranks and settling old
scores with colleagues and ex-wives than in learning his lines.
Sure enough, for the next 1{ hours there's virtually no letup of
bawdy asides, painful reveries and the occasional tortured insights
that hit Jack like a sucker punch to the jaw.
</P>
<P>
   We've seen this structure many times before, in plays about
Truman Capote, Maria Callas, Ty Cobb and others: layers of juicy
gossip alternating with thick slabs of agonized confession. What's
more distracting is that several of Luce's narrative jump-cuts are
remarkably slipshod, and he pads the evening with too many cheap
laughs about New York cabdrivers and the like.
</P>
<P>
   But Plummer, like the seasoned pro he is, skates over these
bumps with unerring comic timing and hilarious vaudevillian
showmanship. He also demonstrates why he's one of the continent's
top classical actors: Despite all the blatant gag-dropping here,
Plummer's reactions are hauntingly subtle: a quaver that slithers
like a garden snake across his magnificent baritone, a look of
panic that freezes his features like a man glimpsing his own ghost.
</P>
<P>
   Even with Frank feeding him lines from the wings, Plummer's
Barrymore is his own best straight man. ``I don't have to tell you
that divorces cost more than marriages _ but, goddamit, they're
worth it!'' he bellows at one point.
</P>
<P>
   If Luce's structure were as brilliant as his one-liners,
``Barrymore'' might be a small masterpiece. As it is, it's a
uniquely memorable evening with an unforgettable drinking buddy.

SHE'S FLIRTY, HE'S COMPLEX IN `CARMEN'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; In the confident hands and coolly smirking mouth
of Jennifer Larmore, a cigar is much more than just a cigar.
</P>
<P>
   It's a sly, playful reminder of who ultimately holds the cards
when it comes to male-female relations. Hint: It isn't the sex that
enters Ernest Hemingway look-alike contests.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Larmore needs any humdrum Freudian symbolism to lift
her performance in L.A. Opera's new production of ``Carmen.''
Making her much-anticipated stage debut in the title role, the
Atlanta-born mezzo-soprano, whose forte is bel canto singing,
proves she has the deep-burgundy vocal coloring and the acting
chops required of Bizet's beloved tragic heroine.
</P>
<P>
   And while her voice isn't quite domineering enough for this
role, Larmore's strong-willed, charismatic presence and quicksilver
emotional shape-shifting are ideal for opera's ultimate femme
fatale.
</P>
<P>
   Originally staged two years ago by Washington Opera, Swedish
director Ann-Margret Pettersson's production sends out some mixed
psychological signals. When Larmore first appears as the
cigar-brandishing temptress, she's decked out in a black riding
habit, looking more like Don Juan's reckless daughter than a lowly
cigarette factory worker.
</P>
<P>
   Is this meant as some kind of fantasy representation of how
Carmen is perceived by the love-struck Don Jose (Placido Domingo)?
If so, the concept isn't carried through. In any case, Larmore's
Carmen is less a bewitching vamp than a heedless flirt bent on a
fatal course. Though she purrs and growls, snaps her body like a
whip and throws curves every which way, in the end she's a
refreshingly down-to-earth sensualist, not a Hollywood harlot.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Domingo's rumpled Don Jose suggests a flawed, complex
human being rather than an opera comique archetype. He's an old
lion anxiously stalking an obscure object of desire, a volatile mix
of fragility and pride that's expertly realized in the famous
``Flower Song.'' Domingo ends this passionate plea to his lover
curled like a schoolboy around his mother's knee _ while somehow
looking no less the man for it. It's a great moment only a great
tenor could pull off.
</P>
<P>
   Working with far more one-dimensional characters, two other
singers find ways to shine. Richard Bernstein brings a comic
self-awareness to the puffed-up machismo of the toreador Escamillo,
while soprano Carla Maria Izzo has an anguished sweetness that
stops short of sappiness in portraying the long-suffering Micaela.
</P>
<P>
   Conductor Bertrand de Billy keeps maudlin sentiments at bay
while putting just enough gloss on the Iberian embroidery of
Bizet's German-Romantic score. By turns naturalistic and
aggressively poetic, this ``Carmen'' is often very beautiful to
look at. Following the lead of many other directors, Pettersson has
transposed the action from the 1870s to the 1930s, turning the
soldiers into Franco's fascist legions and the gypsies into
Republicans clad in black berets and cartridge belts. Designer
Lennart Mork suffuses the opening Seville street scene with ochre
light, a bit of graffiti mockingly scratched onto a wall. At the
start of Act 3, a vast sheet of blue-white fabric unfurls in a
showy but lovely abstraction of the morning sky.
</P>
<P>
   This ``Carmen'' isn't quite the long, deep gulp of perfumed air
it wants to be, but neither is it blowing smoke.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; It was the lead story on local television
stations that evening. Parents leave children alone for days.
Details at 11.
</P>
<P>
   Zachary Alessandro of Studio City was all of 2 years old. But he
was old enough to comprehend the distraught faces that flashed back
at him from the tube. Sadness, he concluded.
</P>
<P>
   He walked into his bedroom, peeled a pillowcase off a pillow and
began filling the bag with his toys.
</P>
<P>
   His parents smiled. How cute, they thought. They let the
situation pass. Zachary would forget about the troubled children,
they thought. He was, after all, only 2.
</P>
<P>
   But Zachary didn't forget. He wanted to give small sacks filled
with goodies to children like those on television. ``When are we
going to make the sacks?'' he asked occasionally.
</P>
<P>
   Zachary's parents, who donate to various charities, are
compassionate. But they hesitated about pursuing their son's idea.
They worried his good deed might expose him at too early an age to
such real-world issues as delinquent parents.
</P>
<P>
   But Zachary kept pushing. And his parents finally relented.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for ``Zax Sax'' was born.
</P>
<P>
   A year after that fateful television news program, Zachary
opened a lemonade stand strategically located near neighborhood
garage sales to raise money to stock his Zax Sax.
</P>
<P>
   A relative pitched in $50, and soon he had raised about $120 to
buy fabric that his mom sewed into small bags, complete with
drawstrings and stuffing on one side of each bag for a makeshift
pillow. ``So they can take a nap,'' Zachary explained.
</P>
<P>
   Now, two years since he learned about the less-fortunate fates
of other children, he occasionally fills the homemade sacks himself
with toys Mom orders in bulk from catalogs. At the family's kitchen
table, he walks down his assembly line of crayons, trolls, rubber
snakes and sunglasses, dutifully depositing one of each in his
bags.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you stuff it up,'' he said, pulling the drawstring and
closing the bag. ``And put it in the box. Yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   During the past month, Zachary and his mom have delivered some
60 bags to the North Hollywood and Van Nuys divisions of the Los
Angeles Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time I have ever had anyone this young be
involved in volunteer work,'' said Detective Harold Rhudy of the
Van Nuys Division, an officer for 26 years.
</P>
<P>
   Before Zax Sax came along, a visit to a local police division
went something like this for a child: Just saw Dad beat Mom. Police
came and handcuffed Dad. Now sitting in police station amid strange
adults who are busy processing paperwork. Tired. Scared. Nothing to
do.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Zax Sax are a welcome relief for officers and the
children who receive them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't get gifts quite often, and to be handed something,
especially when they're nervous and fearful, it breaks down many
barriers,'' said Detective Thomas Culotta of the North Hollywood
division.
</P>
<P>
   Zachary originally wanted to meet and hand his sacks in person
to children at police stations. But detectives said laws require
them to keep children's identities private.
</P>
<P>
   It still didn't dissuade Zachary from wanting to reach out and
help.
</P>
<P>
   His parents don't regret giving in to their young
philanthropist's wishes. The project has helped Zachary appreciate
how lucky he is compared to some other children, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows there are bad mommies and daddies that get
arrested,'' said Lorraine Alessandro, Zachary's mother.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, who could say no to a child with such good intentions?
</P>
<P>
   ``I took out my toys, and I wanted to give them away, so we came
up with the idea,'' Zachary explained. The reason was simple:
``Because I've got a lot of toys.''

<P>
   A new earth satellite, launched last fall, captured radar images
of skyscraper-like thunderclouds rising more than 11 miles into the
atmosphere from the center of Hurricane Bonnie on Aug. 22.
</P>
<P>
   So powerful were the forces producing the clouds that they
punched through the upper boundary of the troposphere, the dense
lower layer of the atmosphere, by one to three miles.
</P>
<P>
   The radar images, which are themselves invisible, were
artificially colored. In one image of Hurricane Bonnie, red was
used to indicate higher amounts of moisture. A circular white patch
under the spiky image of the thunderclouds described the surface
cloud layer of the hurricane as it moved northwestward over the
Atlantic Ocean toward the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The tallest spike of clouds reached 59,000 feet, about twice as
high as Mount Everest. Normally, tropical thunderstorms reach
30,000 to 40,000 feet, and 40,000 to 50,000 feet is not out of the
ordinary in the center of a hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   But clouds as tall as those recorded here are rarely seen in
Atlantic hurricanes, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   When these images were captured, say scientists at the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration, Hurricane Bonnie was moving
very slowly, allowing it to suck up more moisture and energy from
the sea surface. Warm, moist air kept funneling upward, driving the
cloud tops ever higher.
</P>
<P>
   When the air reached higher altitudes, where it was colder, the
moisture condensed into raindrops, releasing latent heat into the
atmosphere. This infusion of energy, meteorologists believe,
strengthens a hurricane. And indeed, Hurricane Bonnie intensified
during the 24 hours after the images were obtained.
</P>
<P>
   At its peak, the hurricane was a moderately severe storm, rating
as a category 3 (with category 5 the strongest) on the
Saffir-Simpson scale of hurricane intensity.
</P>
<P>
   The radar images were made by instruments aboard the Tropical
Rainfall Measuring Mission, the world's first space-borne rainfall
observatory. A joint Japanese-American project, the satellite was
launched Nov. 27 from Japan as one of the first of a planned series
of new satellites to be launched over the next several years, aimed
at obtaining vast amounts of information about the earth-atmosphere
system.
</P>
<P>
   The mission satellite has flown over some 100 tropical cyclones,
giving scientists views unobtainable with instruments on the ground
or on airplanes, and possibly giving them new insights into
hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   But the greater value, experts say, may come from the
information it provides about tropical precipitation, which in turn
could help experts improve computerized weather predictions.

`THREEPENNY OPERA' HAS ITS CHARM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When one of his henchmen says to Macheath in ``The
Threepenny Opera'' that something was nice, Mack the Knife corrects
him. ``That wasn't nice, clown. That was art,'' Mackie says turning
to the audience with a leer to deliver the punch line. ``And art
isn't nice.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's the problem with the Bertolt Brecht-Kurt Weill
classic at UCLA's Freud Playhouse, part of the latest offering in
the Reprise! series of concert musicals, which is a counterpart to
the Encore! series in New York City. It's a little too nice.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say that the production doesn't offer its
pleasures. In fact, that's what it does best. There are solid
renditions of Weill's familiar cabaret-style songs, some very good
performances and witty staging.
</P>
<P>
   So it may seem unfair to carp, considering that the series is
meant to be a showcase of neglected musicals and in essence bills
itself as a ``concert'' (actors often carry around notebooks to
refer to lines since there is usually only about a week of
rehearsals). But the play is staged, and the actors do more than
read their parts.
</P>
<P>
   This stripped-down approach has worked well with other shows in
the series, such as ``Promises, Promises'' or Finian's Rainbow,''
but ``The Threepenny Opera'' is a different beast than those
Broadway lambs.
</P>
<P>
   First produced in 1928 in Berlin, the musical was meant as a
commentary on the decadence, cynicism and corruption rife in an
economically unstable Germany under the shadow of Nazism. Brecht
was a communist, but the subversive ideology he put forth in
``Threepenny'' was more theatrical than Marxist. His intention was
to ``alienate'' audiences, wanting to wake them from their
comfortable roles as passive observers of entertainment, remind
them that they are watching a play and implicate them in crimes of
society.
</P>
<P>
   Based on John Gay's ``The Beggar's Opera,'' the musical is
filled with lowlifes of every sort. There are cutthroats, cheats,
con artists and corrupted officials, and Brecht wanted the audience
to know they were responsible. He even creates an artificial upbeat
ending, reminding people that they may like things neatly tied up
with a happy conclusion, but that rarely happens for most people.
</P>
<P>
   The Reprise! production of ``The Three Penny Opera'' is the 1953
translation by Marc Blitzstein that played on Broadway, and it's
this version that we are most familiar with. But it's probably time
to go beyond this, and there have been recent and only moderately
successful attempts to reinterpret the musical.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't mean it has to go the Baz Luhrmann ``William
Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet'' route, but the musical begs not to
be put in a time capsule. Perhaps an odd choice for the series,
nonetheless this bare-bones version almost presented an opportunity
to be subversive, to invoke the Brecht-Weill spirit.
</P>
<P>
   What was presented, though, was very professional. Those who are
fans of Weill's dark, almost atonal music won't be disappointed.
From Ken Page's (the Street Singer) wonderfully forceful opening
``The Ballad of Mack the Knife'' through Jonelle Allen's (Jenny)
dynamic ``Pirate Jenny'' to Carrie Hamilton and Marguerite
MacIntye's (Lucy and Polly) lively ``Jealousy Duet,'' the show's
singing is always engaging.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Cassidy is a live wire as Macheath, and his energy on
stage is infectious. The rest of the cast, including stage veteran
Theodore Bikel (Mr. J.J. Peachum) are quite good. And if you have
never seen ``The Threepenny Opera,'' you won't go wrong if you buy
a ticket. It may not be Brechtian, but it is entertaining.

 &HT;    G7 MEMBERS TO REVIEW SUPPORT OF RUSSIA, BASED ON MARKET REFORMS
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (f) Financial
categories.
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox New Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ World economic leaders will review their approach to
the Russian economy in the wake of the nation's near financial
collapse, the British government said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the Group of Seven industrial nations spent
several hours being briefed in London on the country's economic
situation by Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Georgy Mamedov.
</P>
<P>
   The former world superpower, in recent weeks, has seen its
currency -- the ruble -- plummet in value, most of its banks
struggle with insolvency and heard consumers' complaints of empty
store shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Before the end of the month, the heads of the G-7 member
governments -- which include the United States, Britain, Canada,
France, Germany, Italy and Japan -- are expected to receive a
report with recommendations based on the meetings with Mamedov.
British Prime Minister Tony Blair is considering whether to call
for a G-7 summit to discuss the Russian situation within the next
few months.
</P>
<P>
   The report would be used at such a summit, a senior financial
official with the Blair government said in a briefing afterwards
with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   While refusing to reveal specifics of the meeting, the official,
who asked not to be named, said it was clear that the G-7 is
considering a new approach to Russia. ``The program we had
supported has suffered some serious setbacks,'' he said. ``We need
to study the situation and come to some conclusions.''
</P>
<P>
   No definitive actions were taken at the meeting, but the G-7
delegates said continued financial aid from the West would be
linked to continued reforms in Russia toward a free market economy.
``The international community is ready to be supportive in Russia
provided the economy is headed in the right direction,'' the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians asked to be judged on their performance in the
coming months, but did not offer an specifics, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not expect any programs as the government was only
three days old,'' the official said. ``It was a very open,
friendly, candid discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov promised Monday to
continue market reforms but said he would also work to protect
Russians from the painful effects of the country's economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot conduct reforms that affect the people adversely,''
Primakov said at a Cabinet meeting. ``If therapy drags out for
decades . . . it is certainly not in the interests of the country,
not in the interests of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Primakov was accepted Friday by the Russian Parliament, which
had repeatedly rejected President Boris Yeltsin's earlier
nomination of Viktor Chernomyrdin. The ruble, which had lost
two-thirds of its value over the past month, rallied.

<P>
   Mamedov said the G-7 meeting went well. ``There was a lot of
enthusiasm for the fact that we have a new prime minister and that
the period of uncertainty is over,'' he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   He said his government was inviting International Monetary Fund
representatives to visit his country soon. Russia is eager to
receive another installment from the $22.6 billion rescue program
the IMF approved in July. The first $4.8 billion was consumed in a
vain attempt to prop up the slumping ruble.
</P>
<P>
   Mamedov said the G-7 officials welcomed signs of more stability
in Russia. ``They all have an economic interest in that because the
Dow Jones index does not fall by chance,'' he said.

IN NURSES' LIVES, A TREASURE TROVE OF HEALTH DATA 
</HEADLINE>

   More than 20 years ago, a doctor who was curious about the
effects of long-term oral contraceptive use sent questionnaires to
370,000 registered nurses. The answers he and colleagues received
have turned into the largest and longest repeated follow-up study
of a group of women, a fountain of information about health, in
particular women's health.
</P>
<P>
   The project, known as the Harvard Nurses' Health Study, has
yielded more than 200 published findings, including these:
</P>
<P>
   _Hormone replacement therapy can increase the risk of breast
cancer and can decrease the risk of heart disease and osteoporosis.
</P>
<P>
   _Margarine can increase the risk of heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   _Vitamin E can protect against heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   _One or two drinks a day can increase the risk of breast cancer
while protecting against heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   These findings, and many more, have altered how people eat and
drink and live their lives. Some scientists call the study the
single greatest contributor to understanding women's health.
</P>
<P>
   But this huge scientific effort has only begun to pay its
dividends. With many of the original participants now entering
their 60s and 70s, the study promises to bequeath an even greater
wealth of knowledge, much of it otherwise unattainable, about how a
lifetime of choices in food, drink, exercise and medications can
translate into protection from or increased risk of deadly and
debilitating diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a brilliant idea, a unique idea,'' said Dr. Leslie
Bernstein, an epidemiologist at the University of Southern
California. ``It's one of the largest studies ever to have been
assembled. They were leaders, ahead of their time. Now everybody is
trying to emulate what they've done.''
</P>
<P>
   The study began in 1976 when Dr. Frank Speizer, the Edward H.
Kass professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and
co-director of the Channing Laboratory at Brigham and Women's
Hospital, sent the first health questionnaires and received more
than 120,000 responses.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we began to gather data it became very clear that we could
expand the study,'' Speizer recalled. ``The excellent cooperation
of the nurses is the most important part.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 90 percent of the original respondents still answer a
questionnaire every other year, telling what they eat, what
medicines they take, what illnesses they have had and whether they
drink, smoke, exercise or take vitamins _ among other things.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that those answering the questions are nurses means
their answers are reliable, the researchers say. Plus, the
researchers can gather blood and other samples, simply by sending a
request and a few collection supplies, something that could never
be done with the public.
</P>
<P>
   By knowing these women's experiences, researchers can look at
the histories of those who have contracted diseases and compare
them with those who have not and begin teasing out the important
factors in determining a woman's risk for a particular illness.
</P>
<P>
   Since the study began, Speizer has been joined by many
scientists from around the world seeking to capitalize on this
unique trove of data. Researchers have been able to identify risk
factors for more common diseases, like breast, colon and lung
cancer, diabetes and heart disease. In the future, researchers say
they will be able to identify risk factors for rarer conditions,
like lymphoma, kidney cancer and bladder cancer, as well as
afflictions more common later in life, like stroke and senility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is afraid of losing their memory,'' said Dr. Francine
Grodstein, an epidemiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital who is
leading the new effort to determine whether using aspirin, taking
hormones or other life style choices prevents declines in cognitive
function.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Grodstein is expanding the study with a
telephone test that researchers will repeatedly administer to
participants over time. Researchers have spoken with about 2,000 of
the women, asking questions like ``Who is the president?'' and
reading a list of 10 words, which the participant is asked to
repeat, all typical tests of mental function.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are also beginning to study the blood samples of
30,000 women, looking for pesticide residue, antioxidants and
naturally produced hormones. Over time they will be able to discern
what connection, if any, these or other substances have to the
incidence of cancer. They can also use the blood samples to look
for genetic factors.
</P>
<P>
   One person could not predict her fate by examining the findings
of the study _ the numbers produced are simply average outcomes
over a range of women with different genetic backgrounds. By
looking at the variation in the genes of women who contract or do
not contract diseases with the wealth of data on their exposure to
a variety of substances, researchers hope to begin to solve this
most complex of problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we can help women understand what life style
changes are most important to them with their genetic makeup to
prevent disease,'' said Dr. Sue Hankinson, an epidemiologist at the
Harvard School of Public Health who is leading the blood work.
``Ultimately we could provide a much more individual kind of
recommendation.''
</P>
<P>
   As the women in the study age, researchers will also be able to
continue to identify protective or beneficial diets, activities and
habits associated with a healthier, longer life.
</P>
<P>
   By 1989, the study had already proved to be such a good source
of information that the team of researchers began a study of
younger nurses, enrolled at an earlier age, called Nurses II.
Researchers have even enlisted the children of the women in Nurses
II in another study to look at the risk factors for adolescent
obesity, which Dr. Graham Colditz, an epidemiologist at Harvard
Medical School heading the study, described as reaching epidemic
proportions.
</P>
<P>
   After so many years of working together, the study has produced
a bond of deep mutual respect between researchers and the nurses,
whom they call their collaborators.
</P>
<P>
   ``This group of women has been so tremendously dedicated,'' said
Dr. JoAnn Manson, an endocrinologist at Harvard Medical School,
echoing her many colleagues' sentiments. ``They have been the
trailblazers in terms of helping us to get the answers.''

 &HT;    G7 MEMBERS TO REVIEW SUPPORT OF RUSSIA, BASED ON MARKET REFORMS
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (f) Financial
categories.
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox New Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ World economic leaders will review their approach to
the Russian economy in the wake of the nation's near financial
collapse, the British government said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the Group of Seven industrial nations spent
several hours being briefed in London on the country's economic
situation by Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Georgy Mamedov.
</P>
<P>
   The former world superpower, in recent weeks, has seen its
currency -- the ruble -- plummet in value, most of its banks
struggle with insolvency and heard consumers' complaints of empty
store shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Before the end of the month, the heads of the G-7 member
governments -- which include the United States, Britain, Canada,
France, Germany, Italy and Japan -- are expected to receive a
report with recommendations based on the meetings with Mamedov.
British Prime Minister Tony Blair is considering whether to call
for a G-7 summit to discuss the Russian situation within the next
few months.
</P>
<P>
   The report would be used at such a summit, a senior financial
official with the Blair government said in a briefing afterwards
with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   While refusing to reveal specifics of the meeting, the official,
who asked not to be named, said it was clear that the G-7 is
considering a new approach to Russia. ``The program we had
supported has suffered some serious setbacks,'' he said. ``We need
to study the situation and come to some conclusions.''
</P>
<P>
   No definitive actions were taken at the meeting, but the G-7
delegates said continued financial aid from the West would be
linked to continued reforms in Russia toward a free market economy.
``The international community is ready to be supportive in Russia
provided the economy is headed in the right direction,'' the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians asked to be judged on their performance in the
coming months, but did not offer an specifics, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not expect any programs as the government was only
three days old,'' the official said. ``It was a very open,
friendly, candid discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov promised Monday to
continue market reforms but said he would also work to protect
Russians from the painful effects of the country's economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot conduct reforms that affect the people adversely,''
Primakov said at a Cabinet meeting. ``If therapy drags out for
decades . . . it is certainly not in the interests of the country,
not in the interests of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Primakov was accepted Friday by the Russian Parliament, which
had repeatedly rejected President Boris Yeltsin's earlier
nomination of Viktor Chernomyrdin. The ruble, which had lost
two-thirds of its value over the past month, rallied.
</P>
<P>
   Mamedov said the G-7 meeting went well. ``There was a lot of
enthusiasm for the fact that we have a new prime minister and that
the period of uncertainty is over,'' he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   He said his government was inviting International Monetary Fund
representatives to visit his country soon. Russia is eager to
receive another installment from the $22.6 billion rescue program
the IMF approved in July. The first $4.8 billion was consumed in a
vain attempt to prop up the slumping ruble.
</P>
<P>
   Mamedov said the G-7 officials welcomed signs of more stability
in Russia. ``They all have an economic interest in that because the
Dow Jones index does not fall by chance,'' he said.

 UNDATED: the answers.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The nurses themselves say they actually look forward to hearing
from the researchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been wonderful,'' said Irene Kilroy, 62, a nurse at Good
Samaritan Hospice in Brighton, Mass., who said she always answers
the questionnaire the day it arrives. Mrs. Kilroy, who was among
the 800 nurses who gathered last year to celebrate the 20th
anniversary of the study and its results, added, ``We feel we've
made a wonderful contribution.''
</P>
<P>
   The questionnaire varies with research interests, but has
consistently grown, now running about six pages and taking the
women from 20 minutes to more than an hour to complete. Using a
form, like an SAT answer sheet, that will be optically scanned, the
women record information like how often they eat specific foods
with choices ranging from never to six times per day or more. They
also write in more detailed information like which brand of vitamin
or cereal or cooking oil they use.
</P>
<P>
   All this self-examination has its effects, said Barbara Dwyer,
65, a nurse from Medford, Mass., who described herself as proud to
be part of the study.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does make you think more about your weight and smoking and
exercise,'' she said. ``I did stop taking the hormone therapy, and
I really watched my weight more.''
</P>
<P>
   So it is with mixed feelings, at best, that the researchers wait
for enough of these women to succumb to disease and die, the
necessary first step before the database will be, in the
euphemistic language researchers adopt, ``rich enough'' or
``powerful enough'' to offer useful information about illness and
death.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Meir Stampfer, an epidemiologist at the Harvard School of
Public Health who reviews the death records and officially assigns
a cause of death to participants, describes the process as ``a
little creepy.''
</P>
<P>
   The study has become a model for many other projects around the
country. The Iowa Women's Health Study, a project started in 1986
with 42,000 women who were licensed drivers in Iowa, studies body
fat and diet and disease using the Harvard questionnaire. The
Teachers Study in California, begun in 1996, has enlisted 135,000
women in cancer research.
</P>
<P>
   At first, skeptics abounded.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Walter Willett, an epidemiologist and physician at the
Harvard School of Public Health, who has been with the study since
its second year, said that early on there was great skepticism over
the worth of such an endeavor.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started, smoking was thought not to be a risk factor
for heart disease in women,'' Willett said, ``People said there was
no variation in diet and that people couldn't remember what they
ate, so the whole field was hopeless. You only have to scratch the
surface to see that people eat differently for many different
reasons. These are things we take for granted now.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, because the study is based on responses to
questionnaires, it can only identify associations between risk
factors and diseases, unlike a randomized, clinical trial in which
participants are assigned to specific treatments, testing whether a
risk factor causes a disease. As a result, some have questioned the
validity, in particular, of the study's more surprising results.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Nurses' Health Study was basically jeered at and taken to
task for the finding that there was a connection between alcohol
and breast cancer,'' Stampfer said. ``We were mocked for coming up
with a seemingly silly and unsubstantiated result, but now it's
turned out to be pretty well accepted.''
</P>
<P>
   And researchers are quick to point out that many of the things
the Nurses' Health Study looks at cannot be assigned as part of a
tidy, experimental design.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's never going to be a randomized study of alcohol,''
Stampfer said. ``There are ethical issues, compliance issues. It
can never happen, and the same is true with a lot of the dietary
things that we study.'' The same could be said of birth-control
methods and physical activity levels, also studied by the Harvard
group.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a study like the nurses' study can pick up on
long-term or delayed effects of diet and other habits, because it
has run for so much longer than nearly any randomized trial. In
real life, as opposed to a clinical trial, people often change what
they do over the years, altering their diet, taking up hormone use,
dropping it, taking it up again, quitting smoking and much more.
``We keep track of all the changes,'' Willett said. ``If we didn't,
we'd miss the important effects.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the nurses reliably return their questionnaires, but
those who do not can count on help from researchers _ who may send
as many as six additional questionnaires before they try
telephoning. If that does not work, researchers turn to the post
office, computer databases and other sources of information to
track them down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it'd be just a couple of years that I'd be doing
this,'' said Mrs. Dwyer, recalling when she received her first
questionnaire in the mail so long ago. ``I'm not even sure how long
it's been. One year I didn't send it back, but they kept after me
until I did. They keep sending it to you until you feel almost
guilty. And after awhile you think, you've done it all these years
_ why stop now?''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The National Aeronautics and Space Administration
has been shifting its focus away from costly, large satellites and
space probes, hailing a number of successes with smaller, less
expensive craft that exemplify its new ``faster, better, cheaper''
philosophy of doing business.
</P>
<P>
   From its highly successful Pathfinder mission, which left a
small robot rover crawling about Mars, to new probes heading for
asteroids and comets, and small satellites measuring tropical
rainfall or atmospheric gases on Earth, the space agency says it
has ample evidence that the streamlined approach is working.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller, simpler spacecraft _ combining cutting-edge technology,
like miniature instruments, with inexpensive, off-the-shelf
components _ can maintain a steady pace of exploration as budgets
decline and new billion-dollar missions, like the Hubble Space
Telescope, are no longer feasible, the space agency says.
</P>
<P>
   But what if faster, better, cheaper proves to be none of the
above? What if the process of narrower program requirements,
speedier, incentive-based contracts, more contractor responsibility
and less government supervision or oversight fails to pay off? Then
the government and the taxpayers could end up with Lewis and Clark.
</P>
<P>
   A program announced in 1994, the Small Spacecraft Technology
Initiative, should have resulted in two satellites named for the
19th century American explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark
orbiting Earth today, making detailed measurements of surface
features and doing environmental sampling. Together, the two
satellites were to demonstrate 55 new technologies and fly seven
major instruments developed by industry, university and government
scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Clark was never built, a victim of instrument problems,
testing delays and rising costs. And Lewis, launched into orbit on
Aug. 23, 1997, re-entered the atmosphere and burned up a month
later. Investigators said Lewis spun out of control and lost power
because of flawed control system design and inadequate monitoring
by ground controllers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lewis and Clark were not high-profile missions and didn't
raise a lot of eyebrows when they failed,'' said Marcia S. Smith, a
space policy expert with the Congressional Research Service, ``But
they showed you can do faster, smaller, cheaper, but don't
necessarily get better.''
</P>
<P>
   In announcing contracts for the two satellites in June 1994, the
administrator of the space agency, Daniel S. Goldin, said the
program put his ``faster, better, cheaper'' policy into practice.
He called for the satellites to be developed and launched into
orbit within 24 months at a cost of less than $60 million each.
Under this concept, the agency states the results it wants and
leaves it up to the contractor with the winning bid to determine
details, like design of the spacecraft, who will build what
instruments and what rocket will be used to launch the finished
craft.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new way of doing business for NASA,'' Goldin said
then. ``We told the industry what to do, not how to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   To safeguard the government's interests, contracts under the new
program contain awards based upon performance and disincentives for
cost overruns that reduce fees if costs rise above certain levels,
agency officials said. And if costs rise 15 percent above contract
amounts, they said, programs face cancellation.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ghassem Asrar, the agency's associate administrator for
earth science, said a new way of doing business required a new
management approach, one that did not require the constant scrutiny
of projects. But he said the experience with Lewis and Clark showed
the agency that it had gone too far in relinquishing oversight of
the projects to keep costs down.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a general perception in industry and Congress that
the government having too much oversight adds time and money to
projects,'' Asrar said, ``But we discovered the hard way that it's
not always true. We learned we stepped too far back.''
</P>
<P>
   A $59 million contract for Lewis went to TRW Inc. of Redondo
Beach, Calif., calling for a 600-pound satellite with a three-year
design life. It would carry two advanced imaging instruments,
called hyperspectral imaging radiometers, that would split light
reflected from Earth's surface into hundreds of spectral bandwidths
or colors.
</P>
<P>
   Since all material scatters light differently, scientists said
that getting data in hundreds of wavelengths instead of the
half-dozen or so measured by earlier Earth-resources satellites
would allow monitoring the planet in unprecedented detail.
</P>
<P>
   Potential applications of data from Lewis' hyperspectral imager,
which has not flown on another craft, and other instruments
included monitoring crops for stress, moisture and pests;
determining the health and variety of forests; monitoring
pollutants, including toxic waste dumping and oil spills; and
exploring for minerals from space.
</P>
<P>
   A $50 million contract for Clark went to CTA Inc. of a
Rockville, Md., a technology company that was acquired last year by
the Orbital Sciences Corp. of Dulles, Va., which designs and makes
rockets, satellites and other space-related products. Clark,
similar in dimensions to Lewis, was to carry instruments to measure
and map global air pollution from space, and an X-ray astronomy
experiment.
</P>
<P>
   The plans also called for the craft to carry an advanced
multispectral stereo imager designed to transmit to ground stations
only clear pictures that were not obscured by clouds. Cloud-covered
images contain little useful information about ground features, but
consume valuable computer resources to process and transmit.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists expected Clark to demonstrate the use of satellites
for land-use management and possible commercial applications,
including measuring the growth patterns and expansion of cities;
determining the best sites for airports, power plants and other
large projects, and assessing damage from tornadoes, floods and
other disasters.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Engineers familiar with Clark said the project ran into problems
when subcontractors had trouble building and testing some
instruments that proved more technically complex than expected. In
addition, they said, a number of subcontractors were acquired by
other companies during the development period and personnel
changes, combined sometimes with cost-cutting measures or
relocating of sites, resulted in schedule delays.
</P>
<P>
   Because regular reporting to NASA was not required and each
satellite program only had one person at NASA headquarters
monitoring it instead of a team, the agency was not aware of many
problems with Clark until last year, when it initiated several
reviews, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   When Orbital Sciences acquired CTA last year, NASA officials
said, it tried to find solutions to Clark's problems but the
potential fixes would have resulted in cost overruns exceeding
contract provisions.
</P>
<P>
   The agency terminated the Clark mission in February, citing
launching schedule delays and rising costs. The agency estimated
that it would cost $62.5 million to complete the project, a 23
percent cost growth that far exceeded the 15 percent maximum
allowed in the contract.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said it had invested about $55 million into Clark,
but had recovered some assets from the mission that might be used
in other projects, including three major instruments, spacecraft
components and rights to a booster rocket.
</P>
<P>
   Barron S. Beneski, a spokesman for Orbital Sciences, said the
company did not wish to comment on the Clark project and the
problems it had inherited from CTA, the original contractor. ``This
is in the past and we want to move on,'' he said. ``I'm sure
everybody learned some lessons from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis had a different set of problems, but shared one with
Clark. Both contractors selected the same new rocket to launch
their satellites, the Lockheed Martin Launch Vehicle. Development
of the rocket was delayed for two years when it went out of control
on its first flight in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   TRW delivered Lewis on time and the total cost to NASA ended up
being $64.8 million, within contract terms. But the agency incurred
an additional cost of $6.2 million for storage and maintenance of
the spacecraft when rocket problems delayed launching for a year.
</P>
<P>
   In a report issued in June, an independent failure review board
told the space agency that Lewis had failed because the attitude
control system used to keep it stable in space was flawed in design
and testing.
</P>
<P>
   TRW adapted the design from that of another spacecraft, but did
not adequately take in consideration that Lewis was oriented in
space differently from the other satellite. As a result, the
control system could not sense some of the satellite's spinning
motion and failed to correct it.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the report said, Lewis was designed to operate by
itself for long periods in a safe mode that required minimal ground
control. Controllers lost contact with the spacecraft three days
after launching after a 12-hour unattended period. By the time
technicians discovered the problem, the satellite had lost solar
power and discharged most of the energy in its batteries.

   The review board also criticized the flight team for failing to
notice initial signs of trouble and for deciding to abandon
round-the-clock staffed ground operations so early in the mission,
a decision that it said was not conveyed to the space agency or
senior TRW management.
</P>
<P>
   Joanne Maguire, vice president of TRW's space and laser program
division, said the company reviewed its procedures after the
failure and was updating several, including tightening the design
review process and revising how program managers report changes to
senior management.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lessons learned from Lewis are paying dividends to all of
our programs,'' Ms. Maguire said.
</P>
<P>
   Asrar of NASA said the agency was ultimately responsible for
assuring that project objectives were met and ``our assurance
process was ineffective in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency's Office of the Chief Engineer is putting together a
``lessons learned'' report on Lewis and Clark, as well as other
``faster, better, cheaper'' projects, in hope of finding the
optimal way to manage them, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency is moving toward what he called ``light touch
management'' for such programs, which includes two major reviews
during the course of each project and not giving contractors so
much autonomy. This is in contrast to old-style project management,
which often included a half-dozen reviews and daily interaction
with NASA, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This process is new and we are still learning,'' Asrar said.

   While the nation remains focused on the sex scandal in the White
House, the American public is ignoring what could be an even more
serious sexual scandal _ the young ages at which boys and girls now
engage in sexual intercourse, more often than not risking pregnancy
and sexually transmitted diseases, including infection with the
virus that causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of American children are at risk of having unsafe sex,
and it is critical that they learn, first, how to resist pressures
to have sexual intercourse at such young ages and, second, how to
protect themselves from unwanted consequences if and when they
decide to go all the way.
</P>
<P>
   While there has been a decline in the teen-age birth rate
resulting from the increased use of contraception and a leveling
off of sexual activity among teen-agers, there are still too many
girls and boys engaging in reckless sexual activity. Teen-age
pregnancy rates are much higher in the United States than in many
other developed countries _ twice as high as in England and in
Canada and nine times as high as in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   American teen-agers, their parents and teachers should be aware
of the findings of a study conducted in New Zealand among more than
900 21-year-old men and women. As studies have found in the United
States and Britain, the New Zealand study reported that half the
men questioned reported having intercourse for the first time by
age 17 and half the women by age 16. In New Zealand, nearly a third
of the women and 28 percent of the men were 15 or younger when they
first had sex. But looking back, many who became sexually active in
their early or mid-teens had regrets about starting so young.
</P>
<P>
   Now older and wiser, 54 percent of the women and 16 percent of
the men said they should have waited longer before engaging in
sexual intercourse, and among the women whose first sexual
experience occurred before age 16, 70 percent said they wished they
had waited.
</P>
<P>
   According to the study's findings, which were published in
January in the British Medical Journal, 13 percent of the men who
first had intercourse before age 16 contracted a sexually
transmitted disease, as against only 6 percent of those who waited
longer to initiate sexual activity. Among the women, the comparable
figures were 28 percent and 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Although the New Zealand researchers did not ask about the use
of contraception and unwanted pregnancies, studies in this country
have shown that 22 percent of girls 15 through 19 fail to use
contraception the first time they have sex. And among 1,510
Americans 12 through 18 questioned in 1996, less than half reported
consistently using contraception.
</P>
<P>
   As might be predicted, each year in the United States, about 3
million teen-agers acquire a sexually transmitted disease.
One-fifth of the people diagnosed with AIDS are in their 20s, and
most were infected as teen-agers. And each year nearly 1 million
teen-age girls, including 20 percent of sexually active girls 15
through 19, get pregnant. Teen-age pregnancy rates have more than
tripled from 1960 to the early '90s, with about 40 percent of girls
getting pregnant before they turn 20. One-fifth of the unmarried
teen-agers who get pregnant do so within the first month of first
intercourse and one-half within the first six months. With little
instruction at home or at school on how to resist the pressures to
have sex and with even more erratic access to effective
contraception, such consequences are hardly surprising.
</P>
<P>
   The New Zealand researchers, from the University of Otago
Medical School in Dunedin, cited familiar reasons for the falling
age at which first intercourse occurs. ``Children are exposed to
sexual images through the media,'' they wrote. ``Social and peer
pressure may arise from the portrayal of sex as glamorous,
pleasurable and adult, while negative consequences and the
responsibilities involved in sexual relationships are seldom
portrayed.''
</P>
<P>
   That's putting it mildly. In a currently popular movie, ``Slums
of Beverly Hills,'' a precocious 13-year-old decides to have sex
with an older boy ``just to get it over with.'' Is this the message
we want to convey to American youth _ that sex is something you
try, like roller-blading or water skiing, to see what it's like or
to add to your roster of achievements? Dr. Ann Davis, an adolescent
gynecologist formerly at the Floating Hospital in Boston, said,
``Often when I ask a young teen whether she is sexually active, she
will seem ashamed to admit that she is not.''
</P>
<P>
   Virginity may no longer be the prize it once was among
prospective brides. Nor does having an abortion or bearing a child
out of wedlock carry the stigma it used to. Still, these are hardly
desirable options for young people, whose primary goals should be
to get an education and acquire skills to be able to support
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Lest you think that girls who have sex do so because they find
it irresistible, in a 1992 national survey, 25 percent of them said
that their first experience was ``voluntary but unwanted.'' The
percentage of unwanted sexual activity, as well as the failure to
use contraception, rises with the older the boy is than the girl.
Experts in the field say that age 9 is none too soon to teach girls
how and why to say ``no'' and what to do should they say ``yes.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem admittedly is not easy to tackle. A study published
this summer in the journal Family Planning Perspectives disclosed
that girls who have intercourse at an early age, as well as those
who fail to use contraceptives and those who have children, tend to
be depressed, have low self-esteem and possess little sense of
control over their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, reducing the incidence of early and risky sexual activity
may involve much more than instruction about sex and contraception.
It may require giving girls a reason to be hopeful and an
opportunity to believe in themselves and their ability to make
something of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   When a girl's home life fails to instill such hope, it falls on
the shoulders of schools and after-school activities to fill in the
gaps.
</P>
<P>
   Programs like two developed by Girls Inc., Growing Together and
Will Power/Won't Power, have proved effective in delaying sexual
activity among young girls. Growing Together involves five two-hour
mother-daughter workshops designed to foster communications about
sexuality and other sensitive issues.
</P>
<P>
   Will Power/Won't Power is an assertiveness training program
designed to help young teen-agers refuse to become sexually active
without jeopardizing their friendships and popularity with peers of
both sexes.
</P>
<P>
   Both programs explore the opportunities life holds and help
girls realize what they may lose by becoming pregnant. The
techniques used in these programs could be adopted in communities
and intermediate and high schools nationwide. For details about the
design of both programs, contact Girls Inc. at 212-509-2000 or on

DESKTOP STUDIO FOR HOME VIDEO BUFFS 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(jt) 
 By ROB FIXMER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With a few notable exceptions like the stuff that ends up on
``America's Funniest Home Videos,'' most family movies and tapes
are destined to the oblivion of those dresser drawers that collect
the pressed flowers and love beads of our youth.
</P>
<P>
   There is no mystery to this. Home videos are typically painfully
packed with jiggled-camera shots and endless feet of boring images.
Yet, most contain a few gems within their 120 minutes of raw
footage that are worth savoring from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies the market for Studio 400, a $200 peripheral from
Pinnacle Systems of Sunnyvale, Calif., that enables people with
Pentium-class computers running Windows 95 or 98 to edit home
videos into movies that are actually worth watching.
</P>
<P>
   No one who has used a professional Macintosh-based video editing
system like the Avid would ever be satisfied with the Studio 400.
Yet, with enough patience and just a touch of creativity, this
product can help you fashion a first-rate production from the
visual chaos of your home videos.
</P>
<P>
   And if your objective is to produce videos for a Web site, the
Studio 400 is probably a wiser investment than a professional
system. Its lack of sophistication is not a drawback for making
short clips, and the quality of its output far exceeds the current
state of the art in online movies.
</P>
<P>
   That said, do not rush out and buy this device unless you are
absolutely sure you have the required equipment to make it work _
and that you are willing to suffer through the extreme hassles of
setting it up and disassembling it.
</P>
<P>
   The most important requirement is the right kind of camcorder.
It basically has to be a Sony or one of the very few camcorders
from other companies that use the Sony LANC system. LANC, commonly
referred to as ``Control L,'' is a set of communications rules that
Sony cameras use to send and receive instructions like start, stop,
record and pause. Unless you already own such a camcorder or are
willing to buy one, the Studio 400 will be useless.
</P>
<P>
   (Pinnacle Systems also claims to support a few camcorders that
can be controlled with an infrared remote or a Panasonic 5-pin
jack, only used abroad. For this review, only a Sony camcorder was
used.)
</P>
<P>
   "You will also need a VCR that can be controlled by a standard
infrared remote. That covers virtually all VCR's, but unless your
computer just happens to be sitting right next to your television,
you will have to unplug the VCR and move it.
</P>
<P>
   Before doing this, consider that when unplugged, most VCR's lose
anything stored in their memory, which will have be reset. And if
your VCR requires using an on-screen menu to switch it from cable
or antenna reception to accepting input from a camcorder, you will
also have to attach a television to the VCR during the setup
process.
</P>
<P>
   Nor will you be able to use your VCR or camcorder when it is
connected to the system.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, installing Studio 400 leaves you with a jumble of
eight cables, at least two of which are not supplied and will have
to be hunted down. The unit itself _ a box about 6.5 inches by 4.5
inches and 2 inches called the studio mixer _ must be plugged into
a computer's parallel and serial ports and into a parallel printer
unless you have more than one printer port.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you are willing to go through the expense of making the
Studio 400 a semi-permanent installation by dedicating a VCR and
camcorder to the system, setting up for each editing session will
take about an hour.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, you can do without the VCR and save your finished
movies directly on your hard drive _ but only if you have about a
gigabyte of space for a half-hour movie that plays on the PC
screen.
</P>
<P>
   There are other drawbacks. The connection to your parallel port
is supposed to let you run your printer at the same time, but when
either of two popular ink-jet printers _ a Canon BJC 4000 or an
Epson 600 _ was attached to Studio 400, neither worked properly.
Nor could the computer find a Xip drive that had been attached via
the parallel port. Two hours of playing with the port settings,
rebooting and re-initializing printers never fixed the problems.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, once set up, Studio 400 turned out to be a useful tool
that enables you to control both your camcorder and VCR from your
computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   The first step is to capture the images from a tape on the
camcorder and save them on your hard drive. At this step, the
system employs heavy compression so that the images use little disk
space _ about 150 megabytes for every hour of video. These images
only have to be good enough to let you see what you will be editing
and can be discarded after the movie is completed.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, it is easiest to capture the video from an entire
tape, but you can monitor the action on screen as the tape plays
and start and stop the camcorder to select only portions you want
to use. As the video is captured, Studio 400 recognizes scene
changes and pops the first frame of each scene into an ``album'' on
your computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   Next you choose the scenes you want and arrange them in order by
dragging the first frame of a scene from the album into a cell on a
``story board.'' You then choose fades, cuts and other ways that
one scene blends into another from a respectable selection of
effects and drag them to their desired spot on the story board.
</P>
<P>
   Studio 400 also enables you to create titles and subtitles.
While title animation is limited, the text can be moved in and out
of scenes nicely using the transition effects.
</P>
<P>
   The editing is completed by switching from the story board to a
timeline view of the movie. At this point you can shorten or
rearrange scenes, add sound effects, narration and background music
and fine-tune transitions. Music can be cued to the exact length of
the movie or of individual scenes.
</P>
<P>
   When editing is finished, Studio 400 completes the movie by
reading its instructions from your timeline. For each scene, it
cues the camcorder to the first frame, copies the scene to the VCR,
then pauses the VCR, finds the first frame of the next scene and
repeats the process until the entire movie is assembled on the
videotape in your VCR. At each step, it adds the titles, transition
effects and sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on your creativity and patience and the quality of the
videos, the result can be surprisingly professional _ or just
another, very expensive artifact for your dresser drawer.

   &UR; Corn Silk &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is it true that each strand of silk on an ear of corn
represents a kernel of corn?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, but only if pollen falls on the silk. Otherwise, a
kernel does not develop.
</P>
<P>
   A corn plant produces corn silk surrounding each ear about two
months after the plant emerges from the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The plant matures after about four months, according to ``How a
Corn Plant Develops,'' a report by the Cooperative Extension
Service of the Iowa State University of Science and Technology at
Ames.
</P>
<P>
   Tassels, the male part of the plant, emerge at its apex and shed
pollen for a week or two, fertilizing the individual silk strands
below, said Dr. Dale E. Farnham, assistant professor of agronomy at
Iowa State.
</P>
<P>
   The silk strands grow a little more than an inch every day and
continue to grow until they are fertilized.
</P>
<P>
   Pollination occurs when the falling or wind-borne pollen grains
are caught by these new moist silk strands. A captured pollen grain
takes about 24 hours to move down the silk to the ovule, where
fertilization occurs. The ovule then develops into a kernel.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, two to three days are required for all silk strands
on an ear to be exposed and pollinated.
</P>
<P>
   Ovules that are not fertilized will not produce kernels and will
eventually degenerate. Stressful conditions, including lack of
moisture, tend to dry the silk strands and pollen grains, usually
resulting in a nubbin, or an ear with a barren tip.

UNHAPPY MARRIAGE OF PLANTS  
 NOT ALL CLOCKS ARE IN SYNC  
 EVEN BIRDS NEED PRACTICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By KAREN FREEMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Genetic engineering may be enough to push a plant to
promiscuity. And that's bad news for the scientists who have been
counting on crop plants' propensity to keep themselves to
themselves when it comes to reproduction.
</P>
<P>
   When genetic engineers slip a gene for herbicide resistance into
a crop, they hope that the domesticated plants won't pass it
around. If the wild plants can't get the gene for resistance, they
can be wiped out with the herbicide.
</P>
<P>
   No one wants to see a generation of untamed interlopers with a
gene that lets them thumb their metaphorical noses at the
weedkiller.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't thought to be much of a danger because most crop
plants are self-fertilizing. But when Dr. Joy Bergelson of the
University of Chicago and two colleagues looked at genetically
engineered Arabidopsis _ a self-fertilizing mustard plant _ they
saw inhibitions against mating with wild relatives melting away.
</P>
<P>
   And it seems to be gene splicing, not just the herbicide
resistance, that is the cause, the researchers reported in the
Sept. 3 issue of the journal Nature. Non-engineered plants with a
mutant gene for herbicide resistance showed nowhere near the level
of erosion of family values.
</P>
<P>
   __
</P>
<P>
   Plant behavior is also causing trouble for scientists working on
ways to store nuclear waste.
</P>
<P>
   When a small amount of radioactive material from the Three Mile
Island accident was buried in an experiment at Oak Ridge National
Laboratory in Tennessee, scientists expected to see some
radioactivity leaching out _ but down, not up. When radioactivity
turned up on the surface, they had to figure out why.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers led by Dr. William Sanford of Colorado State
University reported in the Journal of Environmental Radioactivity
that plant roots probably drank in radioactive molecules in water
and ferried them to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   __
</P>
<P>
   Whether plant or animal, slowpoke or speedster, organisms across
a wide swath of biology may use the same basic mechanism for timing
daily cycles. But that doesn't mean that all biological clocks
evolved from the same ancestral clock, and a study in the Sept. 4
issue of the journal Science indicates that they probably didn't.
</P>
<P>
   The circadian clock, that self-winding marvel, appears to tick
away with swings of a molecular pendulum. The level of a molecule
builds until a braking mechanism is triggered, then the level falls
as the pendulum swings back.
</P>
<P>
   But researchers from Nagoya University have reported that the
circadian molecules used by blue-green algae are different from
those used by mammals and fruit flies, indicating a separate
evolutionary origin.
</P>
<P>
   The clocks all do a remarkable job for their disparate masters.
As Alexander Pope said, `` 'Tis with our judgments as our watches,
none go just alike, yet each believes his own.''
</P>
<P>
   __
</P>
<P>
   Timing is just one of the problems of a young zebra finch trying
to learn to sound like one. A study in the Sept. 3 issue of Nature
says the syrinx, the source of birdsong, is a more complicated
instrument than it appears.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Bell Laboratories and the California Institute of
Technology looked at the acoustic properties of the isolated syrinx
and found the organ is capable of producing a variety of sounds all
on its own, free of muscle control and neural input.
</P>
<P>
   So a young finch yearning to sound like an adult one day has a
tough instrument to master _ more like taking up the French horn
than fooling around with a harmonica.

<P>
   Most of the talking heads on TV and a good number of senators
and congressmen seem to be in a state of collective shock over the
more lurid elements of the Starr Report. They're stunned, they tell
us. Stunned!
</P>
<P>
   ``How can this president ever walk in front of another audience
again, again in his life, political or private, without their first
thought in the front row being the thought bubble, the mental image
of the acts described in this report we're reading today?'' fretted
Brian Williams of MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's worse than I thought it would be!'' said Rep. Thomas
Davis (R.-Virginia).
</P>
<P>
   Give me a break. What did these people expect when they scrolled
through the Starr Report? Did they really think they'd read stories
of romantic dinners, declarations of deep love, stolen kisses under
the moonlight and soft-focus movie-sex with orchestral music in the
background?
</P>
<P>
   Affairs are rarely if ever like that in real life. Affairs are
awkward and messy and occasionally ridiculous _ especially the
sexual stuff. Zippers are unzipped, bras are unhooked,
undergarments are pushed aside in a rushed frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   Was the Clinton-Lewinsky liaison really so different from
millions of other flings? I don't think so. Joke all you want about
the cigar, the Altoid mints, the stained dress _ but would you want
every little quirk of your sex life to be detailed in a report
posted on the Internet?
</P>
<P>
   Forget for a moment that Bill Clinton is the leader of the free
world, and you realize this relationship was almost mundane.
Clinton's fling with Lewinsky follows the pattern of so many
assignations between older, married men and starstruck young women.
It wasn't shocking _ it was depressingly predictable, from its
groping start to its inevitable finish.
</P>
<P>
   She was an intern who flirted with the boss, who should have
known better than to pursue it. Instead, he encouraged her as she
playfully showed him a flash of her underwear, and told him she had
a big crush on him.
</P>
<P>
   He asked if he could kiss her. She said yes. Moments later, she
was engaging in a sex act.
</P>
<P>
   Thus began what Lewinsky thought was a grand love affair, and
Clinton knew to be something less. A month into it, Lewinsky
starting asking the questions young women almost always ask when
mired in such relationships.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him why doesn't he ask any questions about myself, and
... is this just about sex?'' she testified.
</P>
<P>
   And Clinton gave the kind of answer married older men almost
always give in that situation. He assured Lewinsky he ``cherished''
their time together.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, he gave her just enough encouragement to keep it
going.
</P>
<P>
   Did Clinton consider leaving his wife for Monica? Hey, it
happens. The world is filled with trophy second wives. In this
case, though, it's doubtful the man considered such a move for even
one second.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Monica thought they were in love, and she convinced herself
the feeling was mutual, according to the Starr Report.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just knew he was in love with me,'' she told prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   While it's true that Clinton foolishly, recklessly gave Lewinsky
trinkets and would wear the neckties she presented to him, it was
Monica who acted as if she was a high school senior in love with a
teacher who really just wanted sex but tolerated her fantasies of a
substantial relationship.
</P>
<P>
   _ For Valentine's Day, she placed a personals ad in the
Washington Post. It was addressed to ``Handsome,'' and quoted from
``Romeo and Juliet.''
</P>
<P>
   _ She blabbed to at least 11 people about the affair, reportedly
telling one friend Clinton might marry her after he left the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   _ She sent him gushing love notes, riddled with grammatical
errors, and spent hours on the phone with him.
</P>
<P>
   _ As Clinton tried to distance himself from her, she crashed
parties and even tried to grope him in public, and she threw
tantrums and began referring to him as the ``creep.''
</P>
<P>
   _ After a gap of nearly a year, there were two more cheap
trysts. This too sounds like an awful lot of affairs in which the
married man calls it off, only to have a brief relapse before
ending it for good.
</P>
<P>
   _ Finally, in December of 1997, Lewinsky was outside the gates
of the White House, in tears and screaming at Secret Service agents
who refused to let her see the president one last time. Only then
did she realize it was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want me out of your life,'' she wrote to Clinton. ``I
guess the signs have been made clear for a while _ not wanting to
see me and rarely calling ... You let me down, but I shouldn't have
trusted you in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Shocking? Stunning? Hardly. This was a most ordinary affair,
doomed from the start. The most obscene thing about the whole
sordid episode is that people are seriously talking about
impeaching the president over this nonsense.

<P>
   Most of the talking heads on TV and a good number of senators
and congressmen seem to be in a state of collective shock over the
more lurid elements of the Starr Report. They're stunned, they tell
us. Stunned!
</P>
<P>
   ``How can this president ever walk in front of another audience
again, again in his life, political or private, without their first
thought in the front row being the thought bubble, the mental image
of the acts described in this report we're reading today?'' fretted
Brian Williams of MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's worse than I thought it would be!'' said Rep. Thomas
Davis (R.-Virginia).
</P>
<P>
   Give me a break. What did these people expect when they scrolled
through the Starr Report? Did they really think they'd read stories
of romantic dinners, declarations of deep love, stolen kisses under
the moonlight and soft-focus movie-sex with orchestral music in the
background?
</P>
<P>
   Affairs are rarely if ever like that in real life. Affairs are
awkward and messy and occasionally ridiculous _ especially the
sexual stuff. Zippers are unzipped, bras are unhooked,
undergarments are pushed aside in a rushed frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   Was the Clinton-Lewinsky liaison really so different from
millions of other flings? I don't think so. Joke all you want about
the cigar, the Altoid mints, the stained dress _ but would you want
every little quirk of your sex life to be detailed in a report
posted on the Internet?
</P>
<P>
   Forget for a moment that Bill Clinton is the leader of the free
world, and you realize this relationship was almost mundane.
Clinton's fling with Lewinsky follows the pattern of so many
assignations between older, married men and starstruck young women.
It wasn't shocking _ it was depressingly predictable, from its
groping start to its inevitable finish.
</P>
<P>
   She was an intern who flirted with the boss, who should have
known better than to pursue it. Instead, he encouraged her as she
playfully showed him a flash of her underwear, and told him she had
a big crush on him.
</P>
<P>
   He asked if he could kiss her. She said yes. Moments later, she
was engaging in a sex act.
</P>
<P>
   Thus began what Lewinsky thought was a grand love affair, and
Clinton knew to be something less. A month into it, Lewinsky
starting asking the questions young women almost always ask when
mired in such relationships.

<P>
   ``I asked him why doesn't he ask any questions about myself, and

FILIPINOS CONTINUE QUEST FOR RETURN OF CHURCH BELLS FROM WYOMING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIE CHAO  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ At an Air Force base in Cheyenne, Wyo., sit two
bronze church bells at the center of a trans-Pacific dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Taken by American soldiers as a war trophy in 1901 from a
Philippine island, the bells symbolize a period of history few
Americans understand well _ the violent and bloody rebellion
against U.S. rule.
</P>
<P>
   The Bells of Balangiga, as they are called, had been forgotten
for decades in their isolated Wyoming home. They suddenly came to
international prominence last year when the Philippines asked for
them back in time for the centennial of the Philippines'
independence from Spain.
</P>
<P>
   But asking has not been enough, nor has a year of high-level
negotiations or pleas to the spirit of a century of
Filipino-American friendship.
</P>
<P>
   Pitting American war veterans against Filipino-American
activists, the question of where the bells belong has stirred up
issues of patriotism, justice and interpretations of history.
</P>
<P>
   The story of how the church bells ended up in Cheyenne stems
from two grisly battles in the coastal village of Balangiga in
1901. In the first, nationalist rebels launched a surprise attack
on American soldiers as they were quietly eating breakfast. The
bells of the small Catholic church were sounded as the assault
began. Only 22 of 74 soldiers survived.
</P>
<P>
   Retaliation was brutal. American Brig. Gen. Jacob Smith
essentially ordered his troops to kill everyone on the island of
Samar over the age of 10. Villages were set on fire, crops were
destroyed and thousands are believed to have died.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish you to kill and burn. The more you kill and burn, the
better you will please me,'' Smith told his officers, according to
testimony at his court-martial in 1902.
</P>
<P>
   Although Smith was found guilty of misconduct, he got off with
admonishment.
</P>
<P>
   American troops took the two bells back to their home base, what
is now F.E. Warren Air Force Base in Cheyenne, as war trophies.
Nearly a century later, Wyoming veterans view the bells as a
commemoration to lost American lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just don't believe in dismantling war memorials,'' said
Robert Nab, an adjutant of the American Legion in Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   Any notion that the bells are religious objects, as Bishop
Joseph Hart of the Cheyenne diocese has argued, doesn't wash with
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our view is, the church became part of the conflict because it
was used to alert the local people to attack the American army,''
Nab said. ``We feel strongly that the bells and the church itself
were part of the massacre.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Filipino Americans have strongly advocated the return of
the bells.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of us take the act of acquiring these bells as a total
insult,'' said Terry Bautista, a co-founder of Filipinos for
Affirmative Action in Oakland, Calif. ``It's like you already
killed the women and children, you already took it upon yourselves
to mess up the land, then you have the gall to take something from
a church.''
</P>
<P>
   The significance of the Balangiga battles went beyond the lives
lost on both sides, says Professor Daniel Phil Gonzales,
coordinator of Filipino-American studies at San Francisco State
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``The retaliatory attack did not stop with Balangiga,'' he said.
``It was the spark for even more insidious slaughter of tens of
thousands of people. It made the wholesale slaughter of Filipinos a
rational act in the minds of Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that the June centennial celebration of the Philippines'
independence from Spain has come and gone, the goal is to get the
bells back by 2001, the centennial of the confiscation, said Rodel
Rodis, a San Francisco attorney who has written several articles
about the bells.
</P>
<P>
   The Philippine government has even proposed a compromise _ make
replicas of the bells and allow each country to keep one replica
and one genuine bell. But the Wyoming veterans were not receptive
to the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``All it takes is a small group of narrow-minded, jingoistic
veterans,'' Rodis said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The group has some powerful allies. Sen. Craig Thomas, R-Wyo.,
introduced a bill in April requiring congressional approval before
any part of a veterans memorial could be sent to a foreign country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most people (in Wyoming) agree that this is a memorial
to the soldiers who died,'' said Dan Kunsman, a spokesman for the
senator. ``History brought them to Cheyenne, and that memorial
should stay there.''
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the conflict in the Philippines lasted four years _
from 1898, when the United States acquired the archipelago
following the Spanish-American War, until 1902, when President
Theodore Roosevelt declared victory.
</P>
<P>
   Some estimates say that as many as 250,000 Filipinos were killed
in the insurrection. The Philippines gained independence from the
United States after World War II.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANDERSON VALLEY, Calif. _ Kary Mullis, Nobel laureate in
chemistry, is jumping up and down at the kitchen table of his
cabin, a place in the woods several miles beyond where the paved
road ends. His large head and wiry body shake as if in rage. From
his lips comes an angry buzzing sound.
</P>
<P>
   He is imitating a swarm of yellow jackets, acting out an episode
in which the wily insects ambushed him, inflicting five stings
around the mouth, after he had attacked their nest. He goes on to
tell how he invented a novel brew, concocted in his kitchen
blender, that eliminated the aggressors from his property for a
season.
</P>
<P>
   He feels somewhat the same way toward his former colleagues at
the Cetus Corp., where he invented the technique that won him the
Nobel Prize. ``None of those vultures had anything to do with it,''
he says emphatically. He is aggrieved that Cetus paid him a mere
$10,000 for the discovery but later sold it to Hoffmann-La Roche
for $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   His invention, known as the polymerase chain reaction or PCR, is
used for amplifying chosen sections of DNA and has quickly become
an essential tool for biologists, DNA forensics labs, and almost
anyone else who needs to study the genetic material.
</P>
<P>
   Amplifying DNA, a requirement for most tests, used to be done in
bacteria, a process that took weeks. With PCR, performed with
chemicals in a test tube, the job takes a few hours.
</P>
<P>
   Science has been just one of the keen interests in Mullis's
life, competing with psychedelic drugs and women, although he is
now happily married to his fourth wife, Nancy Cosgrove. His newest
interest is writing. A book of essays, ``Dancing Naked in the Mind
Field,'' was published last month by Pantheon.
</P>
<P>
   For those who would like to analyze creativity and sell it in
bottles, Mullis would seem a promising subject. His invention is
highly original and significant, virtually dividing biology into
the two epochs of before PCR and after PCR. Yet the Mullis formula
for creativity, on closer inspection, is a brew probably somewhat
unsuitable for general consumption.
</P>
<P>
   One ingredient is unbounded self-confidence. ``Part of it has to
do with his ego and belief that he's much smarter than the people
around him,'' said Dr. Corey Levenson, a former Cetus colleague now
at Ilex Oncology in San Antonio. ``Most people who launch into an
unfamiliar area would first speak to recognized authorities and get
all the background. Kary saw that as a waste of time. He figured it
would take less time to do the experiments himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Mullis' friends speak of his physical as well as intellectual
risk-taking. Dr. Frank McCormick, a cancer biologist at the
University of California, San Francisco, recalls seeing Mullis in
Aspen skiing down the center of an icy road through fast two-way
traffic. ``Mullis had a vision that he would die by crashing his
head against a redwood tree. Hence he is fearless wherever there
are no redwoods,'' McCormick said.
</P>
<P>
   Along with lack of fear comes a lack of concern about people's
opinions. In his new book Mullis describes episodes that others
might keep private, such as the time he addressed the Empress of
Japan as ``sweetie'' when being awarded the Japan prize, and how he
was nearly arrested when he went to Stockholm for his Nobel Prize,
for playing a laser beam from his hotel room at passers-by.
</P>
<P>
   His fondness for the heterodox is evident in the account of a
lecture he gave in April 1994 at a medical society conference in
Toledo, Spain. ``Just before the lecture, he told me he would not
speak about the PCR but would tell his ideas about AIDS not being
caused by the HIV virus,'' the ambushed president of the society,
Dr. John F. Martin, wrote afterward in a letter to Nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``His only slides (on what he called `his art') were photographs
he had taken of naked women with colored lights projected on their
bodies,'' Martin continued. ``He accused science of being
universally corrupt with widespread falsification of data to obtain
grants. Finally he impugned the honesty of several named scientists
working in the HIV field.''
</P>
<P>
   Kary B. Mullis was born in 1944 in Lenoir, N.C., and grew up in
South Carolina, where his father was a furniture salesman and his
mother, who raised him after a separation, sold real estate.
</P>
<P>
   He trained as a chemist at the Georgia Institute of Technology
and at the University of California at Berkeley. Then, shortly
after getting his Ph.D., he dropped off the scientist's usual
career path, first to write fiction and then, for two years, to
manage a bakery.
</P>
<P>
   It was a friend, Thomas J. White, who found him jobs back in
science, first at the University of California, San Francisco, and
then at Cetus in Emeryville, Calif., one of the first biotechnology
companies. Mullis's job, essentially that of a technician, was to
make short chains of DNA for other scientists. When machines became
available to do the job, he had time on his hands for other
pursuits.
</P>
<P>
   Mullis has often described how the concept of PCR came to him
during a night drive along Highway 128 to his cabin in Anderson
Valley. He was playing in his mind with a new way of analyzing
mutations in DNA and suddenly realized that he had thought up
instead a method of amplifying any DNA region of choice. Before the
trip was over, Mullis has written, he was already savoring
prospects of the Nobel Prize.
</P>
<P>
   The night journey was made in 1983; the Nobel Prize came 10
years later. But by then Mullis had dropped out of full-time
science again. He left Cetus in 1986, earning his living by
consulting and lecturing. He has published no more scientific
papers. The divine spark that kindled the idea of PCR has not
struck again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like writing about biology, not doing it,'' Mullis says. ``I
don't want to go back to the lab myself and don't want to have
people under my command. Fiction is my way around doing
experiments.''
</P>
<P>
   He also enjoys giving lectures. ``I love a microphone and a big
crowd; I'm an entertainer, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of his agenda seems to have been selected with an eye to
the shock value of adopting beliefs untypical of Nobel
prize-winning scientists. He echoes the belief of the distinguished
virologist Peter Duesberg that HIV is not the cause of AIDS. He
disputes the arguments that chlorofluorocarbons are depleting the
ozone layer and that industrial waste gases may cause the climate
to get hotter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scientists are doing an awful lot of damage to the world in
the name of helping it. I don't mind attacking my own fraternity
because I am ashamed of it,'' Mullis says.
</P>
<P>
   He jumps to his feet to swat a yellow jacket that has
infiltrated the cabin.
</P>
<P>
   Given his success as an independent thinker in chemistry,
Mullis's challenges to other kinds of orthodoxy are not to be
lightly dismissed. But the line between fact and entertainment in
Mullis's world can be hard to discern. In his book he professes to
believe in astrology, to have been rescued from a fatal accident by
a person travelling in an astral plane, and to have conversed with
an alien disguised as a raccoon.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Asked why people should accept his views on AIDS when he has no
standing as a virologist, he replies, ``I don't care, I'm on my
vacation life here.''
</P>
<P>
   Vacation life? ``I have a spiritual thing in me. After lots of
tough lives I got a vacation.'' Is he speaking of reincarnation as
a metaphor or the real thing? ``I believe it,'' he says. ``If
reincarnation is a useful biological idea it is certain that
somewhere in the universe it will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Is it not awkward to accommodate reincarnation within the theory
of evolution? ``I don't think DNA is the whole thing even though I
invented a cool way of playing with it,'' Mullis declares.
</P>
<P>
   The invention of PCR may well become a paradigm of scientific
discovery because of its significance and because Mullis has
described the eureka moment so graphically. But though the idea was
central, proving it worked was also important.
</P>
<P>
   According to White, the friend who got him a job at Cetus and
oversaw part of the development of PCR, the reduction of the idea
to practice was done largely by others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mullis as an experimentalist is sort of hit and miss,'' White
said. ``He got a lot of data but he was having personal problems
and tended to do uncontrolled experiments, so it wasn't very
convincing when he did get a result.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after a year, Mullis had not developed definitive proof of
his concept, so White then enlisted another scientist's help.
Within a few months Dr. Randall Saiki, a rigorous experimentalist,
produced data that convinced everyone at Cetus that the process
worked, White said.
</P>
<P>
   Mullis believes his colleagues tried to take the credit for the
invention away from him. White denies that, saying a plan to have
Mullis author the first paper describing the theory of PCR went
awry because Mullis whiled away the summer creating fractal
pictures on Cetus's computers instead of doing experiments.
</P>
<P>
   By default, a paper by Saiki and other scientists on the
applications of PCR was published first. Mullis's own paper was
then rejected by the journals Nature and Science on the grounds
that it was not new.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel he has never accepted responsibility for the course of
how the publications came out,'' White said, noting that he and
colleagues then took steps to let other scientists know Mullis was
the inventor, such as having him describe the technique at an
important conference.
</P>
<P>
   White pays tribute to Mullis's fertile mind, describing how he
came up with practical ways to improve PCR, such as the use of Taq
polymerase, an enzyme made by bacteria that live at high
temperatures. But managing his friend's creativity was not a
carefree task.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a hard person to know, hard not only on his spouses but
on his friends. In the midst of being extremely charming he could
be extremely abusive,'' White said. The two men are no longer close
friends but White, who is now vice president of Roche Molecular
Systems in Alameda, Calif., said that Mullis is ``a very unusual
person, no doubt about it _ I am happy I knew him.''
</P>
<P>
   White's version of events is supported by Paul Rabinow, an
anthropologist at the University of California at Berkeley, who
made a study of Cetus at the time PCR was invented. His book,
``Making P.C.R.,'' was published in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mullis is a brilliant, gifted guy who at Cetus found himself
protected by a very steadfast character, Tom White. The one person
who never said he wanted credit for PCR was Tom White,'' Rabinow
said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the monetary rewards for PCR, Mullis says in his book he
was ``plenty wrong'' in his assumption that he would be amply
rewarded by Cetus. His former colleagues consider he did not do too
badly. He voluntarily quit the company in 1986 at a time when no
commercial value had been established for PCR, and five years
before its sale to Roche for $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the guy had been around five years later he would have been
handsomely rewarded,'' White said. ``Any invention you make is
owned by the company, that's the deal,'' said Levenson.
</P>
<P>
   Mullis has blazed through his friends' lives like a meteor,
leaving so blinding a trail that few feel they can see to the core.
``I don't know where creativity comes from. He built his model of
the universe to fit what he observed,'' Levenson said.
</P>
<P>
   In Rabinow's view, Mullis is ``a tinkerer, a bricoleur, he loves
to play with things, he loves to try things out, he ignores people
who say you can't do it. He was an experimentalist not in the high
scientific sense but the magician sense.''
</P>
<P>
   In Mullis's new profession, as author and lecturer, the magic is
less evident. His book is amusingly written but some of its
viewpoints seem a little ad hoc, like a surprising attack on the
Federal Reserve Board as a ``tawdry sepsis.''
</P>
<P>
   Mullis repeats the words several times to savor their resonance.
It's a good fighting phrase, but why apply it to the Federal
Reserve? Mullis explains that with the Board's ability to intervene
in currency markets its members have ample opportunity to profit
from their inside knowledge. ``If you can get around the law you do
it, and Alan Greenspan is no different from Kary Mullis,'' he
declares.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Kary, you're not dishonest,'' his wife protests. ``With
money I am,'' he says defiantly. The bottle of red wine at his
side, full three hours ago, now stands empty. The yellow jackets
are resuming their campaign. A mind that made a brilliant invention
is wandering between sense and solipsism.

   &UR; Lead in Breast Milk &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Mother's milk is generally best, but not always.
</P>
<P>
   A study in the October issue of Environmental Health
Perspectives, the journal of the National Institute of
Environmental Health Sciences, shows that lead accumulated in a
woman's bones can be released during pregnancy and transferred to
breast milk during lactation. This can mean increased lead exposure
for breast-fed infants, a risk if the mothers have been previously
exposed to high concentrations of lead.
</P>
<P>
   The study, conducted by Australian and American scientists,
looked at samples of blood, urine and breast milk of 21 mothers
during pregnancy and six months after delivery and compared these
samples with blood and urine specimens from their 24 infants, said
Dr. Brian Gulson, a toxicologist at Macquarie University in Sydney,
Australia, and lead investigator of the project. The researchers
found a significant link between the amount of lead in the mothers'
milk samples and the corresponding lead levels in the infants'
blood. They also noted that 40 percent to 70 percent of the lead in
pregnant women's blood came from lead accumulated in the bones.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paul Mushak, who was an adviser to the study, believes the
research has relevance for health and regulatory policy. ``One of
its critical implications is that lead is a transgenerational
problem,'' Mushak said. High lead levels in the blood of infants
and children can result in brain damage, behavioral problems and
liver and kidney disorders. The Centers for Disease Control
recommends testing for high-risk infants beginning at the age of 6
months.
</P>
<P>
   As for breastfeeding, Gulson says, ``It is still an important
option for healthy mothers. Breast-fed infants are only at risk if
their mothers have been previously exposed to high concentrations
of lead.''

   ``You think there might be a little scratching and clawing,
maybe some kicking or biting, as they fight to gain possession of
that million-dollar prize?'' _ From a column I wrote last month,
speculating on what would happen when Mark McGwire and/or Sammy
Sosa hit their 62nd home run.
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Biting! There really was biting outside Wrigley Field
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Thank heavens, because I thought I'd lost my touch on the
popular pulse. Human beings were behaving with class and dignity,
and it was confusing me. I watched in amazement as fan after fan
returned coveted home run balls to Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa,
brushing away the memorabilia dealers and the home shopping
channels, asking the superstars for only a few autographed trinkets
in return.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the youngsters who scrambled across the tarp in the
outfield bleachers at Pro Player Park in Miami to retrieve a couple
of McGwire's home run balls? One was 17, the other just 11. Each
said it wouldn't be right to keep the ball and handed it over to
McGwire in exchange for balls, bats, jerseys and the chance to
shake hands with the big lug.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the woman who made that one-handed catch of a
Sosa home run at Wrigley Field. She too said the ball belonged to
the slugger _ though to Sammy's credit, he signed the ball and
handed it right back to her.
</P>
<P>
   Similar stories of bleacherite benevolence were told after
several other homers. Apparently a lot of fans were buying
McGwire's theory that anyone who tried to sell a special home run
ball was holding it ``hostage.'' These purists were killing me!
Where was the greed, where was the selfishness, where were the
stories about fans fighting? Heck, where were the lawyers? All
these nice people were ruining my perception of the American way of
life _ but that was before Bloody Sunday on Waveland Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone seemed under-prepared for the possibility of Sammy Sosa
reaching the 62 mark over the weekend. They didn't use balls marked
with infra-red labels for Sosa's at-bats (as they did when McGwire
was closing in on Maris); the commissioner wasn't in attendance;
there was no special ceremony planned to honor No. 62 _ and while
there were plenty of cops stationed outside Wrigley, they were
greatly outnumbered by the ball-hawkers.
</P>
<P>
   When Sammy hit No. 60 on Saturday, the fan who grabbed the ball
was doused with beer by rooftop revelers. That should have been
taken as a sign.
</P>
<P>
   It got weirder, rougher and greedier on Sunday. The unemployed
fan who caught No. 61 said there was no way he was giving the ball
to Sammy; instead, a $10,000 price tag sounded about right.
</P>
<P>
   When home run No. 62 sailed out of the park, hundreds of fans
dashed for it. Longtime ballhawker Gary ``Moe'' Mullins, 47, said
he had possession of the ball, but lost it in a massive pileup to
one Brendan Cunningham, 33. Cunningham emerged from the pack,
reportedly shoved the ball down his pants and ran down Sheffield
Avenue until he found police protection from the mob.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like a VIP or a criminal!'' Cunningham told NBC-5's Amy
Jacobson, as he described his ride in a police car.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was tripped and mugged and knocked to the ground,'' Mullins
told Jacobson in a separately taped interview. ``I held on as long
as I could but they piled up so high, they finally got it from me.
I was being bit, scratched, everything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't bite anybody!'' Cunningham retorted.
</P>
<P>
   Mullins filed a police report. (Never having dealt with a claim
of a stolen home run ball, the cops classified it as an alleged
strong arm robbery.) As of this writing, ownership of the ball is
still in dispute, and there's talk that _ surprise, surprise _ the
whole mess might wind up in court.
</P>
<P>
   All right, NOW we're talking, sports fans. Now we've got the
material of which columns are made. Just a few points to ponder:
</P>
<P>
   A. You can buy official National League baseballs for about $9
at area sporting goods stores. Without the infra-red markings,
who's to say any of these guys really have the balls Sammy hit? In
fact, I'VE got the 62nd homer! Yeah, that's my story, it bounced
over to me!
</P>
<P>
   B. Which baseball is really going to be worth $1 million _
McGwire's 62nd, or the last record-setting homer of the season? If
Sosa finishes with 67 and McGwire closes with 65, isn't Sammy's
67th the real treasure?
</P>
<P>
   C. Do you think Chicago police will consider closing off
Waveland Avenue for next Sunday's game, the regular season home
finale for the Cubs?
</P>
<P>
   D. In an effort to gain a strength advantage, will some
ballhawkers start ingesting androstenedione?
</P>
<P>
   E. When the oversized McGwire took that victory lap in that
little red '62 Corvette, did he look like a GI Joe doll in a Hot
Wheels car or what?

MCGWIRE RETURNED TO US SOMETHING THAT WAS MISSING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PHIL RECORD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thank you, Mark McGwire, for giving back _ if even for a little
while _ what many lovers of baseball feel has been taken away from
us.
</P>
<P>
   You gave us, in your successful effort to become the new
home-run king, the enthusiasm for the sport that was once properly
described as the national pastime.
</P>
<P>
   I, and many others, have lost much of our loyalty for baseball _
and many other professional sports _ because we no longer feel that
the owners and players have loyalty for us.
</P>
<P>
   That is sad.
</P>
<P>
   For the owners and the players, the name of the game is money,
and that spells G-R-E-E-D. That hasn't left much room for the fans.
</P>
<P>
   But for one brief moment, you, Mark McGwire, gave back to many
us that joy of watching the game as you battled the pressure to
smash home run No. 62.
</P>
<P>
   Here was what has been described as a very decent guy who seemed
more interested in sharing with others the thrill of the conquest
than in how much he was going to deposit in his bank account.
</P>
<P>
   We began to identify with this man of class and power.
</P>
<P>
   We pulled for him. We let him tug at our hearts.
</P>
<P>
   We wanted him to reach a plateau no other man had reached in the
major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   We didn't bear him resentment.
</P>
<P>
   We forgot, for one brief moment, how professional sports has
forgotten many of us.
</P>
<P>
   We rejoiced when that baseball barely cleared the left-field
fence in Busch Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   I'm thrilled I was watching live TV when McGwire reached the
mountaintop. I thank him for the mental snapshots that will remain
with us for many years:
</P>
<P>
   _An elated McGwire being congratulated warmly by the opposing
Chicago Cub infielders as he circled the bases.
</P>
<P>
   _A display of a father's love as Big Mac lifted on high his
10-year-old son, Matt, after circling the bases. And the joy
reflected in the faces of McGwire's parents, who were in the
stands.
</P>
<P>
   _The unselfish sportsmanship of Sammy Sosa, Big Mac's chief
competitor in the race for the home-run kingship. I was deeply
moved by the sight of the two embracing after Sosa left his
position in right field to congratulate from the heart the new
King.
</P>
<P>
   _The fans in St. Louis standing for Sosa the next time he came
to bat and pulling for him to put one out of the park. McGwire has
called them the best fans in baseball. They certainly were on
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   _McGwire not hesitating to give recognition before and after his
achievement to the source of his talent. Prior to Tuesday night, he
said the record-breaking homer would come in the Lord's time, which
proved to be perfect (in McGwire's words, ``It was a great script
written by the Man Upstairs''). After breaking the record, he did
not forget to give credit to the Lord.
</P>
<P>
   _McGwire hurdling a railing to embrace the family of Roger
Maris, the man whose record he broke Tuesday night. He enabled them
to share in some of the joy and enthusiasm that was denied to their
father when he broke Babe Ruth's home-run record.
</P>
<P>
   _Tim Forneris, who described himself as ``just a regular Joe,''
not hesitating to return the record-breaking ball to McGwire. It
was Forneris, a member of the Busch groundskeeping crew, who chased
down the ball after it cleared the fence.
</P>
<P>
   Thank God the ball did not fall into the hands of those
memorabilia groups that would perpetuate the greed of the game by
offering $1 million for it.
</P>
<P>
   So thank you, Big Mac, for giving back what many of us thought
was gone forever: a great zest for the game and a true joy in
watching one accomplish the seemingly impossible.
</P>
<P>
   For a brief period you put on the back burner the Bill
Clinton-Monica Lewinsky scandal. For a brief period you showed that
the talents of a good guy could triumph over the greed that has
soiled a wonderful game.
</P>
<P>
   May your days be long and blessed by the Lord you did not forget
in your hour of triumph.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I fear, it is back to business as usual. We will again be
overwhelmed by what one syndicated columnist aptly called the
Monica Mess; owners and players in professional sports will resume
haggling over outrageous salaries, and owners of the some teams
will be ready to desert the fans in one city for those in another
if they feel there are more bucks to be made.
</P>
<P>
   Sports can get an unreasonable hold on us. I certainly used to
be in that grasp on those Saturday afternoons when Notre Dame was
in a tough game.
</P>
<P>
   It's OK to be amused by sports, to use them as a diversion from
the trials and pressures of life. The trouble is, too many of us
abuse sports.
</P>
<P>
   Too many of us spend our time chasing a small white ball on
Sunday mornings when we should be in church worshiping Jesus. Too
often we feel it necessary to skip some ``pew time'' in order to
get an early start to the stadium to watch a bunch of grown men
smash their bodies together.
</P>
<P>
   St. Paul undoubtedly was a sports fan. He used references to
sports in some of his epistles. But I doubt if he was ever a fool
for sports.
</P>
<P>
   As I watched the enthusiasm of the crowd in Busch Stadium on
Tuesday night, I wondered how many put that much enthusiasm into
making their marriages work, into their work, into their church.
</P>
<P>
   Too few, I fear.
</P>
<P>
   It seems it is OK to get tremendously excited in a sports
stadium, but many label us as fools if we show real excitement
about God.
</P>
<P>
   Don't let that stop you. Paul assures us in the fourth chapter
of 1 Corinthians that those who appear to the world to be fools on
Christ's account will also appear to be wise in the eyes of God.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that the next time you go to the stadium.

<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. _ Elena Avila, a psychiatric nurse, donned a
headband to join a ceremonial procession with Mayan healers in
colorful embroidered dresses and Aztec dancers wearing brightly
feathered headdresses.
</P>
<P>
   The procession opened the 12th International Congress of
Traditional and Indigenous Medicine here last month, where
conventional medicine intersected, sometimes unevenly, with
alternative forms of treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I practice medicine and spiritual healing simultaneously,''
said Ms. Avila, who treats patients privately and works with
doctors. She earned a master's degree in psychiatric nursing at the
University of Texas at El Paso, and has called herself a
``curandera,'' Spanish for healer, for the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   In the Southwest, this combination does not always raise
eyebrows. Hispanic people and American Indians, who respectively
make up 38 percent and 9 percent of the population of New Mexico,
often rely on a heritage of herbs, spiritual healing and other folk
practices.
</P>
<P>
   In cities like Albuquerque, some pharmacies devote shelves to
Hispanic medicinal herbs, and doctors are accustomed to patients'
using traditional therapies, like Native American healing
ceremonies. In some remote communities, traditional medicine may be
the only kind available.
</P>
<P>
   But the use of traditional medicine is not always a function of
lack of access to regular health care, said Kim Kinsey, the program
manager of primary care planning in rural health programs for New
Mexico. For many, it is an alternative. ``People may choose Western
medicine,'' Ms. Kinsey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may also choose to see the curandera or medicine people
at the same time,'' she said, referring to traditional Hispanic and
Native American healers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kinsey said that the Indian Health Service, for instance,
sets aside rooms in its hospitals for medicine people to see
patients along with a Western doctor.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report in Archives of Family Medicine in March,
38 percent of patients surveyed at an Indian Health Service clinic
in Milwaukee said they had seen a healer and 86 percent said they
would consider seeing one. The weeklong meeting, at the University
of New Mexico, coincided with evidence of increasing public
interest in complementary medicine, therapies that lie outside the
realm of conventional, mainstream medicine.
</P>
<P>
   A report published this month in The Journal of the American
Medical Association showed that one in three American adults uses
complementary therapies, like chiropractic, acupuncture,
homeopathy, herbs and folk remedies. The report also said that more
than half the nation's medical schools offer courses in alternative
medical practices, and patients are looking for doctors familiar
with complementary as well as mainstream medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``My patients come in with their own remedies, from a community
healer or organized or nonorganized traditional healing,'' said Dr.
Christopher Urbina, vice chairman of the Department of Family
Practice and Community Medicine at the University of New Mexico's
School of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Among the remedies brought to him by patients, Urbina described
a mixture of alcohol and avocado seeds that patients rub in their
joints and poultices, usually of aloe vera and other herbs, for
skin conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional medicine was part of Urbina's own childhood. ``I
grew up in a Mexican-American family,'' he said. ``My mother gave
me multiple remedies when I was growing up. We always did things
before we went to the physician.'' He recalled remedies from the
ordinary (drinking chamomile tea to settle the stomach) to the
strange (placing sliced potatoes on the head to alleviate fever).
</P>
<P>
   At the medical school, traditional and other alternative
therapies are integrated into the curriculum in the context of
patient care, in classes and in grand rounds, Urbina said. Students
can attend seminars with alternative healers to develop sensitivity
to cultural beliefs of various populations, and patients who ask
for healers or traditional therapies are supported, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But patients who avoid conventional medicine can find themselves
in trouble. Dr. Jeffrey Sollins, an Albuquerque internist who
supplements conventional medicine with complementary therapies,
said that patients who used unproved alternative treatments
exclusively were taking a serious risk.
</P>
<P>
   Sollins cited the example of parents who reject conventional
medicine and refuse to have their children vaccinated. They are
putting their children at risk for serious, avoidable diseases,
said Sollins, who is director of an organization called Bridges in
Medicine Health Care Inc.
</P>
<P>
   But he added that ``the indigenous practitioners I've met often
recognize when they're past their limit.''
</P>
<P>
   As increasing numbers of scientists explore the effectiveness of
alternative therapies, doctors may begin to feel more comfortable
discussing them with their patients and finding ways of
incorporating them into their practices.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Helmut Wiedenfeld, a chemist at the Pharmacy Institute at
the University of Bonn, described his research with traditional
healers and diabetes in rural Mexico. The World Health Organization
estimates that 8 percent of Mexico's population will have Type 2
diabetes by the year 2005 and this sometimes deadly disease is
rampant among Mexican Indians.
</P>
<P>
   (In the United States, the rate of Type 2 diabetes among Indians
is nearly triple that of non-Hispanic whites.) A high fat and
carbohydrate diet plays a part, and although most rural areas of
Mexico are far from fast food outlets, virtually every village has
a stand that sells sugary soft drinks, Wiedenfeld said.
</P>
<P>
   His field work in three Indian villages in Mexico left
Wiedenfeld with considerable respect for traditional healers. Even
without the training or equipment to detect levels of blood
glucose, the healers could identify the classic symptoms of
diabetes, and they treated the disease with an herbal tea brewed
from ``cola de caballo'' (equisetum myriochaetum), he said.
</P>
<P>
   In field trials, Wiedenfeld and his colleagues found that the
herbal tea helped stabilize blood sugar levels in female patients
who took part in a study.
</P>
<P>
   Wiedenfeld believes that both the successes and failures of
alternative medicine can be quantified.
</P>
<P>
   And Urbina added, ``How we live our lives is a balance between
the scientific evidence, our understanding of the evidence and our
own cultural beliefs,'' he said.

KACZYNSKI REPORT PAINTS PORTRAIT OF DEEP EMOTIONAL DISTRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SETH ROSENFELD  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As a small boy, Theodore John Kaczynski feared
people and buildings.
</P>
<P>
   In school, where he skipped from the fifth to seventh grades, he
felt he didn't fit in, had no friends and was the object of
classmates' teasing.
</P>
<P>
   As a Harvard University undergraduate, he was diagnosed as a
paranoid schizophrenic but was never treated.
</P>
<P>
   In graduate school he became more isolated, frustrated with his
inability to form relationships with women, and considered getting
a sex-change operation. When his attempt to seek counseling ended
in humiliation, he thought of killing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just then, there came a major turning point in my life,'' he
later told a prison psychiatrist. ``What was entirely new was the
fact that I really felt that I could kill someone.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaczynski's enveloping madness is detailed in a 47-page
psychiatric study that was a key factor in his January plea to
being the Unabomber, responsible for an 18-year string of bombings,
beginning in 1978, that killed three and wounded 23 others.
</P>
<P>
   The report was filed under seal in Sacramento federal court
where Kaczynski was charged, but was made public Friday in response
to a legal motion by the San Francisco Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   The study was prepared by Dr. Sally Johnson, a federal prison
psychiatrist who interviewed Kaczynski for more than 19 hours,
interviewed his family, and reviewed his copious writings on the
bombings.
</P>
<P>
   The deepest psychological study of the 55-year-old Kaczynski to
date, it reaches a provisional but convincing conclusion that his
methodical bombings stemmed from severe mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``You read this and you get the impression that certainly Ted
Kaczynski is in bad shape psychologically,'' said Michael Rustigan,
a criminologist at San Francisco State University who studies
serial killers.
</P>
<P>
   David Kaczynski, who turned his brother in to the FBI after
recognizing the Unabomber's published manifesto as similar to
Theodore's other writings, said in an interview Friday that the
study gave an accurate but sometimes surprising picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess what I became aware of after his arrest was how little
the family did know about how much trouble Ted was having, how much
pain he was in,'' said Kaczynski, an Albany, N.Y., social worker
who counsels disturbed children. ``It only makes sense that his
illness should have some mitigating effect on his sentence, which
it apparently did.''
</P>
<P>
   But Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephen Freccero, one of the
prosecutors, said the study was one of several reasons why the
government accepted the plea agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Kaczynski previously had offered to plead guilty only if he
could appeal pretrial rulings, with a possibility of reversing his
conviction. After the report was issued he offered to plead
unconditionally, Freccero said, which meant he'd spend the
remainder of his life in prison. Going to trial risked a jury
decision to spare him because of his mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our view is that he was always first and foremost a killer,''
Freccero said.
</P>
<P>
   The report traces Kaczynski's lonely progression from the
shyness of childhood to the peaks of paranoia and the machinations
of a serial killer.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1942, he grew up near Chicago, the oldest son of a
housewife and a sausage maker who shot himself to death in 1990
after being diagnosed with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   He was a bright child but feared people and buildings, and
tended to play beside other children rather than with them, his
mother said.
</P>
<P>
   Kaczynski told Johnson that as a child he suffered ``extreme
verbal and emotional abuse,'' though the report did not confirm
that.
</P>
<P>
   He described skipping sixth grade as a pivotal event in his
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He remembers not fitting in with the older children and being
the subject of considerable verbal abuse and teasing from them,''
the report said.
</P>
<P>
   David Kaczynski, who is seven years younger than his brother,
said: ``Nothing in my family strikes me as abusive. If anything, we
made great efforts to be supportive, to build up his self-esteem.''
</P>
<P>
   Theodore Kaczynski remained hurt by ``the kinds of things that
any other child would let roll off his back,'' he said. ``It's as
if he had no emotional immunity, no ability to heal.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson noted that ``it was evident that Mr. Kaczynski is
extremely sensitive to even minor criticism and tends to perceive
this, or even an absence of encouragement or positive response from
an individual, as a deliberate attempt at humiliation or
harassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The central themes involve his belief that he is being
maligned and harassed by family members and modern society.
Consistent with other individuals with persecutory types of
delusions, he is resentful and angry, and fantasizes and actually
does resort to violence against those individuals and organizations
that he believes are hurting him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He demonstrates a lack of remorse as indicated in his
writings,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Reams of Kaczynski's written views were seized at his Montana
cabin when he was arrested in April 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``He frequently expressed both hatred and a wish for revenge and
love and affection for the same individual,'' Johnson added.

SOUTH AFRICA LEARNS THAT TOURISM IS FRAGILE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 20) 
</HEADLINE>

   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ The bomb that went off in the
Planet Hollywood restaurant in Cape Town on Aug. 25, killing two
people, has hurt tourism in South Africa's prettiest city, but no
one agrees how much. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One restaurateur says that business fell off for only the first
couple of days; another says reservations dropped sharply. One
tourism official says she can prove that the city lost at least
$800,000 in business, another estimates the nation lost $55
million. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This much is not debated: South Africa is new at international
tourism, and still floundering in figuring out how to respond to a
crisis. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Cape Town dozens were hurt in the blast, in addition to the
two who were killed. Who left the bomb in the crowded bar, and why,
is still unknown. An anonymous caller to a radio reporter said it
was left by a group called Muslims Against Global Oppression.
</P>
<P>
   That got wide currency because the blast followed American
cruise missile attacks on the Sudan and Afghanistan, which were
themselves in retaliation for truck bombs that exploded outside
United States embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. A day later, the
group condemned the bombing and called it a ploy to discredit
them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since then there have been no arrests. Videotapes from cameras
inside the bar proved to be weeks old. The one lead the police
admit having is that the bomb had a timer like those on bombs left
at two Cape Town police stations. Those bombs are believed to be
the work of People Against Gangsterism and Drugs, a militant
anti-crime group founded by Muslim clerics. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Planet Hollywood is part of the Victoria and Alfred Waterfront,
a collection of shops and restaurants that resembles Fisherman's
Wharf in San Francisco and the South Street Seaport in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism officials estimate that 40 percent of all foreign
visitors and 56 percent of American tourists visit it. Although the
Waterfront usually feels like a safe place, its reputation has
suffered because of the blast and because of a fatal shootout
between two drug gangs outside the entrance several months ago. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since the blast, the Waterfront has hired a new firm to oversee
its security guards, started mounted armed patrols and added 30
cameras to the 116 already in place. Some theaters and clubs search
customers' bags. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gauging the blast's effect on tourism is tricky. ``There was
definitely an impact that first week,'' said Maureen Thompson, a
spokeswoman for the Waterfront. ``As time plods by, things look as
if they're getting back to normal again.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rens Ratcliffe, manager of St. Elmo's Pizza, and Andre Swart,
the manager of Mitchell's Waterfront Brewery, a popular tavern,
said that their walk-in crowds were back to normal. The
reservations clerk at the Quay 4 restaurant said she had some
cancellations from tour groups: ``A Dr. Pepper group from the U.S.
that booked over a year ago canceled, and it said on the fax that
it was because of the bombing.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Americans are seen as especially desirable tourists. More
Britons and Germans visit, but Americans stay longer _ 20 days on
average, versus 10 for Europeans _ and spend more _ $140 a day, not
counting air fare, versus $94 for Britons and $73 for Germans. (The
bombing got more publicity in Britain than in the United States. No
Americans were hurt, but three generations of one British family
were injured.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Americans are also seen as extremely cautious. ``They tend to be
more nervous than Europeans,'' said Gillian Saunders, a tourism
consultant. ``We had cancellations here because of a bomb in
Nairobi. We don't get that with Europeans.'' Nairobi is 2,400 miles
from Cape Town, about the distance from New York to Los Angeles. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Saunders' consultancy, Grant Thornton, came up with the $55
million loss estimate. She admits it was a bit of a guess _ ``a
discussion amongst ourselves'' _ based on the assumption that a
third of the 60,000 Americans who come for pleasure would cancel
this year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sheryl Ozinsky, manager of Cape Town Tourism, a joint
city-industry group, found $55 million ``a bit over the top.'' Her
$800,000 figure, however, is based strictly on actual cancellations
received by the 60 of her 1,400 members who bothered to answer her
snap survey. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Both women and Ms. Thompson said that South Africa is ill
prepared to mount a big campaign to win tourists back. Local
government has promised $160,000 and hoteliers have agreed to
donate rooms and meals if foreign travel writers can be rounded up
to write what they hope are glowing articles.
</P>
<P>
   But that amount seems a pittance considering that South Africa
earns over $3 billion a year from foreign tourism, an industry that
employs more than 600,000 South Africans. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Australia's spend on this is 10 times ours,'' said Ms.
Ozinsky. ``It's unbelievable.'' &QL;

SURFING THE NET

<P>
   The trouble with traveling on the World Wide Web is that after a
while you may crave a home there, a place where you pick up your
mail, chat with friends, trade gossip and information or just hang
out.
</P>
<P>
   On the Web, you can wander from site to site, searching for
rooms and restaurants, booking air fares, seeking sights to see and
places to play. But it is like staying in a different hotel every
night of a vacation; eventually you forget where you are, and you
never talk to anyone. Consequently, a dozen or so Web sites have
gotten more homey lately. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Until the early 1990s, the brave souls who sought information
and socialization on line joined such services as America On Line,
Compuserve, Prodigy, GEnie, Bix, eWorld and hundreds of others.
Only the bravest of the brave tried the Internet, a vast collection
of cybertext scattered around the world, accessed by arcane
commands and intended for the technologically sophisticated.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these services still exist, but since the beginning of
the World Wide Web, a friendlier subsidiary of the Internet, many
people have gone straight to the Web, usually via a search engine,
a kind of index. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HOME ON THE WEB &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Setting Up a Site &QL;
</P>
<P>
   www.yahoo.com &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo has long been my search engine of first choice, partly
because of its rich selection of sites _ there are 47 subcategories
in the travel section alone _ and partly, no doubt, from force of
habit. Now news headlines have been added, with links to a variety
of journalistic establishments, as well as stock quotes, free
e-mail, and a personal calendar to remind you of anniversaries,
birthdays and other important dates.
</P>
<P>
   You can set up your Yahoo page to suit yourself, with the kinds
of news, weather, scores and stock prices that you are interested
in. I set mine up to watch for Travel (with the key words New
England, inn and budget) and Air Fares (with the key words air
fares, airline fares, United States and North America).
</P>
<P>
   With those personalized changes, which took place immediately,
Yahoo would watch for news in those categories. There are ``rooms''
where you ``chat'' about travel, television, investments, sports,
science fiction, cyberdating and whatever _ all on bright, colorful
screens that are not so bright and colorful that they take forever
to download. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CUSTOMIZING &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Browsing the World &QL;
</P>
<P>
   www.excite.com &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Excite tempts me. The opening page, spiffier than Yahoo's but
not excessively so, offers e-mail and chat rooms, top news events,
technology, business, sports news and scores, stock quotes, weather
(you enter your ZIP code or the ZIP code of a place you are
planning to visit) and even a horoscope. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As with Yahoo, the content can be customized. Excite offers a
profusion of travel sites, in broader categories than Yahoo's:
reservations, destinations, busi-ness travel, cruises and tours,
family travel, frequent flier and adventure. There are car rental
sites, restaurant guides and a map on which you click to browse the
world. Nice. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIRTUAL HOUSE HUNTING &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I have dipped into many other portals, as Web homes are coming
to be called, and Yahoo and Excite struck me as the leading ones.
But a virtual home, like a real home, is a highly personal choice.
America On Line, www.aol.com; Compuserve, www.compuserve.com; and
the Microsoft Network, home.microsoft.com, have Web pages distinct
from, and not nearly as comprehensive as, their proprietary
extra-cost services, which are promoted on their Web sites; both
AOL and the Microsoft Network have travel categories you can click
on.
</P>
<P>
   Compuserve does not, and its site seems largely a promotion for
their main service. If you are virtual house hunting, you might
also check Altavista, www.altavista.digital.com; Geocities,
www.geocities.com; Infoseek, www.infoseek.com; Lycos,
www.lycos.com; Netcenter, home.netscape.com; Planet Direct,
www.planetdirect.com; and Snap, www. snap.com.
</P>
<P>
   (Thanks to the Sept. 1 issue of PC Magazine for the list.) It's
house-hunting time.

THE CLINTONS AT BAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c. 1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The customary picture of President Clinton and his
wife Hillary leaving church holding hands was missing this Sunday;
they did not leave the White House to worship, despite the
president's recent appeals for forgiveness and redemption.
</P>
<P>
   They have not, in fact, been seen holding hands in public since
a few days before Clinton's Aug. 17 grand jury testimony, when he
reportedly confessed to her at last about his sexual encounters
with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But Hillary Clinton recently stood at her husband's side at
several public events, introduced him at a fund-raiser by saying
she is ``proud'' of his progressive policies and even patted him on
the back on one occasion. She has not deserted him politically,
although she gives every sign of having done so emotionally.
</P>
<P>
   Their joint appearances now lack the cozy intimacy, the loving
glances and affectionate touching that used to characterize their
public performances. When they are seen together, there is not much
physical distance between them but the psychic distance is
enormous.
</P>
<P>
   Suggestions from the president's advisers last week that she
would make a speech reaffirming her love and forgiveness were
quickly countered by reports from her friends that she will do no
such thing. At least not for a while. Not until the political
process of punishing her husband is further along.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, she may not be able to rescue him this time, as she
did six years ago when she defended him on television against
Gennifer Flower's allegations of an affair.
</P>
<P>
   A USA Today poll conducted Sunday indicated that while 14
percent of those surveyed said her forgiveness would influence
their view of the president ``a great deal,'' 52 percent said it
would affect their opinion ``not at all.'' A Newsweek poll reported
that only 30 percent of those surveyed would be more likely to
support the president if she made a show of forgiving him.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady's credibility has sometimes been questioned and
she is in no mood to test it over her cheating husband's adultery.
</P>
<P>
   She has been accused of lying about such unresolved
controversies as missing law firm records and cattle futures
investments. Her toughest critics even contend she knew all about
his lewd conduct when she blamed the initial stories about Monica
Lewinsky in January on a ``vast right wing conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   The first question everyone asks these days is what political
price Bill Clinton should pay. But the second is: How can she stay
with a selfish, unfaithful cad who has publicly humiliated her?
</P>
<P>
   There have always been two theories, equally unproven, about the
Clinton marriage. One is that she has known all along about his
marital infidelities but ignores them because they share a
passionless business partnership that advances her own political
ambitions as well as his.
</P>
<P>
   The other theory is that they really do love each other and she
naively fooled herself about his womanizing because she was in
romantic denial.
</P>
<P>
   If Lewinsky can be believed, the president himself indicated
that he and his wife were not enjoying perfect wedded bliss even
before the scandal erupted. She says he bragged about ``hundreds''
of affairs throughout his marriage, although he claimed to be
trying harder to be faithful since he turned 40.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky told a friend that Clinton had mused he did not know
whether he would remain married after he left the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky testified that during what she characterized as a
``very emotional'' meeting she told him she hoped he might have
more time for her when he was out of office.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Lewinsky stated, ``And he said, well, l don't know, I
might be alone in three years.''
</P>
<P>
   Did the president really mean to suggest he was thinking of a
divorce? Or that Hillary was? Or was he merely trying to placate a
demanding sexpot who was feeling neglected and had become not just
an inconvenient nuisance but a looming threat to his presidency?
</P>
<P>
   The nation's capital has been awash in gossip for years that the
Clintons were unlikely to remain together once their public life is
over. The feeling, among many women at least, was that she will be
better off with an independent career and a life without him. But
the gossip has always been just that, unconfirmed and
unconfirmable.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton herself remains inscrutable, doing her best to
behave with dignity in a very undignified situation. She is loyally
maintaining a full schedule of public appearances, some in tandem
with the president's own activities.
</P>
<P>
   As the wronged wife bearing up silently under great pain, she
has won the public's sympathy. A Newsweek poll in Monday's issue
shows that 59 percent of those surveyed have a favorable opinion of
her, up from 52 percent pre-Starr report.
</P>
<P>
   Despite everything, Clinton himself retains more support among
women than among men, as he did in both his 1992 and 1996
presidential campaigns. The USA Today poll indicates that roughly
33 percent of men surveyed think Clinton should be impeached and
removed from office, but only 26 percent of the women do.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear how much Hillary's steadfastness and popularity
has to do with that. But it can't hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone would go along with the solution proposed by Donald
Trump, the flamboyant real estate developer. The president's only
option, Trump told the New York Times, is to ``leave his wife
(before she leaves him), resign from office and go out and have a
good time.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   More than 20 years ago, a doctor who was curious about the
effects of long-term oral contraceptive use sent questionnaires to
370,000 registered nurses. The answers he and colleagues received
have turned into the largest and longest repeated follow-up study
of a group of women, a fountain of information about health, in
particular women's health.
</P>
<P>
   The project, known as the Harvard Nurses' Health Study, has
yielded more than 200 published findings, including these:
</P>
<P>
   _Hormone replacement therapy can increase the risk of breast
cancer and can decrease the risk of heart disease and osteoporosis.
</P>
<P>
   _Margarine can increase the risk of heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   _Vitamin E can protect against heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   _One or two drinks a day can increase the risk of breast cancer
while protecting against heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   These findings, and many more, have altered how people eat and
drink and live their lives. Some scientists call the study the
single greatest contributor to understanding women's health.
</P>
<P>
   But this huge scientific effort has only begun to pay its
dividends. With many of the original participants now entering
their 60s and 70s, the study promises to bequeath an even greater
wealth of knowledge, much of it otherwise unattainable, about how a
lifetime of choices in food, drink, exercise and medications can
translate into protection from or increased risk of deadly and
debilitating diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a brilliant idea, a unique idea,'' said Dr. Leslie
Bernstein, an epidemiologist at the University of Southern
California. ``It's one of the largest studies ever to have been
assembled. They were leaders, ahead of their time. Now everybody is
trying to emulate what they've done.''
</P>
<P>
   The study began in 1976 when Dr. Frank Speizer, the Edward H.
Kass professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and
co-director of the Channing Laboratory at Brigham and Women's
Hospital, sent the first health questionnaires and received more
than 120,000 responses.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we began to gather data it became very clear that we could
expand the study,'' Speizer recalled. ``The excellent cooperation
of the nurses is the most important part.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 90 percent of the original respondents still answer a
questionnaire every other year, telling what they eat, what
medicines they take, what illnesses they have had and whether they
drink, smoke, exercise or take vitamins _ among other things.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that those answering the questions are nurses means
their answers are reliable, the researchers say. Plus, the
researchers can gather blood and other samples, simply by sending a
request and a few collection supplies, something that could never
be done with the public.
</P>
<P>
   By knowing these women's experiences, researchers can look at
the histories of those who have contracted diseases and compare
them with those who have not and begin teasing out the important
factors in determining a woman's risk for a particular illness.
</P>
<P>
   Since the study began, Speizer has been joined by many
scientists from around the world seeking to capitalize on this
unique trove of data. Researchers have been able to identify risk
factors for more common diseases, like breast, colon and lung
cancer, diabetes and heart disease. In the future, researchers say
they will be able to identify risk factors for rarer conditions,
like lymphoma, kidney cancer and bladder cancer, as well as
afflictions more common later in life, like stroke and senility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is afraid of losing their memory,'' said Dr. Francine
Grodstein, an epidemiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital who is
leading the new effort to determine whether using aspirin, taking
hormones or other life style choices prevents declines in cognitive
function.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Grodstein is expanding the study with a
telephone test that researchers will repeatedly administer to
participants over time. Researchers have spoken with about 2,000 of
the women, asking questions like ``Who is the president?'' and
reading a list of 10 words, which the participant is asked to
repeat, all typical tests of mental function.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are also beginning to study the blood samples of
30,000 women, looking for pesticide residue, antioxidants and
naturally produced hormones. Over time they will be able to discern
what connection, if any, these or other substances have to the
incidence of cancer. They can also use the blood samples to look
for genetic factors.
</P>
<P>
   One person could not predict her fate by examining the findings
of the study _ the numbers produced are simply average outcomes
over a range of women with different genetic backgrounds. By
looking at the variation in the genes of women who contract or do
not contract diseases with the wealth of data on their exposure to
a variety of substances, researchers hope to begin to solve this
most complex of problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we can help women understand what life style
changes are most important to them with their genetic makeup to
prevent disease,'' said Dr. Sue Hankinson, an epidemiologist at the
Harvard School of Public Health who is leading the blood work.
``Ultimately we could provide a much more individual kind of
recommendation.''
</P>
<P>
   As the women in the study age, researchers will also be able to
continue to identify protective or beneficial diets, activities and
habits associated with a healthier, longer life.
</P>
<P>
   By 1989, the study had already proved to be such a good source
of information that the team of researchers began a study of
younger nurses, enrolled at an earlier age, called Nurses II.
Researchers have even enlisted the children of the women in Nurses
II in another study to look at the risk factors for adolescent
obesity, which Dr. Graham Colditz, an epidemiologist at Harvard
Medical School heading the study, described as reaching epidemic
proportions.
</P>
<P>
   After so many years of working together, the study has produced
a bond of deep mutual respect between researchers and the nurses,
whom they call their collaborators.
</P>
<P>
   ``This group of women has been so tremendously dedicated,'' said
Dr. JoAnn Manson, an endocrinologist at Harvard Medical School,
echoing her many colleagues' sentiments. ``They have been the
trailblazers in terms of helping us to get the answers.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The nurses themselves say they actually look forward to hearing
from the researchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been wonderful,'' said Irene Kilroy, 62, a nurse at Good
Samaritan Hospice in Brighton, Mass., who said she always answers
the questionnaire the day it arrives. Mrs. Kilroy, who was among
the 800 nurses who gathered last year to celebrate the 20th
anniversary of the study and its results, added, ``We feel we've
made a wonderful contribution.''
</P>
<P>
   The questionnaire varies with research interests, but has
consistently grown, now running about six pages and taking the
women from 20 minutes to more than an hour to complete. Using a
form, like an SAT answer sheet, that will be optically scanned, the
women record information like how often they eat specific foods
with choices ranging from never to six times per day or more. They
also write in more detailed information like which brand of vitamin
or cereal or cooking oil they use.
</P>
<P>
   All this self-examination has its effects, said Barbara Dwyer,
65, a nurse from Medford, Mass., who described herself as proud to
be part of the study.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does make you think more about your weight and smoking and
exercise,'' she said. ``I did stop taking the hormone therapy, and
I really watched my weight more.''
</P>
<P>
   So it is with mixed feelings, at best, that the researchers wait
for enough of these women to succumb to disease and die, the
necessary first step before the database will be, in the
euphemistic language researchers adopt, ``rich enough'' or
``powerful enough'' to offer useful information about illness and
death.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Meir Stampfer, an epidemiologist at the Harvard School of
Public Health who reviews the death records and officially assigns
a cause of death to participants, describes the process as ``a
little creepy.''
</P>
<P>
   The study has become a model for many other projects around the
country. The Iowa Women's Health Study, a project started in 1986
with 42,000 women who were licensed drivers in Iowa, studies body
fat and diet and disease using the Harvard questionnaire. The
Teachers Study in California, begun in 1996, has enlisted 135,000
women in cancer research.
</P>
<P>
   At first, skeptics abounded.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Walter Willett, an epidemiologist and physician at the
Harvard School of Public Health, who has been with the study since
its second year, said that early on there was great skepticism over
the worth of such an endeavor.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started, smoking was thought not to be a risk factor
for heart disease in women,'' Willett said, ``People said there was
no variation in diet and that people couldn't remember what they
ate, so the whole field was hopeless. You only have to scratch the
surface to see that people eat differently for many different
reasons. These are things we take for granted now.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, because the study is based on responses to
questionnaires, it can only identify associations between risk
factors and diseases, unlike a randomized, clinical trial in which
participants are assigned to specific treatments, testing whether a
risk factor causes a disease. As a result, some have questioned the
validity, in particular, of the study's more surprising results.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Nurses' Health Study was basically jeered at and taken to
task for the finding that there was a connection between alcohol
and breast cancer,'' Stampfer said. ``We were mocked for coming up
with a seemingly silly and unsubstantiated result, but now it's
turned out to be pretty well accepted.''
</P>
<P>
   And researchers are quick to point out that many of the things
the Nurses' Health Study looks at cannot be assigned as part of a
tidy, experimental design.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's never going to be a randomized study of alcohol,''
Stampfer said. ``There are ethical issues, compliance issues. It
can never happen, and the same is true with a lot of the dietary
things that we study.'' The same could be said of birth-control
methods and physical activity levels, also studied by the Harvard
group.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a study like the nurses' study can pick up on
long-term or delayed effects of diet and other habits, because it
has run for so much longer than nearly any randomized trial. In
real life, as opposed to a clinical trial, people often change what
they do over the years, altering their diet, taking up hormone use,
dropping it, taking it up again, quitting smoking and much more.
``We keep track of all the changes,'' Willett said. ``If we didn't,
we'd miss the important effects.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the nurses reliably return their questionnaires, but
those who do not can count on help from researchers _ who may send
as many as six additional questionnaires before they try
telephoning. If that does not work, researchers turn to the post
office, computer databases and other sources of information to
track them down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it'd be just a couple of years that I'd be doing
this,'' said Mrs. Dwyer, recalling when she received her first
questionnaire in the mail so long ago. ``I'm not even sure how long
it's been. One year I didn't send it back, but they kept after me
until I did. They keep sending it to you until you feel almost
guilty. And after awhile you think, you've done it all these years
_ why stop now?''

BEAUTIFUL LAKES SHOULD BE OPENED TO THE PUBLIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM STIENSTRA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ You can see this one coming from a mile away.
</P>
<P>
   Future opportunities to go hiking, biking, fishing, canoeing or
horseback riding at the Peninsula's Crystal Springs watershed are
being quietly destroyed in a series of maneuvers by the San
Francisco Planning Department.
</P>
<P>
   Four alternatives are proposed for the Draft Management Plan for
the Crystal Springs Watershed, the extraordinary swath of land
along California Highway 280 on the Peninsula. The preferred
alternative allows for a short connector trail on an existing fire
road for the Bay Ridge Trail, and consideration of a new golf
course, and that's pretty much it.
</P>
<P>
   The other three alternatives attempt to make the preferred
alternative look like a compromise: The ``No Action Alternative,''
where you get zilch (which is what you get now), ``Alternative A,''
where they throw you a golf course near Woodside, but no hiking,
biking, fishing, boating or horseback riding or public access, and
``Alternative C,'' which would allow some public access, perhaps
even hiking or fishing, by gosh, only by permit.
</P>
<P>
   For years, I've called the Peninsula Watershed ``The Forbidden
Paradise,'' because all you have to do is drive down Highway 280,
take in the view of Crystal Springs Reservoir, and ask, ``Why can't
I go there?''
</P>
<P>
   It covers 23,000 acres with four fish-filled lakes, all of which
adjoin another 100,000 acres of wildlands, and all with a network
of dirt roads ideal for hiking and biking.
</P>
<P>
   A formal long-term planning process by the San Francisco
Planning Department is now under way to develop a Watershed
Management Plan. I believe the entire premise is to come up with a
legal document, once and for always, that will keep the public out
forever.
</P>
<P>
   The Peninsula has seven beautiful lakes: Upper and Lower Crystal
Springs, San Andreas, Pilarcitos, Felt, Searsville, and Boronda
(for Palo Alto residents only), and get this: Public access is not
permitted at any of them. That is just plain wrong.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Two new books that hit the mark: ``In the Slick of the Cricket,
A Shark Odyssey,'' by Russell Drumm, which portrays 40 years of
shark chasing by Frank Mundus, whose character was portrayed in the
first ``Jaws'' movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``California Dog Lover's Companion,'' by Maria Goodavage,
featuring an area-by-area guide across the state for lodging where
dogs are permitted, is perfect for people who travel with their
pets.

`THE ROSEANNE SHOW' WANTS YOU, GIRLFRIEND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH MARDER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ She screamed, she whispered, and she grilled a
dead-on fake Linda Tripp (called, for legal purposes, Linder
Tripp). The one thing Roseanne didn't seem to do during the
premiere of ``The Roseanne Show'' was speak in a regular voice.
</P>
<P>
   The syndicated talk show, which airs 10 a.m. weekdays on KNBC
(Channel 4), debuted Monday with Roseanne hoisted over the audience
in a cherry picker, sprinkling rose pedals and flinging Polaroid
pictures she took of herself down to the audience from her perch in
the bucket.
</P>
<P>
   She did a monologue and the Tripp comedy sketch, gabbed with
guests and had a singer like other talk shows. But Roseanne also
dealt with issues of parenting and child-rearing while trying to be
uplifting and inspirational.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roseanne'' tried _ maybe a little too hard _ to be all things
to all people. All people, that is, except men.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is for sure: Attracting male viewers is not a major
concern.
</P>
<P>
   Sure it's a daytime show, and the audience is primarily made up
of women, but this show takes it too far. ``Roseanne'' couldn't be
more squarely aimed at women if you put a target over 51 percent of
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Roseanne's gal pal Whoopi Goldberg was her first guest. The two
sat on animal-print chairs, talking about Goldberg's 8-year-old
movie ``Ghost'' and plugging her new job as the center square on
``Hollywood Squares'' (which is produced by ``Roseanne'' producer
King World). Talk eventually turned to the fact that both women
were once welfare mothers.
</P>
<P>
   Roseanne joked that it would have cost $7,000 for the rights to
show Goldberg in ``Ghost,'' so the clip was skipped and, in a fine
comic turn, a sketch artist was brought on to depict scenes from
the film.
</P>
<P>
   Then they moved on to ``issues.'' The two debated the Ken Starr
report, often shrieking and talking over each other.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg told the tale of when she found out that her
14-year-old daughter was pregnant and that she didn't get mad
because ``sex is a wonderful thing _ how could I be angry at her
for having it?''
</P>
<P>
   Roseanne said if it were her daughter she would have beaten her
(butt).
</P>
<P>
   The anecdote ``coincidentally'' led perfectly into the show's
next segment.
</P>
<P>
   After the commercial break, the statistic that every 26 seconds
another adolescent gets pregnant popped on the screen, and three
invited teen-age mothers (one with a second child on the way) were
brought out.
</P>
<P>
   Roseanne and Goldberg sat at the edge of the stage and talked to
_ no, whispered to _ the three moms, counseling them. The women
were given the $7,000 Roseanne said the show saved on Goldberg's
movie clip, and she asked the three moms to act as each other's
support group and check back in a month.
</P>
<P>
   To punctuate, with an exclamation point, that this is for and
about women, Sandra Bernhard, whose lips make her look like Mick
Jagger and whose moving-only-from-the-waist-up dancing style
resembled Tina Turner, belted out an earthy ``I Am Woman'' as
Roseanne, back in the cherry picker, threw her a batch of flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Women love flowers, you know.
</P>
<P>
   But as for the show, women may have problems loving it because,
ironically, it may be aimed too squarely at them.

AMERICANS AWARE OF THEIR LEADERS' FLAWED NATURES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM WRIGHT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is among ordinary Americans a strong strain of decency and
fairness. It is an essential part of our nation's character. Once
again, as often before in this country's history, the public is
reacting with reasoned restraint to the shock, shame and sorrow of
events in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Bombarded incessantly by a withering fusillade of news media
overkill during the whole four weeks since President Clinton's
confession of Aug. 17, mainstream Americans have rejected hysteria.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't that they don't have opinions. To persistent pollsters,
they've said repeatedly that they (1) think Bill Clinton has been a
good president, (2) disapprove of his conduct with Monica Lewinsky
and (3) are seriously disappointed in him.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a majority insist they (4) do not want the president
impeached, (5) believe that the investigation has gone on too long
and (6) want to get the public focus back on America's unfinished
business that affects their lives.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing actually inconsistent between these conclusions
and the people's historic reaction to their public figures.
</P>
<P>
   Folks traditionally have tolerated moral frailties and forgiven
behavioral transgressions in elected officialdom, so long as
they're convinced that the public servant is actively fighting for
them.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans probably would rather have a well-meaning rogue
who loves and serves them than a moral purist who's indifferent to
their problems or sanctimonious and ineffectual.
</P>
<P>
   Of the nine presidents elected in the past 50 years (Dwight D.
Eisenhower through Clinton), there were only three (Richard Nixon,
Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter) about whose marital fidelity I never
heard ugly Washington rumors. This doesn't mean that rumors
involving others were true. But Ford and Carter were rejected for
re-election, and Nixon left for other reasons. The public just
isn't fixated on the president's bedroom, and doesn't want to be.
</P>
<P>
   Nor should we infer from this that Americans don't value a high
moral standard in public office. I'm convinced that they do. They
want decent role models for their children. Yet they know that
elected officials are human and prone to err. They tend to judge
each as a whole person and don't condemn altogether for one
character flaw.
</P>
<P>
   Texans understand this. Our state's political patron saint, Sam
Houston, offended almost all the conventional moralists at one time
or another.
</P>
<P>
   Houston swore profanely, so much so that the Mexicans named him
``Senor God Damn.'' He drank excessively, seeming at one point
ready to drown his future in alcohol. The Cherokees named him ``Big
Drunk.'' Mentioned in his 30s as a presidential prospect, Houston
forfeited his political career and resigned the governorship of
Tennessee under a cloud of suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   He was married three times _ once without the benefit of clergy,
unless we count Cherokee tribal customs. He fought duels in
violation of the law. On one occasion, he was censured by the U.S.
House for thrashing a congressman who had publicly insulted his
honor.
</P>
<P>
   Baptized by immersion in an icy stream at age 61, Houston was
told, ``All your sins are washed away.'' He replied, ``God help the
poor fish.''
</P>
<P>
   But Houston had enormous redeeming virtues. If his faults were
bigger than life-size, so was his faith. If his crudeness was
colossal, so was his basic integrity. For 50 years, he wore a ring
given him by his mother. Engraved on the underside, next to his
skin, was one word: ``Honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston left the governorship of Texas rather than swear
allegiance to the Confederacy. He believed secession to be treason.
Twice governor, of two different states, he twice vacated the
office rather than compromise his convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Reprimanded by the House in 1832, Houston described himself as
``a man of broken fortune and blasted reputation.'' He contritely
took the blame for his misdeeds. He quoted Lord Byron: ``The thorns
which I have reaped are of the tree I planted; they have torn me
and I bleed.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, he was president of the Republic of Texas and
on his way to immortality.
</P>
<P>
   To ask forgiveness is harder for a public man than for most
others. But asking it is the act of a big person. So is giving it.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps history's greatest story of sin, forgiveness and
redemption is that of David, Old Testament hero and most honored of
Israel's kings. If you haven't read it lately, revisit it in
Chapters 11 and 12 of 2 Samuel.
</P>
<P>
   David, so capable of nobility and grace and yet so human, had an
affair with another's wife, who became pregnant. In an attempt to
cover his misdeed, David ordered the husband, Uriah, sent home from
the battlefront. A few days with his wife, the king reasoned, and
Uriah would suppose later when the child came that it was his own.
</P>
<P>
   But Uriah, intent on serving his king and country, refused to go
home. Frustrated, David ordered his general to abandon Uriah to the
enemy. Uriah died a soldier's death.
</P>
<P>
   King David's crime of adultery and official betrayal, compounded
by murder, was greater than any attributed to any American
president. Its enormity, impressed upon the king by a prophet named
Nathan, drew from David the self-judgment that he deserved to die.
Yet he was forgiven and became, with all his flaws, a role model
for his progeny through 26 centuries.
</P>
<P>
   This is no excuse for Bill Clinton. What he did was wrong. He
knows that. But if the American people want to forgive their
president, as they seem to, who will deny them that right?
</P>

SCHOENBERG ANNIVERSARY: WHIRLWIND OF ENERGY FOR A DISSONANT
MASTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By PAUL GRIFFITHS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ I am not sure I have ever seen a group of musicians
stride onto a concert platform so joyful and eager as were the 15
players who burst through the stage entrance door at Merkin Hall on
Saturday night. And what were they to perform? Schoenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Only in New York, asserted the cellist Fred Sherry, who was
responsible for putting together a whole weekend of programs at
this venue to celebrate the 124th anniversary of Schoenberg's
birth. Maybe he was right. The city is home to scores of musicians
who are devoted, heart and soul, to the music not only of
Schoenberg but also of his most challenging successors. It is also
home to a large and willing audience that wants to hear this music.
</P>
<P>
   Our major musical institutions rarely want to recognize that
fact _ with the conspicuous exception now of the Metropolitan
Opera, which this season is presenting both Schoenberg's ``Moses
und Aron'' and Berg's ``Wozzeck'' and whose maestro, James Levine,
was at Merkin on Saturday to take part in the postperformance
discussion. Others should note that the hall was full for the work
the happy band of 15 was to play: Schoenberg's Chamber Symphony No.
1.
</P>
<P>
   The musicians' enthusiasm by no means stopped when they got
going. Rather, they thrust their phrases with maximum care and
effort into the Chamber Symphony's maelstrom of activity.
</P>
<P>
   There were incisive, battling strokes from the first violinist,
Rolf Schulte. Sherry himself showed that warmth can coexist with
speed. The clarinetist Alan R. Kay and the oboist Stephen Taylor
blended perfectly together. Donald Palma, on bass, produced some
beautiful harmonics.
</P>
<P>
   Tara Helen O'Connor, on piccolo in the closing pages, put the
sparkle on the mounting exhilaration. And finally the two horn
players, William Purvis and Christopher Komer, seemed to lift the
whole work into their hands and lob it over the finishing line.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the ensemble wobbled, as wobble it will when so much
is going on. And sometimes one might have wanted more dynamic
variation. Robert Craft, who had conducted, admitted this in the
postperformance discussion, remarking that it had been difficult to
get the players to hold back when they had been so overjoyed by
what they were doing. Everyone there, surely, was overjoyed too.

FOR INTRAMURALS IN CHICAGO, THE PRIZE IS A THEATER
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By BRUCE WEBER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO, Sept. 14 _ It is a conflict that has evoked pride and
betrayal, pettiness and high-mindedness, calling up a fair bit of
history and not a little money. Though neither side is evil, each
claims to be wronged. As a drama it might be stageworthy if it
didn't involve so much litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Theodore Gross, president of Roosevelt University, one of the
combatants, sized it up by invoking King Lear. ``Shakespeare said
it better than I ever could,'' he said. ``It's a case of filial
ingratitude.'' That would be one spin. The other is that Roosevelt
is greedily overstepping its bounds.
</P>
<P>
   The battle is over control of the 109-year-old Auditorium
Theater, one of this city's most prominent cultural venues. It is
owned by Roosevelt but has been managed for 38 years by the
Auditorium Theater Council, a community-based group that was formed
with the aid and encouragement of the university and then more or
less left alone to do its job.
</P>
<P>
   The council's sole functions have been the restoration and
operation of the theater, and it views the university's recent
attempts to assert the power of ownership by using theater funds
for nontheater purposes as anathema. ``The theater is a cash cow to
them,'' said Fred Eychaner, the council board member who is leading
the fight. ``The art and the architecture is clearly in second
place.''
</P>
<P>
   A magnificent 4,200-seat performance hall, designed by Louis
Sullivan and Dankmar Adler, the theater occupies some 40 percent of
the mammoth Auditorium Building downtown. It is a venue for
traveling Broadway shows and a growing variety of performances by
both internationally known and local arts groups. The Joffrey
Ballet, the Chicago Youth Symphony and dance troupes from Zimbabwe
and Japan are all on the schedule this season, and the
Broadway-bound revival of ``Oliver!'' is slated for next fall. But
the nature of its management and the future of its programming both
depend on the outcome of litigation that has gone on for four
years.
</P>
<P>
   Though the council has put $9 million worth of restoration work
into the theater and has $5.5 million in the bank, Roosevelt says
the council is not maximizing its earning potential or thinking big
enough. Gross hopes to turn the theater into a centerpiece for a
music and performance conservatory and to hire new management that
will make it a nationally important venue, perhaps a launching site
for extravagant touring shows, perhaps, like the Brooklyn Academy
of Music, an arts emporium with an idiosyncratic agenda that itself
becomes an attraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it will be,'' Gross said. ``That will depend
on the vision of the people we put in charge.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the council decries those plans as
pie-in-the-sky and fears that a parade of high-grossing popular
shows will deprive local audiences of diverse programming and local
arts groups of their access to the space. The council also says
that such a programming plan is a questionable financial strategy
because three other large theaters are being built in the city and
Chicago's appetite for big musicals is unproven. In any case, the
issue is control, and it dates to 1960, when the council was
formed.
</P>
<P>
   Although the legal argument has grown grotesquely arcane, the
fundamental dispute is over the nature of the relationship forged
then between the university and the council. Namely, the question
is whether the initial agreement established the theater as a
public trust with the council as trustee. The council says yes,
that although the agreement does not specifically say so, it
created an implied trust and that other documents and letters
confirm that a trust is what the university intended.
</P>
<P>
   The university says this is simply ludicrous, that the council
is and always has been simply a committee of the university. ``When
people raise money for a place and operate it, they have an
understandable tendency towards proprietorship,'' Gross said.
``They think they own it. But they don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt, founded in 1945 as an alternative to local colleges
that used racial quotas, struggled financially for many years but
is now an expanding university with an enrollment that has grown to
nearly 7,000. It has owned the Auditorium Building and used it as a
campus since shortly after the university's inception but did not,
in its early days, make use of the theater, and indeed allowed it
to fall into disrepair. In the late 50s, it invited proposals from
the public to take over the theater portion of the building.
</P>
<P>
   That resulted in the formation of the council, a group of
private citizens that included Roosevelt trustees. It raised $3
million, enough to reopen the theater in 1967, and has operated it
in the black through much though not all of the last three decades.
Still, it does not pay rent to Roosevelt, and in the deficit years,
during the 1980s, Roosevelt lent its support, helping to keep the
theater open.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between the two groups has been rocky from the
start, but until Gross' arrival in 1987 the university maintained a
largely hands-off policy, leaving the council to run the theater
without interference. But Gross made it known that he wanted
circumstances to change because, he said, the theater was not
serving the university to full advantage. ``The theater was left
alone for too long,'' he acknowledged last week. ``But why should
Roosevelt give up control of an asset that it owns? I don't think
any self-respecting university would make such a sacrifice.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue boiled over in December 1994 when Gross tried to
appropriate $1.5 million in theater funds to help secure a loan for
Roosevelt's new campus in Schaumburg, a suburb northwest of the
city. The council, claiming that its cash assets reflect donations
by the public specifically meant for the theater, saw the move as a
power grab. ``You don't give money for breast cancer in order for
it to go to prostate cancer,'' said Jan Kallish, the council's
executive director. ``You don't give money for the theater and
expect it to be shipped out to a university in Schaumburg.''
</P>
<P>
   The council filed suit to stop the appropriation and, with
rising acrimony, the matter has been in the courts ever since. In
1995 a county court judge made a summary judgment in favor of
Roosevelt; in April 1997 the Illinois Appellate Court returned the
matter to the court for trial. This summer there were 10 weeks of
testimony. A ruling is expected on Sept. 28, but both sides say
that if they lose, they will appeal.
</P>
<P>
   An exasperated Gross said the $1.5 million was to be taken from
accumulated ticket revenues, not from public donations. And he
remains appalled by what he calls the ingratitude of the council
board. ``During the 1980s when the Auditorium Theater was in
deficit mode, Roosevelt stood by them,'' he said. ``We could easily
have shut the doors. We were there when they needed us. They
weren't there when we needed them.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Both sides say their primary concern is the continued health of
the theater, with Roosevelt asserting that the theater can only
benefit if the university is as strong as it can be, and the
council saying that the university will never make the theater
enough of a priority to restore and manage it properly.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides say they want to settle, but on the issue of
controlling the theater's board and assets, the parties appear
intractable. ``We've talked settlement for four years,'' said
Stanley Eisenhammer, a lawyer for Gross. ``Every time we reach an
agreement, they pull back and ask for more.''
</P>
<P>
   The council's point of view? ``At one point we agreed to pay
more than we thought we should in exchange for a stipulation that a
certain amount of the theater's money would always be used for
restoration,'' Eychaner said. ``It was turned down unilaterally.
They said we weren't going to tell them what to do with the
building.''

FROM PARCELS TO PASSENGERS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 20) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Pa.)   (af)  
 By BETSY WADE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Cinderella tale is always fun, even when the transformation
takes place in the predawn dark at Philadelphia International
Airport. The pumpkin _ in this case, a United Parcel Service
Airlines 727 with ``UPS'' on the tail and a brown stripe down the
fuselage, emptied of packages flown from Raleigh-Durham, N.C., _
was sitting with its wide left-side cargo door flung up,
clamshell-style.
</P>
<P>
   The cargo containers, with tops curved to fit inside the
fuselage, had been removed to a spot where the parcels would be
sorted onto trucks to complete the Thursday-to-Friday overnight
delivery process. One worker was inside the 727 unhooking a cargo
net.
</P>
<P>
   At the cockpit end of the otherwise empty cabin, two tourism
magazines stuck incongruously out of pockets on a front wall,
although there was nothing for anyone to sit on, let alone light to
read by.
</P>
<P>
   But over the next couple of hours, a team of seven UPS employees
furnished Cinderella's coach, converting the empty space into a
cabin with galleys and 113 seats, magazines and safety cards, able
to carry passengers.
</P>
<P>
   UPS Airlines has been using five single-aisle 727's from its
fleet of 224 planes to fly charter passengers on weekends or
vacation weeks, or to catch cruises, since the spring of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Next-day package delivery, which caused UPS to get certification
as an airline in 1988, is a night operation, but it does not
require flying on Friday nights because few companies want
shipments on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   So, watching equipment sitting idle, UPS began to consider
renting its planes to organizations needing a lift on the weekend.
Tour operators and cruise lines, the company realized, would be a
perfect fit. So far, UPS is not selling its seats to passengers,
but only chartering the trip to a tour or cruise company.
</P>
<P>
   UPS appears to be alone in doing such total conversions,
although some passenger airlines take out seats and fly a little
cargo now and then.
</P>
<P>
   UPS Airlines now has contracts with three tour companies _
Vacation Express of Atlanta, Apple Vacations of Newtown Square,
Pa., and TNT Vacations of Boston _ plus four cruise lines, Royal
Caribbean, Celebrity, Princess and Premier. UPS provides the plane,
flight and cabin crews, check-in personnel, catering and cabin
cleaning.
</P>
<P>
   The tour company sells the tours, manages the paperwork and pays
UPS for the lease. The company's clients charter the planes to get
their passengers to Bermuda (where I went), Aruba, Cancun, the
Bahamas, Puerto Rico _ all sorts of warm places. Tour companies and
cruise lines use various charter companies, so getting on a UPS
flight is a matter of chance.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When I arrived at the empty 727 in Philadelphia at 4:45 a.m. on
a Friday in August, three trailers, tailgates open, were backed up
to the cargo aperture. They contained passenger necessities, packed
in precise order for rolling into the plane: overhead bins first,
then blocks of 12 seats, already affixed to floor sections, then
galley units, then more seats.
</P>
<P>
   The actual floor of the plane, like a theater stage, had marks
and numbers in two colors: red for cargo containers, yellow for the
passenger service. Louis Lombardi, head of UPS air operations in
Philadelphia, walked me in. We stood by the cargo opening, where an
electrified lift was waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Most cargo planes have no windows, but ike all the convertible
models, this one did. Plastic shields were protecting them for now.
The toilets, two in the rear and one in the front, are always
aboard. The overhead bins were designed for frequent
reinstallation.
</P>
<P>
   Oxygen masks, along with all the government-required safety
devices, rolled aboard with the bins, which had pillows and
blankets inside. Lombardi said that when the conversion was
complete, crews contracted from AMR, the parent of American
Airlines, would clean the cabin and replace pillows and blankets.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Once the overhead bins were all in, the seat sections came out
of a trailer. Each was rolled in, slid into place then locked in.
</P>
<P>
   I had bought a ticket just for the trip out to Bermuda and back
from Apple Vacations: Each way it takes less than two hours. I flew
out on a 7:45 a.m. flight, aboard a plane that had been converted
earlier, not the one I had watched, which still needed cleaning and
would not be ready until a later flight.
</P>
<P>
   The passengers I rode with were staying the weekend or a week.
My visit was an eye-wink; I hung out with the crew at the Grotto
Bay Beach resort near the airport and flew back at 4 p.m. with
passengers who had arrived the Monday or Friday before.
</P>
<P>
   UPS configures the seats into 20 rows with 33 inches of space
between the back of one seat and the back of the next. This is two
to three inches more space that most regular airlines allow, and
three or four more inches than many charter companies.
</P>
<P>
   There are no first-class seats. I sat at a bulkhead, and was
comfortable. Because no passenger was connecting to another flight,
and the plane was going to only one place, travelers willingly
checked their bags, reducing the crush on aisles, bins and floor.
</P>
<P>
   UPS uses various catering companies, depending on the departure
city. Both breakfast on my outbound flight and dinner on my return
were hot dishes, but neither meal was anything more than average
airline food. While the plane waited in Bermuda, the carts with the
afternoon meal were taken off and refrigerated.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some charter companies, UPS sells its drinks. Bloody
Marys at $4 moved briskly at breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   In Bermuda, at the adjoining table in the Grotto Bay poolside
restaurant, was a family of five. The mother, the Rev. Jeanne G.
Thomas, a Presbyterian minister from Wallingford, Pa., told the
crew she had warned her children they were flying United Parcel,
and the 7-year-old was briefly alarmed about getting big enough
breathing holes in his box.
</P>
<P>
   By this time, even I was a little weary of such banter, but crew
members were game and responded with their usual lines about bar
codes.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Thomas and her husband, James, were making the trip for
their 20th anniversary. The inbound flight had arrived before their
rooms were available, but that hadn't dampened their mood.
</P>
<P>
   The captain on my trip, Wendell Lantz; the first officer, Sharon
Gallagher, and the engineer, Jim Waggener, are employees of United
Parcel: They fly both cargo and passengers, wearing brown uniforms
and neckties with the company logo. The cabin attendants _ Kathy
Conrad, Jeff Riddle and Karen Morgan _ are employees of a
subcontracting company, Inclusive Solutions, for which United
Parcel is the sole client.
</P>
<P>
   They work only weekends, and their blue uniforms bear sunbursts
and other vacationish emblems. Many flight attendants are former
employees of passenger airlines who prefer the shorter weekend work
schedules.
</P>
<P>
   On the flight home, I sat next to yet another anniversary
couple: James B. and Linda Gibson, who were marking 22 years. The
Gibsons said they stayed four days at the Sonesta; as they
remembered, their package, with breakfast and dinners included,
cost $2,100. Their only complaint was that the stay was too short.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Vestiges of moisture from the ghost of Tropical Storm Frances
will join with a cool front Tuesday, setting the stage for
scattered showers and thunderstorms from the lower Great Lakes to
northwest New England. A few of the storms could produce brief
downpours and gusty winds, but the risk of severe weather will be
almost nil. Showers and isolated thunder will develop farther east
near the northern New England coast as a warm front presses slowly
toward the Canadian Maritimes.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly sunny, unseasonably hot, and humid weather will continue
across much of the Middle Atlantic and Southeast States as
sprawling high pressure holds steady over the region. Warm air
aloft associated with the high will suppress the vertical growth of
cumulus clouds, so that any afternoon thunderstorms that develop
will be solitary. However, on the high's weak western flank,
clusters of thundershowers will bubble up from the western Gulf of
Mexico coast to the middle Mississippi Valley within a narrow
corridor where humid air flows northward. The heaviest rain will
likely occur in Texas and Oklahoma, where low pressure near 18,000
feet incites currents of rapidly rising air.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered heavy thunderstorms will douse parts of southwest
Florida as a disturbance teams with local sea-breeze fronts to lift
tropical moisture. Rainfalls in excess of an inch are possible.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the West will be sunny to partly cloudy and tranquil.
Isolated thunder will develop in New Mexico, while patches of
morning fog begin the day along the Pacific Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Wet Desert
</P>
<P>
   In a typical September, rainfall at Las Vegas averages 0.28
inches, a meager total consistent with the city's desert climate.
With California's Sierra Nevada Mountains far to the west and the
lofty Spring Mountains just to the west effectively blocking
Pacific moisture, September rains are supported by a sporadic flow
of moisture from the south. This month, a persistent flow of
moisture from the tropics at high altitudes has fueled measurable
rain on seven of the first 13 days. The total of 1.29 inches of
rain already ranks this month as the city's fourth wettest
September on record.

<P>
   For a work that is treasured around the world for its glow of
youthful honesty, Anne Frank's diary has turned out to have more
than its share of contention, exploitation and evasion. Tuesday
night's documentary, ``Anne Frank: The Missing Pages,'' based on a
new biography by Melissa Mueller, draws attention to five censored
pages that Otto Frank, Anne's father and the keeper of her flame,
entrusted privately to a friend because they cast an uncomfortable
light on his relations with his wife, Edith.
</P>
<P>
   In what Ms. Mueller calls ``a stunning analysis of her
parents,'' Anne wrote that there was little sexual love between
them. Missing, Anne wrote, was ``the kind of love that I envisage
for a marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mueller, who has been denied permission to quote from the
new material in her book (``Anne Frank: The Biography,'' published
by Metropolitan Books, a division of Henry Holt), reports that
Frank had a ``first love'' whom his wife was never able to replace.
Tuesday night's program suggests that Otto may have married Edith,
who was from a well-to-do German family, for her money.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the facts of the case, the cheerful Edith glimpsed
Tuesday night in youthful photographs is virtually absent from the
diary known to so many millions of readers. Ms. Mueller says, ``By
leaving these pages out, Otto Frank actually betrayed his wife and
daughter, because this is the only passage in the diary where Anne
shows sympathy and understanding for her mother.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Missing Pages'' speculates on Anne's intentions in writing
and rewriting what the diary's custodians found to be an
``extremely unkind and unfair picture'' of her parents. Did she
come to think of her diary, composed as letters to a make-believe
friend, as a sketch for a novel? Did some of her reworkings reflect
the imagination of a developing writer as well as the changing
attitudes of a teen-ager whose feelings about her parents were
still unresolved?
</P>
<P>
   Turning to the abiding mystery of who betrayed the Frank family
to the Germans, Ms. Mueller directs suspicion at a cleaning woman
who was worried about her husband's being arrested and also may
have been seeking revenge for a son who was lost in the German
Navy.
</P>
<P>
   But as one researcher says Tuesday night, nothing in the new
material can much enhance or diminish the impact of the diary.
</P>
<P>
   The Franks were among many Jews betrayed to the Nazis, and the
details of their betrayal, like those of their domestic relations,
are easily overshadowed by Anne Frank's legacy. For that, see
Saturday night's episode of ``Biography,'' titled ``Anne Frank: The
Life of a Young Girl,'' at 8 o'clock on A&AMP;E.

BISCUITS AND OTHER REASONS TO RISE AND SHINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   My daughters are my biggest fans, so I was a little more than
skeptical when Asha told me recently that I should quit my job and
just sell my biscuits.
</P>
<P>
   It's sort of like my sisters telling me I should just write
books. You have to wonder if their biscuits have been baked enough.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing I know for sure is that they love me an awful
lot, and for that I'm eternally grateful. Besides, not only do they
often provide substance for this column, they teach me things like,
well, how to make biscuits.
</P>
<P>
   It was a Saturday morning when I decided I could no longer wait
to go to Mississippi to have them. Biscuits, I mean.
</P>
<P>
   I called Nancy, whom I consider the best cook among my five
sisters (after myself, of course), and asked her how to make
biscuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get you some self-rising flour and milk and oil, and you
stir it and stir it and stir it,'' she told me.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, but, how much flour and oil and milk, and after I'm done
stirring it and stirring it, how long do I bake it?'' I asked.
``What do I put the oven on?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, about 350,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Did I tell you that, out of all of my sisters, Nancy is the
sweetest? Who else would offer instructions like that but a
sweetheart?
</P>
<P>
   I did make biscuits that day. They rose, they were golden brown,
a little crusty on the outside, but edible. I was determined to
master this rather sketchy recipe, so every Saturday for the next
several months, I made Jimmy, Jamila and Asha my guinea pigs.
</P>
<P>
   They were gracious. They ate them. They offered compliments, but
I knew these were not Nancy's biscuits. These weren't even the
biscuits my sister Dianne could bake.
</P>
<P>
   I retreated and started to offer my family the uncanned version
from the grocer's freezer. I felt like a failure. Even my baby
brother, Ronald, was making biscuits for his family. In fact, he'd
become rather well-known for making one really big one for each
member of his family.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate, it occurred to me that although Dianne didn't always
get them right, she was the sister who got a certain pleasure out
of giving instructions. Whatever she told me, I knew I could make
this recipe mine. Just like I had with the poundcake recipe, the
turkey stuffing and banana pudding.
</P>
<P>
   Now Dianne would teach me to make mouth-watering biscuits. At 7
a.m. on a Saturday morning about a month ago, I got her on the
phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you doing up so early?'' she asked in amazement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want biscuits,'' I said, my ingredients and daughters
already in position.
</P>
<P>
   In about 15 minutes, she had talked me through a perfect pan of
biscuits. It was on! For the next month, every Saturday morning, I
was up at 7 making biscuits. Two weeks ago, my biscuits had their
coming-out. It was time to test them on my sister Jo.
</P>
<P>
   My biscuits? They're the bomb!
</P>
<P>
   Wasn't it the Duke of Edinburgh who said, ``I never see any home
cooking. All I get is fancy stuff''?
</P>
<P>
   The poor duke. Obviously, he never had sisters or daughters, and
I happen to have the best. They believe I can do anything. Sell my
biscuits? Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   But I could never put a price on being in the kitchen with my
daughters and flour, or on sharing recipes with my sisters. Jo and
I still laugh about Nancy's instructions: ``Stir it and stir it and
stir it.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments like these do not happen often enough.

Jack Rosenthal is editor in chief of The New York Times Magazine.
This is the 17th summer he has pinch-hit for William Safire, who is
on vacation. 
 By JACK ROSENTHAL

<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1965, Gordon E. Moore, co-founder of Intel, boldly predicted
that the power of computer chips would double every 18 months.
Moore's Law has turned out to be remarkably prescient _ about the
content of computers. It is no guide, however, to the content of
communication. There are no automatic upgrades, updates or new
releases for language. English is studded with fossils of
techno-terminology, and how we use them tells much about how
language does change.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the change is generational: The parent says
``hi-fi''; the teen-ager, ``stereo.'' A child of the 1920s ``turns
up the Philco,'' while a child of the '70s, in unconscious homage
to the Victrola, ``cranks some tunes.'' What do you call a
refrigerator? In the '40s, when ice trucks, tongs and picks were
still common, many people said ``icebox'' even when referring to
the electrified version. Now, most people say ``fridge''; in
Germany, many still say ``Frigidaire.''
</P>
<P>
   A more interesting source of language change arises when the
context changes even though the word stays the same. Consider the
verb ``dial.'' A sizable fraction of the population has never used
a dial phone, yet the term remains indispensable. No matter how
skillfully old movies can be colorized, it's silly even to think
about updating titles to, say, ``Touch M for Murder.''
</P>
<P>
   A whole generation has passed since music relied on scratchable
33 1/3 or 45 rpm platters, and two generations since breakable 78s.
The actuality of a needle stuck in the same wa-wa-wa sound is now
rare. Yet ``sounds like a broken record'' remains the common
impatient simile for boring repetition. Indeed, people still use
``record'' and ``album'' to describe the now-ubiquitous CD.
</P>
<P>
   What goes for voice communication applies also to
correspondence. Notice the header on your last e-mail message.
People who have hardly ever seen carbon paper routinely send out
 &UR; cc &LR; 's, carbon copies. There is no convenient way other than  &UR; bcc &LR; ,
blind carbon copy, to say, ``I'm sending you a copy without
informing the addressee.'' It has been decades since radio
announcers urged listeners to tune in next week _ ``same time, same
station'' _ but the phrase remains useful and hence common.
</P>
<P>
   Some such expressions remain so dear to writers that they endure
as cliches even though they are now so dated that they purely
mystify readers. ``Stemwinder,'' for instance. It continues to
appear in political reporting as a way of describing a partisan
oration. Once, it meant modern and up to the minute, deriving from
the invention of a watch wound by a knob, replacing a key. But as
the regular writer of this column notes in ``Safire's Political
Dictionary,'' that change was patented in 1866. In this era of
quartz and batteries, 25 presidents later, when is the last time
any of us actually wound a watch stem?
</P>
<P>
   Many people know that ``over the transom'' refers to unsolicited
manuscripts sent to publishers; few of them have ever seen the kind
of inside ventilation window that used to exist over office doors _
through which, presumably, unbidden authors tossed their
undiscovered triumphs.
</P>
<P>
   Another example, ``nickel and dime,'' reappeared during the
recent sale of the Woolworth Building, the stately white tower in
New York, by the company that has now taken the name Venator Group.
Even so, ``nickel and dime'' endures as an adjective describing the
discount stores of yesteryear. In another context, it's a verb that
means to drain away a little at a time. In still another, it's an
adjective meaning cheap.
</P>
<P>
   These are not mere anachronisms or curiosities. They reflect an
underlying characteristic of language. The meaning of words comes
not from the dictionary but from the social contexts in which they
are used. As the contexts change, so do the meanings.
</P>
<P>
   In her book ``Talking Voices,'' the linguist Deborah Tannen
observes that meaning is not derived from expressions directly, by
a process of deconstruction according to definitions and rules, but
... in a leap of association.'' Whatever their literal derivation,
words come to mean what we need them to mean. The nearest rotary
phone may be 20 miles or 20 years distant, but everyone knows what
it means to dial.
</P>
<P>
   FRAUGHT THOUGHT
</P>
<P>
   In the Marx Brothers' movie ``Horse Feathers,'' a secretary
says: ``The dean is furious. He's waxing wroth.'' To which Groucho
responds: ``Is Roth out there too? Tell Roth to wax the dean for a
while.'' The question today is: What's waxing? ``To wax'' means to
grow gradually and traditionally; there has to be  &UR; something &LR;  that
waxes, like the visible face of the moon. But lately the verb has
been going out on the town unescorted.
</P>
<P>
   In a manuscript received at The New York Times an author wrote:
``It's not the type of job that ... charming recruiters wax about
over seared tuna to recent Phi Beta Kappa graduates.'' In another
article, someone ``waxes provocatively.'' One could sputter
hypercorrectively, ``Waxes  &UR; what &LR;  provocatively?'' But that would
overlook the practical lesson. ``Wax'' is so often used positively
_ to wax poetic or enthusiastic _ that the verb is becoming
shorthand for the phrase.
</P>
<P>
   The same is true for ``fraught.'' It means filled, charged or
loaded _ with whatever the speaker chooses. But every day brings a
new example of its being filled with nothing; just plain fraught. A
magazine writer last fall described an academic proposal as ``too
politically fraught _ liable, even, to give some kind of comfort to
white supremacists.'' Newsweek reported recently that the actor Jim
Carrey had ``a monumentally fraught relationship with his
parents.'' A New York Times story said that in Boston,
``neighborhood schools'' has become ``a fraught, to some even
frightening, phrase.''
</P>
<P>
   A Presbyterian in Belfast, Northern Ireland, told The Irish
Times last month that the chill factor has been such that many
Protestants now like to live in less fraught surroundings.'' Just
as ``wax'' usually carries positive vibes, ``fraught'' bears
negative ones _ fraught with danger or hardship _ and ``fraught,''
unfreighted, becomes shorthand for the thought.
</P>
<P>
   These instances of compression offer the same lesson in language
provided by the reapplication of ``record,'' ``dial,'' ``cc'' and
the like. Words are not handcuffs. People make of them what they
need to. In language, necessity is the mother of reinvention.

   Some people leave their hearts in San Francisco, but Kevin
Spacey has a warm spot in his for London. The actor, who triumphed
as Hickey in O'Neill's ``The Iceman Cometh'' at the little Almeida
Theater in the city's Islington section and then moved with the
drama to the 1,000-seat Old Vic near Waterloo Station, is joining
the board of the historic Old Vic. One of the world's most famous
stages, the Old Vic was spared its final curtain this summer by a
charitable trust created to preserve it.

<P>
   Closing Credits
</P>
<P>
   The Venice Film Festival, whose top award is the Golden Lion,
wound up in something of an uproar on Sunday. The festival's
director, Felice Laudadio, called the competition ``stupid and
arrogant'' and resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Beatty, whose political satire ``Bulworth'' was in the
competition, got a surprise when he was chosen for a lifetime
achievement award.
</P>
<P>
   The Gold Lion went to ``The Way We Laughed,'' directed by Gianni
Amelio. The bittersweet story of two brothers from Sicily who move
to Italy's industrial north was the first Italian film in a decade
to win the festival's top prize.
</P>
<P>
   Other honors went to Sean Penn, named best actor for
``Hurlyburly''; Catherine Deneuve, best actress for ``Place
Vendome''; Emir Kusturica, best director for ``Black Cat, White
Cat,'' and Eric Rohmer, cited for best original screenplay, for
``Conte d'Automne.''

   NEW YORK _ Fifty years ago, in September 1948, a 21-year-old
conductor made his debut leading the Landestheater Halle in
Germany. His name was Kurt Masur, and on Wednesday night he will
honor that occasion by leading the New York Philharmonic at Avery
Fisher Hall in the opening concert of its 157th season.
</P>
<P>
   The all-Beethoven program, including the Symphony No. 1, begins
a complete traversal of Beethoven's nine symphonies in five
programs over three weeks, ending on Oct. 3. The cycle is the
orchestra's first since its 100th anniversary in 1941, when it was
led by Arturo Toscanini.
</P>
<P>
   The concert is also a salute to the violinist Isaac Stern.
Stern, who first performed with the Philharmonic in 1944, has since
made more than 100 solo appearances with the orchestra. In a
program that also includes the ``Fidelio'' Overture, he will
perform two Romances for violin and orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Homage
</P>
<P>
   Some 35,000 fans and guests bade an emotional farewell to the
director Akira Kurosawa at a memorial service on Sunday at his
studio in Yokohama, Japan. About 4,000 guests inside the studio
heard an eulogy delivered from the gold-room set used for one of
the director's greatest films, ``Ran.'' Kurosawa, whose works
include ``Seven Samurai,'' ``Kagemusha,'' ``Rashomon'' and
``Yojimbo,'' died on Sept. 6 at 88.

CRUISE TALKS BUT CAT STAYS IN THE BAG
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Perhaps the most anticipated studio film in years is
Stanley Kubrick's long-delayed ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' made under
almost military-style secrecy in England and starring Tom Cruise
and Nicole Kidman. Even top executives at Warner Bros., which is
tentatively set to release the movie in March, have little idea
what the film is about.
</P>
<P>
   But Cruise, who attended the Toronto Film Festival, broke the
silence surrounding the film and insisted the other day that the
director was not indulgent even though the movie took 15 months to
shoot, an unusually long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't waste time; he's not indulgent,'' Cruise said. ``He
worked seven days a week. I got faxes from him at 3, 4 in the
morning with scenes.''
</P>
<P>
   By some accounts, the movie, written by Kubrick and Frederic
Raphael, is a psychosexual thriller about two psychiatrists, played
by Cruise and his real-life wife, Ms. Kidman. Warner executives
have said they believed the film also involved a menage a trois.
Cruise would not go into details about the film's plot.
</P>
<P>
   The film had extensive delays, including recasting several roles
and frequent rewrites, but ``it was part of the process,'' said
Cruise, 35, who was in Toronto to promote the film ``Without
Limits,'' which he produced. ``When you look at the amount of time
it took to make the movie, it probably took 10 months of shooting
time. But there are times he gave us time off.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when the cast was away, however, Kubrick ``was always
working on the movie,'' Cruise said.
</P>
<P>
   He made his comments after a news conference in which an
executive at the film festival, apparently under orders from Warner
Bros., told reporters that the actor would not discuss anything
related to ``Eyes Wide Shut.'' But later, during an interview in
his hotel room, Cruise was relatively forthcoming about the film.
</P>
<P>
   Kubrick _ one of Hollywood's most acclaimed filmmakers, whose
movies include ``Paths of Glory,'' ``Dr. Strangelove,'' ``A
Clockwork Orange'' and ``2001: A Space Odyssey'' _ is surprising,
but ``he's not pretentious at all,'' Cruise said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly he'll say something to you, or you'll see how he
creates a shot, and you realize this man is different, this man is
profound. And it seems without effort. And you come out of this
experience and realize the possibilities of film, the possibilities
of how to communicate ideas and concepts in a way that you never
thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a movie made this way. He does it in a certain
way, like Chaplin did it his way, and Woody Allen does it his way.
Woody Allen directed a whole movie and then reshot it.'' That was
``September,'' which Allen largely reshot.
</P>
<P>
   Kubrick is not known as an especially spontaneous or funny
director, but Cruise said he found both these qualities.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to see what is going to to happen,'' Cruise said. ``I
understand why he's an enigma. He doesn't give many interviews.''
</P>
<P>
   Cruise defended Kubrick's secrecy: ``He wants to protect the
story and protect the actors in his film. Today you can pick up a
script on the Internet. You see movies and you already have
preconceived ideas about it. You prejudge them. There's so much
information out there. There's no sense of discovery. And Stanley
wants that sense of discovery. He wants the movie to stand on its
own.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't make a lot of movies. But movies are his life. He
worked seven days a week on this one. And he wants to protect his
movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Cruise said he had limited time to use his leverage as a movie
star to make and produce his own films. With his partner, Paula
Wagner, Cruise produced ``Without Limits,'' which opened last week
to generally strong reviews. The film, directed by Robert Towne,
deals with the life of track star Steve Prefontaine. Without
Cruise's influence, it's doubtful that Warner Bros. would have made
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a finite period of time for anyone in the movie business,
and not just actors,'' he said. ``How many movies can you make? How
many years do you have the energy, the power, the time to produce
movies? I know I've got to do it now. I want to use time in a way
that's constructive. I don't want to sit down when I'm 70 and say
I've wasted my time away and not made the films I wanted to make.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But Cruise said he had no regrets about the time he spent on
Kubrick's film. He turned aside estimates that, as perhaps the
highest-paid star in movies, he had lost $20 million to $40 million
because of his extensive involvement in ``Eyes Wide Shut'' and his
inability to move onto other projects in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say: `You've lost 40, 60, 80 million dollars. You've
lost all this money. You've lost all this time.' I don't understand
that kind of thinking,'' Cruise said. ``I've been doing this for 18
years. Yeah, I make money. I make a lot of money. And money's
wonderful and nice. But that does not enter into why I make movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some things you don't do for money. I know that's
hard to believe. To have a chance to work with Stanley Kubrick,
that's worth it for me.''

DEMOCRATS ARE THE MAIN THERMOMETER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RON HUTCHESON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If you're trying to gauge how much trouble
President Clinton is in, don't pay any attention to the
Republicans. Listen to the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   One of the hard facts of life in Washington is that your enemies
can't hurt you nearly as much as your friends. No one resigns from
office because they are under attack from their political
opponents. They resign when their allies go AWOL.
</P>
<P>
   It happened to Richard Nixon. It happened to Jim Wright. Now
it's happening to Clinton. Democrats are not in full-scale retreat
yet, but the troops are getting skittish.
</P>
<P>
   The lurid details and explosive allegations in the report
submitted to Congress by independent counsel Kenneth Starr will
only add to the panic attack. If the polls show that the public is
turning against Clinton and his party, presidential apologies are
likely to fall on deaf ears as Democrats try to avoid an Election
Day meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   The grumbling in the ranks started long before Sen. Joseph
Lieberman, D-Conn., denounced Clinton's behavior in a blistering
Senate speech. But Lieberman's decision to go public proved that
Democrats have nothing to lose and plenty to gain by distancing
themselves from the president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton acknowledged as much by agreeing with Lieberman that the
White House sex scandal resulted from immoral, wrong and
unacceptable behavior. The president also uttered the words ``I'm
sorry'' for the first time since he acknowledged his relationship
with former intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's comments are mild compared to some of the more
recent criticism directed at Clinton by members of his own party.
</P>
<P>
   Although most Democrats are not ready to toss Clinton overboard,
they clearly have no intention of going down with the ship.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon's experience is instructive. At the start of 1974, only 37
percent of Americans favored Nixon's impeachment. Most
congressional Republicans embraced Nixon's view that the Democrats
were out to get him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't confuse me with the facts,'' Rep. Earl Landgrebe,
R-Ind., one of the president's die-hard fans, told reporters as the
Watergate scandal reached a climax. ``I've got a closed mind. I
will not vote for impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the first issues that Congress had to resolve was
establishing the grounds for Nixon's removal. What, exactly, does
the Constitution mean when it says that a president can be
impeached for ``treason, bribery, high crimes and misdemeanors''?
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Nixon's lawyers argued that impeachment should
be used only in cases involving criminal conduct. Others concluded
that the Constitution's framers wanted to include conduct that
might not violate any law but that does violate the standards that
Americans expect of their president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Underlying all the constitutional relationships we talk about
is the necessity for standards of honesty, truth and integrity,''
said Paul Sarbanes, a Maryland Democrat who was then a member of
the House and now is a senator. ``Our own system of free government
cannot operate if those standards are not honored.''
</P>
<P>
   With time, most lawmakers concluded that Nixon's conduct fit
either definition of an impeachable offense. Nixon's determination
to fight evaporated as his stalwart defenders abandoned him in the
face of mounting evidence of presidential wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after 5 p.m. Aug. 7, 1974, three prominent Republicans _
Sen. Barry Goldwater of Arizona, Senate Minority Leader Hugh Scott
of Pennsylvania and House Minority Leader John Rhodes of Arizona _
met with Nixon in the White House and told him that he could not
longer count on Republican support. The next day, Nixon announced
that he would resign.

 &HT;    Streep just acts, doesn't care for all the fuss
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA_How do you start to write about the best actress in the
world?
</P>
<P>
   It helps to take a tip from the woman herself, Meryl Streep.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband has taught me a great thing,'' she says, talking
about the jitters she gets when she's about to play a new role.
``He's an artist, and he goes into his studio every day and
confronts that space, with nothing in it. And he just says, `Start
by starting.' Now I always say that to myself: `Just start.'''
</P>
<P>
   Okay then, let's start with the resurrection.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine this: Moviegoers here have just wet a few hankies (and
shirtsleeves) watching Streep battle cancer in an early screening
of ``One True Thing,'' opening Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Ten minutes later, she strolls down the theater aisle, smiling
and very much alive. Then for a half-hour she answers questions
about the movie, based on Anna Quindlen's book and co-starring
Renee Zellweger and William Hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing Streep in public isn't a typical Meryl moment. Famously
private, she doesn't often feed the Hollywood PR machine. She
prefers staying in Connecticut with her sculptor husband, Don
Gummer, and their four kids.
</P>
<P>
   Even while promoting her new movie, she'd rather not slow things
down by posing for photographers. ``I've had more pictures taken of
me than President Clinton,'' she sighs.
</P>
<P>
   You can tell she doesn't care for all the fuss.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's first and foremost an actor and secondly a star,'' says
Pat O'Connor, who directed her in ``Dancing at Lughnasa,'' opening
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was totally intimidated,'' says ``One True Thing'' director
Carl Franklin in describing how he felt when he knew he would be
working with Streep. ``There are certain people who have a big
reputation, but when you meet them you're disappointed. They come
down to size. Meryl doesn't do that. She's a formidable presence.
... She's sweet, and she's down to earth. But she's somebody who
doesn't make mistakes. She measures up to her reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   Streep never plays Streep in her movies. She disappears: a
country factory worker (``Silkwood''), Danish writer (``Out of
Africa''), Australian mother (``A Cry in the Dark''), Polish
survivor (``Sophie's Choice'') or Italian-American housewife (``The
Bridges of Madison County'').
</P>
<P>
   When the film's producer asked Quindlen what she thought about
Streep, ``I said, `Is there more than one answer to that
question?''' the novelist recalls. ``What can you say? Each time
you look up at the screen, she was a totally different human being.
When she signed on, I told my family, and my oldest son said,
`That's so great, but do you think she can do an American
accent?''' He was convinced she was British. Quindlen had to tell
him, no, honey, she grew up in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Today, without her fabled accents or a wig, Streep almost seems
adrift just being herself. She sits for an interview here wearing a
light plum-colored suit, grayish glass beads around her neck. She
stands up again and smooths the back of her jacket, a slight
nervous adjustment. At 49, her age shows only in a few laugh lines
around her eyes. A blue vein pulses dimly in her cheek, visible
through that translucent skin. It's the sort of skin that lets
thoughts and emotions drift across it, like wind on water.
</P>
<P>
   As Streep speaks, her hands carve graceful arcs in the air.
Because she doesn't give many interviews, her replies are fresh;
there's a sense that she's discovering her own answers as they
come. None of the tired soundbites.
</P>
<P>
   And she's funny. Sometimes when she knows better.
</P>
<P>
   Like the night before. At the Q&AMP;A, she quipped that she liked
how haggard she looks in the tear-jerking finale of ``One True
Thing'' because she looks so thin.
</P>
<P>
   Today, she hides her face. ``That was so sick, I regretted that
so much. I really did.'' A pause, a smile: ``But it's true.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing the role of someone with cancer is something she knows
about. In the '70s, she nursed her lover, actor John Cazale, as he
died from bone cancer. She's seen it up close. She knows it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's holy,'' she says. ``It's really what life is about. It's
where it goes. I respect it, and I wanted to make sure they got it
right.''
</P>
<P>
   She's a little tired and anxious to get through the morning's
interviews. Flying into Atlanta the day before, her plane bumped
down through a sudden storm. Today, Hurricane Earl is creeping up
from the Gulf, and Streep wants to head out of the city as early as
she can.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a bad flyer,'' she admits. ``That's because I have four
children and I really want to be here tomorrow. Here, in the world,
alive. It's a meat-and-potatoes issue for me.''
</P>
<P>
   You may not think meat and potatoes when it comes to Streep, but
that's one of her contradictions. She can play champagne; she can
play beer. She's racked up 10 Oscar nominations (only two shy of
Katharine Hepburn's record) while raising a family (yes, she does
laundry).
</P>
<P>
   And she's a mother first, actress second. She flew home to
northwest Connecticut by helicopter after every day's shooting on
``One True Thing,'' committed to making it home for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   When visiting the set, Quindlen says, ``I talked to Renee about
the scene they were shooting. Meryl and I talked about where our
kids were going to high school.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Her main consideration was always what was needed at home,''
Franklin says. ``That's one of the things you have to take into
account, working with her. Part of what makes her a bit of an
enigma is that she is a very private person and she's not one to go
play the studio game and be glib.''
</P>
<P>
   Meryl the Mom
</P>
<P>
   Ask her about her kids, and she's a mix of pride and precaution.
Family is family. It's separate. That's why she's never let
magazines like Architectural Digest do a spread on her home. She
suddenly seems to whiff something rank. ``Oh what a nightmare! Why
would anybody want to have all these people come into their
house?''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard enough finding privacy in a house with four kids,
``For a long time, the toilet was the only place I could get by
myself. If I remembered to lock the door. I also have a little
window seat my husband built me on the back of my office. I love to
sit there.''
</P>
<P>
   People sometimes marvel at Streep's ability to combine family
life and career. She shrugs it off. ``I live the only way I can
live and stay sane. Relatively,'' she adds. ``You know?''
</P>
<P>
   So would she be glad if one of her kids decided to be an actor?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' she says, leaning in conspiratorially, ``my son was in
`Death of a Salesman' his senior year. He was Biff.'' She cuts her
voice to a whisper: ``I have to keep my voice down, because he's in
there,'' she says, pointing to the adjoining door. (Henry, 18,
accompanied her on the tour.) ``Although, you know,'' she adds,
``it's gonna be in a newspaper, (so) what am I whispering for?''
</P>
<P>
   Straightening up, she clears her throat and makes a decision.
``I'm not gonna talk about this, because he would not appreciate
it. But ...'' And here she simply mouths the words: ``He's a
wonderful actor.''
</P>
<P>
   With a mock melodramatic moan, she adds, ``I thought, `Oh, I'm a
failure as a mother.' I've been pointing them in all sorts of
interesting directions. The natural history museum: `Think about
being an anthropologist.' Or financial planning. Accounting.''
</P>
<P>
   Momdom has kept Streep off the theater stage for 16 years,
except for a two-week workshop in Seattle for friend Wendy
Wasserstein's play ``An American Daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   Streep was afraid of performing live after so long, but ``I
loved it! Oh my God, oh my God, I loved it. And I realized how much
I'd given up for my children.'' The last words come out again in a
mock-grand, wounded voice. Her youngest is only 8, so it may be 10
more years until she can try the stage again. ``I can't even say
it, but it seems to mean that, yeah,'' she says. ``They don't care
what I'm doing during the day. They just want me home at night.''
</P>
<P>
   She may be a great parent, but her own mom makes fun of her.
``My mother says, `You have raised four only children.' I have
three girls. Everything is a big drama. But it's great. They're so
interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   The two youngest girls' fave movie lately: ``Dance With Me,'' a
love story, starring Vanessa L. Williams, set in the world of
ballroom dancing. ``We're all in love with (co-star) Chayanne
now,'' Streep says. ``Big, major.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most, her kids have the don't-embarrass-me-Mom syndrome.
They hate it if Streep, a trained singer who was once slated to
play ``Evita'' on-screen, sings around the house or in the car.
</P>
<P>
   But during the interview comes the unmistakable warble of a
young man in the room next door. Her son. So the kids can sing; she
can't.
</P>
<P>
   Streep smiles ruefully. ``Therein lies the dreadful irony,
because the world is about them. Your world (as a kid) is not about
your parents, it's about you. And that's the way it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Some years back, Streep punched a photographer who was trying to
shoot one of her kids. ``I'm a public figure,'' she says. ``You can
write anything you want about me. But they are not. They should be
able to make their own mistakes, and if somebody writes about them
I will sue their pants off.''
</P>
<P>
   Okay then. Next subject:
</P>
<P>
   Meryl the Actress
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason you hire Meryl is if you want to get the best
actress in the world,'' says director O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   But good luck asking Streep the secret to her success. ``There's
not a lot of mystical conversation about the way she works,''
Franklin says. ``Her process goes on in private. There's only so
much you can explain about what she does. There's something else at
work there that may be more in the category of `gift.' It defies
explanation.''
</P>
<P>
   So nobody knows what makes Streep so good. ``Neither do I,'' she
says with a hint of bewilderment. ``I don't know how it really
works. I don't know how other people do it. I see de Niro writing
lots of things in the margins of his script, but I don't know what
he's doing.''
</P>
<P>
   She read a book by writer-director David Mamet about acting.
``But I couldn't locate myself in one page of it,'' Streep says.
``To me, it felt like surgery on the outside of your body. I
couldn't incorporate it into what I understand. It's sort of
inchoate, my process.''
</P>
<P>
   With a self-mocking grand diva voice, she repeats, ``My
process.'' And laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's magic, how actors do this,'' she continues.
``There's a little bit of craziness in it. There's a little bit of
what goes out of control ... with multiple-personality people. The
brain, the emotional, imaginative connection is very inscrutable to
me. I don't question it. But I do always feel completely daunted at
the beginning by the fact that I don't have a method.''
</P>
<P>
   So despite the Oscars and accolades, Streep can still be
surprisingly vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Making Meryl cry
</P>
<P>
   Take the shoot of ``Dancing at Lughnasa.'' Of the five actors
playing Irish sisters, three were British, only one was Irish, and
Streep was the sole American. A dialect coach was hired to monitor
their accents. And Streep remembers seeing him shake his head in
dismay while listening as she acted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a complete breakdown,'' she says. ``I cried for two
weeks _ ask Roy, my makeup man. I really had like a complete
dismantling. And it's because I don't have a method that I've
articulated for myself. So I understood how fragile my process is,
how ephemeral, that it can be stolen away by basically a lack of
confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   It makes sense to O'Connor. ``The reason Meryl is at the top of
her game (as an actor) is that great talent like that is very
sensitive.'' Even when she's not acting.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Streep felt ambushed watching ``The Truman Show,''
when she learned that the sunny actress/wife played by Laura Linney
is named ``Meryl Burbank.'' (Her own name is a combo of her first
names, Mary and Louise.)
</P>
<P>
   ``That hurt my feelings _ I mean, if I'm gonna admit things,''
she says. ``It did. It was a weird choice of a name.''
</P>
<P>
   But certainly the choice was meant as a sort of tribute to her
status. ``Meryl'' is now synonymous with ``Actress.''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, but what was it supposed to represent in that movie?'' she
asks. ``I guess it represents'' _ she switches into a saccharine,
cheerful voice _ ``perky perfection in some horrible way, which is
really not the way I feel in my skin.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all the emotional dangers of being an actor _ and
getting jibed at in somebody else's movie _ performing a scene
right, nailing it, makes it worthwhile. And Streep knows when that
happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yes, yes!'' she leans back in her chair as if reliving the
experience. ``It's just the sweetest feeling, and you feel it all
over your little self, head to toe. You know you're all done. You
can go have a doughnut now. It's why people keep going back to
acting, even if they are not making any money, the play fails, or
the movie doesn't get distributed. You do it for that hit. It's
just irresistible.''
</P>
<P>
   So how do you sum up Streep, 20 years into her career?
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a wonderful person to work with,'' O'Connor says. Then
he adds, apologetically, ``That's the guff you journalists always
have to listen to. But in this case, it's absolutely meant.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's Quindlen's take: ``What must it be like to be absolutely
the best at what you do in the whole world? You'd think she'd be a
terrible human being, but in fact she's just the best.''
</P>
<P>
   But there will always be a certain unknowability of Streep. Even
one of her brothers (she has two) has said that the Streep family
is hard to get to know.
</P>
<P>
   So here comes the stare-into-her-eyes, Barbara Walters style
question: Who is Meryl Streep?
</P>
<P>
   The actress takes a pause, and you can tell she doesn't know
whether to laugh the question off _ or be embarrassed that people
want to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm me,'' she says simply. ``People who know me don't have to
ask that. And people who don't know me are not gonna find out in a
three-minute answer.''
</P>
<P>
   And here it comes again, that what's-the-fuss, get-over-it,
I'm-just-Meryl laugh.

THE WILD, THE SUBLIME, THE REAL AND THE ARTIFICIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. _ By now, summertime adventures
are being put aside for more urbane cultural concerns, but for me
that may be difficult. In my mind, I am still trudging up a jagged
mountain path, sidestepping mule dung and negotiating slick rocks
in the late summer heat. With every turn come vistas I doubt will
be displaced in my mind by any music heard or art seen in coming
months: massive granite contusions carved by ancient glaciers;
sheer, glistening slopes of stone shining with cascades of water;
glimpses of earth's supple musculature upon which one walks
tentatively, humbly, struck dumb by its powers.
</P>
<P>
   I am more cautious than John Muir was more than a century ago
when he climbed these mountains without the benefit of marked paths
and chiseled stone steps. Muir, who founded the Sierra Club, wrote
eloquent paeans to the American wilderness, particularly to
Yosemite, where he found ``majestic operations of nature''
appearing alongside ``the frailest, most gentle and peaceful
things.''
</P>
<P>
   He suggested strapping one's mountain shoes tight and bounding
ecstatically from boulder to boulder down the slopes: ``You will
then find your feet playing a tune, and quickly discover the music
and poetry of rock-piles.''
</P>
<P>
   But I am afraid of that Siren music, and walk gingerly to a
rock's edge at the peak of Nevada Falls, vertiginously gazing down
at the rushing waters and up again at the looming rock faces,
unable to encompass in my imagination the scale of things, admiring
the beauty, shaken by the immensity. The scene's timelessness turns
time into trivia; intimations of immortality inspire hints of the
opposite.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteenth- and 19th-century philosophers called this effect the
``sublime,'' and at one time artists and musicians yearned to
imitate its powers in painting and sound. The sublime overwhelms,
bewilders, frightens, chastises and elevates. It courts one's
understanding, yet defies one's imagination.
</P>
<P>
   The sublime may not be in artistic fashion these days _ what
role can it have in a world of postmodern tastes? _ but judging
from Yosemite there is a gargantuan appetite for it. An estimated
4.5 million people are expected to visit the park this year. I
encountered several thousand when descending from the falls to
lower, more accessible terrain. Sublime it is. Solitary it isn't.
We are all migrating here for a purpose, not necessarily seeking
solitude, but yearning for something _ the wilderness sublime _
that inspires a peculiar feeling about one's humanity and its
fragile grandeur in the face of greater things.
</P>
<P>
   Religions have tapped that desire. Some of these mountains here
are even called cathedrals. In recent decades, popular culture has
begun filling the gap that art promised to fill, creating man-made
substitutes for those who can't get their dose of canyons and
cataracts. Like the natural version of the wilderness sublime,
these cultural creations _ Imax films and special-effects cinematic
spectaculars _ present images that confound the human imagination
and seem beyond human control. They alter the scale on which we
judge ourselves. They exhilarate and frighten us, amaze and humble
us and invoke great forces that we cannot fully anticipate or
control. Forget profundity and beauty; such matters are stripped
away for the sake of raw effect. So many people line up for this
artificial sensation, it might be called the commercial sublime.
</P>
<P>
   But the commercial sublime is present not only in films like
``Titanic'' and ``Armaggedon.'' It can also be found in even more
mundane incarnations, one of which I stumbled on during the same
trip that brought me to this mountain: Disneyland.
</P>
<P>
   This might seem, at first, absurd. After all, Disneyland, a
six-hour drive away, seems to be the opposite of these mountains,
not their counterpart. Instead of offering a landscape that dwarfs
the human, it offers a townscape that is dwarfed by the human. The
buildings in Disneyland are smaller than full size, compressed to
create a sense of the viewer's fairy-tale superiority.
</P>
<P>
   The medieval castle of Fantasyland is no Bavarian structure
towering over a ravine, but a scaled toy model. The amusement
park's vast ``lands'' are remarkably contained and navigable: no
immensity here.
</P>
<P>
   But this makes the impact of the attractions themselves, hidden
behind the facades, all the more powerful. I am lured onto the Big
Thunder Mountain Railroad, which looks neither big nor thunderous
nor mountainous. The cart I am in veers into the plastic landscape,
but, instead of seeing grand vistas, I twist off balance, drop
precipitously into a miniature free fall and lurch like some
drunken John Muir attempting a boulder dance. There is a moment
when it seems too much for the human system _ my bearings are lost,
I am subject to some greater force, fear sends an electric shock
through my body _ and then, just as suddenly, the moment passes
into laughter and I am ready to pay homage to those big, thunderous
and mountainous effects.
</P>
<P>
   It is an artificial version of the sense I have laboriously
climbing to the top of Nevada Falls in Yosemite, every turn
yielding gasps at the changing shapes of rock and water, fear mixed
with fascination, not just at beauty but at the wildness of it all.
In comparison, human desires are puny things. Maybe Disneyland
aspires, in part, to such a sentiment (as long as it leaves those
commercial desires intact).
</P>
<P>
   This may be why its various ``lands'' so self-consciously invoke
the wild and untamed _ Adventureland, Frontierland, Tomorrowland. A
spaceship is out of control; an explorer is lost in a cavern; a
raft crashes down a roaring waterfall. Natural forces are invoked
and imitated, and the viewer is artificially dwarfed by their
seeming immensity. It is no accident that one of the more
astonishing ``rides'' is a three-dimensional virtual-reality show
called ``Honey, I Shrunk the Audience,'' in which the viewers
actually begin to feel as if they are being carried around in a
box.
</P>
<P>
   But once these experiences end, the sublime perspectives are
inverted, and riders stumble warily into a comforting world in
which everything is even more manageable and more controlled than
in ordinary life.
</P>
<P>
   The thrill is, of course, less lasting and far less resonant
that that of Yosemite's vistas, but there are times I wonder even
about even that wilderness. We camp in a tent, 100 yards from flush
toilets and 10 yards from another store-bought domicile or
recreational van; we store our toothpaste and trail mix in metal
lockers at the campsite to protect them from the imperial appetites
of swaggering bears. And we walk on laboriously constructed paths
that permit no fatal missteps.
</P>
<P>
   Even this is perhaps an artificial wilderness, a stage set with
appropriate crowd control. One almost begins to envy Muir's
solitude, his strolls through the meadows and sequoia groves, his
easy acquaintance with nature's creatures and forces. But partly
because of his efforts on behalf of wilderness, we are at least
given this managed piece of it.
</P>
<P>
   Which is just enough to spur the appetite for more. For on the
trails, above the shuttle buses and cafeterias, again and again
comes that aching vision in which space and time become tactile
immensities. And human culture, with all its high- and low-minded
enterprise, is temporarily put in its place.

`TURANDOT' BIDS FAREWELL TO BEIJING, THE `HOME' IT AWED AND
PERPLEXED
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ After eight performances _ actually seven and
two-thirds, because one was halted by rain _ the much-anticipated
production of ``Turandot'' in an ancient temple of the Forbidden
City here closed on Sunday night to a lengthy standing ovation from
a nearly full house approaching 3,000.
</P>
<P>
   If the sumptuous costumes, lavish set and kinetic staging by the
Chinese movie director Zhang Yimou sometimes seemed to upstage the
music _ conducted by Zubin Mehta with singing by major stars _ the
thousands of opera fanatics who traveled here from Europe, the
United States and neighboring Asian countries still got what they
paid for: a grand theatrical spectacle that will be hard to match.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's beautiful,'' sighed Dr. Abdul Allam, a surgeon who came
from Switzerland with his wife, Almut Allam, president of the
Connecticut Opera in Hartford. ``The grandiosity of the temple, the
costumes _ it's just unbelievable,'' Allam said. ``And the sound is
excellent, with no echo.''
</P>
<P>
   Although few Chinese are steeped in Western opera, Zhang's
interest in the project and his goal of making the opera more
authentically Chinese was widely noted here. ``Chinese feel proud
that on their own land the Chinese culture is playing a major role
on the international stage,'' said one typical article in the
Beijing Youth Daily newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how the $15 million production had gone, Michael Ecker,
the Austrian impresario who pulled it together, said that
``artistically, it was a great success.''
</P>
<P>
   The financial story is less clear. Ecker said that 87 percent of
the seats had been sold but that corporate sponsorships, high-end
sales and donations had been lower than expected, which he blamed
on the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Ecker said that until he received an accounting from the China
Performing Arts Agency, which was a co-sponsor of the production
and controlled many tickets, he could not assess the financial
situation, which would include revenues from television and
recording rights as well as ticket sales. ``I hope we'll break
even,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The official video and compact disc of the performance will be
released on Oct. 11 by BMG Classics, Ecker said, and a film of the
production is to be shown in the United States on PBS.
</P>
<P>
   On the last night, a few scalpers were selling what they said
were $350 tickets for $50, and they had some takers among some
Westerners. The scalped tickets presumably came from the hundreds
distributed free to people in the government.
</P>
<P>
   The crowds included many Chinese who obtained free tickets and
who came out of curiosity. Many shared the view of one businessman
who attended on Sunday and said, ``I just don't understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the scenery seemed to dazzle everyone. ``Zhang
Yimou is a genius,'' said one young Chinese office manager, who
professed to not understand a single word.
</P>
<P>
   Opera fans or not, some of Beijing's more affluent inhabitants
saw ``Turandot'' as a social event not to be missed, and many
celebrities from the literary and art worlds turned out, especially
for one of the earlier shows that was reserved for Beijing
residents at reduced rates.
</P>
<P>
   In the sort of biting article rarely seen here, a popular
newspaper, Southern Weekend, wrote, ``The only ones who pretended
any interest in hearing the performance were those media types who
were mingling with the foreigners between acts.''
</P>
<P>
   The article added: ``The tickets for `Turandot' were expensive
and hard to get. And for this very reason some people just had to
go and see it, and what's more were certainly not going to buy
their own tickets. Otherwise you wouldn't be flaunting your status
and influence.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of the few Chinese reviews of the production, in the
English-language China Daily, Li Xing wrote that the performance
offered ``a busy feast for the eye,'' and that ``opera lovers had
the luxury of basking in Puccini's splendid choruses and the
resounding accompaniment of the orchestra under the brilliant
conducting of Zubin Mehta.''
</P>
<P>
   ``However, the production has not gone beyond creating a
theatrical spectacle,'' Ms. Li added, saying that the audience was
too busy watching all the scene changes and extras moving about to
``sink deep into the arias.''

MA TACKLES MOTHER OF GOD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Having recently tackled tango and bluegrass,
Yo-Yo Ma certainly wasn't resting on his laurels when he decided to
take on yet another new genre: music written for the Mother of God.
</P>
<P>
   A formidable assignment, to be sure. But that hadn't stopped
British composer John Tavener. In his 1987 piece ``The Protecting
Veil,'' Tavener had sought to explore the mysteries of the Russian
Orthodox faith while creating what he termed ``a lyrical icon in
sound rather than in wood, using the music of the cello rather than
a brush.''
</P>
<P>
   As the most iconic cellist of the jet age, Ma was the natural
choice to attempt Tavener's wrenchingly ecstatic work. The result
was a Sony Classical recording with the Baltimore Symphony
Orchestra, released this year.
</P>
<P>
   But playing the work live was a different matter, says Ma,
who'll perform ``The Protecting Veil'' with the Los Angeles Chamber
Orchestra in concert tonight at the Hollywood Bowl. Jeffrey Kahane,
the orchestra's music director, will conduct a program that also
will include Schumann's Symphony No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was actually a little scared of it at first, because it's a
brilliant piece,'' says Ma, speaking by phone from his home in
Boston. ``What I say to myself is, `Imagine you're in music class
and your teacher comes to you and says, ``OK Yo-Yo, next week I
want you to write about the Mother of God!'' &UR;  &LR; ' And I'm like, `OK!
What's wrong with him, right?!' &UR;  &LR; ''
</P>
<P>
   The spiritualistic and meditative qualities that define ``The
Protecting Veil'' have long characterized Tavener's work. Born in
1944, he first commanded attention with the dramatic cantata ``The
Whale'' followed in the late 1960s and early '70s with a number of
works influenced by Roman Catholic theology.
</P>
<P>
   Tavener's interest in metaphysical issues heated up with his
conversion to Russian Orthodoxy in 1977 at 33. ``The Protecting
Veil'' was inspired by an Orthodox feast day commemorating the
Virgin's appearance in A.D. 902 to the Greeks defending
Constantinople against the Saracen army. In the piece, the solo
cellist represents the voice of the Mother of God, a constant
reassuring presence over human affairs.
</P>
<P>
   As the liner notes to the ``The Protecting Veil'' observe,
Tavener's music has strong harmonic as well as mystical properties
_ an unusual combination for a contemporary composer. Perhaps it's
because of his ability to channel powerful, accessible, unambiguous
emotions that an excerpt of Tavener's ``Innocence'' was performed
last year at Princess Diana's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   When Ma first began exploring ``The Protecting Veil,'' he
wondered if it was going to be ``one of those New Age-y pieces'' _
more sizzle than steak.
</P>
<P>
   While so much 20th-century music has expressed itself through
``complexity and abstraction,'' Ma says, Tavener leans toward
elegant simplification that is able to evoke loss and grief,
resurrection and joy.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, simplification won Ma over.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really makes sense of it,'' Ma says of the piece. ``It's a
construction that is totally clear.'' &UR;

``TOMCAT IN LOVE'': SHELL SHOCK ON THE BATTLEFIELDS OF A MESSY LOVE
LIFE  
 (PUBLICATION NOTES AT END)  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHIKO KAKUTANI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The hero of Tim O'Brien's suffocating new novel is not only a
boor, he's also a big bore.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Tomcat in Love,'' O'Brien has left behind the battlefields
of Southeast Asia, which provided a backdrop for his earlier books
``Going After Cacciato'' (1978) and ``The Things They Carried''
(1990), two of the most powerfully imagined works to emerge from
the Vietnam War. He has instead moved to the domestic front and the
war between the sexes.
</P>
<P>
   His narrator, Thomas H. Chippering, the novel's ``tomcat in
love,'' is a Vietnam veteran who has become a professor of
linguistics at a small college. He's also an obnoxious
megalomaniac: a smug, pompous womanizer who keeps a running
tabulation of women he's been involved with. (``Names. Dates. Body
types. Complexion. Hair color. Other such vital statistical
data.'')
</P>
<P>
   Tom boasts that he's as ``virile as Secretariat,'' that he's got
an I.Q. ``well over 175'' and that women find him ``attractive
beyond words.'' He describes his latest paramour, a Mrs. Robert
Kooshof, as ``an improbable blend of Great Plains housewife and
sturdy strumpet'' who is ``busty as Nepal.'' He calls Toni, his
favorite co-ed of the moment, a ``little marshmallow.'' And he
refers to Thuy Ninh, a Vietnamese girl he had an affair with during
the war, as ``a crocodile in heat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Like any gambling junkie, the female animal wants it all,''
Tom declares in one of his many misogynistic rants, ``your purse
strings, your heart, your spirit, the very breath of your lungs.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, Tom seems like such a ridiculous parody of a male
chauvinist pig that the reader suspects that O'Brien is trying to
write a sendup of the gender wars, a sort of Fay Weldonesque satire
from the male point of view. Certainly many of the novel's central
episodes are farcical in tone: a ludicrous scene in which Tom is
spanked in front of his class by his ex-wife's brother and her new
husband; another in which he is bound and gagged by two women he
has picked up at a bar. And certainly most of the novel's
characters are cartoonish, too: bullying, macho men and catty,
calculating women; clownish figures, meant perhaps to underscore
the comic similarities between ``wartime combat and peacetime
romance,'' in Tom's words. ``Blood lust. Mortal fear. Shell shock.
Despair. Hopelessness. Entrapment. Betrayal.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is ``Tomcat in Love'' isn't the least bit funny or
insightful, and Tom is a tedious, long-winded narrator, reminiscent
of the tedious, long-winded hero of O'Brien's lugubrious 1985 novel
``The Nuclear Age.'' Forced to listen to Tom go on (and on and on
and on) about his messy love life, his feelings of paranoia and his
belief in revenge, readers gloomily realize they are trapped, for
the duration of the novel, inside Tom's overheated brain.
</P>
<P>
   It's a claustrophobic place to be. The reader quickly suspects
that Tom is as crazy as he is self-absorbed. When he's not
scribbling down the vital statistics of his most recent female
conquests, he's obsessing about his ex-wife, the former Lorna Sue
Zylstra, whom he claims is the love of his life and whom he insists
has been having an incestuous affair with her brother, Herbie.
</P>
<P>
   Tom believes that Herbie deliberately sabotaged his marriage,
and he has vowed to exact revenge on Herbie and on Lorna Sue's new
husband, a wealthy tycoon from Tampa, Fla. His plans for revenge
swiftly escalate from practical jokes designed to sow the seeds of
mistrust between Lorna Sue and her husband _ like planting purple
underwear and leg irons under the front seat of the tycoon's car _
to a declaration of all-out war. Tom starts building homemade
bombs, seven of them, in his garage. He has a ``single
thermonuclear motive,'' he says, ``to strike back at the Zylstra
clan with every kilowatt of energy I could muster.''
</P>
<P>
   What this means for the reader is lots of portentous talk about
revenge. Like: ``The word  &UR; glee &LR;  may be taking it too far, yet I
have come to discover that acts of vengeance are often accompanied
by a swollen bladder, an airy tickle at the tip of the urethra.''
And equally trying mumbo jumbo about Tom's state of mind: ``Without
up, I asked, where is down? Without hereness, how does one locate
thereness?''
</P>
<P>
   Tom explains that his ``sensitivity to people leaving'' him, his
``terror of betrayal'' and his ``lifelong propensity for exacting
vengeance'' are the result of a traumatic war experience that
involved being the butt of a monstrous practical joke: it seems his
comrades left him in the jungle to fend for himself while they went
off on a secret mission. Like most of Tom's explanations, this one
remains highly suspect. Given his avowed penchant for lying, it's
hard to tell when he's telling the truth, embroidering the truth or
simply stitching his paranoid fantasies into a tall tale.
</P>
<P>
   As Tom's madness accelerates, he dons military fatigues, darkens
his face with charcoal and starts whistling ``an old Vietnam
marching ditty'' as he heads off to exact ``payback, as in Nam.''
This behavior not only reads like a cruel parody of post-traumatic
stress syndrome, but also mocks the wonderfully nuanced delineation
of the Vietnam experience set down in ``Going After Cacciato'' and
``The Things They Carried.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the reader can only wonder at the disparity between the
power of those earlier books by O'Brien _ distinguished by their
inventive storytelling and their evocative depiction of the
visceral and emotional realities of war _ and the mangled mess that
is ``Tomcat in Love.''

RECENT CASES HIGHLIGHT RISKS OF COSMETIC SURGERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ELIZABETH FERNANDEZ and LANCE WILLIAMS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A fashion executive hired a San Francisco
cosmetic surgeon to have permanent eye-liner applied. During the
procedure, her eye was punctured by a syringe.
</P>
<P>
   A California woman, consulting a doctor about a scar on her leg,
said she was persuaded to try calf implants that would ``make her
legs look like Marilyn Monroe's.'' Three weeks later, feverish and
unable to walk, she needed emergency surgery to save her leg.
</P>
<P>
   A housewife had liposuction in the office of a doctor who was
already on state Medical Board probation for surgical negligence.
Five days later, she was dead.
</P>
<P>
   Cosmetic surgery has become the medical growth industry of the
1990s, with hundreds of thousands of baby boomers undergoing face
lifts, breast implants, liposuction and other procedures in hopes
of fending off the wrinkles and sags of aging.
</P>
<P>
   Many get what they want: a trimmer body, a refreshed appearance
_ the way they remember themselves 10 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But an investigation of cosmetic surgery in California, where it
is heavily marketed and especially popular, shows a growing number
of patients suffer disappointment and disfigurement from what often
are billed as simple, low-risk procedures.
</P>
<P>
   No government agency or professional association keeps data on
accidents involving cosmetic surgery, which can be performed by any
doctor with a medical license, regardless of specialty or training.
</P>
<P>
   But after more than 150 interviews and a review of thousands of
pages of legal records, the scope of a growing problem emerges.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, four people have died following cosmetic
surgery since 1994, three of them after liposuction, the surgical
removal of fat using a suction device.
</P>
<P>
   The Medical Board of California was so alarmed by increasing
complications from cosmetic surgery that it appointed a special
committee to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   According to the chairman of the committee, Dr. Robert del
Junco, 60 to 100 deaths occurred last year in the United States
from liposuction complications out of an estimated 110,000
procedures performed.
</P>
<P>
   ``To put this number in perspective, childbirth, once a major
killer of young women, now yields about seven maternal deaths in
about 100,000 births,'' he said during a June committee meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``This comparison illustrates how one procedure _ a cosmetic
procedure, not a lifesaving one _ appears to have an unacceptable
and, I think, certainly preventable, high mortality rate. In my 20
years in medicine, I have never seen any cosmetic procedure that
has had such a high rate of risk.''
</P>
<P>
   For every liposuction death ``I've heard ... there could
possibly be 20 near deaths,'' del Junco said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yet what is the medical community doing about this? If it were
a drug, it would have been pulled from the market,'' he said.
``Cosmetic surgery is not like heart surgery. These are healthy
people, and some are getting incredibly bad outcomes.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the outcomes:
</P>
<P>
   _ Jennifer Ha, 38, a Santa Rosa mother of four, was stricken on
the operating table during 1996 surgery in the clinic of Dr. Leslie
Moglen, a San Francisco physician already on Medical Board
probation for gross negligence in previous cosmetic surgeries.
Moglen said he was deeply saddened by the death, which he said
resulted from ``an idiosyncratic drug reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Paul Falaschi was 25, handsome, healthy, but overweight, a
personal trainer in a gym environment that stressed good looks.
Last November, he had liposuction at St. Francis Memorial Hospital:
fat removed from his abdomen, thighs, flanks, buttocks. Four days
later, he died of strep infection.
</P>
<P>
   _ Audrey Penn Rodgers, 71, of San Francisco, died of heart
failure in 1994, two days after bladder surgery by a gynecologist
and liposuction by a doctor who advertised, ``When you consider
cosmetic surgery, have it performed by a specialist.'' Three
doctors and the California-Pacific Medical Center paid a $50,000
judgment.
</P>
<P>
   _ San Francisco psychotherapist Myra Breen Ruskin, 56, underwent
a $20,000 face lift and other cosmetic procedures in August 1997,
then died in a recovery room at her doctor's Union Street clinic,
law enforcement records show.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year later, no one has been held responsible,'' said
Ruskin's son, Joshua Breen. ``Doctors are pushing beyond the
boundaries of what is medically prudent. You have a formula for
disaster. The bigger question is who is responsible for putting in
place medical standards? How many more people will have to die
before something is done?''
</P>
<P>
   _ Lisa Santoro, a former fashion consultant, went to Dr. Alan
Gaynor, a San Francisco cosmetic surgeon who has promoted his
skills by performing live procedures on television talk shows, once
doing a fat transplant from Geraldo Rivera's buttocks to his face.
</P>
<P>
   Santoro wanted permanent eyeliner tattooed into her upper and
lower lids, a procedure Gaynor had spoken of on the Geraldo show.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's perfect,'' Gaynor boasted. ``And it doesn't look like
make-up.''
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't Santoro's outcome. She said in a lawsuit that Gaynor
punctured her eye with a syringe.
</P>
<P>
   Gaynor said he was innocent of wrongdoing and settled Santoro's
lawsuit out of court. ``I am a person of conscience,'' he said,
``and I was profoundly worried for her.''
</P>
<P>
   _ In June 1992, Carmen Sandino went to cosmetic surgeon Jeffrey
Friedman to discuss having a scar removed. While there, she said, a
medical assistant said Friedman could make her legs ``look like
Marilyn Monroe's'' with calf implants. Sandino agreed to the
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   In a lawsuit, Sandino contends that Friedman had never done a
calf implant procedure before and boned up on the procedure by
watching a medical video and reviewing a textbook.
</P>
<P>
   Within days of the operation, Sandino said, she was suffering
excruciating pain. Her legs were swollen and blistered; fluid
drained from her wounds. She was hospitalized for nine days after
surgery to save the leg and off work for five months.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman denied malpractice. He said he had received seminar
training in the calf-implant procedure and had arranged for an
experienced surgeon to proctor the operation.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was settled out of court.

   ``Patients undergo cosmetic surgery assuming a high degree of
success,'' said New York cosmetic surgery consultant Wendy Lewis.
``In cosmetic surgery, the margin of error is zero. You can accept
the risk of death in a gall bladder or liver surgery, but who wants
to die from liposuction?''
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by a society fixated on youth and beauty, cosmetic
surgery is seeing unprecedented growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's beyond a boom; it's an explosion,'' San Francisco plastic
surgeon Andrew Barnett said. ``It's an amazing growth.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past five years, the nip-and-tuck industry has
flourished, with some procedures, such as liposuction and breast
augmentation, tripling from 1992 to 1997, according to the American
Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons. The number of
cosmetic surgery procedures rose 68 percent between 1992 and 1996,
the organization said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 3.3 million cosmetic treatments were performed in
1996, according to the American Academy of Cosmetic Surgery. Men
accounted for 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But in the largely unregulated cosmetic business, some
physicians are performing plastic or cosmetic surgery who received
their formal training in another specialty.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of hucksterism in this business,'' said Dr. John
Renner, president of the National Council for Reliable Health
Information. ``I know doctors who've given fanny tucks away as part
of a raffle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it a travesty that pediatricians and ER physicians and
other doctors who could not get operating privileges anywhere are
opening up offices and doing cosmetic surgery,'' said Dr. Aaron
Stone, a plastic surgeon in Los Angeles. ``This isn't the Wild West
anymore. If you don't have hospital admitting privileges, you
shouldn't be doing surgery. Period.''

WITH BOOK-TV, C-SPAN2 DEVOTES WEEKENDS TO LITERARY PURSUITS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   At first glance, TV shows about books seem like an oxymoron. But
the low-tech, intellectual book programs on C-SPAN2 have grown so
popular that the cable channel launched ``Book TV,'' devoting every
weekend to shows about books and the book industry.
</P>
<P>
   It could make for an interesting audience demographic. ``One
group will be the same people who already watch C-SPAN and
C-SPAN2,'' said Connie Brod, executive producer of ``Book TV.''
``They are already used to coming to us for subjects covered in
depth. The second group, I'm hoping, is book lovers who may not be
watching a lot of TV because they'd rather read.''
</P>
<P>
   Each weekend from 7 a.m. Saturday until 7 a.m. Monday, C-SPAN2
will air unedited interviews with authors, panel discussions,
bookstore signings, trade meetings, book conventions and
interactive chats between viewers and authors, book editors and
book publishers. (No current C-SPAN2 programming is being replaced;
there will simply be fewer repeats of previous telecasts.)
</P>
<P>
   The timing for ``Book TV'' seems right; various publishing
industry surveys suggest total book sales in 1998 may increase as
much as 8 percent to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   C-SPAN's foray into book programming began 10 years ago with
``Booknotes,'' its venerable author interview show. ``We know from
feedback that our current book programming is popular with our
viewers, though all our information is anecdotal since we've never
taken formal ratings,'' said C-SPAN spokesman Richard Fahle. ``But
everything C-SPAN and C-SPAN2 covers are issues that influence
public opinion, and books are part of that realm. Where books (on
TV) are concerned, we're a playing field of one.''
</P>
<P>
   No other network can or would devote full weekends to books,
Fahle said. ``They have to fulfill their advertisers' wishes, which
is to get the maximum number of eyes glued to their commercials.''
C-SPAN and C-SPAN2 don't face the same pressure because they are
privately funded by the cable industry; about 5 cents a month from
each TV cable customer's bill goes toward their costs.
</P>
<P>
   Initial ``Book TV'' programming leaves lots of room for
experimentation. Saturday kicked off with a one-hour rerun of
``Booknotes,'' followed by a two-hour ``Business of Books''
segment. The rest of the day's viewing included features on
children's books, historical works, another ``Booknotes'' encore
and several generic ``More Books'' slots allowing the network and
its viewers to travel between book-signings, trade shows and panel
discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday included three ``Biography'' segments and one
``Children's Books'' slot, with the rest of the day's programming
reserved for the ubiquitous ``More Books.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Book TV'' viewers, though, will have to be interested in the
nonfiction side of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``On C-SPAN and C-SPAN2, we always deal with real information,
things that have been and can be researched,'' Fahle said. ``So at
this point we have no plans to go into fiction. Larry McMurtry, for
instance, is best-known as a writer of fiction, so from that
perspective we wouldn't have him on. But as someone who is a
scholar concerning books, someone who has rare bookstores, those
are subjects with him we would definitely like to try.''
</P>
<P>
   Even programs about children's books will stick to nonfiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to focus on children's books that can be learning
tools for them,'' Brod said. ``Our first program will be about
Peter and Cheryl Barnes, a couple who write children's books
together. Their titles that we'll look at are `House Mouse, Senate
Mouse' and `Woodrow, the White House Mouse.' The books are so cute
that you just can't imagine, but they use the stories to teach
children about how the government works. `Cinderella,' now, you
won't see that on `Book TV.' ''
</P>
<P>
   One thing that doesn't concern C-SPAN2, Fahle said, is how to
fill entire weekends with book programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing we had to decide when we began looking at
`Book TV' was, Is there enough stuff out there?'' he said. ``This
isn't going to be a problem. In fact, we now think we could have
enough to fill an entire network week. Perhaps some day we'll look
at that.''

DEAD MAN WRITING: HEMINGWAY IS PATRIARCH OF POSTHUMOUS PUBLISHING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY SWINDELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Ernest Hemingway took his own life in 1961, he left behind
papers weighing half a ton, including several unpublished
manuscripts. Soon after his death, ``A Moveable Feast'' was issued,
and Papa's recollection of Paris in the 1920s was a posthumous
triumph.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequently, however, publication of the novel ``Islands in the
Stream'' compromised Papa's reputation. Still later, in 1986, the
arrival of another novel _ ``The Garden of Eden'' _ seriously
wounded it.
</P>
<P>
   We supposed we had heard the last from Ernest Hemingway. But no.
Now we're told that Scribner will publish ``Truth at First Light,''
a novel believed to contain more comedy than Papa's usual quotient,
in the summer of 1999, as part of a Hemingway centennial
celebration. The factual/fictional account follows a writer and his
wife on an African safari.
</P>
<P>
   Posthumously published novels are nothing unusual. Most authors
of high rank have a book in press when they advance to that great
literary cocktail party in the sky. Perhaps there's another in
manuscript, possibly an even older unpublished work in the trunk.
These usually see publication in the early aftermath of the
author's life, when former friends and colleagues are still saying
nice things about the deceased, however guardedly.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't often that readers wait 38 years after an author's
passing to absorb his final literary testament. And Patrick
Hemingway, the fabled author's 70-year-old son and editor of the
200,000-word manuscript, assures us that ``Truth at First Light''
will be absolutely the final published work in the Hemingway canon.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-eight years. Is that a record? Probably not, but in the
concern of high-profile authors, it surely is.
</P>
<P>
   When Herman Melville died in 1891, aged 72, he had published no
prose works after his 40th year. Disillusioned by critical
response, the author of ``Moby Dick'' abandoned fiction in favor of
poetry. But in his last few years, Melville worked intermittently
on the maritime novel ``Billy Budd, Foretopman.''
</P>
<P>
   For many years afterward, the completed ``Billy Budd''
manuscript languished undisturbed among the late author's papers.
</P>
<P>
   During the early 20th century, there was little interest in
Melville. However, a literary revolution was trumpeted in the years
immediately after World War I by a new wave of critics _ H.L.
Mencken, Lewis Mumford, Charles Baldwin, Edmund Wilson, Thomas Beer
_ who discovered Sinclair Lewis, Scott Fitzgerald and yes, Ernest
Hemingway; and who rediscovered Stephen Crane, Frank Norris and
yes, Herman Melville.
</P>
<P>
   Published in 1924, all of 33 years after its author's death,
``Billy Budd'' is today regarded as one of Herman Melville's major
works.
</P>
<P>
   So, too, is ``The Mysterious Stranger'' considered an important
entry in the Mark Twain ledger. When Sam Clemens died in 1910,
``The Mysterious Stranger'' existed as a story in several
manuscript drafts that were markedly different from one another. As
a philosophical parable showing the pessimism of Clemens'/Twain's
later years, it incited curiosity and mild interest upon finally
seeing print in 1916.
</P>
<P>
   Later, it was determined that Albert Bigelow Paine, executor of
the Clemens estate as well as Sam's official biographer, had
fashioned ``The Mysterious Stranger'' from three drafts, taking
parts from each, with the result that the published version was
more Paine than Twain. The original ``final'' draft as Sam Clemens
wrote it appeared at last in 1969, and has passed every test of
scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   So in a way of thinking, Sam Clemens still has Hemingway beaten
by 21 years in the game of posthumous publishing.
</P>
<P>
   What remains is to find a lost Poe or Hawthorne manuscript;
better yet, a complete novel by Charles Dickens, about which no one
knew anything. The divine quest is to find a literary equivalent to
Schubert's Unfinished Symphony.
</P>
<P>
   Might it be Ernest Hemingway's ``Truth at First Light?'' That
would be a stretch, because Papa, living or dead, has ever been too
much with us. In any event, we must wait and see, as we anticipate
the literary event of 1999.

MALDEN MILLS TO CLOSE MAINE PLANT, MOVING 200 JOBS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Malden Mills Industries Inc. says it must close a plant in
Bridgton, Maine, and move its operations and 200 jobs to Malden's
facility in Lawrence, Mass., to survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a very difficult decision, one I didn't expect to
have to make,'' said Malden Mills chief executive Aaron Feuerstein,
who added, ``We would not make this move unless we felt it
absolutely necessary to ensure the long-term health of our
business.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bridgton knitting mill is one of the largest employers in a
town about 40 miles northwest of Portland. The move to close the
mill by December stunned a community with about 4,500 residents,
said Town Manager Ronnie Belanger.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a total surprise,'' Belanger said.
</P>
<P>
   Malden Mills ``repeatedly gave assurances to our local paper
that the plant wouldn't be shutting down,'' said Brenda Ridlon,
president of the Bridgton Lakes Region Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three years ago, the Lawrence headquarters facilities for
Malden Mills were devastated by fire. As part of heroic rebuilding
efforts, Malden Mills has shifted gears, focusing more on selling
fabrics to apparel makers and away from making fabrics that
furniture companies use for upholstery.
</P>
<P>
   That shift is one reason why the Bridgton plant must be closed
after being part of the Malden Mills family for about 35 years _
and one reason why the total work force for Malden Mills has
dropped from about 3,000 workers before the fire to about 2,000
today, said Malden Mills spokesman Jeff Bowman.
</P>
<P>
   As it focuses more on apparel, Malden Mills must be able to
react quickly to fashion trends, and a need to be nimble led to the
decision to consolidate operations in Lawrence, Bowman said.
</P>
<P>
   Thread is brought to Lawrence, then trucked 130 miles to
Bridgton, a town far from major highways, for one step of a process
that turns thread into fabric, he said. Later steps, including
dyeing and finishing, take place in Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   By bringing all steps of the process to Lawrence, Malden Mills
can cut costs and be more efficient, Bowman said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the distance, few Bridgton workers are likely to move
to Lawrence; workers on the job for more than three years will get
a week's worth of severance pay for each year of service. Workers
make an average of about $13 to $14 per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Because last year's mild winter reduced the demand for warm
clothing, the apparel division of Malden Mills sold about $250
million worth of fabric last year, somewhat below expectations.
</P>
<P>
   A private company, Malden Mills does not disclose revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to shut the Bridgton mill is another blow for
Maine's rural towns. Once these towns thrived, thanks to tanneries,
paper mills, and shoe factories, said Charles Colgan, a professor
at the University of Southern Maine's Muskie School of Public
Service.
</P>
<P>
   Now Maine's rural manufacturing sector ``is the most vulnerable
part of the economy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While rural areas are losing manufacturing jobs, southern and
coastal counties are gaining service jobs, said Dana Evans, an
analyst for the Maine Labor Department. In July, the state's
seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 4.5 percent, he said.

 Includes a color slide of David Hyde Pierce in a scene from
``Frasier.'' 
 By CHRISTOPHER LOUDON  
 c.1998 Canadian TV Guide  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arriving for a late-night interview at Montreal's trendy
L'Express bistro in chinos, creased button-down shirt and
wire-rimmed glasses, David Hyde Pierce _ winner of a 1998 Emmy
Award as Best Supporting Actor in a comedy _ looks every inch the
well-bred, well-educated, slightly rumpled preppie.
</P>
<P>
   Which actually isn't surprising, because that's exactly what the
39-year-old Yale graduate is.
</P>
<P>
   Don't confuse him with his television alter-ego, natty, neurotic
Niles Crane, though. Told that there will be a 15-minute wait for
his reserved table, Pierce doesn't fly into a Nilesian priggish
snit. Instead, he's content to stand patiently by the bar.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually settling into a corner table, Pierce seems remarkably
unperturbed by the fact that the entire restaurant is trying hard
not to stare at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get used to it,'' he says with a good-natured shrug. ``It
happens enough that you don't really notice it any more, unless
it's really obvious or silly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at my hotel eating breakfast the other day, sitting by
myself at a little table,'' he recalls. ``Right next to me was a
group of about 16 kids, and I could hear them loudly whispering to
one another, `Is that him? It looks like him. Could it be him? It
might be him.' Finally I turned to them and said, `Yes, it's him.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Another time I was chased through a chateau in the Loire
Valley by a bunch of American high-school girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am, by nature, a fairly shy person,'' the Canadian-born
actor continues, ``and one of the things I had to learn was, when
you're on a popular show and people feel they know you, what used
to pass for shyness can be perceived as rude.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do feel more vulnerable, but people are always nice,'' he
admits. ``Nobody ever comes up and throws food on me and says the
show is crap.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's strange, though,'' he adds after a moment, ``is that
there's a whole genre of people who come up to you and say, `Hey,
are you that guy on ``Frasier?''' I say, `Yes,' and they say, `I
never watch it.' I've never understood the psychology of that.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been a busy off-season for Pierce, who spent most of his
hiatus in Quebec, Canada, filming the feature film ``Isn't She
Great.'' The loosely-based-on-fact movie stars comedy heavyweights
Bette Midler and Nathan Lane as ``Valley of the Dolls'' author
Jacqueline Susann and her husband, Irving Mansfield.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce appears as Susann's editor, a rather Niles-like
character.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm playing a kind of WASPy, fairly well-off Connecticut guy,
which is not that far from Niles,'' he admits. ``But it was such a
good part and such a good script that it was never a question.
</P>
<P>
   ``The curse of being on `Frasier' is the challenge of finding
writing that's that good in any other medium,'' the actor adds.
``I've been looking at scripts for two years, then this came along.
It's a terrific script, written by Paul Rudnick (author of 1996's
`Jeffrey' and 1997's `In &AMP; Out'). It's like an incredible marriage
of his obvious comic ability and a very serious side that I think
he handles tremendously well.''
</P>
<P>
   Working with larger-than-life performers such as Midler and Lane
was a memorable experience, Pierce reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just funereal,'' he says with his trademark deadpan. ``No,
really, it's great. And the thing that makes it great is that
they're both so good. People can be a hoot on the set, but if
they're not good to work with, that tires really quickly. These two
are both such pros ... They're really very different people, but
they work off each other beautifully.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't She Great'' also offered Pierce the chance to act with
one of his comic heroes, John Cleese, who plays his boss in the
film.
</P>
<P>
   ``That tipped it for me,'' he says. ``When people ask who
influenced me, I always say John Cleese. Also, Bob Newhart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only realized this recently,'' Pierce adds. ``I had a
flashback of when I was growing up, and remembered watching `Monty
Python' and `The Bob Newhart Show' and laughing hysterically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alec Guinness was also a role model of mine, because he has
that quality of doing the most with the least, with the smallest
gesture,'' he says. ``That's my taste in acting, and both John
Cleese and Bob Newhart are masters of that.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, ``Frasier'' shifts into the coveted Thursdays-at-9:00
time slot previous occupied by ``Seinfeld.'' Star Kelsey Grammer
reportedly lobbied hard for the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kelsey had personal reasons for wanting it,'' Pierce says,
``because of all those years that `Cheers' was on Thursday night,
and it felt like home to him. The rest of us said, `We have a good
show. It will be a good show on Tuesday night, it will be a good
show on Thursday night.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, it's nice to be acknowledged,'' he admits. ``You feel
like NBC is saying, ```Seinfeld'' was our prime show, and now this
is our prime show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Frasier,'' which recently was awarded its fifth straight Emmy
as Best Comedy, ended the 1997/98 season with a bang, as Frasier
and his colleagues were fired from their radio jobs. The new season
will find them seeking new jobs, Pierce says, offering fertile
comic ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point in the show, I think it's a really smart and
organic way to throw something new into the mix,'' he says. ``It
certainly didn't feel like a gimmick, and I think people will love
watching Kelsey try other jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The might-be relationship between Niles and Daphne will be
developed further, Pierce notes, but that doesn't mean that we've
heard the last of Niles' never-seen ex, Maris.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will always be a Maris,'' he says, ``because she is such
a great character. In fact, I think NBC should give her a spin-off
show _ in which she never appears.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierce's closest friendship among the cast is with Grammer, his
brother on the show. On the surface, the zany, bigger-than-life
Grammer and the calmer, more reactive Pierce could hardly be
different, but Pierce says there's more to both men than meets the
eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surprisingly, we're a lot alike,'' he says. ``We don't tend to
do the same things, and if we weren't on the same show it's
unlikely that we'd run into each other socially. The show is the
thing that brought us together, and there's a very strange
transference that happens in playing brothers. We just respond to
one another in a very deep way.''
</P>
<P>
   The cast of ``Frasier'' is, on the whole, a warm, friendly
bunch, Pierce says. But he cautions that a friendly on-the-set
atmosphere, while pleasant, is not a prerequisite for a successful
show.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have to choose between working with nice people or
talented people,'' he explains, ``you have to choose the talented
people, because that's what makes the show good.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've fallen into a situation where everyone on the show is so
generous and so good at what they do. That's when you know you've
won the lottery.''

DENNIS FARINA'S `BUDDY' SYSTEM

entertainment package.)

 Includes a color slide of Dennis Farina in a scene from ``Buddy
Faro.'' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    The face rings a bell.
 &HT;    Let Dennis Farina walk down the street and, inevitably, people
stop to chat with the actor or nod a silent hello. They can't all
place the name, but that craggy, tough-guy mug is hard to forget.
 &HT;    ``Some people see me and say, `How's the nose?,' meaning they
saw `Get Shorty' (1995),'' Farina says, laughing. ``Some people who
know their TV recognize me for `Crime Story,' but a lot of people
just think they recognize me from something they think I did,
because I have played a lot of tough guys.
 &HT;    ``I don't know what it is,'' he concludes. ``I have that look,
that persona, I guess.''
 &HT;    The latest vehicle for that persona is ``Buddy Faro,'' an
offbeat series debuting Sept. 25 on CBS. The actor plays the title
character, a legendary private eye _ he had a way with a quip as
well as with the ladies _ who disappeared without a trace in the
1970s.
 &HT;    After by-the-book gumshoe Bob Jones (Frank Whaley) tracks him
down, the drunken, grubby Faro spiffs himself up and teams with
Jones to crack tough cases.
 &HT;    ``Buddy lived his life a certain way in the 1970s, and now he
has a chance to do it all over again,'' the soft-spoken, modest
Farina says by telephone from Los Angeles during a break from
taping ``Faro.'' ``So what if the times have changed?''
 &HT;    It's a little bit ``Austin Powers,'' a little bit
``Moonlighting,'' a little bit ``Maltese Falcon.'' And a whole lot
unusual.
 &HT;    ``It's a different show from anything else out there, and that's
what interested me,'' Farina says. ``I really didn't care to do
just another TV show.
 &HT;    ``The quirkiness of it and the quirkiness of the characters
appealed to me,'' he adds, ``and I liked that it wasn't a straight
drama or a straight comedy. It's a little bit like life in that
way, in that you're not always in a dramatic situation or a funny
situation.
 &HT;    ``In our everyday experiences, most of us experience a little
bit of both.''
 &HT;    The show's quirkiness manifests itself in several ways. Jumpy
cameras and nifty editing supply a sleek veneer, while zippy music
enhances the mood.
 &HT;    Then there's the often-bohemian banter, the distinctive
character eccentricities. In an unexpected sort of way, it's all
pretty much what you'd expect from ``Faro'' head honcho Mark Frost,
who co-created the peerlessly odd ``Twin Peaks,'' and co-executive
producer Charles Haid, who directed the pilot.
 &HT;    ``I was aware of Frank Whaley and Allison Smith (who plays a
neophyte private eye) and Charlie, but knowing that Mark would be
around to talk to, to work with on the scripts, made all the
difference,'' says Farina, who also serves as co-executive producer
of the show. ``Mark listens to everyone, cuts through the minutiae
and says, `OK, this is what I think we should do.' His involvement
was actually what convinced me to do the show.''
 &HT;    That ``Buddy Faro'' would be a television series was by no means
carved in stone.
 &HT;    ``When the whole thing started, I asked that we do `Faro' as a
movie,'' the actor recalls, ``but Mark didn't want to and his deal
with CBS didn't allow him to do that.
 &HT;    ``Then I suggested we do it as a `Columbo'-like series of TV
movies, but TV people aren't interested in that anymore,'' he adds.
``So we're at the pilot and 12 episodes. Hopefully, the American
public will think Buddy's as interesting as I do.
 &HT;    ``I love fish-out-of-water stories, and Buddy's a very big fish
out of water.''
 &HT;    Farina debated long and hard before committing to ``Faro.''
After all, his movie career has been blooming of late. He starred
with Bette Midler in Carl Reiner's ``That Old Feeling,'' and also
logged supporting roles in this summer's ``Out of Sight'' and
``Saving Private Ryan.''
 &HT;    ``I weighed everything, believe me,'' Farina says. ``After a lot
of thinking and a lot of business meetings it came down to me
asking myself, `Do I want to do this or do I want to see someone
else doing it?'
 &HT;    ``If I said no, I might have wound up saying, `Gee, I wish I'd
done that,''' the actor says. ``Now we'll see what happens. If it
all falls apart, fine _ at least I won't feel I missed an
opportunity.''
 &HT;    Farina has always made the most of his opportunities. ``Thief''
(1981) marked the former policeman's big-screen debut, and he first
generated serious buzz with the acclaimed but short-lived series
``Crime Story.''
 &HT;    Subsequent credits include several plays in his native Chicago,
among them the Steppenwolf Theatre production of ``A Prayer for My
Daughter,'' directed by John Malkovich, and such films as
``Manhunter'' (1986), ``Midnight Run'' (1988), ``Another Stakeout''
(1993) and ``Eddie'' (1996).
 &HT;    ``I act because I enjoy doing it, but I also like to
entertain,'' says Farina, a 55-year-old, divorced father of three.
``I don't seek to convey a message to anyone.
 &HT;    ``The work I've done I did because I liked the role, the work,
the people,'' he says. ``I love `Thief' because it's the first
thing I ever did, and `That Old Feeling' because I got to do a
comedy and work with Bette Midler and Carl Reiner.''
 &HT;    His small role as an officer in Steven Spielberg's summer hit
was a great personal satisfaction, Farina says.
 &HT;    ``I was proud to be even the tiniest part of `Saving Private
Ryan,''' he explains. ``That is an important film, and it will be
watched for a long time.''
 &HT;    Farina laughs.
 &HT;    ```Buddy Faro' won't change the world for anybody, but it may
entertain you for an hour every Friday night,'' he says. ``That's
the reason, I think, that they started making TV shows and movies.
 &HT;    ``I know it's important to inform and educate, but entertaining
is important, too.''
 &HT;    Between finishing the ``Faro'' pilot and launching into
production on the first dozen episodes, Farina squeezed in ``The
Mod Squad,'' an upcoming film version of the hip 1960s television
series. He plays the police captain who assembles a trio of young
delinquents _ among them Claire Danes _ to operate as undercover
cops for the LAPD.
 &HT;    ``I'd never watched the show, but the script for the movie was
good,'' Farina says. ``They've got the squad going into the clubs
these kids today like. You need a kid to go into these places
undercover, because I'd certainly be too old to do it.
 &HT;    ``It's a nice-size role, and it kind of sets up everything else
that happens.''
 &HT;    Though he's shared the screen with some of Hollywood's biggest
names, Farina doesn't pine for the upper reaches of stardom. He'd
rather share the screen with Travolta, De Niro, Clooney or Hanks
than be any one of them.
 &HT;    ``I accept being considered a character actor,'' Farina says.
``I have no problem at all being known as that.
 &HT;    ``I'm pretty happy where I'm at,'' he concludes. ``I never had a
grand scheme about where I wanted to be. I never said, `If I'm not
doing this or that by the time I'm 55, I'm out of here.'
 &HT;    ``I've just taken things as they've come my way and,
fortunately, they keep coming.''

PROCOL HARUM'S GARY BROOKER ROCKS ON

 Includes a color slide of musician Gary Brooker 
 By TITO DAVILA  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    They'd just buried the Czar, and Gary Brooker was in Russia
looking for bones.
 &HT;    No, he wasn't grave-robbing. The singer and pianist, who
``skipped the light fandango'' in the 1960s gothic-rock anthem ``A
Whiter Shade of Pale,'' was taking the occasion of a Russian tour
with Beatles legend Ringo Starr to look for old bootleg records,
made on old, glued-together X-rays and known, with typical Soviet
black humor, as ``bones.''
 &HT;    ``I was trying to get ahold of some `bones,' but I didn't find
any,'' Brooker says. ``They would use it as if it was vinyl and
made a pirate recording, but you could usually see the X-ray
picture through it, somebody's chest or something.''
 &HT;    It was through ``bones,'' the musician adds, that many fans in
the old Soviet Union first heard such forbidden, ``imperialist''
tunes as ``Conquistador,'' ``Whiskey Train'' and ``A Salty Dog,''
all originally recorded by Procol Harum, Brooker's band in the
1960s and 1970s.
 &HT;    Brooker visited Russia in late August as a member of Starr's
latest incarnation of his All-Starr Band, featuring former Cream
member Jack Bruce on bass and Peter Frampton on guitar. The tour's
stops included Finland, Switzerland, Denmark, Germany, Belgium,
England, Ireland, Luxembourg and Portugal, as well as Monte Carlo,
where Brooker agreed to a telephone interview from his hotel room.
 &HT;    Looking back on Russia, which the band left just as its
financial crisis crystallized, the musician most recalls runaway
prices and a bad experience with Russian trains.
 &HT;    ``We were on the Red Arrow from Moscow to St. Petersburg, a
long-distance train,'' he says. ``I should think it was last
cleaned in 1947.''
 &HT;    Trains matter to Brooker, who patterned his autobiographical
``Last Train to Niagara'' on an imaginary long-distance rail
journey. Even his sea epic ``A Salty Dog,'' was surprisingly
inspired by train travel.
 &HT;    But ``Whiter Shade,'' his biggest hit, was inspired by something
even more unlikely _ Bach's ``Air on the G String,'' which Brooker
heard played on a Hamlet Cigars television commercial.
 &HT;    The 1967 song, which combined classical and rock music, double
keyboards, Keith Reid's far-out lyrics and Brooker's soulful voice,
was Procol Harum's first recording. It immediately climbed to the
top of the charts, and has remained one of rock's most enduring and
memorable songs, featured in movies such as ``The Big Chill''
(1983) and ``The Commitments'' (1991), and covered by artists
ranging from Sammy Hagar to Annie Lennox.
 &HT;    Brooker, however, has reservations about the song's appeal to
other artists.
 &HT;    ``Normally a song like that would have been covered a million
times by everybody from Liza Minnelli to Julio Iglesias,'' he says.
``It's not that simple in its content. I think you've got to put it
across with a bit of conviction, otherwise you'll sound silly.
 &HT;    ``Annie Lennox sang it like she meant it,'' he adds. ``You
believed her. If you don't put those words across just right,
people won't believe it.''
 &HT;    Now in his 50s, Brooker enjoys a private life that is in sharp
contrast to his hard-rocking onstage career. He and his wife,
Franky, celebrated their 30th anniversary in July _ no small
accomplishment for one in Brooker's line of work.
 &HT;    The musician has a simple formula for a successful marriage, he
says: ``Pick the right woman. Pick the right man.''
 &HT;    After the Starr tour, he's scheduled for an October trip through
Europe with ex-Rolling Stone Bill Wyman's band, the Rhythm Kings.
The ensemble will include Georgie Fame, Albert Lee and Frampton,
and they'll make stops in Germany, Denmark, Sweden and Norway.
 &HT;    Brooker's friendships with Starr and Wyman date back to the
1960s _ he played at Wyman's wedding _ and he insists that the
veteran stars are still capable of putting on a dynamic show.
 &HT;    ``This is not like a revival show _ we are going over old ground
in a new way,'' he says. ``They play my songs really well and it's
good playing Cream songs, Frampton and Bad Company and a couple of
Beatles tunes,''
 &HT;    Brooker, who traces his R&AMP;B roots to Ray Charles and Jerry Lee
Lewis, isn't afraid to team with rock icons: Since Procol Harum
disbanded in 1977 _ since 1991, the group has reformed periodically
to produce two CDs and several tours _ he's also played with George
Harrison and Eric Clapton, providing backup vocals and piano for
Clapton's music for Martin Scorsese's ``The Color of Money'' (1986)
and touring extensively with his band.
 &HT;    He even helped the legendary guitarist master a new set of
strings.
 &HT;    ``I said, `Come out with me one day when I go fly fishing,'''
says Brooker, himself a European Open fly-fishing champion. ``He
liked it and I showed him how to do it _ he is a very quick
learner, and he became proficient pretty quickly and had a natural
feel for it.''
 &HT;    Brooker's main offstage focus, of late, has been a crusade to
save his neighborhood church in England. It's a surprising twist
for the singer, whose songs have often had an anti-clerical tone:
One denounced ``religious leaders teaching hate,'' while another
scorned preachers who ``don't know what they're teaching.''
 &HT;    Nevertheless, in 1996 Brooker came to the aid of the
13th-century St. Mary &AMP; All Saints Church, located in Surrey, a
bucolic suburb south of London. It was scheduled to close, he
learned, because of a budget crunch on the national level.
 &HT;    ``The main reason was that the Church of England invested
heavily in the stock market, and their coffers were emptied because
of losses on the market,'' he says, ``and they were going to take
away our local vicar.
 &HT;    ``So I said perhaps we could do a little concert in the village
hall,'' he recalls. ``They held me to my word, and we ended up
doing it in the church.''
 &HT;    The performance featured Brooker's vocals and piano leading a
rock band, backed by a chorus and string quartet. ``A Whiter Shade
of Pale'' came into its own when played on the church's organ. The
performance was recorded and issued on a CD as ``Within Our
House,'' and the hastily assembled recording has generated a steady
stream of funds to help keep the church open.
 &HT;    It was another spur-of-the-moment recording, on a chilly
Canadian November evening, which yielded Procol Harum's greatest
success. Brooker recorded the band's performance with the Edmonton
Symphony Orchestra, producing its only gold album. The biggest hit
was a remake of an earlier tune, ``Conquistador,'' which tells the
tale of a historical figure who came to conquer but only died.
 &HT;    The song, originally a forgettable track on Procol Harum's debut
album in 1967, was rearranged for orchestra at the last minute
because, Brooker says, ``we needed another fast one.''
 &HT;    Procol Harum continued to produce critically praised albums, and
even hit the European charts with a single called ``Pandora's Box''
in 1975. But it was never quite to break through as a top-rank
band.
 &HT;    Brooker can't help wondering if the band may have sealed its
fate in 1969, when it passed on a chance to play at the Woodstock
Music Festival.
 &HT;    ``They really wanted us at Woodstock, they pleaded with us,''
Brooker recalls. ``But we were just coming to the end of a long
tour, and one of the reasons we were going back to England was that
the wife of (guitarist) Robin Trower was going to have a baby, and
we were going to be there in time for that birth. So we said, `No
thanks, we are going home.'
 &HT;    ``The baby, of course, was two weeks late,'' he adds with a
chuckle. ``It would have helped us a lot if we had been at
Woodstock, but that's the way the dice fall.''

THE UNLIMITED POTENTIAL OF MONICA POTTER

entertainment package.)

 Includes a color slide of Monica Potter in a scene from ``Without
Limits.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    They tell Monica Potter she looks like Julia Roberts, but so
what?
 &HT;    ``Not that I would mind that a bit,'' Potter says. ``They do
tell me I look like Julia Roberts' blonde sister. I get Juliette
Lewis, too.''
 &HT;    Someday soon, though, people may be telling Lewis _ or even
Roberts _ that she looks like Monica Potter, because as she settles
in for an interview at the Los Angeles Hilton, wearing a simple
blue dress with her long blonde hair loose and tumbling across her
shoulders, the 26-year-old Potter is enjoying her status as one of
Hollywood's current rising stars.
 &HT;    Her appeal will be tested on Sept. 25, when she hits screens in
``Without Limits,'' a biopic of the late Olympic runner Steve
Prefontaine (Billy Crudup).
 &HT;    ``I play his girlfriend, Mary,'' Potter says. ``She's a real
person, which was a unique way for me to explore a role. I got to
spend a lot of time with the real Mary. She told me a lot of
stories about Steve and his drive to win. That helped me flesh out
the character.''
 &HT;    Produced by Tom Cruise and directed by Robert Towne, director of
``Personal Best'' (1982), ``Without Limits'' was filmed two years
ago, but delayed to distance it from Disney's ``Pre,'' a
Prefontaine biography which flopped in 1997.
 &HT;    In the meantime, Potter had made another film, gaining good
notices as Nicolas Cage's wife in 1997's ``Con Air.''
 &HT;    ``I saw `Con Air' with an audience,'' she recalls. ``It was an
out-of-body experience for me, because you really don't believe
you're up there. Afterwards someone recognized me and said, `Really
nice job.' That meant so much to me.''
 &HT;    So ``Without Limits'' is technically Potter's second film,
though it was made first. There's more to come, though: She plays
Robin Williams' love interest in ``Patch Adams,'' due in December,
and then will star in ``Martha Meet Frank, Daniel and Lawrence,'' a
romantic comedy with equally hot newcomers Joseph Fiennes _ Ralph's
brother _ and Rufus Sewell.
 &HT;    Add it all up, and Potter just might be the ingenue du jour.
 &HT;    ``This stardom idea is just starting to hit me,'' she says.
``I'd be thrilled to sign an autograph.''
 &HT;    She'd expected ``Without Limits'' to be her big break, but as it
turned out it was ``Con Air'' that got her bandwagon rolling.
 &HT;    ``I didn't think that movie would be a huge career boost,'' the
actress recalls. ``I just thought I would have a few weeks on the
film, and I would make my SAG rate and be able to pay off some
insurance.''
 &HT;    Instead, she says, she benefited from producer Jerry
Bruckheimer's eye for a hit. The film was an unexpected smash, and
suddenly Potter's agent started getting calls.
 &HT;    ``The thing about my agent is that she believed in me from day
one. She would send me to audition for things that Cameron Diaz was
getting or Gwyneth Paltrow might do,'' she recalls. ``She always
treated me like one of the girls who was doing very well. I never
felt like I couldn't do the big movies. I was told, `It's just a
matter of time.'''
 &HT;    Most actors have Hollywood horror stories, but not Potter.
 &HT;    ``I might be completely naive _ I'm from Cleveland,'' she says.
``But the truth of the matter is that people have been very nice to
me.''
 &HT;    Not that she hasn't had to work for her success. Potter has been
acting since age 5, in fact, having made her not-so-professional
debut in her parent's bedroom.
 &HT;    ``My Dad would tell me, `Pretend to be a sandwich,''' she
recalls, giggling. ``My three sisters and I would make ourselves
into human sandwiches with the pillows in my parents room.''
 &HT;    She laughs.
 &HT;    ``I know this is so bizarre _ just stick with me here,'' she
begs. ``My dad would put me between the pillows and I would act out
being peanut butter. I guess I was good at it, because my dad would
say, `You're going to be a movie star.'
 &HT;    ``I would always imagine that I was an actress,'' Potter adds.
``As a little girl, when I would wave to people, I would do it like
I was at the Oscars.''
 &HT;    Her destiny became manifest when she started acting in
Cleveland, doing commercials at age 12. She studied at the
prestigious Cleveland Playhouse, and then after high school logged
time in Chicago, Miami and Los Angeles trying to break into the
business.
 &HT;    ``I would take any job,'' Potter says. ``I did a children's
pilot for a game show. I hope nobody ever sees it.
 &HT;    ``I can see `Hard Copy' bringing it out,'' she adds, wincing.
 &HT;    Potter settled in Los Angeles in 1994 during a stint on the soap
opera ``The Young and the Restless.'' She was on the verge of
giving up show business, she admits, thinking that her real break
would never come.
 &HT;    ``I always thought I would like to study psychology, because I
think it's needed in this town,'' she says, laughing. ``I've always
been interested in why people are so weird, and there are a lot of
case studies in Hollywood.''
 &HT;    The idea of quitting at 22 would seem impossible to many
career-obsessed performers, but Potter's life has never revolved
exclusively around acting.
 &HT;    Currently, her highest priority is her two young children. She
and her husband, who is in the construction business, live in Los
Angeles _ though she is reluctant to say anything more about her
family, including the children's names or ages.
 &HT;    ``I don't want to say because I'm worried about security,'' she
says.
 &HT;    Some warned her that marriage and kids weren't compatible with a
Hollywood career, and urged her to keep it quiet.
 &HT;    ``At first,'' she recalls, ``everyone said, `Don't say anything
about being married. You're an ingenue!'''
 &HT;    She shrugs.
 &HT;    ``You know what? This is who I am,'' she says defiantly. ``If
people don't like it, they can lump it. Then they can take it down
the street and dump it. I don't care.
 &HT;    ``I learned that little line from my dad,'' she adds with a
chuckle, ``and it comes in really handy.''
 &HT;    Stardom may place further stress on her family life. Potter
isn't sure, but she's ready for the test.
 &HT;    ``Journalists ask me how this work will affect my personal
life,'' the actress says. ``My response is that you can only take
one day at a time, as they say.
 &HT;    ``I've been married for seven years,'' she adds, ``and my
husband is the most supportive person in the world next to my
father, so I'm not worried.
 &HT;    ``Anyway, who knows what will happen in a lifetime? Only God
knows. I think, as a couple, you just have to work together.
 &HT;    ``My family is what keeps me grounded,'' Potter concludes. ``A
lot of people in this business lose their personal life, and I hope
I never do.''
 &HT;    Even if it means giving up her shot at being the next Julia
Roberts.
 &HT;    ``It's not a bad thing to be compared to Julia,'' she says,
flashing a Julia-esque smile. ``I think she's fantastic. The
comparison might even help at this stage of my career, but once
people get to know me they'll see that I'm different.
 &HT;    ``I would love to play her little sister in a movie,'' Potter
adds. ``I could dye my hair brown or she could dye her hair blonde.
Either way, it would work.''
 &HT;    The truth is, Potter would rather be the next Carole Lombard.
 &HT;    ``I love the older actresses,'' she says. ``I love old-time
Hollywood. Those women were so beautiful and classy.
 &HT;    ``I would die if they said, `She's the next Grace Kelly.'''

   &UR; PHYSICS SAVES LIVES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Author Unknown: As a premed student at Washington University in
St. Louis, I had to take a difficult class in physics. One day our
professor was discussing a particularly complicated concept. A
student rudely interrupted to ask `Why do we have to learn this
stuff?`
</P>
<P>
   `To save lives.` the professor responded quickly and continued
the lecture.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, the same student spoke up again. `So how
does physics save lives?` he persisted.
</P>
<P>
   `It keeps the ignoramuses out of medical school,` replied the
professor.

   &UR; The Fortune Teller &LR;
</P>
<P>
   During a recent publicity outing, Hillary sneaked off to visit a
fortune teller of some local repute. In a dark and hazy room,
peering into a crystal ball, the mystic delivered grave news.
</P>
<P>
   `There's no easy way to say this, so I'll just be blunt: Prepare
yourself to be a widow. Your husband will die a violent and
horrible death this year.`
</P>
<P>
   Visibly shaken, Hillary stared at the woman's lined face, then
at the single flickering candle, then down at her hands. She took a
few deep breaths to compose herself. She simply had to know. She
met the fortune teller's gaze, steadied her voice, and asked her
question.
</P>
<P>
   `Will I be acquitted?`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Gift Giver &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A young couple got married and went away on their honeymoon.
After 2 weeks they came back and finally put away all of the
presents they received from friends and family. Since this was a
new home, the process took sometime. The silver went into the
closet, items were put on the walls for display and some of the
more intimate apparel was put in the bedroom drawers.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, they received in the mail two tickets for a
popular show where tickets were impossible to get. They were very
excited and warmed by the gesture of the person who sent this.
Inside the envelope, however, was only a small piece of paper with
a single line.
</P>
<P>
   `Guess who sent them.`
</P>
<P>
   The pair had much fun trying to identify the donor, but failed
in the effort.
</P>
<P>
   They went to the theater, and had a wonderful time. On their
return home late at night, still trying to guess the identity of
the unknown host, they found the house stripped of every article of
value. And on the bare table in the dining-room was a piece of
paper on which was writtenin the same hand as the enclosure with
the tickets:
</P>
<P>
   `Now you know!`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CITY STREETS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   My friend Ivy Podolski was driving home to New Jersey via Harlem
River Drive when her car began to overheat. She left the highway
and stopped at a service station. When her car was repaired, she
asked for directions back to the highway and was told to look for
Broadway and follow it until she saw the signs for Harlem River
Drive.
</P>
<P>
   After driving a few blocks, she realized she was hopelessly
lost. She stopped and asked a dreadlocked fellow on the street,
``Can you tell me how I can get to Broadway?'' He didn't miss a
beat. ``Well, it all depends,'' he replied. ``Can you sing, can you
dance?''
</P>

   The hazards of parking in Manhattan are many and well known, but
Jamie Moog has another to add to the list. His car was parked on
the Upper West Side and when he went to pick it up, it looked, in
his own words, ``like a rancid tossed salad.'' A sanitation pickup
had obviously taken place and one of the bags had somehow come
undone over his car. Moog had no choice. He needed his car, so he
got in and started off, trailing lettuce, shredded carrots,
cucumber peels and other mutilated vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Stopped for a red light at 65th and Madison, he noticed a man
hosing down the sidewalk. He rolled down his window and yelled,
``Think I could have a blast?'' indicating the mess. The stranger
took one look, aimed a stream at the car and voila, almost as good
as a car wash. Moog directed a thumbs-up signal through the watery
window and headed to his appointment, his faith in humanity
restored.

   Thomas Amesse is the deputy superintendent of a large wastewater
treatment plant on Wards Island. His duties include reviewing the
log sheets listing visitors. The truck drivers for one of the
contractors who remove the plant's waste usually sign in by writing
their company name and their own first name. Amesse was amused as
he looked over the sheets for one week this summer. There were only
two entries on the final shift. That night, the plant was visited
by Mohammed and Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   The scene: The J. Peterman outlet at Woodbury Common
</P>
<P>
   The observer: Carol Alexander
</P>
<P>
   Short, roundish woman, perhaps mid-40s, gesturing appropriately
to saleswoman: ``I'm a size 6 up here, but then I branch out.''
</P>
<P>
   The sign on the Chinese restaurant read: ``To serve you better,
Excellent Dumpling will be closed on Sundays.'' Which led Bonnie
Seegmiller to ponder how better service is achieved by closing.
</P>
<P>
   Jill Plotkin was annoyed with Sydney, her 4-year-old daughter.
``How many times do I have to tell you not to play with my good
camera?'' she asked. ``Don't worry, Mommy,'' Sydney replied. ``I
won't press the Cheese button.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Yaeger, breaking his drive back from East Hampton with
a snack stop, noticed a woman eating at one of the picnic benches
near the restaurant. As she set a plate of food down before her
apparently ravenous dog, she issued her instructions: ``Eat
slower,'' she commanded. ``Chew!''
</P>
<P>
   Ivy Berchuck was at Chautauqua this summer racing from concerts
to lectures. At one particularly crowded event, she edged onto a
bench, squeezing an elderly couple even closer together. After
apologizing, she began talking to them and the woman eventually
asked where she was from. ``New York City,'' Ms. Berchuck said. The
woman was thrilled. ``We're from Nashville,'' she said. ``We would
just love to visit New York some day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Please come soon,'' Ms. Berchuck replied. ``I know you'll have
a great time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yes,'' the woman said. ``And I know what we'll do first.
We love music, so we'll drop our bags at a hotel and get ourselves
right over to the Metropolitan Opry.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Steuer and a friend were going through the security check
at Kennedy International Airport recently when the friend was
stopped. A mysterious-looking item in his suitcase showed up on the
X-ray. He opened his bag _ the item was a long shoehorn.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's that?'' the inspector asked. Told what it was, the
inspector said: ``Really? How do you play it?''
</P>
<P>
   The friend picked up the shoehorn, put it to his mouth and began
blowing through the hole at the end. Smiles all around. The couple
and the shoehorn were given a pass.
</P>
<P>
   Overheard on a Madison Avenue bus by Marilyn Baker:
</P>
<P>
   First chic woman: ``I just love your pedicure.''
</P>
<P>
   Second chic woman: ``I'll give you a card to my beauty salon but
ask for Monique. She really understands my toes.''
</P>
<P>
   Gene Alden was sitting on a bench at the entrance to the Museum
of the City of New York when he heard this exchange between a young
woman with a camera dangling from a strap around her neck, and her
friend who had come to meet her.
</P>
<P>
   Young Woman No. 1: ``Where is your camera?''
</P>
<P>
   Young Woman No. 2: ``I didn't bring it. I had no lens cover.''
</P>
<P>
   Young Woman No. 1: ``You could have brought it anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Young Woman No. 2: ``Well, I couldn't find my camera strap.''
</P>
<P>
   Young Woman No. 1: ``You could carry it in your hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Young Woman No. 2: ``Yeah, but I couldn't find the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Young Woman No. 1: ``So what! You could still carry it.''
</P>
<P>
   Young Woman No. 2 (after a few silent moments): ``Well, I didn't
have any film!''

   &UR; PHYSICS SAVES LIVES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Author Unknown: As a premed student at Washington University in
St. Louis, I had to take a difficult class in physics. One day our
professor was discussing a particularly complicated concept. A
student rudely interrupted to ask `Why do we have to learn this
stuff?`
</P>
<P>
   `To save lives.` the professor responded quickly and continued
the lecture.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, the same student spoke up again. `So how
does physics save lives?` he persisted.
</P>
<P>
   `It keeps the ignoramuses out of medical school,` replied the
professor.

   &UR; The Fortune Teller &LR;
</P>
<P>
   During a recent publicity outing, Hillary sneaked off to visit a
fortune teller of some local repute. In a dark and hazy room,
peering into a crystal ball, the mystic delivered grave news.
</P>
<P>
   `There's no easy way to say this, so I'll just be blunt: Prepare
yourself to be a widow. Your husband will die a violent and
horrible death this year.`
</P>
<P>
   Visibly shaken, Hillary stared at the woman's lined face, then
at the single flickering candle, then down at her hands. She took a
few deep breaths to compose herself. She simply had to know. She
met the fortune teller's gaze, steadied her voice, and asked her
question.
</P>
<P>
   `Will I be acquitted?`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Gift Giver &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A young couple got married and went away on their honeymoon.
After 2 weeks they came back and finally put away all of the
presents they received from friends and family. Since this was a
new home, the process took sometime. The silver went into the
closet, items were put on the walls for display and some of the
more intimate apparel was put in the bedroom drawers.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, they received in the mail two tickets for a
popular show where tickets were impossible to get. They were very
excited and warmed by the gesture of the person who sent this.
Inside the envelope, however, was only a small piece of paper with
a single line.
</P>
<P>
   `Guess who sent them.`
</P>
<P>
   The pair had much fun trying to identify the donor, but failed
in the effort.
</P>
<P>
   They went to the theater, and had a wonderful time. On their
return home late at night, still trying to guess the identity of
the unknown host, they found the house stripped of every article of
value. And on the bare table in the dining-room was a piece of
paper on which was writtenin the same hand as the enclosure with
the tickets:
</P>
<P>
   `Now you know!`

   My friend Ivy Podolski was driving home to New Jersey via Harlem
River Drive when her car began to overheat. She left the highway
and stopped at a service station. When her car was repaired, she
asked for directions back to the highway and was told to look for
Broadway and follow it until she saw the signs for Harlem River
Drive.
</P>
<P>
   After driving a few blocks, she realized she was hopelessly
lost. She stopped and asked a dreadlocked fellow on the street,
``Can you tell me how I can get to Broadway?'' He didn't miss a
beat. ``Well, it all depends,'' he replied. ``Can you sing, can you
dance?''

   The hazards of parking in Manhattan are many and well known, but
Jamie Moog has another to add to the list. His car was parked on
the Upper West Side and when he went to pick it up, it looked, in
his own words, ``like a rancid tossed salad.'' A sanitation pickup
had obviously taken place and one of the bags had somehow come
undone over his car. Moog had no choice. He needed his car, so he
got in and started off, trailing lettuce, shredded carrots,
cucumber peels and other mutilated vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Stopped for a red light at 65th and Madison, he noticed a man
hosing down the sidewalk. He rolled down his window and yelled,
``Think I could have a blast?'' indicating the mess. The stranger
took one look, aimed a stream at the car and voila, almost as good
as a car wash. Moog directed a thumbs-up signal through the watery
window and headed to his appointment, his faith in humanity
restored.

   Thomas Amesse is the deputy superintendent of a large wastewater
treatment plant on Wards Island. His duties include reviewing the
log sheets listing visitors. The truck drivers for one of the
contractors who remove the plant's waste usually sign in by writing
their company name and their own first name. Amesse was amused as
he looked over the sheets for one week this summer. There were only
two entries on the final shift. That night, the plant was visited
by Mohammed and Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   The scene: The J. Peterman outlet at Woodbury Common
</P>
<P>
   The observer: Carol Alexander
</P>
<P>
   Short, roundish woman, perhaps mid-40s, gesturing appropriately
to saleswoman: ``I'm a size 6 up here, but then I branch out.''
</P>
<P>
   The sign on the Chinese restaurant read: ``To serve you better,
Excellent Dumpling will be closed on Sundays.'' Which led Bonnie
Seegmiller to ponder how better service is achieved by closing.

   Jill Plotkin was annoyed with Sydney, her 4-year-old daughter.
``How many times do I have to tell you not to play with my good
camera?'' she asked. ``Don't worry, Mommy,'' Sydney replied. ``I
won't press the Cheese button.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Yaeger, breaking his drive back from East Hampton with
a snack stop, noticed a woman eating at one of the picnic benches
near the restaurant. As she set a plate of food down before her
apparently ravenous dog, she issued her instructions: ``Eat
slower,'' she commanded. ``Chew!''
</P>

   Ivy Berchuck was at Chautauqua this summer racing from concerts
to lectures. At one particularly crowded event, she edged onto a
bench, squeezing an elderly couple even closer together. After
apologizing, she began talking to them and the woman eventually
asked where she was from. ``New York City,'' Ms. Berchuck said. The
woman was thrilled. ``We're from Nashville,'' she said. ``We would
just love to visit New York some day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Please come soon,'' Ms. Berchuck replied. ``I know you'll have
a great time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yes,'' the woman said. ``And I know what we'll do first.
We love music, so we'll drop our bags at a hotel and get ourselves
right over to the Metropolitan Opry.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Steuer and a friend were going through the security check
at Kennedy International Airport recently when the friend was
stopped. A mysterious-looking item in his suitcase showed up on the
X-ray. He opened his bag _ the item was a long shoehorn.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's that?'' the inspector asked. Told what it was, the
inspector said: ``Really? How do you play it?''
</P>
<P>
   The friend picked up the shoehorn, put it to his mouth and began
blowing through the hole at the end. Smiles all around. The couple
and the shoehorn were given a pass.
</P>
<P>
   Overheard on a Madison Avenue bus by Marilyn Baker:
</P>
<P>
   First chic woman: ``I just love your pedicure.''
</P>
<P>
   Second chic woman: ``I'll give you a card to my beauty salon but
ask for Monique. She really understands my toes.''
</P>
<P>
   Gene Alden was sitting on a bench at the entrance to the Museum
of the City of New York when he heard this exchange between a young
woman with a camera dangling from a strap around her neck, and her
friend who had come to meet her.
</P>
<P>
   Young Woman No. 1: ``Where is your camera?''
</P>
<P>
   Young Woman No. 2: ``I didn't bring it. I had no lens cover.''
</P>
<P>
   Young Woman No. 1: ``You could have brought it anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Young Woman No. 2: ``Well, I couldn't find my camera strap.''
</P>
<P>
   Young Woman No. 1: ``You could carry it in your hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Young Woman No. 2: ``Yeah, but I couldn't find the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Young Woman No. 1: ``So what! You could still carry it.''
</P>
<P>
   Young Woman No. 2 (after a few silent moments): ``Well, I didn't
have any film!''

   &UR; PHYSICS SAVES LIVES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Author Unknown: As a premed student at Washington University in
St. Louis, I had to take a difficult class in physics. One day our
professor was discussing a particularly complicated concept. A
student rudely interrupted to ask `Why do we have to learn this
stuff?`
</P>
<P>
   `To save lives.` the professor responded quickly and continued
the lecture.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, the same student spoke up again. `So how
does physics save lives?` he persisted.
</P>
<P>
   `It keeps the ignoramuses out of medical school,` replied the
professor.

fortune teller of some local repute. In a dark and hazy room,
peering into a crystal ball, the mystic delivered grave news.

   A young couple got married and went away on their honeymoon.
After 2 weeks they came back and finally put away all of the
presents they received from friends and family. Since this was a
new home, the process took sometime. The silver went into the
closet, items were put on the walls for display and some of the
more intimate apparel was put in the bedroom drawers.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, they received in the mail two tickets for a
popular show where tickets were impossible to get. They were very
excited and warmed by the gesture of the person who sent this.
Inside the envelope, however, was only a small piece of paper with
a single line.

   Lynn Steuer and a friend were going through the security check

stopped. A mysterious-looking item in his suitcase showed up on the
X-ray. He opened his bag _ the item was a long shoehorn.

inspector said: ``Really? How do you play it?''

blowing through the hole at the end. Smiles all around. The couple

   &UR; PHYSICS SAVES LIVES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Author Unknown: As a premed student at Washington University in
St. Louis, I had to take a difficult class in physics. One day our
professor was discussing a particularly complicated concept. A
student rudely interrupted to ask `Why do we have to learn this
stuff?`
</P>
<P>
   `To save lives.` the professor responded quickly and continued
the lecture.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, the same student spoke up again. `So how
does physics save lives?` he persisted.
</P>
<P>
   `It keeps the ignoramuses out of medical school,` replied the
professor.

   Lynn Steuer and a friend were going through the security check
at Kennedy International Airport recently when the friend was
stopped. A mysterious-looking item in his suitcase showed up on the
X-ray. He opened his bag _ the item was a long shoehorn.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's that?'' the inspector asked. Told what it was, the
inspector said: ``Really? How do you play it?''
</P>
<P>
   The friend picked up the shoehorn, put it to his mouth and began
blowing through the hole at the end. Smiles all around. The couple
and the shoehorn were given a pass.

   Gene Alden was sitting on a bench at the entrance to the Museum
of the City of New York when he heard this exchange between a young
woman with a camera dangling from a strap around her neck, and her
friend who had come to meet her.
</P>
<P>
   Young Woman No. 1: ``Where is your camera?''
</P>
<P>
   Young Woman No. 2: ``I didn't bring it. I had no lens cover.''
</P>
<P>
   Young Woman No. 1: ``You could have brought it anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Young Woman No. 2: ``Well, I couldn't find my camera strap.''
</P>
<P>
   Young Woman No. 1: ``You could carry it in your hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Young Woman No. 2: ``Yeah, but I couldn't find the case.''

<P>
   Young Woman No. 1: ``So what! You could still carry it.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Symphony orchestras in the United States begin as
civic gestures. While the Berlin or the Czech Philharmonic defends
a national culture (and is paid by a national government to do so),
their American counterparts identify individual cities and report
on their aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   Cities like this one, for example, maintain their orchestras in
the same spirit in which they pave streets, plant trees or open
schools. European cities are old and work to keep their identities.
American cities are young and are usually looking for an identity.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle Symphony, for all the local pride it represents, has
known the downside of urban life, including its longstanding and
seemingly intractable housing problem. Crowded with the city's
opera and ballet companies into a drably functional theater left
over from the 1973 World's Fair, it has regularly suffered the
indignities of restricted rehearsal opportunities, compromised
schedules, cramped quarters or, in some cases, no quarters at all.
</P>
<P>
   All this makes the opening of Benaroya Hall over the weekend an
important event. The 2,500-seat space, with a 540-seat recital hall
attached, sits between a pair of the steeply sloping side streets
that characterize Seattle's downtown. Like the art museum just
below it and the proliferating apartment buildings all around, it
is a component of urban renewal.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle residents, festively dressed for the weekend's concerts,
seemed very pleased with what their city is doing.
</P>
<P>
   The new hall, costing $118 million, has been financed in the
usual American way, through a pool of local government funds,
corporate donations and private giving. The several names attached
to it are displays of gratitude, also typically American.
</P>
<P>
   The building itself is named for Jack Benaroya, a Seattle
developer who gave $15 million. The larger of the auditoriums bears
the name Taper, after the savings-and-loan family known for its
cultural generosity in California. The smaller space is Nordstrom
Hall, for the national retailers. The Boeing Arcade Gallery recalls
the airplane maker's significant help with management for the
project.
</P>
<P>
   Benaroya Hall is also important for how it works. Fiscally
minded builders have been leaning toward layouts adaptable to
several kinds of performance, but the multipurpose design has been
rejected here. No adjustable walls and ceilings. No orchestra pit
or wing space for musical theater. Every element is fixed in place.
It is a symphony hall. The city owns Benaroya Hall, but the Seattle
Symphony runs it.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, Benaroya's physical attractions are mostly hidden.
The big theater sits in a kind of cocoon: a sound-insulated
shoe-box shape encased on the outside by thick concrete, set on a
rubber undercarriage and further separated from the outside world
by an air pocket on every side.
</P>
<P>
   It has a darkly handsome interior, though it was made less so by
Saturday night's heightened television lights. Boxes are angled
toward the stage. The surfaces are plaster, and the walls, made of
African makore wood, bulge intermittently in the form of converging
triangles.
</P>
<P>
   The acoustics designed by Cyril Harris seem exceptionally good.
One hears the different orchestra sections with clarity, and
already the stage floorboards resonate nicely. Having been witness
at the inauguration of several dry, dead halls in recent years, I
find this one a pleasant surprise.
</P>
<P>
   The smaller hall is equally alive if not more so. Chamber
orchestras and new-music ensembles, at least judging from the
rehearsal I heard on Friday, are going to be severely tested on
matters of restraint and fineness. The recital hall has an explicit
sound; it promises to reward the virtuous while punishing the
smallest musical miscalculation.
</P>
<P>
   Benaroya Hall's exteriors make little impression; this amateur's
eye, at least, found little to engage it. What one sees from the
street or experiences in the inner public spaces appears functional
to a fault, despite Robert Rauschenberg's large panels above the
main staircase and the pair of oddly wriggling glass chandeliers by
Dale Chihuly.
</P>
<P>
   It is as if the designer Mark Reddington and his employers
really didn't want to be noticed at all. Seattle, for all its
openness to the arts, is a conservative town and may not have been
in the mood for a beacon or a challenge. What it has got is a
well-behaved neighbor. The performance spaces, properly lighted,
are striking. What is around them reassures more than it excites.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Saturday's symphony concert, conducted by Gerard Schwarz, began
with speeches and then went through a potpourri of pieces. ``A Gala
Celebration'' by David Diamond was busy and businesslike in its
first performance. Webern's hyper-romantic ``Langsamer Satz,'' an
attractive sin of the composer's youth, profited from Schwarz's
preference for slow tempos. So did most of Stravinsky's
``Firebird'' Suite and the excerpts from Wagner's
``Goetterdaemmerung'' after intermission.
</P>
<P>
   The first bizarre moment of the evening was Henri Lazarof's
``Celebration for Four Brass Choirs.'' Such anguished and
gloom-ridden music seemed a strange way to greet Seattle's
citizenry as it filed into its new hall for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The other episode of strangeness was Jessye Norman in Wagner's
final scene. One forgave the lapses in pitch and the episodes of
strain; the part is probably high for her voice. Less acceptable
were the hooting vowels, the spit-out consonants and the popeyed
exaggeration of gesture. Ms. Norman has within her a great artist.
I hope she will look at what she did here on television and do some
reconsidering.
</P>
<P>
   The orchestra itself is decent, reliable and at times quite
good. With Schwarz, its future is in excellent hands. Perhaps the
real challenge Benaroya Hall offers is to these musicians. The
place is a world-class establishment, a significant success. The
Seattle Symphony is going to have to work hard to keep up with it.

 &HT;    WOMEN SUPPORTERS CONFLICTED OVER CLINTON
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For many women who have been among President
Clinton's most loyal fans, these are uncomfortable and conflicting
times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts my heart,'' said Susan Lundy, looking visibly
distressed as she went from exasperation to admiration to
disillusionment in discussing the man she had twice voted for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than being a womanizing jerk, he's a good leader,'' said
Lundy, a 40-year-old registered nurse from Bondurant, Wyo. But she
quickly added of his sexual liaison with a White House intern and
his efforts to cover it up: ``It's unforgiveable, the abuse of
office.''
</P>
<P>
   But should he be impeached? ``I think the humiliation is
punishment enough,'' she said. ``I feel like he's leading us in the
right direction.'' Asked what that has meant for her family, she
offered, ``He seems to have cared'' about people and added: ``It's
all 'seems to have' now.''
</P>
<P>
   Turning to her 3-year-old son Jason, along for a family tour of
the capital, she said, ``I'm not telling him'' about the president.
</P>
<P>
   Women, especially the so-called ``soccer moms'' who were widely
credited with providing Clinton's victory margins in 1992 and in
1996, are being tested by the Starr report and its graphic
depictions of Clinton's sexual escapades with then 21-year-old
Monica Lewinsky. Although their support has drooped a bit, women
continue to support the president in far greater numbers than men,
most recent polls indicate. A Washington Post poll, for example,
showed that 25 percent of women favor impeachment, compared with 35
percent of men.
</P>
<P>
   Many of his staunchest supporters are still holding on, but with
caveats.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could get him by the collar and shake him and say, 'Grow
up!' and have it work, I would have done it a long time ago,''
Patricia Ireland, president of the National Organization for Women,
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Her feminist group has pulled back from solid backing and even
discussed calling for Clinton's resignation. ``I've been talking to
a lot of people who think it would help to have Al Gore an an
incumbent,'' Ireland said.
</P>
<P>
   She blamed Clinton for ``the kind of disrepect for women in the
workplace that may be harmful to literally millions of us out in
the work place.'' And that's in addition to the scandal's expected
impact on the coming elections, in which Republicans and
conservatives unsympathetic to NOW's views are expected to extend
their majority in Congress
</P>
<P>
   BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   For all of that, Ireland still applauds Clinton's policies,
which included pro-choice on abortion, and for picking women for
high cabinet posts such as Attorney General Janet Reno and
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, both firsts for their
gender.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't come in perfect packages,'' Ireland said.
</P>
<P>
   END OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   At the National Women's Political Caucus, president Anita Perez
Ferguson said she leans toward censure for Clinton, whom she faults
for ``setting a bad example'' but credits for numerous small
changes throughout the government, especially the signing of the
family medical leave act.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is obviously a real split between the person and the
policies,'' Ferguson said. ``I feel that I can trust him with the
public policies, the leadership of the economy, and in
international relations. With other things, I'm going to be
cautious and watch where we go.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson readily conceded her position was not totally
consistent on Clinton. ``Life is contradictory,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of Clinton's female supporters have been so
understanding. Mary Jones, a retiree from the Chicago suburb of
Naporville who was visiting Washington voted for the president but
now regrets it. She believes he should resign or be impeached..
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me,'' she added, ``he's supposed to be an
inspiration to the country.''

2 REPORTS, ONE GLOBAL, ONE REGIONAL, DRIVE BONDS UP 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose late
Monday as stocks declined from their intraday highs.
</P>
<P>
   Two reports were also major factors in bond market activity. A
statement from the Group of Seven nations led to speculation of
global interest rate cuts to spur growth, and a regional report by
the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta showed that manufacturing in
the southern part of the country was slowing, which could suggest
the Fed might lower interest rates soon.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Schaja, an economist with Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette,
said Monday's Atlanta Fed report on regional business activity was
not as weak as it appeared. The index of business activity fell to
a reading of minus 12.1 in August from a plus 1.2 reading in July,
which had originally been reported as a reading of plus 3.4.
</P>
<P>
   ``The details of the report suggest that caution should be used
in interpreting the decline as a reliable gauge of a sharp drop in
economic activity,'' Ms. Schaja said.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year bond was up 4/32, to 104 4/32. Its yield, which
moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.22
percent, from 5.23 percent on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Market participants were also awaiting Wednesday's testimony to
the House Banking Committee by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, who will report on
the global economic turmoil and may offer some insight about rate
cuts. Few investors, however, expect a cut in interest rates before
the Sept. 29 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the
Fed's policy-making group.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the bond market already bracing for a very weak economy
before actual business conditions seriously deteriorate,'' said
Maury Harris, chief economist at Paine Webber, ``the accompanying
pre-emptive interest rate reductions should prevent realization of
the stock market's worst fears about a weak U.S. economy.''
</P>
<P>
   And he added that since the Fed might start temporarily basing
its rate decisions more on world financial market and economic
turbulence than on just this nation's economic conditions, even a
temporarily very weak domestic economy might no longer be required
before the central bank trimmed the federal funds rate that banks
charge one another for overnight loans. That rate is currently 5.5
percent.

HOME RUN CHASE A HAPPY DISTRACTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - The thrill of the chase is back!
</P>
<P>
   The quest to become Major League Baseball's all-time home run
leader seemed to lose some of its spark when Mark McGwire of the
St. Louis Cardinals, with a nation watching last Tuesday, drilled
No. 62 on a line just inside the left field foul pole at Busch
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs, at 58 and holding, was lost in
the McGwiremania. For all the excitement that the McGwire-Sosa home
run chase had generated through the summer, there was a sense that
once McGwire surpassed Roger Maris' tremendous feat of 61 home runs
in 1961, the home run derby, for all intents and purposes, was
over.
</P>
<P>
   A gap of four round-trippers with two weeks to go seemed
insurmountable. Time for fans to turn their attention to the
upcoming playoffs, and maybe pay more attention to the start of the
football season.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Bill Clinton and Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast. In the friendly confines of Wrigley Field last
weekend, Sosa did not disappoint the fans who love to chant
Sam-meeee; Sam-meeee. On Friday he hit No. 59. On Saturday No. 60
flew out onto Waveland Avenue. And on Sunday he again hit two
tremendous shots over the left field wall _ all unanswered by
McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa _ whose grace and heartfelt joy at seeing McGwire smash the
record redefined humility in professional athletics _ had tied
McGwire for perhaps the most glamorous record in all of sport.
</P>
<P>
   It was an amazing display of power in a series with the
Milwaukee Brewers, who left Chicago not knowing what hit them. The
advance hype and postgame hoopla sadly paled by comparison to that
which surrounded McGwire's feat earlier in the week. Sosa's
incredible accomplishments of the weekend were overshadowed by a
nation trying to come to grips with a president fighting for his
political survival.
</P>
<P>
   These two men have been great for baseball, helping to erase the
image of overpaid athletes who sulk better than they play, of a
sport with labor problems that never seem to end, and of a league
that has a long way to go to recapture the respect that it once
had.
</P>
<P>
   Records are made to be broken, and by season's end the home run
king will be the player with the most. Regardless of who will wear
the new crown, the skills of both men in putting the sweet part of
the bat on a pitch traveling in excess of 90 mph from a distance of
60 feet, 6 inches, are truly remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   They have been a tonic for the country and for baseball, and for
that we are thankful. &QL;

   NY-CLINTON (New York) _ President Clinton gets a warm reception
in New York, where he came to appeal for funds while still

SAVVY COSMETIC SURGEON LEAVES TRAIL OF DISSATISFIED PATIENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LANCY WILLIAMS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Charming, glib and media savvy, Dr. Alan Gaynor
is San Francisco's most televised cosmetic surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   The state Medical Board accuses him of incompetence, gross
negligence and dishonesty. But on talk TV, Gaynor has become an
emblem for the idea that, with little pain or risk, modern medicine
can reverse the aging process.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Gaynor gave Geraldo Rivera a live-on-camera ``instant
face lift,'' using a syringe to suck fat from the talk-show host's
buttocks and injecting it into a crease in Geraldo's craggy face.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, as the studio audience laughed and cheered, Gaynor gave
Geraldo an on-air eyelid lift.
</P>
<P>
   On his Web site, www.lookyoung.com, Gaynor say he is ``the best
known cosmetic surgeon in the United States,'' with appearances on
more than 400 TV shows.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes dressed in aquamarine surgical scrubs, he has
cheerfully flogged such procedures as the ``Lipo-Sculption'' (a
$10,000-per-session surgical suctioning of fat from the belly,
bottom and thighs), the ``Sushi Hair Transplant'' ($3,000 per
cluster of mini-grafts) and the laser-fired ``Alternative
Facelift'' ($5,000 per blast.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We travel the world to find new surgical procedures that are
safe and work well!'' his commercial says.
</P>
<P>
   But don't tell that to the Medical Board, which in 1996 moved to
suspend Gaynor's medical license, or to four women who have claimed
in court papers that they were disfigured during visits to his
office.
</P>
<P>
   Gaynor denied wrongdoing. He said he was a caring, skilled
doctor, wrongly targeted by the state, perhaps for writing a
consumer-oriented book on cosmetic surgery.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had great sympathy for patients who have complained
about him, but said the vast majority of his patients had happy
outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in practice 21 years. During that period, I've done
20,000 procedures,'' he said in an interview. ``I will leave it to
you: Are the number of cases I had too many for ... a doctor who
has been in practice that long?''
</P>
<P>
   One woman said Gaynor's fat transfer procedure had left her with
leg scars and nerve damage.
</P>
<P>
   Another said she had needed a tracheotomy after her neck
liposuction went awry. A third said she had suffered ``horrendous
facial scarring'' and lost part of her nose.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth said that while having permanent eyeliner applied, she
had been stabbed in the eye with a syringe and partially blinded.
</P>
<P>
   For them, Gaynor has come to symbolize a lamentable aspect of
the surgical quest for youthful good looks, one seldom mentioned on
happy-talk TV or in glossy ads. Cosmetic surgery is serious
business _ and when it goes wrong, the down side is very steep
indeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The injury Dr. Gaynor inflicted on me has shattered my life,''
former fashion consultant Lisa Santoro wrote to a San Francisco
judge in 1993, more than a year after she said Gaynor had punctured
her eye with a syringe. ``The episodes of pain that I have endured
... have been beyond comprehension.''
</P>
<P>
   According to his Web site biography, Gaynor is a onetime child
piano prodigy from New York who became a dermatologist in San
Francisco in 1980, after completing Yale Medical School and a
residency at the University of California at San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few years, he was showing up in gossip columns as ``the
best skin doctor in the world'' and ``the Sassoon or Gucci of
skin.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, Gaynor focused on collagen injections, surgical face
lifts, chemical skin peels. But he became interested in
liposuction.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he has recalled in TV interviews, he met Brazilian
physician Luis Toledo, who was saving fat from liposuction and
injecting it into the faces of patients to smooth wrinkles. Gaynor
seized on the procedure and promoted it heavily. Eventually, the
supermarket tabloid Globe featured him in its ``medical marvels''
column.
</P>
<P>
   Gaynor's first breakthrough celebrity client was Eddie Fisher:
in 1989, he got his name in USA Today for performing liposuction on
the 1950s crooner.
</P>
<P>
   But that was nothing compared to the public relations bonanza he
reaped from his 1992 appearance on ``Geraldo.''
</P>
<P>
   While comedian Joan Rivers made wisecracks and the studio
audience whooped and yelled, Gaynor gave Rivera a local anesthetic,
then extracted fat from his bottom and injected it into his
forehead to smooth a wrinkle. The physician kept a running patter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Geraldo's going to get the point now!'' Gaynor quipped as he
shot Rivera's backside with Novocain.
</P>
<P>
   The show had monster ratings. The after-broadcast buzz continued
for months, as the Johnny Carson, Arsenio Hall shows and ``Saturday
Night Live'' took turns mocking Rivera for undergoing what came to
be known as the ``butt-head'' procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Gaynor parlayed that appearance into three other ``Geraldo''
stints, plus appearances on ``20/20'' and other national shows.
</P>
<P>
   Gaynor's media-propelled medical practice brought him wealth: a
mansion on Telegraph Hill and two Mercedes Benzes, one with the
personalized license plate, ``LIPODOC.'' His donations to Steve
Young's Forever Young Foundation caused the San Francisco 49ers
quarterback to praise Gaynor as ``a man with a golden heart.''
</P>
<P>
   But a different portrait of Gaynor emerges from a review of the
lawsuits in which he has been involved. In them, he is sometimes
portrayed as confrontational and litigious.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1990 he sued a prospective patient after she balked at going
through with an operation.
</P>
<P>
   And last year, after a patient sued him over a fat transfer that
went awry, Gaynor counter-sued for invasion of privacy, because the
patient had tape-recorded some of her phone calls to him
complaining about post-operative problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``My civil rights have been violated,'' Gaynor told the court.
</P>
<P>
   Gaynor's worst problem with a patient occurred in 1992, only
three months after his first appearance on ``Geraldo.''
</P>
<P>
   Santoro, 37, a glamorous, $250,000-per-year saleswoman in New
York's Garment District, said she had read an article in Allure
magazine that described how Gaynor had given his own wife permanent
eyeliner by tattooing her upper and lower eyelids. Santoro wanted
the procedure to highlight her own striking brown eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Reassured by literature describing Gaynor's ``100 percent
positive track record with our clients,'' her lawsuit said, Santoro
flew to San Francisco. At Gaynor's office, she said, she watched a
video of a Gaynor appearance on the Phil Donahue show, then was
given Valium.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Gaynor injected Santoro's eyelids with lidocaine,
then turned her over to a tattoo artist, Linda Swan, to apply the
eyeliner.
</P>
<P>
   But within minutes it became clear something was terribly wrong.
Santoro told Swan her eye hurt. After that, according to the
Medical Board, Gaynor told Swan to drive his patient to the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   In the car, the pain was so intense, Santoro began throwing up.
</P>
<P>
   In her lawsuit, Santoro said Gaynor had plunged the needle of
lidocaine directly into her cornea. The injuries destroyed the lens
of her eye and all but wrecked her life, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Beset by pain and confined for years to a darkened room because
of light sensitivity, she lost her job and her fiance.
</P>
<P>
   Gaynor initially said the accident had occurred because Santoro
had thrashed about in the chair as he injected her. Later, in a
counter-lawsuit, he blamed Swan, claiming that the tattoo artist
had re-injected Santoro's eye with anesthetic after he'd left the
room.
</P>
<P>
   Swan denied it. She sued Gaynor, claiming he had tried to induce
her to back up his false testimony in a pretrial hearing; Gaynor
countered with a slander suit, accusing Swan of telling potential
patients that he had blinded Santoro.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the lawsuits were settled. But the Medical Board has
charged Gaynor with gross negligence, dishonesty and repeated
negligent acts in the affair.
</P>
<P>
   Gaynor said terms of the settlements limit what he can say, but
he said that once the injury occurred, he sent Santoro to ``the
best ophthalmologist in the city. ... I was profoundly worried for
her.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gaynor said he put his medical practice ``in
hibernation'' to spend more time with his family and to promote his
book, ``Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Cosmetic Surgery
But Couldn't Afford to Ask.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a ``definite guide to finding the fountain of youth in the
doctor's office,'' the publisher said.

`THREEPENNY OPERA' HAS ITS CHARM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When one of his henchmen says to Macheath in ``The
Threepenny Opera'' that something was nice, Mack the Knife corrects
him. ``That wasn't nice, clown. That was art,'' Mackie says turning
to the audience with a leer to deliver the punch line. ``And art
isn't nice.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's the problem with the Bertolt Brecht-Kurt Weill
classic at UCLA's Freud Playhouse, part of the latest offering in
the Reprise! series of concert musicals, which is a counterpart to
the Encore! series in New York City. It's a little too nice.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say that the production doesn't offer its
pleasures. In fact, that's what it does best. There are solid
renditions of Weill's familiar cabaret-style songs, some very good
performances and witty staging.
</P>
<P>
   So it may seem unfair to carp, considering that the series is
meant to be a showcase of neglected musicals and in essence bills
itself as a ``concert'' (actors often carry around notebooks to
refer to lines since there is usually only about a week of
rehearsals). But the play is staged, and the actors do more than
read their parts.
</P>
<P>
   This stripped-down approach has worked well with other shows in
the series, such as ``Promises, Promises'' or Finian's Rainbow,''
but ``The Threepenny Opera'' is a different beast than those
Broadway lambs.
</P>
<P>
   First produced in 1928 in Berlin, the musical was meant as a
commentary on the decadence, cynicism and corruption rife in an
economically unstable Germany under the shadow of Nazism. Brecht
was a communist, but the subversive ideology he put forth in
``Threepenny'' was more theatrical than Marxist. His intention was
to ``alienate'' audiences, wanting to wake them from their
comfortable roles as passive observers of entertainment, remind
them that they are watching a play and implicate them in crimes of
society.
</P>
<P>
   Based on John Gay's ``The Beggar's Opera,'' the musical is
filled with lowlifes of every sort. There are cutthroats, cheats,
con artists and corrupted officials, and Brecht wanted the audience
to know they were responsible. He even creates an artificial upbeat
ending, reminding people that they may like things neatly tied up
with a happy conclusion, but that rarely happens for most people.
</P>
<P>
   The Reprise! production of ``The Three Penny Opera'' is the 1953
translation by Marc Blitzstein that played on Broadway, and it's
this version that we are most familiar with. But it's probably time
to go beyond this, and there have been recent and only moderately
successful attempts to reinterpret the musical.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't mean it has to go the Baz Luhrmann ``William
Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet'' route, but the musical begs not to
be put in a time capsule. Perhaps an odd choice for the series,
nonetheless this bare-bones version almost presented an opportunity
to be subversive, to invoke the Brecht-Weill spirit.
</P>
<P>
   What was presented, though, was very professional. Those who are
fans of Weill's dark, almost atonal music won't be disappointed.
From Ken Page's (the Street Singer) wonderfully forceful opening
``The Ballad of Mack the Knife'' through Jonelle Allen's (Jenny)
dynamic ``Pirate Jenny'' to Carrie Hamilton and Marguerite
MacIntye's (Lucy and Polly) lively ``Jealousy Duet,'' the show's
singing is always engaging.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Cassidy is a live wire as Macheath, and his energy on
stage is infectious. The rest of the cast, including stage veteran
Theodore Bikel (Mr. J.J. Peachum) are quite good. And if you have
never seen ``The Threepenny Opera,'' you won't go wrong if you buy
a ticket. It may not be Brechtian, but it is entertaining.

LAWYERS AND LAWMAKERS SIFT THROUGH STARR REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Ark., Calif.)  (See also CLINTON-CONGRESS, CLINTON-CONSTITUENTS, CLINTON-DEFENSE,
CLINTON-STARR, CLINTON-POLICY, CLINTON-PERJURY)

 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The room, H2-186 in the Ford House Office Building,
has the crash-course ambiance of a law-school study hall on the eve
of the nation's ultimate examination on constitutional law.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the 27 lawyers and 35 House lawmakers who are the only
ones permitted the entry code to the guarded room are cramming on
the biggest legal case of their careers _ the impeachment grounds
crafted against President Clinton by Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater
independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are highly trained lawyers, so I assume they have some
special talent for rummaging through the 17 boxes of stuff in
there,'' one House staff member said with a smile of doubt at the
daunting task going on inside as the lawyers quietly, whisperingly
race through the Starr report's supporting evidence for impeachment
charges.
</P>
<P>
   The staff lawyers _ 18 Republicans and nine Democrats _
sometimes find themselves sharing a big study table in the
45-by-15-foot common conference room. They sit as rival scholastics
silently searching through various chunks of the Starr boxes for
something damning or promising, exculpatory or explosive. Time is
short; the task is huge, with the room open only from 8 a.m. until
midnight each day for intense lawyers who might prefer
all-nighters.
</P>
<P>
   Two separate side rooms have been set aside for the minority and
majority members, stocked with locked storage cabinets and video
and audiotape players to sample electronic evidence ranging from
Linda Tripp's furtive recordings of Monica Lewinsky to Clinton's
controversial pleadings of his innocence.
</P>
<P>
   No one can leave with any documents, which marks H2-186 as the
latest challenging arena in the endless media-leaking contest that
has marked the sex-and-mendacity investigation of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, here I am just skating around the Ford building,'' Rep.
John Conyers of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary
Committee, declared rather fatalistically as he wandered the halls
in search of H2-186. ``I just want to see the premises,'' he said
before finding the Starr cache and sampling the contents for an
hour.
</P>
<P>
   Conyers emerged chewing jelly beans and offering no fresh
epiphanies. ``It goes on and on and on and on.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the weekend and on Monday, the Judiciary staff lawyers
and the first trickle of committee members began the rush to vet
for public consumption some or all of the boxfuls of supporting
evidence. From explicit tapes to anecdotal hearsay, through 2,600
pages of offerings beyond the boxes, they have less than two weeks
to fashion the next big impetus in the scandal inquiry _ another
document-big dump on the far-from-finished task of judging the
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people do not want, do not see the need for such
detail,'' said Rep. Robert Wexler, D-Fla., a member of the
Judiciary committee who faulted the lurid detail found in the Starr
report and anticipated more in the boxfuls of material inside
H2-186.
</P>
<P>
   The loudest outburst in the common room over the weekend,
according to participants who wanted their identities protected,
was not about the overturning of another promising rock of
illicitness; it was over Sammy Sosa's hitting his 62nd home run to
pull even with Mark McGwire. Quietude soon resumed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of like being in a library _ you don't talk a lot,''
said Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., a former U.S. attorney who spent
10 hours in the document room over the weekend and went back for
more Monday. He finds the offerings important because they are, in
effect, the specific citations on which Starr is making the case
against the president. ``We have to put it in context but also see
what material there may be of an exculpatory nature.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The atmosphere in there is intense but rather collegial,''
Hutchinson said. ``We're trying to get a job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Between the two private offices of the separate sides there is
the inner-sanctum storeroom of Starr materials, divided within by a
partition, with each side having a full set of documents for
authorized parties to peruse. A copying machine is in the common
area, but it is for use only within the H2-186 operation.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately the Judiciary committee and not Starr's report will
be the agent of any impeachment decision, and not all committee
members are rushing to sample Starr's secret offering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't looked at it yet,'' said Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif.,
a member of the Judiciary committee. ``Mr. Starr sent over a bunch
of accusations and we could spend a lot of time running around.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But the congresswoman said she preferred a different initial
approach. As a lawyer, she stayed here last weekend to study not
the Starr appendices but the Watergate articles of impeachment from
24 years ago, when she served as a staffer in the thick of that
ordeal. ``The first thing is to know what matters
constitutionally,'' she explained, ``And not so much what matters
to us emotionally or morally.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lofgren said she was enlightened by a phrase she had
forgotten from the impeachment articles against President Richard
Nixon, a standard she finds relevant once more, whether
presidential misbehavior is ``subversive of constitutional
government to the great prejudice of the cause of law and justice
and to the manifest injury of the people of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what matters,'' Ms. Lofgren said, promising to consider
in due course whatever H2-186 might have to offer.

 &HT;    CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECKS URGED FOR NURSING HOME EMPLOYEES
 &HT;    BY NICHOLE MONROE
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Convicted criminals continue to find employment in
U.S. nursing homes, and the homes should be required to use a
national registry to perform background checks on many applicants,
advocates for the elderly urged Congress on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In a hearing of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, Sen. John
Breaux, D-La., presented a report by government auditors showing
that about 5 percent of nursing home employees in Maryland and
Illinois had records of crimes including assault and armed robbery.
</P>
<P>
   The panel heard testimony from a man whose 92-year-old mother
was raped by a nursing home worker later identified as a convicted
child molester.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly there are places where convicted criminals who have
paid their debt to society should be able to work,'' said Sen.
Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa. ``But if the crime was one of violence or
deception, my view is that nursing homes are not one of the places
these criminals should work. In these settings, seniors are just
too vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   Abuse in nursing homes has become a growing concern as the
population grows older and long-term care facilities suffer from
tightening budgets, low staffing levels and declining Medicare
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   In July, President Clinton ordered a crackdown on nursing homes
in light of a report that showed two-thirds of American nursing
homes are abusing patients or repeatedly violating health and
safety standards.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, support has grown for a law to create a national
registry and require all nursing homes to check the background of
people applying for jobs that bring them into frequent contact with
residents. Although at least 33 states have their own background
check laws, they don't have access to each others' records.
</P>
<P>
   The Service Employees International Union, which represents many
nursing home employees, said it would supports such a law, but
added that there should be a provision allowing recourse for
applicants who are denied employment resulting from an inaccurate
background check. The group also said employees should not be made
to pay for the background checks.

REPUBLICANS LOOK TO PUSH AGENDA AND KEEP HEAT IN CLINTON

 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Eager to appear focused on the people's business
and not President Clinton's, Republicans plan to push ahead with
their ambitious agenda of economic and social issues, while hoping
to avoid outright battles that would allow Clinton to shift the
focus away from his own woes.
</P>
<P>
   As the pressure on Clinton mounted, Republican Congressional
leaders insisted in the past several days that they were
concentrating on the issues of most concern to their constituents,
from tax cuts and the budget to abortion, drug use and national
security.
</P>
<P>
   In part, they said, they were motivated by a desire to avoid
appearing overly partisan as the House considers impeachment
hearings. But they also said voters want them to have a positive
message heading into this fall's elections and not just to
capitalize on Clinton's problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to expand our majority is to do the business of
the people, not to expect the problems of the Democratic side to
carry us forward,'' said Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo. ``Their
liabilities are not necessarily our assets.''
</P>
<P>
   The way the Republicans handle their legislative agenda in the
final few weeks before Congress adjourns will go a long way toward
determining how much opportunity Clinton will have to change the
subject or put Republicans on the defensive. Most obviously,
Republicans will have to decide whether to risk a showdown over
their spending priorities and a repeat of the government shutdown
in 1995 and early 1996 that played out to Clinton's tremendous
political benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said there is a division within the party about how
hard to push in coming weeks not just over the spending bills
making their way through Congress, but over tax cuts and social
issues like abortion.
</P>
<P>
   While some Republicans in Congress want to press as hard as
possible on those issues at a time when the White House is
struggling to stay politically relevant, other Republicans are
counseling restraint, saying the party should compromise and avoid
ideological battles that Clinton could use to rally his core
Democratic base.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's the view that says that from a political standpoint
things seem to be breaking in the direction of the Republicans and
we should not engage in efforts to pursue our policy agenda that
are not consensual and should let the election be about the
president and his conduct,'' said Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then there's the argument that the American people want us to
do our job on the Starr report, but they really want us to do our
job on cutting taxes, balancing the budget and maintaining a strong
national defense,'' McIntosh said. ``People are evenly split
between those two views.''
</P>
<P>
   McIntosh said he came down on the side of pursuing an ambitious
agenda, although not to the point of shutting down the government
over differences with Clinton about spending priorities for the new
fiscal year that starts Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   A memo circulating among Republican members of Congress last
week from Frank Luntz, a consultant who is influential with many
conservatives, said Clinton is much weaker than during battles over
changing the health care system in 1994 and balancing the budget in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``By a healthy 14-point margin, Americans believe President
Clinton is likely to try to distract the nation from his ethical
problems by forcing a confrontation with Congress'' over policy
issues, Luntz's memo said.
</P>
<P>
   But Luntz said shutting down the government over spending bills
would be going too far, with voters saying they would blame
Republicans rather than Clinton, by 42 percent to 32 percent, if
such a showdown occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Republicans said, Clinton's troubles have created new
opportunities for legislative victories. Republicans said they now
have a realistic hope of passing a substantial tax cut this year,
believing that Clinton has lost some of his ability to convince
voters that a tax cut, by dipping into projected federal budget
surpluses, will endanger the future of the ailing Social Security
system.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said the assumption that the president's
power and influence were in terminal decline vastly overstated his
loss of ability to shape the outcomes of many policy disputes. And
with the country still likely to face crises having nothing to do
with Clinton's sex life, they said Clinton will play as central a
role as ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``He still has the veto pen,'' said a senior administration
official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``He still has
the microphone.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said it would play to their strengths if
Republicans decide to push a conservative agenda, especially on
such issues as education and the environment where the House has
often had to back down when confronted by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's win-win,'' said the White House official. ``If the
Republicans cave, it shows we're still winning our policy agenda.
And if they fight us on an issue like education it will only remind
the public why they like Bill Clinton.''
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Along with taxes, the biggest policy fights in coming weeks will
be over the spending bills that Congress must pass to finance the
government's operation in the new fiscal year that starts Oct. 1.
Clinton issued veto threats against many of the bills during the
summer, objecting both to the spending levels for many programs and
to language dictating the way some programs are run.
</P>
<P>
   But although they said they will almost certainly not allow the
government to be shut down _ Congress can pass temporary spending
measures if Clinton should veto any of the appropriations bills _
Republicans said they may prove less willing to compromise than if
the president was not fighting for his survival.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Democrats said Clinton's limited ability to
twist arms on Capitol Hill and rally public support could thwart
any chance of them getting their legislative initiatives through
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Without considerable help from the president, Democrats said,
the party's already difficult struggle to push new regulations on
health maintenance organizations through the Senate will become a
long shot at best.
</P>
<P>
   A hobbled and distracted president will also make it
considerably more difficult for Democrats to build pressure on
Republicans to go along with a proposed increase in the minimum
wage, a key goal of liberals in the final weeks of this Congress.
The wage increase faces a key test on Tuesday, when Senate
Democrats will attempt to attach it to legislation overhauling the
nation's bankruptcy system.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's problems also raise questions about a variety of other
issues, including how much time he will have to devote to foreign
policy. And his troubles have in some ways demoralized Republicans
as well as Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   After the campaign finance overhaul bill that he co-sponsored
suffered another procedural defeat last week, Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., was asked if he would continue bringing up the bill in the
hopes of creating more pressure for its passage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not as long as the president has got the problems he has,''
McCain said. ``We don't talk about HMO's anymore, we don't talk
about taxes anymore, we don't talk about Social Security anymore.
There's only one thing on everybody's mind and everybody knows it.
That's the great tragedy of the whole thing we are going through.''

MARKET PLACE: FOR CHIEF EXECUTIVES, HOME RUN SEASON ENDS

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Until the recent market slump, chief executives had been hitting
financial home runs like Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa. With
compensation tied increasingly to the rising stock market, outfield
walls were moving in every year _ so much so that many executives
started betting they could hit the ball far beyond the fence.
</P>
<P>
   Since July, however, stocks have been broadly lower. Even with
Monday's strong gains, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, for
example, is down 14 percent from its high on July 17. With the
slump _ and uncertainty about the market's future _ the challenge
chief executives face to make their stock options pay off looks
very different. Executive compensation experts say that if the
market goes into a prolonged slump, the mix and structure of
executive pay packages may change in ways both small and large.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the system works correctly, and if corporations and boards
are serious about pay for performance, there should not be an
alteration in how compensation is delivered,'' said Judith Fischer,
publisher of Executive Compensation Reports, a newsletter. ``But I
think totally new mechanisms will start springing up if the market
does not rebound.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the recent slide, for example, some companies were
backing away from signing onto compensation plans that require
above-average performance before paying off, partly out of fear
that the market was overheated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have seen some people getting cold feet,'' said Robin
Ferracone, president of SCA Consulting in Los Angeles, whose firm
has designed many recent executive compensation plans that set
tougher hurdles for executives.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ferracone and others said that in the event of a prolonged
slump, executives might start requesting that part of their pay be
tied to measures other than the stock price, such as long-term
earnings growth. That is what happened in the flat stock market of
the 1970s, only to be abandoned increasingly for pay tied more to
stock performance.
</P>
<P>
   Such a strategy has paid off handsomely in recent years. The
average salary and bonus of 279 chief executives of large companies
was $2.1 million last year, according to Graef Crystal, editor of
the Crystal Report newsletter on executive compensation. However,
the present value of stock options they received, which give them
the right to buy stock at a set price for a set period of time,
helped push the value of the average pay package to $8.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the drop in the stock market has knocked tens of
millions of dollars worth of paper profits off the value of many
executives' stock options. For others who have signed up for more
challenging compensation packages, the likelihood that those plans
will pay out has also dropped significantly.
</P>
<P>
   Consider John Reed, chairman of Citicorp. Earlier this year,
Reed received 300,000 stock options at about $120. But there was an
important catch. For those options to vest, Citicorp stock had to
reach $200 within five years, and stay at or above that mark for 10
trading days within a 30-day period.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, on the day the proposed merger of Citicorp and
Travelers Group was announced, Reed was well on his way to reaching
his mark _ Citicorp's stock hit its high for the year of $182 on
April 6. But Citicorp's stock closed Monday at $101.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is looking at the price barrier through the wrong end of a
telescope, and he is doing that perched under five feet of water,''
Crystal said. ``It's very hard to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed has plenty of company. When Richard Nanula left his post as
Disney's chief financial officer to become chief executive of
Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide Inc., he signed up for a pay
package that included 3 million stock options with exercise prices
ranging from $53.2875 to $76.125. When his move was announced April
15, Starwood's stock reached a high that day of $53, just shy of
the strike price of his first million options. Since then, Starwood
shares have fallen to $32.0625.
</P>
<P>
   At Circuit City Stores Inc., Richard Sharp, its chief executive,
was closing in this summer on a stock price of $59, the exercise
price of 1 million options he was granted in the 1997 fiscal year,
when the stock was just under $30. But after reaching a high of
$54.50 on July 14, Circuit City's stock has since dropped to
$33.5625.
</P>
<P>
   Other executives received enormous grants of stock options in a
single year, agreeing not to receive any more for several years.
Depending on how the market performs over the next few years, they
may wish they had stuck with smaller annual option grants.
</P>
<P>
   Reuben Mark, chairman of Colgate Palmolive Co., received a grant
last year of 2.6 million stock options to last him through 2003.
The exercise price of the options was set at levels between 10
percent and 70 percent over the market price of $62.563 on Nov. 7
when they were granted. Although the stock ran up to a high of
$98.875 on July 24, it has since sunk to Monday's close of
$72.9375.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, a bear market would certainly test chief
executives' commitment to sticking to the letter of their
employment contract.
</P>
<P>
   For example, more than 20 percent of the country's 1,000 largest
companies have adopted guidelines in the last five years that
require top officers to own stock equal in value to several times
their annual salaries. The goal of such guidelines was to create
the perception that executives were in the same boat as outside
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   But in a falling market, top executives face potentially two
doses of bad news. Not only would the value of their personal
holdings in company stock be falling, but if companies are vigilant
about enforcing the guidelines, they will also make the chief
executive buy even more stock to remain within the guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Because such guidelines are a relatively recent phenomenon,
``I'm not completely sure how many teeth there are in them,'' said
Steven Hall, managing director of Pearl Meyer &AMP; Partners, a
compensation consulting firm in New York.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, many companies may be tempted to reprice their stock
options, a practice used by many concerns in recent years that have
not joined in the bull market. Repricing, which effectively lowers
the bar over which employees must jump for the options to pay off,
has come under growing scrutiny by institutional investors and the
media, and a number of consultants said they expected many
companies would resist the temptation to reprice.
</P>
<P>
   One alternative, of course, is to simply grant new stock options
at a lower price, using the argument that executives need such
incentives to keep them from jumping ship to a competitor. Such a
move, however, could also anger shareholders by further diluting
the value of their stock.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Edelstein, a principal with Todd Organization, an
executive benefits consulting firm, said that many companies whose
performance faltered before the broader market dip are now
considering increasing the interest rate paid on deferred executive
compensation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies are exploring alternatives to stock options,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Paula Todd, a principal with the Towers Perrin consulting firm,
said many executives may also be exercising stock options this year
to cash in the gains of recent years. That could create enormous
public relations problems next year if the market is still in a
slump, she said, when proxies show chief executives pocketing
enormous wealth for the year, despite poor performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gains may be based on seven or eight years of good
returns,'' she said. ``But that big number hits you whenever they
exercise, and the shareholders at that moment may not be feeling so
warmly towards the CEO.''

   Tellabs Inc. called off its planned acquisition of Ciena Corp.
on Monday, after diminished financial prospects, scuttled sales and
a steep drop in the share prices of both companies made the deal
untenable.
</P>
<P>
   The already depressed shares of both companies hit new lows
after the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   When Tellabs announced in June that it would acquire Ciena in a
stock swap then valued at $7.3 billion, it was billed as the merger
of two rising stars in the fast-growing market for
telecommunications equipment. But Ciena, an early leader in a
technology for expanding the capacity of fiber optic networks, has
seen its star dim as larger, more diverse competitors like Lucent
Technologies Inc. have undercut its pricing to grab sales and gain
market share. Tellabs' growth has slowed as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``What really killed this deal was not the pretext of a
strategic fit, but that management and Wall Street's estimates of
Ciena's prospects were unreasonably high,'' said Greg Mesniaeff, an
analyst with Robinson Humphrey in Atlanta. ``It happened that all
the planets were misaligned.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed merger survived Ciena's loss last month of an AT&AMP;T
sale estimated at more than $100 million. But the deal unraveled
after the company last week lost a sale to Digital Teleport Inc.,
estimated to be worth about $25 million, to Pirelli S.p.A. Ciena
then had to announce that results for its third fiscal quarter,
which ended Aug. 1, would fall far below analysts' estimates and
that revenues and profit margins for the fourth quarter and next
year would also be reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Decimated by the string of negative events, Ciena shares closed
Monday at $13.19, down $2.75, a fraction of their 52-week high of
$92.37. Tellabs shares, after initially trading up on the
announcement, dropped after management disclosed in a conference
call with securities analysts that its third-quarter results would
fall below estimates. Tellabs closed at $37.69, down $7.31, down 40
percent from its 52-week high of $93.12.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tea leaves were just not right for us to proceed,''
Michael Birck, Tellabs' president and chief executive, said in the
conference call. The companies had revised the deal's share
exchange rate once to reflect Ciena's diminished growth prospects
and were not likely to find a new rate again that would satisfy
shareholders, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just looked at the revised Ciena prospects and factored in
the sentiment of the market,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Birck held out the possibility that Tellabs and Ciena might
collaborate in the future, but he noted that strategic alliances
that did not involve an equity stake were often more difficult than
mergers. He said Tellabs still regarded the technology pioneered by
Ciena _ dense wavelength division multiplexing, or DWDM _ as
strategic, but he added that its availability now from a number of
competitors had rapidly turned DWDM into something of a commodity.
</P>
<P>
   Ciena managers said they were disappointed that the deal fell
through but would proceed as an independent entity.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, our business fundamentals are strong,'' Patrick
Nettles, Ciena's president and chief executive, said in a telephone
interview. ``We've indicated we are going to be competitive on
price by reducing the expectations for profit margins going
forward.'' Though he would not rule out other mergers, he said,
``We're getting back to the business of running our business
first.''
</P>
<P>
   But analysts predicted that Ciena would have a tough time
competing as an independent company. Although most said that the
company retained a lead in technology, its competitors could not
only undercut its pricing, but could also offer a broader and
deeper array of products and services. It made sense for Ciena to
become a part of a larger company, but that will be difficult to do
now, they said, because the expectations created by the terms of
the Tellabs deal were not realistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``There might be another acquirer, but I don't think anybody
else is going to show up until the dust settles,'' said Steven
Levy, a managing director at Lehman Brothers. ``You've got a
falling star that has not stopped falling yet.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ciena reported third-quarter earnings of $2.1 million Monday, or
2 cents a share fully diluted, down from $35.7 million, or 36 cents
a share, in the comparable period a year ago. Sales rose 6 percent,
to $129.1 million, from $121.8 million in the third quarter of the
1997 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Exclusive of one-time charges associated with the settlement of
litigation with Pirelli and merger-related costs, Ciena earned
$16.1 million, or 15 cents a share, in the quarter. Prior to the
company's warning, analysts had expected Ciena to earn 32 cents a
share, according to First Call.
</P>
<P>
   Nettles said that the shortfall reflected not only the loss of
the sale to Digital Teleport but also delays of a number of smaller
sales that are now expected to close in the fourth quarter. As the
company's number of customers has grown, management's ability to
forecast sales and the timing of sales has been stressed, he said,
adding, ``We've got to learn to manage that better.''

<P>
   Q: When I was hired as a manager, my manager and I agreed upon
goals and what I needed to do to meet them. Now she has completely
changed her thoughts about those goals and put new ones in their
place. Her ideas make no sense for the staff, the company or
anybody. How do I convince her that she is wrong? L.W.
</P>
<P>
   A: It is very difficult to convince people that they are wrong,
and it is arguably wrong to presume that your objective. After all,
even when shown a clear, measurable, irrefutable error in their
thinking, many people still have a hard time admitting they made a
mistake. If you take something as debatable as goals and try to
convince your manager that she is mistaken in this area, you are
trying to squeeze water out of a brick.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than focusing on her being wrong, there are some other
strategies that may work better. Obviously, the first step is for
you to honestly review and assess her approach. Remember, she
thinks that you are absolutely wrong.
</P>
<P>
   If you still find that her approach is strictly in the slow
lane, then you should discuss your suggestions with her. However,
your objective is not to prove her wrong; rather, it is to jointly
develop a more effective strategy.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, present your points in a professional, factual and
nonjudgmental style. Try to use words that have a strong positive
emotional charge for her and try to include phrases with which she
can only agree. In fact, throughout the discussion, she should have
numerous opportunities to agree with you and say yes. Remember that
each little yes helps lead to the big one.
</P>
<P>
   If she still insists that you charge down the wrong path, you
may want to opt for the path that leads to her manager.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Our company just completed a very expensive refurbishment of
our offices. The quality of the workmanship is high, but the
problem is with functionality. Several of us are now having
problems accessing the people we need to deal with. What should we
do? S.E.
</P>
<P>
   A: Employees often have excellent ideas regarding physical
improvements in the work environment, and making changes without
them is simply playing corporate roulette. In this case, the gamble
did not pay off.
</P>
<P>
   Employee satisfaction and productivity clearly are impacted by
working conditions. While wonderful surroundings do not
automatically improve performance, problems with working conditions
can definitely undermine it. And, more importantly, employee ideas,
input and suggestions on issues that affect their work not only
lead to better decisions and increased acceptance of change, such
participation also contributes to employee motivation.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, you and your associates should discuss the
problematic physical barriers among yourselves and try to devise
some adjustments. Ideally, your suggestions will deal less with
moving walls and more with moving people.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is to meet with management to discuss your ideas.
If you meet an immovable wall, it will be a clear sign that there
are more than just physical barriers in this company.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have been a manager here for several months, and although
things were chaotic when I joined, I figured that they would settle
down in time. But nothing has changed. It is always one crisis or
another, systems mean nothing and everyone is running around. I'm
ready to quit. Is there anything that can be done in this
situation? D.C.
</P>
<P>
   A: There is something to be said for a match between an
employee's style, standards and objectives, and those of the
organization in which he or she works. A good match sets the
foundation for personal satisfaction, productivity, commitment and
growth. In your situation, it sounds like the match is ready to
ignite.
</P>
<P>
   This does not mean that you are in a bad company or, conversely,
that there is anything wrong with you. It simply means that this
company is not right for you.
</P>
<P>
   You can meet with management to discuss specific aspects of your
job that need more formalization, organization and structure, but
the prognosis is not very good. The chaos probably emanates from
the top of the company, and may arguably be serving it very well.
In fact, there is a school of thought that contends that chaos in
an organization is a source of creativity, spontaneity and energy.
</P>
<P>
   However, chaos can be stifling when pushed to its limit. In your
case, it sounds like you and the company have been pushed to the
limit. Take a look at your industry and see if this chaotic
environment is typical of it, and then take a look at yourself and
what you really want in a job. &QL;

 &HT;    MINORITIES, SUSPICIOUS OF GOVERNMENT, STILL BACKING CLINTON
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ African Americans, long suspicious of the nation's
law enforcement establishment, have become President Clinton's most
ardent defenders in his bid to withstand impeachment, while among
Latinos, another key constituency, leaders say there is growing
uneasiness over investigating the personal lives of politicians.
</P>
<P>
   For many African Americans, independent counsel Kenneth Starr's
investigation of Clinton's sexual affair with Monica Lewinsky is
not unlike J. Edgar Hoover's infamous investigation of the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr.'s sex life in the early 1960s, said David
Bositis, a senior policy analyst at the Joint Center for Political
and Economic Studies, the nation's leading African American think
tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``The word 'prosecutor' has an entirely different meaning in the
African American community than in the white community,'' said
Bositis. ``Hoover probably spent millions of dollars investigating
King, and Hoover didn't even have the excuse of an independent
counsel law.''
</P>
<P>
   A history of police brutality and persecution of blacks by the
nation's law enforcement system has prompted many African American
officials to rally behind the president, not in approval of his
conduct but to ensure that the president gets a fair hearing as
Congress proceeds on Starr's report, said Rep. Sheila Jackson
(D-Texas).
</P>
<P>
   ``For those of us with a history in the civil rights movement,
this is an issue of fundamental fairness,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-nine of the 35 members of the House Congressional Black
Caucus voted last week against public release of Starr's report to
Congress. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), who heads the caucus,
vowed that her organization intends to be ``the fairness cop'' as
Congress decides what to do about Starr's report of possible
impeachable offenses by the president.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the fairness issue, however, many African Americans view
Clinton as their most important political ally since Lyndon
Johnson, standing up to Republican-led efforts to do away with
affirmative action, programs designed in the late 1960s to correct
past discrimination and ensure equal opportunity for minorities,
and conducting a year-long ``national conversation'' to mend racial
divisions in the country.
</P>
<P>
   A poll by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press
just before Starr's report was released showed Clinton with an 88
percent job approval rating among African Americans, considerably
higher than the 61 percent approval rating among whites.
</P>
<P>
   The poll did not provide such a breakdown among Hispanics, but
Hispanic leaders at the grassroots level suggested Monday that
Hispanic support for Clinton mirrors the national trend, with
roughly two out of three approving of the job he is doing but
disapproving of his personal conduct.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1996 election, Clinton received 88 percent of African
Americans votes and slightly more than 70 percent of Hispanic
votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Latinos are pretty much mainstream,'' said Guillermo Galindo,
incoming chairman of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce in Dallas.
``They don't like what the president did, but they think he's been
a pretty good president overall.''
</P>
<P>
   The political fall of former HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros,
accused of lying to the FBI about a mistress, has contributed to
Hispanic concerns about investigating the personal lives of public
officials, Galindo added.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is whether we should be looking into such
matters,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rosa Orenstein, a lawyer, said a meeting of Democratic and
Republican Hispanic leaders in Dallas Saturday concluded with ``the
overwhelming feeling `` that Starr's investigation had gone too far
into Clinton's personal life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it really our business to be peeping into windows?'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, in contrast to the
black caucus, has not asserted any caucus role if Congress proceeds
with impeachment hearings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be that the Hispanic leadership is stuck in a political
fix,'' said Rodolpho O. de la Garza, a professor of government at
the University of Texas in Austin and vice president of the Thomas
Rivera Policy Institute, a Latino-oriented think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanic leaders are promoting Energy Secretary Bill Richardson
as a possible vice presidential running mate for the Democratic
nominee in 2000, de la Garza noted: ``And if the nominee is (Vice
President Al), Gore, (Hispanics) criticizing Clinton now could hurt
Richardson's chances.''

MANAGEMENT OFFENDS ALLISON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Bruins president/general manager Harry Sinden says he
is prepared to let Jason Allison, Anson Carter, and Kyle McLaren
sit home all season rather than meet the free agents' salary
demands. The sides are no closer to a resolution than they were
July 1 when the players became Group 2 (restricted) free agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all intents and purposes, we've quit negotiating with any
of them,'' said Sinden Monday. ``We'll have three Nedveds on our
hands and we're ready for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Petr Nedved opted to sit out the entire 1997-98 season because
he couldn't get the salary he wanted from the Pittsburgh Penguins.
</P>
<P>
   Allison, who is in London, Ontario, said he was offended by the
Nedved reference and by the notion that the Bruins were done
negotiating.
</P>
<P>
   ``He quit negotiating?'' said Allison. ``I just want to know
when he started. I don't want to hit a home run. I just want to get
on base and they're trying to strike me out. I just want to hear
how they're justifying not trying to sign me. They haven't tried
seriously to get a deal done or even negotiated with us. That's a
bad attitude to take. It's not going to help me, it's not going to
help the team, and it's not going to help the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Allison said he would be willing to discuss a one-year contract
or a three-year contract. The Bruins have said they don't want to
talk about a two-year deal. Allison said the Bruins told his agent
three times that if he wants a one-year deal, he has to take his
qualifier (a 10 percent raise over last year's salary of $600,000).
Allison, who was the ninth-leading scorer in the league, said he'd
be happy to talk about an incentive-laden deal with a reasonable
raise in base salary. He feels the Bruins aren't being fair.
</P>
<P>
   Allison has seen management's quotes about being fearful he
won't be able to repeat his success of last season. If that's the
case, he'll agree to bonuses and would get big money based only on
performance. He said so far the Bruins won't talk about that.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that his salary demands for a three-year deal
are high but he believes the Bruins' offer of $750,000 a year is
outrageously low.
</P>
<P>
   If there is no break in the stalemate, Allison said he will sit
out the year. He said he would begin looking into job opportunities
in the International League and in Europe, just in case.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could've gotten everyone signed before camp,'' said
Allison. ``But they never tried. It's sad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't given up on them. How could I give up on them? We
haven't even started yet. There's so much opportunity here. We have
a good, young team. The last thing I want to do is sit out the
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prospect of being in Boston is exciting. I think we could
win the Stanley Cup in three or four years. It's a great hockey
city and it's a shame. It's a shame that they punish people for
playing well. It's like you don't want to do too well or you get
punished.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' fourth free agent, Ted Donato, would like either to
be assured of an opportunity here or traded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teddy doesn't seem to be able to come to grips with what he
wants to do,'' said Sinden. ``I don't know where that's going to
go. That really is in his hands right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden intimated that the NHL Players' Association might be the
reason there are vast numbers of Group 2's out of camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no evidence of this but it seems to be somewhat
organized across the league,'' said Sinden. ``I think there were at
least 100 players in this position. If it's organized in this
manner, chances are it's not going to be resolved until they change
as a group, as opposed to Boston dealing with their players or some
other team dealing with their players. If I'm right about that, it
could be a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Allison said that theory was patently false and that he and his
agent, Bob Gerow, will not even talk to the Players' Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NHLPA called me and I won't even go,'' said Allison. ``I
don't believe they should have anything to do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   As days and weeks go by, Sinden said, it will be more difficult
for the missing players to acclimate once they're back in the
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much like what we have to face with an injury,'' he said.
``If a player is out for a period of time, there's another period
of time before he can really help you on the ice. It's probably the
same with these players. They're probably doing some skating.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we get them back, they'll probably have to go through a
training camp period for a couple of weeks. If you go really deep
in the season, you might as well forget it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to sign all three. It would be very easy to sign them,
just give them what they want. That's the case all across the
league and it happens way too much.''

ATTORNEY GENERAL WANTS DETAILS OF AUTO RATES SESSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Attorney General Scott Harshbarger Monday called on
Insurance Commissioner Linda Ruthardt to fully disclose what was
discussed at a private meeting on automobile insurance rates she
held in March with key figures from the insurance industry.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Ruthardt, Harshbarger's office said the March 23
meeting could undermine the integrity of the rate-setting process,
in which Ruthardt is supposed to act much like an impartial judge
ruling on arguments made by the insurance industry, the attorney
general and the state rating bureau.
</P>
<P>
   ``The occurrence of such meetings may introduce a nonpublic
aspect to the setting of rates which is not in the public interest
and/or not in accordance with the law,'' said the letter, which was
signed by Assistant Attorney General Peter Leight.
</P>
<P>
   The March meeting first came to light last week when a former
official in Ruthardt's office wrote a letter to Acting Governor
Paul Cellucci stating that Ruthardt ``is too closely aligned with
the insurers to protect the public adequately.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter was written by Stephen J. D'Amato, former director of
the state rating bureau, a unit within the Division of Insurance
that advocates on behalf of consumers. D'Amato said Ruthardt met
with Daniel Johnston, president of the Automobile Insurers Bureau,
to discuss ``settlement of the profit portion of the 1999 rate
hearing, presumably on terms favorable to the insurance industry.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato acknowledged the meeting occurred before the start of
the official hearing to set rates for next year, but he said the
meeting ``violated the spirit of the law and was inappropriate.
Consumers have a right to expect that the commissioner of insurance
and the auto insurers are not meeting behind closed doors to
`simplify' the profit-rate issues of an upcoming hearing.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Klein, a spokesman for the Division of Insurance, said
Johnston sought the meeting with Ruthardt to simplify the process
of setting rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to see if the commissioner would object,'' Klein
said. He said Ruthardt told the insurance industry officials that
she had no problem with trying to simplify the rate-setting
process, but that the other parties in the process would have to
agree.
</P>
<P>
   Klein said no profit numbers were discussed at the meeting and
added that D'Amato has ``turned it into something sinister and it
really isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato said Monday that a legal adviser to Johnston told him
that resolution of the profit portion of the case, including
specific numbers, were discussed at the meeting. He said the profit
portion of the case is likely to be a key element in next year's
rates. The industry is seeking a 15 percent rate hike for next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston did not return phone calls Monday and Klein was
interviewed prior to the release of the letter from Harshbarger's
office.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato also said in his letter to Cellucci that Ruthardt
threatened one of his staff members for being ``too proconsumer.''
D'Amato did not mention the name of the staff member, but one
source said it was Burt Feinberg, a mathematical analyst who two
years ago uncovered a $176 million mistake in the way rates had
been calculated for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Klein said Feinberg did not want to talk to the press, but he
quoted him as saying, ``He doesn't think anyone tried to have him
fired at any point.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci has largely ignored the many serious charges raised in
the letter from D'Amato, with a spokeswoman calling it
``self-promotional'' when its existence was first reported by The
Globe last week.

HERITAGE (Phoenix) - Marcy Gorman points to a slice of Arizona
history. A modest four-room adobe home built 106 years ago, where a
pioneer laid down roots, raised a family and tilled the land. &UR; But
unlike other frontiersmen, this one didn't make his way to Arizona
from Eastern lands. He came through Mexico and represents a fact
many people fail to realize: Hispanics were among Arizona's first
settlers. &UR;  &UR; Today, Latinos around the country begin celebrating
National Hispanic Heritage Month, which runs from Sept. 15 to Oct.
15. It is a time for Hispanics to honor their past and educate
others about the diversity of their culture and their place in
American society. By JULIE AMPARANO. Story will move in the ``A``
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
GROWTH-FORECAST (Undated) - Job growth is slowing in the West, as
expected. However, Arizona is still third in the nation for
creating new jobs. By CATHERINE REAGOR. Story will move in the
``F'' category. &QL; 
CONDORS (Undated) - Arizona will host more California condors than
California when nine more of the endangered giant vultures are
released at a second site north of the Grand Canyon _ the Hurricane
Cliffs. The release of additional condors - the fourth such release
in Arizona since 1996 - is tentatively set for late November or
early December. It will bring Arizona's total to 24 birds, four
more than exist in the wild in California. By STEVE YOZWIAK. Story
will move in the ``A`` category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MONTINI-COLUMN (Phoenix) - The gentleman on the telephone spoke
loudly and quickly and hung up before I could answer his question,
which was: ``Hey, moron, what kind of sick lesson do YOU think this
putrid Clinton scandal is teaching our children?'' There isn't one
lesson being taught, but many. For example, children might learn
that many of our most opinionated citizens choose to speak
anonymously into telephones. E.J.MONTINI. Story will move in the
``A'' and ``K'' categories. &QL; 
 &QL; 
EDIT-BASEBALL (Undated) - Again it's a race between Sammy Sosa and
Mark McGwire. They have been a tonic for the country and for
baseball, and for that we are thankful. Story moved in the ``K''
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
HOYE-COLUMN (Undated) - You want the next ``killer app''?
</P>
<P>
   I got the next killer app . . . right here.
</P>
<P>
   It's an idea that's bumped around in my head for a few years.
But I think it's time has come. OK. So here's my idea: It's called
the home server. You sell people a powerful PC. They plunk it down
in the den. Then, they use it to run an assortment of computer
appliances spread all over the house. My idea is, simply, to give
people computers that fit into their lives.
</P>
<P>
   By DAVID HOYE. Story moved in the ``F`` category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
EGYPT-MANIA (Undated) - It has been 2,000 years since Egypt ceased
to exist as a world power, yet Egypt is all around us. Oh, Mighty
Isis. It is in our culture, in our movies, in our TV shows, in our
literature, in our pockets. A history of the fad, from the days of
Napoleon to Steve Martin's `King Tut.' By RICHARD NILSEN. Story
moved in the ``E'' category. &QL;

   CEO-PAY-MARKETPLACE (Undated) _ Until the recent market slump,
chief executives had been hitting financial home runs like Mark
McGwire and Sammy Sosa. With compensation tied increasingly to the
rising stock market, outfield walls were moving in every year _ so
much so that many executives started betting they could hit the
ball far beyond the fence. Since July, however, stocks have been
broadly lower. With the slump, the challenge chief executives face
to make their stock options pay off looks very different. By Adam
Bryant.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ President Clinton shed the cloak of contrition and
donned the mantle of leadership Monday, using the bully pulpit to
try to talk interest rates downward and proving to Democrats that
he remains their most effective money-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   On a day when Clinton raised about $4 million for Democrats in a
series of exclusive political events, including a private evening
performance of the Broadway musical ``The Lion King,'' major U.S.
allies lined up behind his call to take steps to stimulate the
ailing global economy.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations, an influential
New York policy group, Clinton called for the Group of Seven
industrialized democracies to develop a coordinated plan to get
world markets moving again.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal was quickly endorsed in a statement by the deputy
finance chiefs of the group's other member nations _ Canada,
Britain, France, Italy, Germany and Japan _ who met this weekend in
London on the global financial troubles.
</P>
<P>
   This international support ``is a big deal,'' Clinton later told
60 wealthy Democratic supporters who had shelled out $50,000 per
couple to nibble on a crabmeat salad lunch and listen to the
president. ''This is what politics in America ought to be about.''
</P>
<P>
   Warning that the world economy was facing its toughest challenge
since World War II, Clinton said the risks of a deepening global
downturn now outweigh those of inflation _ a carefully crafted
endorsement of interest rate cuts.
</P>
<P>
   After a generation of tailoring interest rates to combat
inflation, ''clearly the balance of risk has now shifted,'' Clinton
told the Council on Foreign Relations. ''The industrial world's
chief priority today plainly is to spur growth.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House does not control interest rates, which are the
domain of market forces and the Federal Reserve Board, an
independent agency with a mandate to act strictly on economic, not
political, forces. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin stressed that
Clinton was not explicitly calling for interest rate reductions.
</P>
<P>
   Still, coming on the heels of Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan's
recent suggestions that interest rates might be headed downward,
the president's remarks were plainly meant to support that
approach.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not directly refer to his legal and political
troubles over the Monica Lewinsky scandal in his remarks at the
luncheon or a later dinner where 400 people paid $10,000 a plate
for a tuna and pasta buffet. But he did predict that Democrats are
''going to do just fine'' in midterm elections Nov. 3 ''if we talk
about these big things and we remember, these elections are never
about us, they're always about the people out on the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Clinton, ''Our problem is not adversity, we will rise in
adversity. Our problem is complacency.''
</P>
<P>
   Appearing to dampen expectations, however, Clinton stressed that
the party of second-term presidents has lost seats in Congress in
every midterm election since the Civil War. Still, he added, ''I
think we're going to beat history.''
</P>
<P>
   Trumpeting one of the signal successes of his administration,
Clinton said that he was looking forward to Oct. 1, which will
conclude the first fiscal year since 1969 that the federal budget
hasn't run a deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't felt like this,'' Clinton said, ''since the week
before Chelsea was born.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In Clinton's first day of public appearances outside the
Washington area since Friday's public release of Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr's report to Congress on the Lewinsky scandal,
Democratic leaders worked hard to help Clinton change the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the fund-raising luncheon, Democrats scrupulously
avoided mentioning the matter and enthusiastically praised
Clinton's record on the economy and his efforts to advance the
party's agenda in areas ranging from Social Security and health
care reform to education, the environment and crime.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are talking with the American people about the issues that
they care about,'' said House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo..
Gephardt has been sharply critical of Clinton in the Lewinsky
matter, but predicted Monday that his fellow Democrats would regain
control of the House from Republicans in the coming elections. ''In
November,'' Gephardt said, ''we will win the House back.''
</P>
<P>
   However, both Gephardt and Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle,
D-S.D., issued statement in Washington urging Clinton to tell his
lawyers to stop arguing that his misstatements under oath to
investigators did not legally amount to perjury.
</P>
<P>
   ``The considered judgment of the American people is not going to
rise or fall on the fine distinctions of a legal argument, but on
straight talk and the truth,'' said Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly agree with those who have grown impatient with
hairsplitting over legal technicalities,'' said Daschle.
</P>
<P>
   But party officials in New York said that polls were wrong in
suggesting that the Lewinsky scandal had so disgusted Democrats
that many would stay home on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our turnout will be there on November 3 to fight for values
and principles and priorities,'' Steve Grossman, national chairman
of the Democratic National Committee predicted at the luncheon,
held at a private penthouse residence. ''We will be able to bring
this victory home.''
</P>
<P>
   White House aides were heartened by the turnout at the
fund-raisers, saying it signaled the party's continuing support for
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a lot of strong supporters of the Democratic Party
who believe very much in what the president and Democrats are
trying to accomplish for the country,'' said White House spokesman
Barry Toiv. ''Their support enables candidates to communicate their
message to the American people. The president certainly is going to
continue his efforts on behalf of the party, and we appreciate the
support.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a day of respite from the intense circumspection
going on in Washington, President Clinton came to New York on
Monday in pursuit of money and perhaps solace, and found some of
both.
</P>
<P>
   Making his first trip since the release of the Starr report and
accompanied by his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Clinton gave a
speech on the global economy before a foreign policy group and
planned to circulate at three crowded Democratic fund-raisers,
including an evening performance of ``The Lion King.'' Among a
populace long supportive of him, he was largely greeted with
encouragement to proceed with his job, though he also encountered
his share of dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   In a city in which presidential visits are humdrum and often
disdained for the gridlock they add to already car-choked streets,
there was keener interest than usual in Clinton's itinerary in the
wake of the report from the independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like what he did, but I'm not angry at him,'' said
Mary Kane, a medical administrator trying to catch a view of the
president as he arrived for his speech Monday morning on East 68th
Street, down the block from where she works. ``I'd love to see him.
I'd tell him, `Good luck and I wish you well.'''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout a day that the Democratic Party said raised more than
$4 million, there seemed to be more affirmation than antipathy
among hundreds who lined the avenues as Clinton's motorcade wound
its way from a speech at the Council on Foreign Relations on 68th
Street and Park Avenue to the trio of fund-raisers. People pressed
against police sawhorses along Park Avenue clapped and waved as he
proceeded to lunch on 60th Street. There were only a handful of
picketers calling for his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think what he did was necessarily awful,'' said Adam
Gana, a freshman at Hunter College, which is situated just across
from where the president was speaking. ``I think maybe he should
have been a little more considerate and not lied. But I like the
president. I don't think he's a bad guy. If I could get a word with
him, I'd ask him about the universal health coverage rather than
the stupid affairs he's had.''
</P>
<P>
   Later on, as Clinton passed down Fifth Avenue on the way to the
Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, people were lined seven and eight deep for
10 blocks, craning for a look at him, and some of them waited
patiently for more than an hour. When he approached the hotel,
about half of the crowd there cheered and the other half booed.
</P>
<P>
   Some called for his resignation. ``I feel he should resign,''
said Ivan Richards, 30, a Manhattan therapist. ``It's put a stop on
our country. We can't get anything done.''
</P>
<P>
   Others wanted him to fight on. ``I'm out here because it's still
exciting to see the president,'' said Andrea DeMaso, 25, a
marketing executive from Dix Hills, N.Y. ``I think he's doing a
good job and has only done what all the presidents before him have
done.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At his various stops, Clinton sidestepped any discussion of the
Lewinsky matter. His morning speech was presented to about 150
people, who were polite but not especially enthusiastic. Some
council members who had been invited stayed away.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those who did come were reading newspaper coverage of
the Lewinsky matter and then hastily tucked the papers away when
word came that the president had arrived. Theodore Sorensen, who
attended the speech, summed up the feelings of many by saying that
while Clinton's lying under oath was ``inexcusable, it does not
amount to high crimes and misdemeanors.'' Some others, who insisted
on anonymity, were more critical and said that his conduct had
diminished the presidency and they hoped that he would resign.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton took no questions, and when a reporter twice shouted to
him whether he would accept censure from Congress, Clinton ignored
him.
</P>
<P>
   At a $50,000-a-couple fund-raising luncheon on Fifth Avenue,
Clinton did allude to the latest events when he said, ``The
adversity of the moment, I think, has led us to this record
turnout. Why? Because people made a decision and they thought they
were needed and they stood up.''
</P>
<P>
   The luncheon was held in the two-story penthouse of Denise Rich,
a socialite, philanthropist and lyricist, whose ex-husband, Marc
Rich, is a fugitive commodities trader who fled the country rather
than face prosecution in a tax case. Sixty couples filled tables
arranged in three rooms, and others were turned away because of
lack of space. Clinton had his grilled sea bass in a different room
from his wife. Vice President Al Gore and Rep. Richard Gephardt
attended, though Charles Rangel was the solitary New York
politician to show up.
</P>
<P>
   In his introduction, Steve Grossman, chairman of the Democratic
National Committee, said, ``Mr. President, it seems to me that you
have demonstrated, at least in my adult lifetime, a higher
commitment to the kind of moral leadership that I value in public
service and public policy than any other person I've ever met.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in his brief remarks, said, ``I know that I speak for
Hillary when I say we thank you for your personal friendship and
support. It means more now than ever, and we'll never forget it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon, Clinton stopped at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel,
the lodging choice of presidents since the days of Hoover, where he
had a rest break before his evening appearances. He called Sammy
Sosa and congratulated the Chicago Cubs' outfielder on matching
Mark McGwire's record 62 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the dignitary-hardened hotel staff said there was
more excitement than customary given recent news developments. ``I
have no problem with him being here,'' said Geraldine Grays, a
lobby attendant polishing the brass banisters. ``Just leave him
alone. Let him do the job. I know some of the guests said he should
be seen today. He needs all the support he can get.''
</P>
<P>
   In the evening, Clinton and his wife dined with 400 people who
had paid $10,000 a plate at the Supper Club, a dinner and dancing
establishment on West 47th Street. The president's arrival
interrupted guests trying to reach their rooms at the Hotel Edison
next door to the club. Police lined them up and admitted them two
at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Several New York politicians put in appearances at the dinner,
including Mark Green and Geraldine Ferraro, two of the Democratic
candidates for Senate.

 &HT;    COLUMN: The sadness lies in what `might have been'
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I last saw him at a basketball game with Bill and Hillary
Clinton. Everyone was happy, enjoying life. We weren't at the game
ourselves. We were somewhere in Kentucky, en route to Illinois, and
had bivouacked at a motel next to a Mexican restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``That looks like Barlow!'' my wife suddenly said.
</P>
<P>
   I looked up from my enchiladas and frijoles at the television
mounted overhead. The camera had cut away from play on the court,
where Arkansas was playing Arizona, and there he was on national
TV, out of his seat along with the president of the United States,
the two of them cheering a Razorback run in the Final Four in
Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   We knew they were friends from way back, the one from Hope, the
other from Paragould. He didn't have the kind of spare cash it took
to be a Friend of Bill, but he was a believer in Bill. Many were.
</P>
<P>
   ``We both came from small towns in Arkansas,'' Barlow Herget was
saying Friday afternoon as the Internet was fanning the Starr
report to the prurient everywhere. ``We were of the generation that
fought against Orval Faubus. I'm 56 and Clinton was coming up just
behind me. Mac McLarty (former White House chief of staff) and
David Watkins (who got caught up in the inquiry into the affairs of
the White House travel office) were fraternity brothers of mine.''
</P>
<P>
   The years passed and Barlow Herget, a journalist turned local
politician in Raleigh, N.C., became one of those Arkansans whose
belief in Bill Clinton was personal as much as political. Clinton's
promise was messianic, a deliverance from the South's backward,
segregationist past. He was someone to be proud of, someone who,
you were certain, would not only lift his little state but the
South with it.
</P>
<P>
   No one speaks of him anymore with great pride, except his wife.
Those who once did struggle to hold on to what remains of the pride
they had. He was never exactly an altar boy _ that was part of his
charm. Now, the unseemliness of what has engulfed the president is
the kind of thing that shatters personal and political faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the classic American tragedy _ a man of great promise and
talent brought low by the oldest sin in the Bible,'' Herget said.
</P>
<P>
   He remembers the time he picked candidate Clinton up at
Raleigh-Durham International Airport. It was 1992. ``I drove out in
my 1988 Ford station wagon. At the last minute I had to get it
cleaned _ I thought, `I can't pick him up in a car looking like
that. This could be the future president of the United States.'''
</P>
<P>
   He met Clinton again the next time he flew into Raleigh-Durham,
this time on Air Force One, and they rode together in the
presidential limousine. He and his wife, Millie, attended Clinton's
inaugural ball in 1993 and again in 1997. In the fall of 1993,
Herget lost a mayoral election to a Jesse Helms protege, and that
night Clinton called him at home to offer consolation. ``We
commiserated, and he told me not to lose heart,'' Herget says.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't completely. But he's lost something he doesn't expect
to recover. At 56, you understand that these things happen. Friends
divorce when you had no clue of trouble; families disintegrate;
good kids turn out bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm old enough, I've been around long enough to know that
everybody's got human failings,'' he said. But still ...
</P>
<P>
   He was hardly the only person who believed, once, that Bill
Clinton's star could only rise, higher and higher. It was like
someone telling you to keep an eye on a young baseball prospect who
was the real thing, the next Joe DiMaggio. Now, in retrospect, you
recall Paul Simon's lyric as lamentation: ``Where have you gone,
Joe DiMaggio, a nation turns its lonely eyes to you.''
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't the next DiMaggio; he wasn't even very good. But he
could have been.
</P>
<P>
   ```Disappointed' is not strong enough a word,'' Herget said.
``I've wrestled with this. It's as if your younger brother came
home from college and did that which he ought not have done. I feel
like he has betrayed his own promise.''
</P>
<P>
   It goes without saying that he has betrayed others as well,
beginning with his wife and daughter. But for many who've known him
most of their lives, who knew long before others that he could be
reckless in his personal habits, his undoing has a particular
sadness. The Greek dramatists understood tragedy in this way, the
fatal flaw, there from the start, that brings a man down.
Shakespeare understood it.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is that tragedy, in their hands, was never as
tawdry as this. The fallen hero retains something of his nobility,
even in ruin. In Clinton's case, friends and believers alike can
only contemplate a greatness that never was _ or, at best, might
have been. But it is no less painful for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's distasteful, it's embarrassing, and nobody likes
being lied to,'' Herget said in a heavy voice. ``But I honestly
appreciate so much that this kid's done. I'm just sorry about what
he's done to himself.''

PRIMARIES EXPECTED TO DRAW 1 MILLION VOTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADRIAN WALKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ After well over a year of debating the issues and
taking the measure of the candidates, an estimated 1 million
Massachusetts voters are expected to go to the polls Tuesday in
Republican and Democratic primaries that will determine the general
election candidates in November for governor and a host of other
statewide races.
</P>
<P>
   A hotly-contested Republican primary pitting Acting Governor
Paul Cellucci against Treasurer Joseph D. Malone will finally reach
its judgment day, while three Democratic contenders _ former
congressman Brian Donnelly, Attorney General Scott Harshbarger and
former state senator Patricia McGovern _ will vie for the right to
carry the Democratic banner in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the most interesting races on the ballot are the attorney
general's race, in which State Senator Lois G. Pines of Newton and
Middlesex District Attorney Thomas F.Reilly have waged the slugfest
of the political season, and in the 8th Congressional District,
where 10 Democrats are battling to succeed retiring US
Representative Joseph P. Kennedy 2d.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State William M. Galvin estimated turnout at about
30 percent - higher then the turnout in the barely contested
primaries of 1994, but well below the voter participation in 1990,
the last gubernatorial election without an incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're projecting 300,00 voters in the (Republican) primary,
and about 700,000 on the Democratic side,'' Galvin said Monday. He
said absentee ballots, a prime indicator of turnout, indicated that
those estimates might be a tad inflated for the Democratic side.
``It's active where there are local contests and in the Eighth
District, and quiet elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, with fewer than 36 hours left before the polls close,
candidates crisscrossed the state thanking volunteers, appearing on
radio talk shows and preparing for massive rallies in Dorchester
and West Roxbury that traditionally mark a symbolic closing of the
fall political madness in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Under gray skies at Downtown Crossing, Democratic gubernatorial
candidate Patricia McGovern attempted to way-lay voters as they
hurried out to lunch Monday. The crowd was sparse, but the media
presence thick, as McGovern hammed it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the Sammy Sosa of Massachusetts politics,'' she said,
referring to the Chicago Cubs slugger who has been chasing Mark
McGwire for baseball's home run title. ``I've always been behind
the other guy, but I hope I can catch him and pass him.''
</P>
<P>
   McGovern said she has spent the final days of the campaign
travelling the state and receiving warm and supportive words from
the voters. On Election Day, she said, ``I'm going to vote and then
I'm going to rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger began the day touring a Quincy housing development
with US Representative William Delahunt, who was an early
supporter. He later toured Uphams Corner in Dorchester with state
Representative Charlotte Golar Richie,and visited businesses and an
elderly housing development in Jamaica Plain before heading for the
rally in Adams Village in Dorchester.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we're going into the hard-core homestretch of getting
voters to the polls,'' said Harshbarger spokesman Edward Cafasso.
``It's about executing the last two days of the game plan and
getting ready for the general election.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci campaigned in the North End in the morning and greeted
voters at the Back Bay MBTA station. He was planning a tour of four
Boston taverns last night squeezed around appearances at various
rallies.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci said he was concerned that the attention on President
Clinton's woes in Washington could drive down turnout.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big story down in Washington pushed the campaign here off
the front page,'' he noted. ``That kind of froze the race over the
weekend. But we've been focusing on getting out our vote. It
doesn't have much to do with what's on the front page or what's on
the news.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone said he was going into the final relaxed and confident.
He spent the last weekend of the campaign greeting voters at Boston
College and New England Patriots and was making the rounds of radio
and television shows Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been on the phone talking to a lot of our key volunteers
and they're energized and positive and I'm looking for a good day
(Tuesday),'' Malone said. ``I think those Reagan republicans will
turn out and vote for me and carry the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Galvin, the state's top election official, reminded voters that
if they have pledged a party affiliation they can vote only in
their party's primary. Unenrolled voters can take a take a ballot
for either party but can only cast votes for either Democratic or
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Donnelly, the former ambassador, said he believed his
insurgent campaign had helped elevate the dialogue among the
Democratic candidates. Donnelly said he used the final debate
between the Democratic candidates last week in Springfield to put
quality of life and urban issues on the agenda this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the rank and file's decision,'' Donnelly said. ``They'll
make it, I'll live with it. I think my presence helped set the tone
of the debate and the substance of the debate. If you look back,
before I entered all anyone was talking about was who could give
the biggest tax cut. In Springfield, we were talking about
libraries, schools, and cities.''

 &HT;    Newsmagazines focus on Starr report
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   As expected, all three newsmagazines this week are Starr-struck.
Newsweek ($2.95) devoted 29 pages to excerpts from the special
prosecutor's report and a six-page rebuttal from President
Clinton's lawyers. U.S. News &AMP; World Report ($2.95) had 10 pages of
excerpts and no rebuttal and Time ($2.95), apparently counting on
its Time.com Web site to handle serious browsers, included only
five pages of excerpts and a one-page rebuttal. All the pundits are
speculating about Clinton's fate, but former presidential aide
George Stephanopoulos describes the most likely scenario: ``Clinton
won't willingly go home _ and Hillary, who worked on the Watergate
impeachment, is even more reluctant to have her husband join Nixon
in the ranks of the resigned,'' he writes. ``My guess is that
Clinton will convince 34 senators that concealing an adulterous
affair doesn't merit removal from office.'' Meanwhile, Time's
Margaret Carlson says the first lady is coping with the scandal by
doing vigorous exercise workouts on state-of-the-art equipment.
</P>
<P>
   BEING MIKE: Forget about the pretentious article by an anonymous
contributor about ``My First Gulfstream.'' The must-read article in
October's Vanity Fair ($3.95) is the excerpt from Michael Jordan's
autobiography, ``For the Love of the Game: My Story.'' As the
superstar ponders his future beyond basketball, he reflects on the
forces that allowed him to succeed. Several times, Jordan recalls,
he had close brushes with death. He nearly suffocated as a baby,
barely escaped electrocution as a 2-year-old and almost drowned as
a college student. After that, Jordan says, ``How can you say there
isn't a plan for all of us?'' So what about retirement? When it
happens, he says, ``I am not going to mind being out of the
spotlight.'' Also in this issue, the magazine ranks the 50 most
powerful masters of the information age. The Top 5 are Bill Gates ,
Rupert Murdoch, Michael Eisner, Sumner Redstone and Ted Turner.
</P>
<P>
   A MATTER OF STYLE: With its focus on fashion and its
accompanying clothing and fragrance ads, this week's New Yorker
($3) looks more like Vanity Fair than it did when Tina Brown was
editor. But there is substance behind the style. In ``Letter From
Moscow,'' Masha Lipman questions the launching of the Russian
edition of Vogue at a time when the ruble is falling faster than
hemlines. Red is the ``in'' color for fashion, Lipman writes, and
possibly for politics as well. Other fashion coverage includes John
Updike on the men and mores of Coco Chanel and a profile of
designer Charles James, who numbered the Whitneys, Hearst and
Paleys among his clients. Elsewhere in the issue, North Carolina
native Tony Earley writes eloquently _ and sadly _ about the
disappearing dialect of the Appalachians, a form of speech that he
confesses seems ``quare'' to flatlanders.
</P>
<P>
   JANET REBOUNDS: Michael Jackson is not the only one in the
family with problems. In a Rolling Stone ($3) cover story, Janet
Jackson talks about her latest release, ``Velvet Rope,'' her
current tour, and the year of depression and self-doubt after her
last album flopped.
</P>
<P>
   QUICK READS: Stone Mountain Mayor Chuck Burris is in some
glamorous company in the October issue of Ebony ($2.50). The cover
story spotlights some of Hollywood's ``hottest new faces,''
including Lisa Nicole Carson of ``Ally McBeal.'' Featured inside in
a flattering profile, the first black mayor of the former Klan
stronghold in Georgia talks about how times have changed since he
found himself in Stone Mountain park the day of a Klan rally and
was warned to leave. Also of note: The magazine names Atlanta chief
of police Beverly Harvard as one of the ``Top Black Cops'' in the
nation. ...The October issue of Essence ($2.50) lists Oprah
Winfrey, Camille Cosby and Black Entertainment Television executive
Sheila Crump as three of the 20 wealthiest black women.

 &HT;    TBS pays big bucks to rerun `Seinfeld' reruns
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's time to cut another check for Jerry Seinfeld.
</P>
<P>
   In a record cable deal worth more than $100 million, TBS has
purchased national cable and metro Atlanta rights to syndicated
repeats of ``Seinfeld'' to begin in fall 2002 and last four years.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based station will reportedly pay more than $600,000
apiece for 180 ``Seinfeld'' episodes, eclipsing the price Lifetime
earlier negotiated for cable syndication rights to Ellen DeGeneres'
sitcom, ``Ellen.'' Though a cable benchmark, the deal doesn't
approach the nearly $286 million a year NBC will pay for first-run
``ER'' episodes for the next three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But it's still a lot of cash for Seinfeld and his show's
distributor, Columbia TriStar TV. Variety estimates that all
`Seinfeld'' syndication deals to date have bumped the show's
overall gross to much more than $1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   TBS' contract will bump ``Seinfeld'' repeats, a big ratings
booster, off WATL in metro Atlanta. WATL's pact expires in March
2001. There remains an 18-month period between that date and the
start of ``Seinfeld'' on TBS that WATL might purchase.
</P>
<P>
   ``'Seinfeld' is one of the three shows in history _ 'I Love
Lucy' and 'The Andy Griffith Show' are the others _ to sign off at
No. 1,'' said TBS President Bill Burke, who also recently cut deals
for syndicated repeats of ``Friends'' (to start in 2001) and ``Home
Improvement'' and ``The Drew Carey Show'' (both to start in 2002).
``We're very confident of this show. We think it has legs.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, ``Seinfeld'' repeats have been a strong performer,
especially in metro Atlanta. The show, now most often airing at 10
o'clock weeknights on WATL, sometimes beats nearly all prime-time
programming. During the May sweeps, the period stations use to set
ad rates worth millions of dollars, ``Seinfeld'' repeats averaged
nearly 185,000 metro Atlanta homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``May was sensational,'' said Don Hess, WATL programming chief.
But four years from now, he said, ``Seinfeld'' might lose its
ratings heat. ``That's what happened to 'Cheers.'''
</P>
<P>
   Burke, however, thinks TBS got a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``'Seinfeld' is in a very small class of mega-hit shows,'' he
said. ``Networks are not producing a lot of mega-hits anymore. We
think this might be one of the last and wanted to be sure it was on
our schedule.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   With the release today of ``Musical Chairs,'' Hootie &AMP; the
Blowfish show off the band's flexibility, with tunes ranging from
country (``Desert Mountain Showdown'') to R&AMP;B (``What's Going on

explains the diversity by saying that tunes for previus releases
``would end up being a rock 'n' roll song, even if it was written
as a country song. With this record, we just really wanted the
songs to remain intact.''

 &HT;    Jones, Griffin team for `Godot'
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The late Samuel Beckett wanted to see black actors
play his most famous characters: Vladimir and Estragon, the
ever-waiting, ever-befuddled clowns marooned in the bare-stage
universe of 1953's ``Waiting for Godot.''
</P>
<P>
   Joy Zinoman, founding artistic director of Studio Theatre,
didn't know this when she asked Thomas W. Jones and Donald Griffin,
Atlanta-based actors who've enjoyed stage successes in her city, to
play the classic roles. Nor did those stalwarts of Atlanta's
Jomandi Productions ever imagine they'd be invited to star in the
most mystifying but influential play of the postwar era, which
opened last week (to a rave in The Washington Post) and runs
through Oct. 4. Zinoman thought of Jones and Griffin because of
``their friendship, which is so alive. There's a freedom that
carries into their performances.
</P>
<P>
   ``The play scared me to death at first,'' continues the 50ish
Zinoman, ``until I began to approach it not as a cosmic work about
salvation, but a story in which redemption and meaning are found in
the friendship of two valiant vagrants. It's not a political
statement about race.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Zinoman tried to cast a white woman as the slavelike
Lucky, a lesser role, and Beckett's estate turned her down
(``They're monsters _ controlling to the nth degree,'' she adds
hotly). But it was from the estate that Zinoman learned that
Beckett, always obsessive about his plays, once expressed his
desire to see a black Didi and Gogo (as the characters call
themselves). The only such production to date had been in South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, 42, is co-artistic director of Jomandi Productions and
author of two hits that played the Studio (``Bessie's Blues,''
``Birth of the Boom''). Griffin, 40, is an actor with Jomandi and
Alliance Theatre (``The Amen Corner''), an outstanding clown in the
tradition of two well-known Estragons: Bert Lahr and Robin
Williams. Friends for 20 years, Jones and Griffin spoke after a
rehearsal at a restaurant near the Studio.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did this production concept strike you?
</P>
<P>
   Jones: I was stunned. It hit me from left field.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin: I was surprised. Joy told me that when she saw me in
``Seven Guitars'' wearing a bowler (the standard ``Godot''
headware) it started her wheels turning.
</P>
<P>
   Jones: Oh, she came to you first?
</P>
<P>
   Griffin: Right. (Pause. Jones pretends to be put out; Griffin
guffaws).
</P>
<P>
   Griffin: I read this play in college and my reaction was,
``Ohhhhhhhh-kay! Whatever. It ain't `Purlie.''' I mean, I know all
about the play's significance. ... What exactly the brother is
saying, I couldn't tell you.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there a special resonance when the characters are black?
</P>
<P>
   Jones: Every generation of black folks has been told that
something big was coming. I think that's why we bought so heavily
into the Christian ethic. Someone was coming to deliver us. First
we moved to the north but nothing got getter. Then it was
education: We got educated but nothing really changed. So waiting
became our historical motif, like, ``Where's my 40 acres and a
mule?'' When we accept that nobody's coming, we take our destiny
into our hands.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does this ``Godot'' happen in a black world?
</P>
<P>
   Jones: Oh yeah! Joy said to explore it all.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin: It's like vaudeville _ we take it right back to the old
days of black vaudeville.
</P>
<P>
   Jones: There are certain moments with different voices. For
instance, I start out doing Martin Luther King and end up as Jesse
Jackson. (He performs a few lines from the play as if he were
Jackson on a public affairs program.) We push some boundaries. Old
Sam just might climb out of the grave and come after us!
</P>
<P>
   Griffin: Nah, he can't mess with us now.
</P>
<P>
   Jones: I don't know, he might say, ``I wanted to see it black,
but not this bad!'' (They laugh).
</P>
<P>
   Q: The Studio is one of the few small theaters in America that's
thriving (5,000 subscribers) with a balanced racial mix in its
audience. Do you think black audiences will come and connect with
this production?
</P>
<P>
   Jones: I wish I knew. Connecting with this play shouldn't be a
big leap for anyone, though. It has tons of humor. It deals with
issues of power and class that resonate with Jews, resonate with
women, resonate with the Irish. This isn't a production about race
but man's inhumanity to man.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will you bring this production back to Jomandi in Atlanta?
</P>
<P>
   Jones: Sure, if it works _ why not?
</P>

 &HT;    Filmamker tries to trace his roots
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A hit at film festivals around the country (including Sundance
where it won the Freedom of Expression Award), Macky Alston's
``Family Name'' (PBS-check local listings) is a personal
exploration of family matters with a universal significance.
</P>
<P>
   Alston, a white North Carolinian, grew up wondering why some of
the African-American kids at his school had the same last name as
he did. As an adult, he decided to find out. For a start, he
attended separate but equal family reunions. He discovered that,
not only did neither family know about the other family's reunion
but that both families weren't especially eager to have their
mutual history examined. Undeterred, the now New York-based
filmmaker embarked on a geneological quest. In doing so, he used
the Alston history of family secrets as a mirror for his own
once-closeted homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Family Name'' is of particular interest to Southerners (Alston
has kin in Atlanta). Without finger-pointing or rancor, it explores
the peculiar dual legacy fostered by de facto segregation. Part
family album, part detective story, it's a thought-provoking,
touching and ultimately uplifting film.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   (``Family Name'' has an odd Atlanta footnote. Alston, who was
born in Durham, N.C., always knew he had family in Atlanta. So
while researching his film he came here to investigate the Alston
House, which was once owned by his family. When he showed up to
talk to the current residents, he was greeted by a man who agreed
to let the filmmaker return the next day with his camera and crew.
When Alston showed up, however, the house was empty. It turned out
that the man was not the owner and when the director found the real
owner, he learned that the imposter had cleaned the house out and
left without a trace).

 &HT;    Internet, Cable, and networks see ratings rise for Starr's
report
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris and Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Independent counsel Kenneth Starr's report may have been bad
news for President Clinton, but it's been good _ if not great news
_ for the cable TV networks and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In the hours after the release of Kenneth Starr's report Friday,
the Nielsen ratings for the four major cable news networks
increased substantially as news junkies and casual viewers tuned
in. No viewership records were set, though.
</P>
<P>
   Computer users logged on to the Internet in what could amount to
be record-breaking numbers to read the report.
</P>
<P>
   On cable TV, CNN saw the greatest uptick in viewers, nearly
doubling its average ratings for a 24-hour period.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based network drew a 1.4 average rating for the day,
or about 1 million households, said network spokesman Howard
Polskin. The network typically averages a 0.8 rating, or roughly
552,000 households for that time period, he said.
</P>
<P>
   CNN viewership spiked to a 3 rating at 5 p.m., when the
president's lawyers held a news conference to dispute the
allegations in Starr's report, Polskin said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox News also doubled its ratings average for the day after the
report was released, jumping to a 0.4 rating or 131,000 housholds.
</P>
<P>
   MSNBC got a 0.8 average rating or about 354,000 households,
compared with its latest weekday average of 0.3 rating or 139,000
viewers. The network's highest rating was a 1.7, or about 730,000
viewers for ``White House in Crisis: The Starr Report,'' an
hourlong special at 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Its sister network, CNBC, which programs financial news in the
morning and political talk shows at night, saw only a slight
increase in viewership Friday, a spokesman said. Its biggest
performer, ``Geraldo Riviera Live,'' got a 1.5 rating, which means
it was seen in about 1,038,000 homes said spokesman John Brine.
</P>
<P>
   Ratings for the broadcast networks were not immediately
available.
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet, Atlanta-based Web measurement firm Relevant
Knowledge reported that Friday's posting of the Starr report
ignited ``a surfing frenzy'' of major proportions. The company
estimates that 24.7 million ``unique visitors'' logged on, Friday
and over the weekend, presumably to read the report.
</P>
<P>
   The sites that published the report and the rebuttal saw their
traffic increase nearly tenfold. Regional and national news sites
got the most traffic, with a 95 percent increase in traffic and 7
million unique visitors combined.
</P>
<P>
   The heavy traffic was not not good news for Clinton: More than
10 times more users visited sites posting the report than the
president's rebuttal.

CLINTON'S STRATEGY: DENY PERJURY WHILE ADMITTING SIN
</HEADLINE>

 By JAMES BENNETT c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It is surely the strangest debate ever to transfix
the nation's leaders: Does oral sex constitute sexual relations,
and did President Clinton lie when he testified that it did not?
</P>
<P>
   The consensus on Capitol Hill is that it does and he did.
</P>
<P>
   Monday the Democratic leaders of both houses, Sen. Tom Daschle
of South Dakota and Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri, urged
Clinton to stop making fine distinctions.
</P>
<P>
   But despite increasing pressure from Congress, Clinton has no
intention of saying that he perjured himself when he denied under
oath that he had had a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky,
his advisers say.
</P>
<P>
   To do so would be to declare that he broke the law. And an
admission like that, some of his advisers say, would make
impeachment proceedings more likely and might also expose him to
criminal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a rather confusing, two-track White House
strategy. Although Clinton was very precise in his word choice
while denying sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky under oath, he has
chosen to speak very broadly over the last week in admitting
wrongdoing. He is leaving it to his lawyers to be precise, in
denying, point by point, that his acts violated any laws.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, some listeners thought they heard a contradiction
between the president's admission of sin on Friday and his lawyers'
denial of crime. ``I mean, trying to say that the president didn't
lie under oath, but at the same time the president saying that he
did is, to put it mildly, a bit of a conflict,'' Sen. Bob Kerrey,
D-Neb., said Saturday on the CNN program ``Evans, Novak, Hunt, and
Shields.''
</P>
<P>
   The approach also creates a clash over style. On Friday, the
president told a group of clerics that ``legal language must not
obscure the fact that I have done wrong.'' But on Sunday, his
lawyers laid down a barrage of legal language in arguing on
television that Clinton did not commit perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's spokesman, Mike McCurry, said that because of
questions from reporters Clinton's lawyers ``are getting wrapped
around a legal argument about what constitutes perjury. Nonlawyers
don't understand it, I don't understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   But McCurry argued that the question of perjury is for lawyers
and the legal system. For his part, the president is ``not hiding
behind legalisms,'' McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a horribly wrong relationship _ that's now abundantly
clear to everybody _ and he didn't tell the truth about it,''
McCurry said. ``I don't know how he could be more clear about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Clinton political advisers say that his lawyers have
persuasively argued internally that the accusations of perjury
would not withstand legal scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   The White House approach all but guarantees a graphic, public
debate over language and sex. Some of Clinton's allies are hoping
that the country, and as a result the Congress, will have no
stomach for it.
</P>
<P>
   At the root of the perjury accusations is President Clinton's
deposition in the Paula Jones sexual misconduct suit, on Jan. 17.
In it, he denied a ``sexual affair'' or ``sexual relationship''
with Ms. Lewinksy. According to the report by Whitewater
independent counsel Kenneth Starr, Clinton later supported his
denials by saying that he and Ms. Lewinsky did not have sexual
intercourse _ a definition that prosecutors dismissed as absurdly
narrow.
</P>
<P>
   In his January deposition, Clinton also denied having ``sexual
relations'' with Ms. Lewinsky under a definition presented by the
Jones lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   As restricted by the judge in the case, the definition read: ``A
person engages in `sexual relations' when the person knowingly
engages in or causes contact with the genitalia, anus, groin,
breast, inner thigh, or buttocks of any person with an intent to
arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky testified that she performed oral sex nine times on
the president. In his grand jury testimony on Aug. 17, Clinton was
asked if oral sex fit the lawyers' definition. He testified that it
did not.
</P>
<P>
   According to Starr's report, he said: ``If the deponent is the
person who has oral sex performed on him, then the contact is with
_ not with anything on that list, but with the lips of another
person. It seems to be self-evident that that's what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton added, again according to the report, ``Let me remind
you, sir, I read this carefully.'' With great disdain, Starr
dismissed Clinton's argument, and provided testimony from Ms.
Lewinsky that Clinton did make contact with body parts other than
her lips in order to arouse or gratify her.
</P>
<P>
   The president's lawyers, however, are sticking with it. ``He
answered the questions narrowly, but truthfully,'' David Kendall,
Clinton's private lawyer, said on Sunday on the ABC program, ``This
Week With Sam Donaldson and Cokie Roberts.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``There is no perjury there. Was he trying to mislead
the Paula Jones lawyers? Absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Kendall said that Clinton's interpretation of the
definition was ``good faith and correct.''
</P>
<P>
   Kendall expressed uncertainty about whether perjury would be a
high crime or misdemeanor, the Constitutional test for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   But some of Clinton's advisers acknowledge that his defense
against perjury is politically if not legally weak. On the NBC
program ``Meet the Press'' on Sunday, White House counsel Charles
Ruff seemed to be preparing for the possibility that the public may
not accept the perjury defense. He said that perjury was ``clearly
not'' an impeachable offense.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff argued that beginning impeachment proceedings would not be
justified ``even if Congress concludes, the American people
conclude at the end of the day that the president's efforts to
answer narrowly and carefully in fact constituted false
testimony.''

A DAMAGED DISK? THE DOCTOR IS IN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I am very disappointed in Win98. It will not
recognize my modem at all. Dial-Up Networking will not let me type
in the name of my server. My Internet provider tells me it's a
Win98 problem and I will have to talk to Microsoft. Well, I can't
find an 800-number for them, and I got so mad that I damaged my
disk. So, what can you do for me, Doc?
</P>
<P>
   _ Mad at Microsoft
</P>
<P>
   DEAR MAD: Here, have some of this nice Thorazine and think about
fluffy bunnies. ...
</P>
<P>
   When you're nice and relaxed, go look at how your hardware is
set up. Dial-Up Networking is not going to work at all until
Windows successfully recognizes your modem.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming the modem itself is OK, make sure its communications
port and interrupt settings don't conflict with anything else
already installed. Open the Programs menu, go to Accessories, then
System Tools, and pick System Information. Check under Resources
for any conflicts to see if you need to change your modem's
settings. Yeah, I know, that means getting out the manual, but
sometimes it just can't be helped. Put down that entrenching tool,
please.
</P>
<P>
   If there's no conflict, the modem driver may need to be
reinstalled or updated. If you haven't already crushed your modem
installation disk in a bench vise, follow the instructions that
came with it. Otherwise, find a friend who's not afraid of you to
download a new driver from the manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   You might also get your friend to surf over to
support.microsoft.com for technical help, because you're not going
to find an 800-number, at least not without paying for a Microsoft
service plan. However, they do offer free phone support for Windows
in the United States at (425) 635-7222, 8 a.m.-8 p.m. weekdays.
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, after you've replaced your Windows CD, do yourself a
favor for that next moment of blind rage _ trust me, it will come.
Copy everything in the Win98 folder, including sub-folders, to your
hard drive. Once these installation files are on the drive, you'll
never need to run screaming maniacally through the neighborhood
because you can't find the CD. Well, unless you accidentally jammed
an ice pick through the hard drive, that is.
</P>
<P>
   STUPID SOFTWARE TRICK: A tip o' the fez to Earl Hamilton for
sending in this Excel 95 trick:
</P>
<P>
   Open a new file. Click on the Row 95 button to highlight the
row, then press Tab to move to the second column. Click on Help,
then ``About Microsoft Excel.'' As you hold down the Alt, Control
and Shift keys, click on the Tech Support button.
</P>
<P>
   A window titled ``The Hall of Tortured Souls'' opens, allowing
you to explore a Doom-like environment. Check out the names of the
Excel developers scrolling down the wall, then walk up the ramp,
come back down, face the blank wall at the end of the room and type
EXCELKFA. A secret passage opens. Follow the zig-zag trail without
falling off for a really weird and unusual sight.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's probably not as weird or unusual as programmers
actually working on what they're supposed to be working on.
</P>

TODAY'S LESSON: THE PRESIDENT'S CONDUCT

(JT) 
 By JACQUES STEINBERG    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With the Starr report very much on the minds and lips
of her seniors at the Bronx High School of Science Monday morning,
Marilyn Reinhardt opened her fourth-period literature class by
scribbling three one-word questions on the blackboard: ``Psycho?
Devil? Victim?''
</P>
<P>
   She then asked her students whether President Clinton's behavior
with Monica Lewinsky, as well as his apparent attempts to cover it
up, was most like that of the mentally unstable Reverend Dimsdale
of ``The Scarlet Letter,'' the unrepentant killer Mersault of
Albert Camus' ``The Stranger'' or Jay Gatsby, whom she
characterized as a victim of the prevailing ethos of the Roaring
Twenties, which she defined as ``get rich quick by any means, but
then no one comes to your funeral.''
</P>
<P>
   From the back of the room, one 17-year-old girl raised her hand.
``I don't think he's any of the three,'' she said. ``He's just a
man. All men cheat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So it's biological destiny,'' Ms. Reinhardt replied, `` `Stand
by Your Man,' as Tammy Wynette said in that song.''
</P>
<P>
   If this had been any other September, Ms. Reinhardt would have
spent the third day of the school year Monday introducing her
students to Wordsworth, Keats and Jane Austen. But after reading
the report by the Whitewater independent counsel, Kenneth Starr,
over the weekend, she _ like so many other teachers across the
country _ concluded that her original lesson plan just could not
compete.
</P>
<P>
   And so, imploring their classes to cast aside any nervous
snickers, teachers at middle schools, high schools _ and even in
the older grades of some elementary schools, based on visits to
more than a dozen schools throughout the metropolitan New York
region Monday _ wove the scandal engulfing the president into their
lesson plans, often as a way to get their students to think about
larger issues like morality or impeachment that might otherwise
have put them to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   The teachers' only dilemma, it seemed, was not whether to
discuss Clinton's troubles, but in how much detail. And even then
there was surprising latitude.
</P>
<P>
   In Kitty Rooney's 12th-grade class at Bishop Loughlin Memorial
High School in Brooklyn, the words ``sex'' and ``sexual
intercourse'' flew around the room, with little giggling. Never
mind that the subject was government and the setting was a Catholic
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the Constitution class can be formulaic and dry,'' Ms.
Rooney said afterward, ``but now the students are very interested.
It's living history.''
</P>
<P>
   As the students struggled to form opinions, many found
themselves as conflicted as their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Bascio, a social studies teacher at Public School 111 in
midtown Manhattan, asked her seventh graders to write a paragraph
about whether the president should be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, because he shouldn't of cheated on his wife,'' one girl
wrote. ``No, because it is his personal business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some,'' the student concluded, ``think he should be punished
in a different way.''
</P>

HERITAGE (Phoenix) - Marcy Gorman points to a slice of Arizona
history. A modest four-room adobe home built 106 years ago, where a
pioneer laid down roots, raised a family and tilled the land. But
unlike other frontiersmen, this one didn't make his way to Arizona
from Eastern lands. He came through Mexico and represents a fact
many people fail to realize: Hispanics were among Arizona's first
settlers.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Latinos around the country begin celebrating National
Hispanic Heritage Month, which runs from Sept. 15 to Oct. 15. It is
a time for Hispanics to honor their past and educate others about
the diversity of their culture and their place in American society.

GROWTH-FORECAST (Undated) - Job growth is slowing in the West, as
expected. However, Arizona is still third in the nation for
creating new jobs. By CATHERINE REAGOR. Story will move in the
``F'' category. &QL; 
CONDORS (Undated) - Arizona will host more California condors than
California when nine more of the endangered giant vultures are
released at a second site north of the Grand Canyon _ the Hurricane
Cliffs. The release of additional condors - the fourth such release
in Arizona since 1996 - is tentatively set for late November or
early December. It will bring Arizona's total to 24 birds, four
more than exist in the wild in California. By STEVE YOZWIAK. Story
will move in the ``A`` category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MONTINI-COLUMN (Phoenix) - The gentleman on the telephone spoke
loudly and quickly and hung up before I could answer his question,
which was: ``Hey, moron, what kind of sick lesson do YOU think this
putrid Clinton scandal is teaching our children?'' There isn't one
lesson being taught, but many. For example, children might learn
that many of our most opinionated citizens choose to speak
anonymously into telephones. E.J.MONTINI. Story will move in the

<P>
   It's an idea that's bumped around in my head for a few years.
But I think it's time has come. OK. So here's my idea: It's called
the home server. You sell people a powerful PC. They plunk it down
in the den. Then, they use it to run an assortment of computer
appliances spread all over the house. My idea is, simply, to give
people computers that fit into their lives.

SPORTS COLUMN: THE GREAT CHASE IS NOW A RACE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The day before the All-Star Game in Denver in July, Sammy Sosa
was sitting with Ken Griffey Jr. in the interview area at Coors
Field when he was asked whether he, Mark McGwire or Griffey had the
best chance to break Roger Maris' record of 61 homers this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have my money on Mark McGwire,'' said Sosa, the Cubs'
smiling slugger. ``Griffey, I know you my boy, but ... ''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, McGwire, who had hit 58 homers a year ago, had 37.
Griffey, who had 56 a year ago, had 35. Sosa, who had only 36 a
year ago after 40 in 1996, had already hit 33.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have another half to go,'' Sosa said. ``Who knows? I might
be the one, Griffey might be the one, or Mark.''
</P>
<P>
   Like everybody else, Sosa was talking about the one slugger who
might break Maris' record. It never occurred to him, or to anyone
else, that two sluggers might hit 62 homers this season, much less
that they would have done it with two weeks left in the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   When the days have dwindled to a precious few in past
Septembers, baseball has had some memorable pennant races and
batting-title races. But it has never had a home run race anything
like what Sosa has created in his day-to-day duel with McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of chasing Maris' record, McGwire and Sosa are now
racing each other to whatever the eventual record might be _ 65,
67, 70 or beyond _ when the season ends on Sept. 27, a week from
Sunday. And Sosa may get the last shot because Then again, Sosa's
season might not end then.
</P>
<P>
   If the Cubs end up in a playoff with the Mets or Giants for the
National League wild-card berth, Sosa would get an extra game. If
he were to hit any homers in a wild-card playoff game (but not a
division playoff), they would count in his season total.
</P>
<P>
   Over the final two weeks, McGwire will have to hope there is no
recurrence of the back spasms that forced him to leave Sunday
night's game. He was back in the lineup Monday night in St. Louis,
saying he felt fine. In addition, there will be different
psychological factors that would seem to help and hurt both Sosa
and McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   The urgency of the Cubs' drive for the wild-card berth should
help Sosa maintain his concentration. But of his remaining 12
games, only three are at Wrigley Field. He has hit 35 homers there,
one every 8.37 at-bats, including four in three games against the
Brewers over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   On the road, Sosa has hit 27 homers, one every 10.96 at-bats.
After the four-game series in San Diego that opened Monday night,
the Cubs were to return to Wrigley Field for three weekend games
with the Reds, then finish the season next week with two games in
Milwaukee and three in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Cardinals have no wild-card aspirations, they play
10 of their final 13 games at Busch Stadium, where they opened a
four-game series with the Pirates Monday night and where McGwire
has thrived. With 32 homers there, he has one every 7.19 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals go to Milwaukee this weekend for three games, then
return to St. Louis for two games against the Astros and four
against the Expos.
</P>
<P>
   Over the season, McGwire has hit five homers against Houston,
two each against Milwaukee and Pittsburgh and one against Montreal.
Sosa has hit 10 against Milwaukee, 4 against Cincinnati, 3 against
Houston and 2 against San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Until Sosa's surge last weekend, McGwire had always maintained
his lead by responding to Sosa's homers with homers of his own. Now
he must respond just to get ahead of Sosa again.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens down the stretch, this home run race promises
to be more compelling theater than the last weeks of the 1927
season, when Babe Ruth hit 60, and the 1961 season, when Maris hit
61.
</P>
<P>
   Going into September 1927, Ruth had 43 homers, Lou Gehrig 41. In
a Sept. 6 doubleheader in Fenway Park, Gehrig hit his 45th for the
lead but the Babe quickly hit three _ his 45th, 46th and 47th. The
next day the Babe hit two more, then added 11 in his final 20 games
for 60. Gehrig hit only two more for 49.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961, Maris had 56 and Mantle 53 in September when Mantle
developed a severe hip abscess from a flu shot. He missed 18 games,
finishing with 54 homers.
</P>
<P>
   For both Maris and Ruth, there was no September pennant-race
urgency. In 1961, the Maris-Mantle Yankees won the American League
pennant by 8 games; in 1927, the Ruth-Gehrig Yankees won by 19
games.
</P>
<P>
   And now, after all their homers and all their moments, the chase
is over for Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa, but their race for the
record has just begun.

STOCKS RISE AFTER CLINTON NEWS DEEMED NOT CRITICAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER G. GOSSELIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It may take Congress months to decide President
Clinton's fate, but not the financial markets; they have decided
he's staying.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market climbed Monday, with the Dow Jones industrial
average rising almost 150 points, as investors concluded that the
president's troubles, although serious, are not enough to produce a
full-blown political upheaval. Coming atop a 180-point gain last
Friday in the wake of Independent Counsel Kenneth W. Starr's report
about Clinton's affair with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky, the latest market performance signals that investors
think Clinton can ride out the storm, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The markets are saying `This is not a crisis,' '' according to
Richard Schmaltz, investment director with J&AMP;W Seligman in New
York. ``They may be disgusted with the guy, but they are figuring
he will finish his term,'' Schmaltz said.
</P>
<P>
   The president played to the markets Monday in a New York speech
in which he warned that the current global crisis is ``the biggest
financial challenge facing the world in a half century'' and called
on the major economies to adopt a coordinated strategy to boost
growth, a move that investors would dearly like to see.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were also comforted by word out of a London meeting of
finance ministers and central bank leaders of the Group of Seven
industrial nations Monday that a coordinated interest rate
reduction might be in the works. Such a move would help nations
like Russia and Brazil by spurring growth and therefore world
consumption of their products.
</P>
<P>
   In concluding that Clinton will likely remain in office, the
markets tracked weekend poll results that show most Americans
believe that, whatever his personal failings, the president is
still doing a good job in office and should be censured rather than
impeached.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-stock Dow rose 149.85 points, or 1.9 percent, to 7945.35.
That brings its two-day gain to 330 points. The broader Standard &AMP;
Poor 500 Index climbed 20.66 points, or 2.1 percent to 1029.72,
while the technology-laden Nasdaq Composite Index rose 24.05
points, or 1.5 percent, to 1665.75.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks were not alone in rising in value Monday; the dollar also
rose, regaining more than half of the two percent it lost last week
against the Japanese yen and squeezing out small gains as well
against the German mark. Analysts traced most of the gain to
currency traders' conclusion that the Starr report contains no new
surprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a relief bounce as much as anything else,'' said David
Solin, a partner with Foreign Exchange Analytics in Essex, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Relief could be short-lived if, as many expect, companies in
growing numbers warn of profit disappointments on the way. The
financial world is entering the dreaded ``pre-announcement''
period, the weeks leading up to the end of a fiscal quarter when
firms try to get ahead of bad news by disclosing they will not do
as well as had been expected.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that such disclosures could prove a particular
problem this month because the global crisis has cut overseas sales
and made it hard to raise prices at home, and because any profit
figures will be compared with year-ago numbers, which were
spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in for a long confessional period not only about the
quarter, but also the year as a whole,'' said Ned Riley, chief
investment officer for BankBoston.
</P>
<P>
   Investment professionals cautioned Monday that the conclusion by
financial markets that Clinton will be able to hang onto the
presidency does not mean he is out of the woods. ``Even if he
stays, he's going to be a lame duck,'' said Scott Black of
Boston-based Delphi Management, a former Clinton supporter.
``Basically you're going to have a bigger Republican majority in
Congress and two years of gridlock.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All the market is saying is it doesn't like catastrophic
change,'' said Schmaltz. ``That doesn't mean it likes the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, although Clinton Monday hit most of the notes investors
wanted to hear about US readiness to tackle the global financial
crisis, most analysts said that there is little he can do to help
in his politically weakened state.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech to the New York-based Council on Foreign
Relations, the president said ``the leading economic nations must
act together to spur global growth.'' He warned that the principal
problem that policymakers must tackle has changed from inflation to
economic weakness. ``The balance of risks has now shifted with a
full quarter of the world's populations now living in countries
with negative economic growth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that he had asked Treasury Secretary Robert E.
Rubin and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan to convene a
meeting of the G-7 nations to cope with the crisis within 30 days,
a timetable that some observers wryly noted happens to coincide
with an already scheduled session of the International Monetary
Fund and World Bank next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton's call for a meeting makes it a little more likely it
will happen quickly,'' said Gary C. Hufbauer, the just-departed
research director for the Council on Foreign Relations where
Clinton spoke. But ``there is not a lot more he can do,'' Hufbauer
added.

 &HT;    Openly gay candidates in numerous primaries
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Democratic voters in Washington state and
Massachusetts today have the chance to add to the largest line-up
ever of openly gay candidates for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Grethe Cammermeyer, a retired Army colonel, and Susan Tracy, a
former state legislator, are seeking the Democratic congressional
nomination in districts north of Seattle and in the Boston area,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   If they win, seven gay and lesbian candidates, including two
congressional incumbents, will be on the ballot in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are moving toward a place where sexual orientation won't
play a part,'' said Winnie Stachelberg, political director of the
Human Rights Campaign Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Political analyst Charles Cook has said the November election
``is a breakthrough election'' because so many of the gay
candidates are running competitive races.
</P>
<P>
   The incumbents are Republican Jim Kolbe of Arizona and Democrat
Barney Frank of Massachusetts. The other candidates who have won
party primaries are Wisconsin state Rep. Tammy Baldwin; San Diego
City Council member Christine Kehoe and Paul Barby, trying for the
second time to capture a western Oklahoma seat.
</P>
<P>
   If any of these candidates win, it would mark the first time an
openly gay American won election to Congress. Kolbe and Frank
revealed their homosexuality only after they had been in Congress
for some time.
</P>
<P>
   None of the contests is expected to be easy. Baldwin is running
in a Madison-area district that is represented by Rep. Scott Klug,
a Republican who is retiring. She will face Josephine Musser, a
former Wisconsin insurance commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Musser narrowly defeated Ron Greer, a Christian fundamentalist
and former firefighter, who made his opposition to homosexuality a
major part of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Kehoe is trying to unseat Rep. Brian Bilbray, a moderate
Republican whom national analysts say has been helped by a strong
pro-incumbent mood nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Barby is up against Rep. Frank Lucas (R-Okla.), who took 64
percent of the vote two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the Democratic primary in Massachusetts will be
the favorite to win in November because the district is staunchly
Democratic. It is currently held by Rep. Joseph Kennedy, who is
retiring.
</P>
<P>
   But Tracy is one of 10 Democrats in the race, several with
personal fortunes to draw on and with strong records on gay issues.
</P>
<P>
   Cammermeyer's campaign also faces an uphill road, but it may be
the most intriguing because of her life story. She is campaigning
as a career military officer, a nurse, mother and grandmother,
generally leaving her sexual orientation out of her campaign pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Like the other gay candidates, Cammermeyer, 56, said she is
running for Congress because of her concerns about health care,
Social Security and the environment: ``I cannot reiterate enough
that what may have brought some national interest is not of local
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cammermeyer also is the only candidate running this year who
can say that the actress Glenn Close portrayed her in a television
movie.
</P>
<P>
   Cammermeyer drew national attention when she lost her position
in the Washington Army National Guard after acknowledging that she
is gay. She sued for and won reinstatement, then retired in 1997.
Close starred in ``Serving in Silence,'' a movie about
Cammermeyer's ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Cammermeyer, who is divorced, lives with her partner, Dianne
Divelbess, in a small village on Whidbey Island that also is home
to the probable Republican nominee, Rep. Jack Metcalf.
</P>
<P>
   The 70-year-old Metcalf, a retired teacher, began the campaign
in the spring by focusing attention on Cammermeyer's personal life.
He referred to her in a mailing as a ``controversial lesbian.''
</P>
<P>
   In a separate fund-raising letter, Metcalf wrote, ``We are in a
life-and-death struggle for the spiritual and cultural heritage _
and future _ of our country.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a recent interview, he said, ``I don't intend to talk
about it unless she brings it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Candidates who wish to wage a ``family values'' campaign may now
plausibly focus their attention on a bigger story, President
Clinton's sexual indiscretions, without making an issue of their
opponents' private lives.
</P>
<P>
   And Metcalf has one other way of drawing a contrast with
Cammermeyer in this area. He will celebrate his 50th wedding
anniversary in early October, an event his campaign intends not to
let pass unnoticed.

 &HT;    Governor denounces Clinton's actions as `wrong, shameful'
 &HT;    By Kathey Pruitt
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- In a move that may help distance Georgia Democrats
from the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal, Georgia Gov. Zell Miller on
Tuesday harshly condemned the president's behavior as deplorable
and said his longtime political ally has destroyed his own
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't deny what he did was wrong, shameful,'' Miller said.
``I feel sorry that a good friend has betrayed his family and his
staff, debased himself, embarrassed himself and diminished the
presidency. He has shattered his credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who soon will leave office as perhaps Georgia's most
popular governor, is expected to be the mainstay of Democratic
campaigns across the state this fall as candidates try to tap into
his broad support base. Miller's strong links to the president may
be the best way for Republicans to undercut his appeals for support
for other Georgia Democrats on the ballot, or to keep him from
weighing into the contests at all.
</P>
<P>
   But by speaking out on Clinton's woes, Miller may be trying to
inoculate himself and the candidates he supports from being further
tarnished by the president's troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Miller stressed that he is not trying to distance himself from
the president, who he still gives high job approval ratings. And he
wouldn't say whether he thinks Clinton should resign, saying that
is a decision the president must make for himself. ``I still love
him like a brother... but I can remain his friend without excusing
his behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Miller's friendship, and his political support, that
helped catapult Clinton from governor to the White House. Miller is
credited with reviving Clinton's foundering presidential bid in
1992 after allegations of an affair with Gennifer Flowers sent his
campaign into a tailspin in the New Hampshire primary. By moving up
the date of Georgia's presidential primary, Miller provided Clinton
with the platform to rebound and much-needed momentum.
</P>
<P>
   The consultants for Miller's 1989 bid for governor, Paul Begala
and James Carville, crafted Clinton's presidential campaign, and
Miller's chief of staff left the Georgia Capitol to become a White
House staffer.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Miller was rewarded with a position as a keynote
speaker at the 1992 Democratic National Convention, and has
remained a close friend of the president.
</P>
<P>
   But Miller said he couldn't excuse Clinton's handling of
allegations about his relationship with former intern Monica
Lewinsky. ``I'm not talking about what he did to Monica. I'm
talking about what he did after he knew he'd been found out,'' he
said. ``I'm talking about January to August, sending aides who
served him so loyally out to lie unbeknownst to themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, House Speaker Newt Gingrich continued to adopt a
cautious wait-and-see approach Monday.
</P>
<P>
   At Hayes Elementary School in Kennesaw, Gingrich was asked by a
third-grader if the president is ``going to get fired.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know yet,'' Gingrich said. ``We have to see what
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich said a weekend in his Cobb County district confirmed
that his Republican supporters agree with the cautious approach:
``I found even the most partisan Republican wants this to be done
in a fair and constitutional manner with a real opportunity for
justice.''

 &HT;    Charisma, endurance shaped a tragic Southern story
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- I finally met George Wallace, after a lifetime of
hearing about him, when I was working one summer for the Montgomery
Advertiser.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, his wife Lurleen was governor, and whatever he was
sounding off about that day wasn't very newsy, so the city desk
sent another intern and me out to his office. Wallace spotted us
among the other local reporters, and when his official business was
over he kept us behind and inquired our names.
</P>
<P>
   I was only mildly surprised when in a couple of quick questions
he was able to identify me as the nephew of the girl who'd tutored
him in 7th grade algebra. My family came from near Clio, the little
railhead town, named after the muse of history, where he was born.
</P>
<P>
   But then he turned to the other intern and, on hearing his name,
offered condolences for his mother's death in the Orly plane crash
several years before, along with myriad details of that young man's
family, which was from another part of the state. And as I watched
those dark, burning eyes search our faces, imprinting the memory of
us into some unimaginably deep mental card file, I began to grasp
that mixture of awe and terror with which other politicians
regarded him.
</P>
<P>
   He was a force, an almost startling combination of restless
ambition, charismatic resentment and unsleeping memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``If George had parachuted into the Albanian countryside in the
spring of 1962,'' former adviser John Kohn told Wallace's
biographer, Dan T. Carter, ``he would have been head of a
collective farm by the fall, a member of the Communist Party by
mid-winter, on his way to the district party meeting as a delegate
by the following year and a member of the Comintern in two or three
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace traced a fiery arc across the nation's history as the
segregationist Southern governor who tapped into a much wider pool
of white working-class anger in the 1960s, but it was in Alabama
where the fullest range of his shape-shifting political talents
were played out. Over three decades, even after Arthur Bremer's
bullets left him wheel chair-ridden and in constant pain, he
dominated his state in a way no other American politician has in
this era.
</P>
<P>
   It was sheer endurance, as much as anything, that enabled
Wallace to hang on long enough to write his name not only in
history but in myth, the modern embodiment of an old Southern story
of pride, disaster and redemption.
</P>
<P>
   ``That part of the state, you had to grow up tough and rugged,
with stick-to-it-iveness and faith,'' said Rep. John Lewis. The
farm near Brundidge where Lewis grew up is about 15 or 20 miles
from Clio, but it was long after the young civil rights worker was
beaten at Selma's Edmund Pettus Bridge that he met his former
nemesis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on one side, he was on the other. He grew. For me, he's
the personification of a person's ability and capacity to change,''
Lewis said from a phone in a Los Angeles hotel room Monday. The
overwhelming support that black voters in Alabama gave Wallace in
his last election, after his repentance for his '60s demagoguery,
should be a relevant lesson for today, said Lewis, who has been a
staunch supporter of Bill Clinton in his darkest hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can forgive this man, then I think America should be
able to forgive the president,'' Lewis said, giving that tragic old
Southern story one more twist.

 &HT;    Wallace's philosophy `never got in the way'
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dan T. Carter, Andrew Mellon professor of history at Atlanta's
Emory University, is the author of ``The Politics of Rage: George
Wallace, the Origins of the New Conservatism and the Transformation
of American Politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Former Montgomery Advertiser-Journal editor and Carter White
House official Ray Jenkins has said that George Wallace's ``most
enduring legacy'' is ``Richard Nixon's `Southern strategy' and the
fulfillment of it in Ronald Reagan.'' Do you agree? It seems to
leave out credit for the 1964 Barry Goldwater campaign for
president as being the criticial event swinging the South to the
GOP.
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Goldwater's legacy is relevant, but keep in mind that to
many Republicans (including Richard Nixon), Goldwater's strategy
had backfired. (Goldwater lost to Lyndon B. Johnson in a landslide,
carrying only Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South
Carolina and his home state of Arizona.)The real shift for the
center of the Republican Party toward the Southern strategy came
under the leadership of Nixon, particularly after the '68 election
when he saw how much he had been threatened by George Wallace.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Wallace told The Associated Press in 1992 that he ``should
have been vice president in 1972.'' Do you agree? Would a
doctrinaire liberal like George McGovern, in the bitter Vietnam-era
climate, have named archconservative Wallace his running mate?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Ray Jenkins has the final word on this, I think, since he
talked to both Hubert Humphrey (about the 1968 race) and McGovern
(about '72). Neither would have run with Wallace. That kind of
ticket was a pig that would not fly. Despite his crushing defeat in
'72, McGovern wasn't stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you feel regarding Wallace's sea of change to
moderatism on the race issue? Was it a genuine spiritual conversion
or political expediency?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``The late Bob Vance (Alabama Democratic Party chairman and
later an 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals judge) had the best
response to that question. When asked it by an Alabama public
television director for a two-hour documentary on Wallace, he
paused and said, `His philosophy never got in the way.' I don't
think he was a visceral racist in the sense that it overshadowed
his thinking, so it wasn't that hard to change his public views
once the political terrain shifted.''

HONDA HOPES FOR BIG SELLER IN REMAKE OF SEDAN AND COUPE
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by CARS-BOX) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Honda seems destined to reclaim the title of best-selling U.S.
car for its Accord model during calendar year 1998, thanks to a
complete remake of the sedan and coupe versions.
</P>
<P>
   Combined sales of the coupe and sedan should overtake sales of
the rival Toyota Camry, last year's bestseller, in part because
Toyota no longer calls the coupe version a Camry and therefore
can't add the coupe's sales totals to those of the sedan. (The
coupe is called Solara).
</P>
<P>
   The Accord also should surpass its other big rival, the Ford
Taurus, which took first place away from the Accord in the early
'90s and held it until the revised Camry came along for 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Taurus sales slipped not because of something Toyota or Honda
did. Instead, Ford designers violated Rule No. 1 of the auto
business: If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Ford completely remade
the Taurus for 1996, giving it radical new styling that turned out
to be quite controversial among loyal Taurus owners.
</P>
<P>
   Ford will restyle the Taurus for 2000, eliminating some of the
weird stuff _ such as the oval rear window. But the 1999 model
carries forward from '98 with little change (there was a slight
restyling for 1998 that brought a new grille and some other
modifications to the controversial look, but apparently not enough
to increase sales significantly).
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Accord continues its climb back to the top at the
Camry's and Taurus' expense, thanks to restyling efforts that make
it a bit more exciting than it has been.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest draw of the Accord has been its reputation as a
``refrigerator car,'' as I call it. It reminds me of a refrigerator
because, like a refrigerator, there's nothing real exciting about
it, but once you plug it in, it keeps going forever. There's
nothing wrong with that _ the majority of car buyers would readily
forfeit some measure of style for such long-term reliability, as
Honda has consistently proved.
</P>
<P>
   Our test drive for the week, the Accord Coupe EX, tries to break
out of the refrigerator mold _ at least as far as style is
concerned. This is a car with sporty good looks, something that
Honda has never put much emphasis on. The taillights look almost
like those of the Acura NSX sports car, the Honda luxury division's
flagship.
</P>
<P>
   The Accord coupe is offered in the same range of models as the
sedan _ base DX, midlevel LX and uplevel EX versions with
four-cylinder engine, and V-6 versions of the LX and EX.
</P>
<P>
   I tested the four-cylinder version of the EX coupe, with a base
price of $20,800 (cloth seats) or $21,950 (leather interior), plus
$395 transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Although I haven't driven a V-6 model of the Accord sedan or
coupe, the four-cylinder coupe might be the best choice for people
who want sporty performance because it can be ordered with a
five-speed manual transmission. Only a four-speed automatic is
available with the 200-horsepower, 3.0-liter V-6.
</P>
<P>
   The 2.3-liter, 16-valve, four-cylinder powerplant has been
revised for 1998, and offers 150 horsepower and 152 foot-pounds of
torque in the EX and LX models (135 hp in the DX). Coupled with the
manual transmission, this engine offers a good measure of
performance _ actually on par with the 150-horsepower four-cylinder
of the sporty Nissan Altima sedan. The LX and EX models gain the
extra horsepower over the DX by way of Honda's VTEC
variable-valve-timing system.
</P>
<P>
   Handling _ including cornering _ is considerably sportier than
that of past Accords, thanks in part to the new four-wheel
double-wishbone suspension, larger springs and more rigid chassis.
Although the suspensions of the coupe and sedan are virtually
identical, the coupe seems to handle slightly better; that may be
due in part to the slightly shorter wheelbase and better tires.
</P>
<P>
   Designed by Honda engineers at the company's studio in Los
Angeles, the coupe certainly looks more exciting than the sedan.
The body shares no components with the sedan except the headlights
and door handles. Its lines are more aggressive than the sedan's,
with a more steeply raked windshield and those distinctive
triangular taillights.
</P>
<P>
   The coupe is 1.2 inches longer overall than the '97 model, but
has a wheelbase 1.8 inches shorter. Interior room is slightly less
than that of the sedan, making the vehicle a bit tighter fit for
large people _ particularly in the rear seat _ even though overall
interior volume increased to 106.23 cublic feet, 4.8 cubic feet
over the previous year's. (The sedan's interior increased 7 cubic
feet to 115.8 for '98, moving the car from the compact to the
midsize class based on EPA standards).
</P>
<P>
   Front seats in the coupe have side bolsters that Honda says are
more in line with its sportier, more performance-oriented
character. There is a 60/40 split, folddown rear seat that allows
for loading of more cargo, a standard cargo net in the EX coupe,
and a 13.1 cubic-foot trunk (compared with 14.1 cubic feet in the
sedan).
</P>
<P>
   I liked the simple, round gauges; easy-to-operate
heating/ventilation and air-conditioning controls; and the grouping
of the controls in the center of the dash that makes them easy to
reach. The heating/AC controls are on top and the stereo
underneath, in a neat center stack.
</P>
<P>
   The bucket seats are quite comfortable, and the side bolsters
help hold the driver and front passenger in place during tight
turns and sharp cornering. The manual-transmission shifting is
tight and precise, just as you would expect in a sporty vehicle.

   NEW YORK _ President Clinton declared on Monday that the
economic turmoil on three continents constitutes ``the biggest
financial challenge facing the world in a half-century.'' Without
once discussing the calls for his censure or impeachment, he laid
out for the first time a strategy to quell the trouble before it
hits American shores.
</P>
<P>
   In a half-hour address to a friendly, carefully selected
audience at the Council on Foreign Relations in Manhattan, Clinton
said that the economic turmoil, if allowed to fester, would pose a
threat to American security and ``put our own prosperity at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's biggest initiative _ though one he couched carefully
to avoid appearing to interfere in interest rate policy _ was a
call for the world's leading economies to abandon their fear of
inflation and instead ``spur growth.'' He also urged the World Bank
to double its aid in Asia, where millions of people are suddenly
unemployed or sinking back into poverty, and he called for a
meeting of finance ministers from the world's largest economies and
from the hard-hit emerging markets ``within 30 days'' to develop
broader strategies.
</P>
<P>
   ``For most of the last 30 years, the United States and the rest
of the world has been preoccupied by inflation,'' he said. ``But
clearly the balance of risks has now shifted.''
</P>
<P>
   In a move coordinated by the Treasury Department over the
weekend to come within minutes of Clinton's speech, the finance
ministers and central bank governors of the world's seven largest
economies issued a parallel statment that was clearly intended to
open the door to coordinated interest-rate cuts _ a step that, if
skillfully executed, could help spur economic activity around the
globe. It was the first time that the Group Of Seven had vowed to
make a coordinated effort to reign in the economic disorder that
officials clearly fear is spinning out of control.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a general truth,'' one senior administration official
said after Clinton spoke, `that the magnitude of the
deterioration'' in recent week has been ``much greater than anyone
anticipated.''
</P>
<P>
   The finance ministers also endorsed another initiative announced
by Clinton: Support for the use of an emergency fund within the
IMF, now down to its last $15 billion, to combat the latest
economic turmoil in Latin America.

 &HT;    Move to make private prison public is delayed
 &HT;    By Rhonda Cook
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Georgia's attempt to integrate privately run prisons
into its system faces another delay today as the company running
the prison misses another moving-in day for medium-security
inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Cornell Corrections Inc. had planned to start taking
inmates at a prison it built in Charlton County in the southeast
corner of the state early last month. That was delayed because
construction was not complete, so the next deadline was set for
today, Sept. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Department of Corrections spokesman Scott Stallings said Monday
the plan now was to have the first state inmates in the Cornell
prison by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still don't have a firm date,'' Stallings said. ``They had
told us by the latter part of this month. They're just not ready.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to ease the expensive crush on the state prison
system, which now holds more than 38,000 convicts, Georgia
contracted with two companies _ Cornell of Houston and Corrections
Corp. of American of Nashville _ to build three 750-bed
medium-security prisons. The Cornell prison was to be the first to
open while CCA is set to finish building similar prisons in Coffee
and Wheeler counties late this year or early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Cornell officials say the opening delay can be blamed on
weather-related construction problems that are no different from
those that routinely occur with any large building project.
</P>
<P>
   State officials argue that turning to corporate America will
save taxpayers because the private sector can build prisons faster
and it is not hamstrung by a costly governmental bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the addition of the three private prisons, meanwhile,
DOC still plans to ask the 1999 Legislature for $148 million to
build about 4,500 beds that would be in the system within two
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The delay is bad because we need the space,'' said Rep. Denny
Dobbs (D-Covington), who has been holding hearings on sentencing
reform.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ For years, Ramona Rosario could savor the
English-speaking world only through the soap operas flickering on
her battered television set. Her husband refused to let her work,
study English or venture beyond their Hispanic neighborhood in the
Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   And when she finally left him, more than a decade after she
emigrated from the Dominican Republic, she had no job skills, no
English language skills and no way to survive without a welfare
check.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Ms. Rosario studies English with 14 other Hispanic
welfare mothers struggling to break into the work force. But as the
unskilled and undereducated women painstakingly fill their
notebooks at Bronx Community College, many fear they may never put
the shame of government charity behind them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel stuck,'' Ms. Rosario, 42, said in Spanish as she
wearily listed the supermarkets, hospitals and clothing stores that
have refused to hire her. ``Sometimes, I think we're all stuck.''
</P>
<P>
   While white and black single mothers have left the welfare rolls
in droves over the last three years, the number of Hispanic women
on public assistance has held almost stubbornly steady. And the
disparity highlights a widening ethnic divide among New York City's
poorest families.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, the number of whites on welfare has fallen 57
percent; the number of blacks has declined 30 percent and the
number of Hispanics has dipped just 7 percent, city officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the welfare rolls are 5 percent white, 33 percent black
and 59 percent Hispanic, with more Hispanics receiving public
assistance in New York City than in Miami or Los Angeles or the
entire state of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The stark statistics reflect the struggles of thousands of
welfare mothers like Ms. Rosario and her classmates, who arrived in
America with gilded dreams only to find themselves trapped in
poverty and crumbling tenements.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking little English and lacking the education, work
experience and support systems of their black and white
counterparts, most have failed to find work or other means of
support, census data and city and state statistics show.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani often describes the overall 36 percent
drop in the city's welfare rolls as an important accomplishment,
proof that the poor can successfully move from dependency to
self-reliance.
</P>
<P>
   But the troubles of the Hispanic welfare mothers underscore the
challenges that remain as Giuliani works toward his goal of moving
all 200,000 welfare mothers into jobs, or at least workfare
positions, by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the number of disadvantaged Hispanic women on
public assistance has surged, fueled largely by the doubling of the
number of Dominican immigrants receiving government charity between
1990 and 1996, census data indicate.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Ricans still make up the majority of Hispanics on public
assistance, according to a census analysis conducted by
demographers at Queens College. But their numbers have held
relatively steady, compared with the rapid rise of Dominicans, the
city's fastest-growing group of immigrants, who typically speak
less English and experience higher levels of poverty and
unemployment than other Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   And so far, city officials have been unprepared to meet their
needs. This year, the city turned away hundreds of Spanish-speaking
welfare mothers from English classes because they had more students
than seats.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds more were denied access to resume-writing courses and
vocational training _ services available to English-speaking
welfare mothers _ because most programs cannot accommodate students
with limited English skills, city officials said.
</P>
<P>
   City officials say they have budgeted for a significant
expansion of services to this population over the next 10 months,
but Ms. Rosario's story also demonstrates how some women stumble
over cultural roadblocks of their own, clinging to traditional
views of motherhood that sometimes discourage them from seeking
jobs or taking advantage of city training programs.
</P>
<P>
   On the sidewalks of upper Manhattan and the Bronx, where street
vendors sell sugar cane and sweet perfume, some welfare mothers
hold fast to ideals from their homelands, seeing their primary role
as stay-at-home mothers, and viewing day care centers and baby
sitters with deep distrust.
</P>
<P>
   And that view, welfare specialists and sociologists say, is
sometimes reinforced by husbands and boyfriends who prefer their
wives and girlfriends to tend children instead of working.
</P>
<P>
   Maribel Baez, 29, who dreamed of learning English and data
processing, put those goals aside when her husband, a truck driver,
asked her to stay home with their two children. It was an easy
decision, she said. She loved caring for her babies.
</P>
<P>
   But now, eight years later, Ms. Baez says she is paying the
price. Divorced and on the dole, she anguishes over letters in
English from the welfare office, struggling to sound out the words
she cannot understand.
</P>
<P>
   And when she walks timidly into clothing stores looking for
work, the onslaught of rapid-fire English often leaves her head
spinning. Competition for jobs is so fierce in the poor
neighborhoods where Hispanic welfare mothers live that some
supermarket managers want even their employees who bag groceries to
speak English.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel awful, depressed, all of that,'' said Ms. Baez, who
emigrated 11 years ago and now combines English studies with a
workfare job. ``I cry at home alone.''
</P>
<P>
   But when asked whether she wanted to work full time, if she
could find a job that would get her off welfare, Ms. Baez shook her
head. ``It's too many hours,'' she said. ``I need to be with my
children.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials say they have already begun to tackle the
obstacles encountered by some Hispanic women. To make Hispanic
welfare mothers more marketable, city officials plan to expand the
number of work-study programs to accommodate 6,019 students in
English classes this fiscal year, which began in July, a 25 percent
increase over the previous year.

ONLY EIGHT FLIGHT 111 VICTIMS IDENTIFIED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Budgeted as Swissair-Valuables)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TATSHA ROBERTSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia _ Although Navy divers have spent nearly
two weeks combing the ocean floor for remains from Swissair Flight
111, officials as of Monday had identified the bodies of only eight
of the 229 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
   The process is being slowed by the need to gather DNA and
medical records, said John Butt, chief medical examiner of Nova
Scotia. Some of the records also have to be translated.
</P>
<P>
   The mammoth diving and recovery process is still under way but
Butt said he believes there are no human remains scattered outside
the debris area, which leads officials to think they will probably
be found inside several large pieces of the fuselage.
</P>
<P>
   If the recovery process becomes too dangerous, said Butt, the
remains might have to be pulled up with the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't come to that point, yet,'' said Cmdr. Kevin Carle,
spokesman for the Canadian Navy. ``The navy's priority hasn't
shifted. It is still collecting the victim's remains.''
</P>
<P>
   But Carle said the recovery process is extremely dangerous and
slow. ``You have to understand that being down there is like
walking among a hedge of razor blades,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The USS Grapple, a salvage ship, is moored to large concrete
blocks, preparing to raise sections of the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, Navy divers found the second ``black box'' or
cockpit voice recorder. Officials are hoping conversations from the
tape, which records in 30-minute continuous loops, will help
explain the cause of the MD-11 crash on Sept. 2. However, Canadian
law prohibits disclosure of transcripts of the tape to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Swissair officials confirmed Monday, in a statement,
that the flight was carrying valuables on board, including an
original Picasso called ``Le Peintre,'' or ``the painter.'' The art
piece was worth $1.5 million. The plane was also carrying bank
notes, watches and jewelry, as well as another unknown art piece.
</P>
<P>
   The statement said Swissair carries some 200,000 valuable
consignments a year. Officials have also confirmed that a large sum
of money, maybe in the millions, was on the plane, secured in a
container. None of the valuables has been retrieved, said
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Police said poachers ``will not be tolerated and will be dealt
with swiftly.''

 NEW YORK: previous year.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   And the city's vocational training programs, which could accept
only 160 Spanish-speakers, will admit 1,225 this fiscal year, city
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   But state statistics suggest this expansion may leave thousands
of Hispanic welfare mothers without language classes and training.
While New York City has begun to examine some of the barriers
preventing welfare mothers from finding jobs, state social service
officials conducted a comprehensive survey of those very issues
seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The state study, which surveyed 815 welfare mothers in New York
City, found that 80 percent of the Hispanics were born overseas.
Thirty percent lacked ninth grade educations compared with nine
percent of non-Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   And at a time when manufacturing and garment industry jobs were
vanishing, the officials reported that nearly half of all Hispanics
had most recently worked in factories, but 60 percent of
non-Hispanics had more marketable skills, having worked as clerical
workers, store clerks or cooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hispanics are considerably less likely than other recipients
to have acquired from their jobs the kinds of skills that are in
demand in New York City's service-based economy,'' the state
researchers wrote in their report, adding that their limited
educations left Hispanic welfare mothers at ``severe
disadvantage.''
</P>
<P>
   The study also reported that more subtle, cultural obstacles
sometimes blocked Hispanic women from leaving the welfare rolls,
including distrust of day care and low self confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-five percent of Hispanics feared their children would be
mistreated in day care, compared with 45 percent of non-Hispanics.
And about 45 percent of Hispanics feared they could not perform as
well as others at work, compared with 26 percent of non-Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Concentrated in neighborhoods where they can buy groceries, rent
apartments and enjoy television and radio without speaking English,
many Hispanic welfare mothers, the study also noted, can get by
without learning the language, until they have to find work.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, nearly half of all Hispanic welfare mothers could
not speak English well, even though many had lived in New York City
for years. And nearly 76 percent of Dominicans, who are more recent
immigrants, struggled with the new language, the state statistics
showed. &QL;

<P>
   ``The administration is trying to move aggressively on this,
because if you don't speak English, how can I move you toward
employment?'' said Georgia Salley, who runs the city's work-study
programs for welfare recipients.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge is to put more classes and vocational training
geared toward people with limited language skills so they have a
better chance of finding jobs,'' Ms. Salley said, ``but it doesn't
happen in a blink of an eye.''
</P>
<P>
   But advocates for the poor say city officials have known about
the shortage of services for years. In 1991, state officials called
for an expansion of education and training programs for Hispanic
welfare mothers.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1994, lawyers for the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and
Education Fund filed a federal lawsuit charging state and city
officials with failing to provide such services.
</P>
<P>
   That lawsuit, which was based on existing federal laws, was
withdrawn as city officials expanded their programs and the new
welfare law was enacted in 1996. But the issue has acquired only
greater urgency since then.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new rules, welfare mothers can receive cash benefits
for only five years. And as the clock ticks, some advocates and
sociologists worry: Will Hispanic welfare mothers be ready for a
post-welfare world?
</P>
<P>
   ``As a sociologist, it worries me; as an individual, it worries
me,'' said Ramona Hernandez, a sociologist at the University of
Massachusetts in Boston, who recently published a study about the
struggles of Dominican immigrants in New York City. ``It's the
future of a people we are dealing with here.''
</P>
<P>
   And in the classrooms at Bronx Community College, where single
mothers studying English know their time on welfare is running out,
the anxiety is palpable.
</P>
<P>
   Some women try to focus on the success stories, on welfare
mothers like Carmen Yangas, 37, who was hired as a secretary at the
college after taking classes there. Others, like Ms. Rosario, dab
their faces with holy water and pray to their saints for work.
</P>
<P>
   Another woman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said she
simply tries to wipe her memory clean of all the job rejections and
all the hours waiting for the one phone call that never comes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hope is the last thing you lose,'' said the woman, 40 a mother
of four, her brown eyes flashing fiercely. ``I'm going to find
work. I have no choice.''

TODAY'S LESSON: THE PRESIDENT'S CONDUCT

(JT) 
 By JACQUES STEINBERG    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With the Starr report very much on the minds and lips
of her seniors at the Bronx High School of Science Monday morning,
Marilyn Reinhardt opened her fourth-period literature class by
scribbling three one-word questions on the blackboard: ``Psycho?
Devil? Victim?''
</P>
<P>
   She then asked her students whether President Clinton's behavior
with Monica Lewinsky, as well as his apparent attempts to cover it
up, was most like that of the mentally unstable Reverend Dimsdale
of ``The Scarlet Letter,'' the unrepentant killer Mersault of
Albert Camus' ``The Stranger'' or Jay Gatsby, whom she
characterized as a victim of the prevailing ethos of the Roaring
Twenties, which she defined as ``get rich quick by any means, but
then no one comes to your funeral.''
</P>
<P>
   From the back of the room, one 17-year-old girl raised her hand.
``I don't think he's any of the three,'' she said. ``He's just a
man. All men cheat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So it's biological destiny,'' Ms. Reinhardt replied, `` `Stand
by Your Man,' as Tammy Wynette said in that song.''
</P>
<P>
   If this had been any other September, Ms. Reinhardt would have
spent the third day of the school year Monday introducing her
students to Wordsworth, Keats and Jane Austen. But after reading
the report by the Whitewater independent counsel, Kenneth Starr,
over the weekend, she _ like so many other teachers across the
country _ concluded that her original lesson plan just could not
compete.
</P>
<P>
   And so, imploring their classes to cast aside any nervous
snickers, teachers at middle schools, high schools _ and even in
the older grades of some elementary schools, based on visits to
more than a dozen schools throughout the metropolitan New York
region Monday _ wove the scandal engulfing the president into their
lesson plans, often as a way to get their students to think about
larger issues like morality or impeachment that might otherwise
have put them to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   The teachers' only dilemma, it seemed, was not whether to
discuss Clinton's troubles, but in how much detail. And even then
there was surprising latitude.
</P>
<P>
   In Kitty Rooney's 12th-grade class at Bishop Loughlin Memorial
High School in Brooklyn, the words ``sex'' and ``sexual
intercourse'' flew around the room, with little giggling. Never
mind that the subject was government and the setting was a Catholic
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the Constitution class can be formulaic and dry,'' Ms.
Rooney said afterward, ``but now the students are very interested.
It's living history.''
</P>
<P>
   As the students struggled to form opinions, many found
themselves as conflicted as their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Bascio, a social studies teacher at Public School 111 in
midtown Manhattan, asked her seventh graders to write a paragraph
about whether the president should be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, because he shouldn't of cheated on his wife,'' one girl
wrote. ``No, because it is his personal business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some,'' the student concluded, ``think he should be punished
in a different way.''

DEALS SIGNED FOR OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION IN KAZAKHSTAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By STEVE LeVINE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALMATY, Kazakhstan_ U.S. and Japanese companies signed oil- and
gas-exploration deals on Monday that could be worth several billion
dollars to this former Soviet republic in Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips Petroleum of the United States and the Japanese-owned
Indonesian Petroleum Company agreed to pay a total of $500 million
in cash for stakes in a 2,000-square-mile oilfield, called
Kashagan. The Kazakhs are also to receive a $1 billion,
low-interest loan from Japan, and investment in several hydrocarbon
and metals enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Phillips agreed to build a $500 million liquefied
natural gas plant, and the Japanese pledged $2 billion in
investments including an oil refinery, a plastics plant and an
aluminum smelter.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's sale of Kazakhstan's one-seventh stake in the Kashagan
field came at a critical time, less than a week after the
government revised its budget estimates and announced a prospective
$750 million deficit.
</P>
<P>
   At the signing ceremony in Astana, 600 miles north of here,
Prime Minister Nurlan Balgimbayev said the $500 million would be
injected directly into the budget.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement caught industry analysts off guard. While the
Kashagan field is thought by some experts to contain the largest
reserves on the Caspian Sea _ seismic studies have disclosed
gigantic, domed undersea structures _ the field has yet to undergo
drilling tests that would prove what is actually there.
</P>
<P>
   But ``this is big,'' said a Western official here, who spoke on
condition of anonymity. Referring to the $500 million signing bonus
from the two companies to Kazakhstan, the official added, ``That's
a lot of money'' for something sight unseen.
</P>
<P>
   With the deal, the two companies join a consortium that includes
Mobil, Royal Dutch/Shell, Total of France, Agip of Italy, British
Gas and British Petroleum.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly $50 billion in U.S.-led private energy investment has
been pledged over the last few years to the three regional
republics richest in oil and natural gas _ Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan
and Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time horizon that oil companies have is pretty long,''
said Otbert de Jong, head of the ABN-Amro Bank branch here.
``You'll see that events, such as the low oil prices at present,
won't influence decisions now. My feeling in general is that they
will remain very enthusiastic and keep things ticking over.''

NORTH KOREA TRIED TO LAUNCH SATELLITE, U.S. SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States now believes that North Korea
tried, but failed, to launch a small satellite into orbit when it
fired a multistage rocket in an arc over Japan two weeks ago,
administration and defense officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The rocket, however, was significantly more powerful than
American defense and intelligence officials first reported. The
officials now say that the rocket had three stages, not two, and
that the final stage used solid fuel, a significant technological
leap for North Korea's missile program.
</P>
<P>
   The third stage of the rocket, which carried a small satellite,
broke up somewhere over the Pacific Ocean before reaching orbit,
said the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of the satellite indicated that North Korea has not
yet mastered solid-fuel technology, but the officials said the
effort alone suggested that North Korea's program might be more
ambitious and advanced than was widely believed. One government
official said Monday that if North Korea perfected a third stage in
future tests, its missiles would have a range of some 3,500 miles,
enough to reach parts of Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has strongly condemned North Korea's launching
of the rocket on Aug. 31, calling it a provocation that needlessly
stoked tensions in the region. In the two weeks since then,
however, the administration has had to retreat from its initial
assessment of the firing, which intelligence agencies monitored
closely and declared to be a test of a two-stage rocket called the
Taepodong-1.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea has claimed it successfully placed a satellite into
an oval orbit around the earth for peaceful scientific purposes,
including the broadcast of ``immortal revolutionary hymns'' in
honor of its paramount ruler, Kim Jong Il, and his father, Kim Il
Sung, who died in 1994. The launch came only days before North
Korea celebrated its 50th anniversary and consolidated Kim Jong
Il's power as chairman of the National Defense Commission.
</P>
<P>
   But the U.S. Space Command at Peterson Air Force Base in
Colorado, which tracks objects in orbit, has been unable to verify
North Korea's claims, nor has anyone at the Pentagon or the
intelligence agencies been able to tune in to the hymns, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have concluded that North Korea did attempt to orbit a very
small satellite,'' the State Department's spokesman, James Rubin,
said Monday. ``We also have concluded the satellite failed to
achieve orbit.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin went on to say the launch itself confirmed North Korea's
``inherent capability to threaten its neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the State Department announced that a North Korean
delegation had agreed to resume talks about its missile program in
October in New York City. Those talks, which never advanced very
far, were suspended a year ago after two of North Korea's diplomats
defected to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Milhollin, director of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear
Arms Control, a research organization in Washington, said the
disclosures suggested North Korea was intent on building
intercontinental ballistic missiles. ``I don't want to sound
alarmist,'' he said, ``but that's where we are heading.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a day of respite from the intense circumspection
going on in Washington, President Clinton came to New York on
Monday in pursuit of money and perhaps solace, and found some of
both.
</P>
<P>
   Making his first trip since the release of the Starr report and
accompanied by his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Clinton gave a
speech on the global economy before a foreign policy group and
planned to circulate at three crowded Democratic fund-raisers,
including an evening performance of ``The Lion King.'' Among a
populace long supportive of him, he was largely greeted with
encouragement to proceed with his job, though he also encountered
his share of dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   In a city in which presidential visits are humdrum and often
disdained for the gridlock they add to already car-choked streets,
there was keener interest than usual in Clinton's itinerary in the
wake of the report from the independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like what he did, but I'm not angry at him,'' said
Mary Kane, a medical administrator trying to catch a view of the
president as he arrived for his speech Monday morning on East 68th
Street, down the block from where she works. ``I'd love to see him.
I'd tell him, `Good luck and I wish you well.'''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout a day that the Democratic Party said raised more than
$4 million, there seemed to be more affirmation than antipathy
among hundreds who lined the avenues as Clinton's motorcade wound
its way from a speech at the Council on Foreign Relations on 68th
Street and Park Avenue to the trio of fund-raisers. People pressed
against police sawhorses along Park Avenue clapped and waved as he
proceeded to lunch on 60th Street. There were only a handful of
picketers calling for his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think what he did was necessarily awful,'' said Adam
Gana, a freshman at Hunter College, which is situated just across
from where the president was speaking. ``I think maybe he should
have been a little more considerate and not lied. But I like the
president. I don't think he's a bad guy. If I could get a word with
him, I'd ask him about the universal health coverage rather than
the stupid affairs he's had.''
</P>
<P>
   Later on, as Clinton passed down Fifth Avenue on the way to the
Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, people were lined seven and eight deep for
10 blocks, craning for a look at him, and some of them waited
patiently for more than an hour. When he approached the hotel,
about half of the crowd there cheered and the other half booed.
</P>
<P>
   Some called for his resignation. ``I feel he should resign,''
said Ivan Richards, 30, a Manhattan therapist. ``It's put a stop on
our country. We can't get anything done.''
</P>
<P>
   Others wanted him to fight on. ``I'm out here because it's still
exciting to see the president,'' said Andrea DeMaso, 25, a
marketing executive from Dix Hills, N.Y. ``I think he's doing a
good job and has only done what all the presidents before him have
done.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At his various stops, Clinton sidestepped any discussion of the
Lewinsky matter. His morning speech was presented to about 150
people, who were polite but not especially enthusiastic. Some
council members who had been invited stayed away.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those who did come were reading newspaper coverage of
the Lewinsky matter and then hastily tucked the papers away when
word came that the president had arrived. Theodore Sorensen, who
attended the speech, summed up the feelings of many by saying that
while Clinton's lying under oath was ``inexcusable, it does not
amount to high crimes and misdemeanors.'' Some others, who insisted
on anonymity, were more critical and said that his conduct had
diminished the presidency and they hoped that he would resign.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton took no questions, and when a reporter twice shouted to
him whether he would accept censure from Congress, Clinton ignored
him.
</P>
<P>
   At a $50,000-a-couple fund-raising luncheon on Fifth Avenue,
Clinton did allude to the latest events when he said, ``The
adversity of the moment, I think, has led us to this record
turnout. Why? Because people made a decision and they thought they
were needed and they stood up.''
</P>
<P>
   The luncheon was held in the two-story penthouse of Denise Rich,
a socialite, philanthropist and lyricist, whose ex-husband, Marc
Rich, is a fugitive commodities trader who fled the country rather
than face prosecution in a tax case. Sixty couples filled tables
arranged in three rooms, and others were turned away because of
lack of space. Clinton had his grilled sea bass in a different room
from his wife. Vice President Al Gore and Rep. Richard Gephardt
attended, though Charles Rangel was the solitary New York
politician to show up.
</P>
<P>
   In his introduction, Steve Grossman, chairman of the Democratic
National Committee, said, ``Mr. President, it seems to me that you
have demonstrated, at least in my adult lifetime, a higher
commitment to the kind of moral leadership that I value in public
service and public policy than any other person I've ever met.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in his brief remarks, said, ``I know that I speak for
Hillary when I say we thank you for your personal friendship and
support. It means more now than ever, and we'll never forget it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon, Clinton stopped at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel,
the lodging choice of presidents since the days of Hoover, where he
had a rest break before his evening appearances. He called Sammy
Sosa and congratulated the Chicago Cubs' outfielder on matching
Mark McGwire's record 62 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the dignitary-hardened hotel staff said there was
more excitement than customary given recent news developments. ``I
have no problem with him being here,'' said Geraldine Grays, a
lobby attendant polishing the brass banisters. ``Just leave him
alone. Let him do the job. I know some of the guests said he should
be seen today. He needs all the support he can get.''
</P>
<P>
   In the evening, Clinton and his wife dined with 400 people who
had paid $10,000 a plate at the Supper Club, a dinner and dancing
establishment on West 47th Street. The president's arrival

NEW YORKERS OFFER CLINTON A SUBDUED CHEER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK - There was no strolling or shopping this time around.
</P>
<P>
   On his past trips to Manhattan, President Clinton has stepped
out of his limo to mingle with the people and buy some trinkets in
a mall.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, though, as he was shuttled from one Manhattan fundraiser
to the next, the president stayed securely behind the armored
plating and the tinted glass.
</P>
<P>
   New York has long been a hospitable stop for Clinton, and New
Yorkers remain as supportive as any, even amid his current
troubles. The Daily News' editorial Monday blared, ``City to Bubba:
Hang in there.''
</P>
<P>
   And indeed, hundreds of people waved and cheered as his
motorcade zoomed down Park Avenue in the morning, Fifth Avenue in
the afternoon, and Broadway in the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the applause was far from feverish _ or unanimous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a unionist, I'm for the president 100 percent,'' said Jose
Rosado. ``But I will never vote for him again, even if he runs for
something. I have a family. I have morals.''
</P>
<P>
   Jean Piersol, a teacher visiting the city from San Francisco,
said, ``I'm disappointed in him. He's a brilliant man, but he's so
stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, she stood on the sidewalk for nearly an hour,
waiting for a glimpse of Clinton, as he left a $50,000-a-seat
luncheon in the Fifth Avenue penthouse of Denise Rich.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited,'' Piersol admitted. ``It's the President. It's
bigger than him. I want to get a picture of him for my class _
though maybe I'll wait a while to show it to them, 'till after this
has blown over.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate over Clinton's behavior and the Kenneth Starr report
carried into the streets, as the crowds waited for the president to
pass and the barricades to be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should resign and I think the people who are up there with
him,'' said Walker Dean, a commercial real-estate consultant, ``are
a bunch of hypocrites.''
</P>
<P>
   A schoolteacher who identified herself only as Barbara replied,
``What, you think this hasn't been going on since George
Washington's day? Look at Kennedy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not talking about Washington or Kennedy,'' Dean replied.
``We're talking about this president in 1998. Our times have
changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Three women from Trenton, N.J., who had come into Manhattan on
the train to shop, were all for the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Ken Starr investigation is the most phenomenal waste of
money,'' said Ellen Glover. ``I don't condone Clinton's behavior,
but really, it's his personal life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We already knew he was a cheat,'' added her friend, Sherry
Bailey. ``The only person he should have to answer to is Hillary.
When someone asks you a question that's none of their business, you
don't have an obligation to answer it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the evening, as Clinton headed toward Times Square _ first
for a dinner at The Supper Club, then a special performance of
``The Lion King'' at Disney's New Amsterdam Theater, with tickets
priced from $125 to $100,000 a seat _ the argument raged on.
</P>
<P>
   George Cruikshank held a sign reading ``Clinton Is the Real
Lyin' King,'' and shouted, ``Where's the outrage?''
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Reedy, an office supervisor in the area, sneered back,
``He's no lying king. He's a good man. All these people in Congress
are doing the same thing. The only difference is they didn't get
caught.''
</P>
<P>
   The most widespread criticism of Clinton Monday concerned how
badly his trip here _ with its attendant security and roadblocks
and pedestrian barricades _ was tying up traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell him to stay the hell out of New York,'' said an Upper
East Sider who was blocked from getting to work by barricades
around the Council on Foreign Relations, where Clinton delivered a
policy address on international economics in the morning. ``He
messes up the whole town every month, it seems.''
</P>
<P>
   Tempers flared hotter still in Times Square, where security
measures went into effect during the evening rush hour. ``Is the
president going to pay my parking bill?'' asked one man who was
blocked from getting to the garage where he parks his car. Other
office workers pleaded with police to let them through so they
could get home to sick children, angry spouses, or starving pets.

NO INCREASED HEART ATTACK RISK FROM LOW-ESTROGEN, ORAL
CONTRACEPTIVES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RUTH SoRELLE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Women taking the current formulations of low-estrogen, oral
contraceptives do not face increased risks of heart attack,
according to a report in the Houston-based journal Circulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are saying that if you are not at high risk for heart
attack _ you don't smoke, have a normal blood pressure, are not
obese _ then oral contraceptives are OK for you to use,'' said Dr.
Stephen Sidney, assistant director for clinical research at the
Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers also found no differences between women taking
pills containing either of the two forms of the hormone called
progestin, commonly used in current oral contraceptives.
</P>
<P>
   The study analyzed the results of studies involving 271 women
between the age of 18 and 44 who had heart attacks, and 993 similar
women who had not suffered a heart attack. The women were drawn
from groups at Kaiser Permanente and the University of Washington
at Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   After statistically compensating for heart attack risk factors,
the researchers found that women who took the birth control pills
were no more likely to have heart attacks than those who had
stopped taking the pills or had never taken it.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 68 percent of the women who had heart attacks were
smokers. Only 22 percent of women who did not have a heart attack
were smokers.
</P>
<P>
   The mean body mass index (BMI) _ a measure of a person's percent
of body fat and an indication of obesity _ of the women who had
heart attacks was above 30, compared with 25.5 in the women who did
not have heart attacks. The National Center for Health Statistics
defines overweight as a BMI of 25-29, and obesity as 30 or greater.
</P>
<P>
   While the risks associated with stroke and birth control pill
have received the most attention, ``I think historically all
cardiovascular disease has been of some interest in the field of
oral contraceptives,'' Sydney said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier studies had shown that such pills did increase the risk
of stroke, deeply seated blood clots and heart attacks, he said.
But those studies had involved oral contraceptives that contained
much higher concentrations of estrogen.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney said he thinks the difference in this study is the pill
itself. Newer forms of birth control pills have much lower
concentrations of estrogen.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said, the study does not prove that the lower dose
pills are less likely to cause heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The caveat that Sydney stressed is the possibility of risk
factors. Smoking, high blood pressure and obesity raise a person's
risk of heart disease, and those people probably should not use
oral contraceptives, he said.
</P>
<P>
   One important point to remember, he said, is the rarity of heart
attacks in young women who are under age 45.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they happen, they are explained by the traditional risk
factors for heart disease,'' he said.

FBI CHIEF CITES CIA HELP IN AFRICAN BOMBING INQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUDAPEST, Hungary, _ The director of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, Louis Freeh, said Monday that much of the progress
made in the investigation of the bombings of two U.S. embassies in
East Africa had been a result of close cooperation between two
usually rival agencies: the FBI and the Central Intelligence
Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh, who was visiting an FBI-financed international training
center here, said in an interview that it ``doesn't make sense''
for past antagonisms to hamper collaboration between two
organizations that can help each other fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the work in the East Africa bombings is the product
of close cooperation of the agency and the FBI in terms of locating
suspects and obtaining lawful evidence that FBI agents can
introduce in court,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA has long fought to preserve its overseas authority
exclusively for itself, but it does not have law-enforcement
powers. The FBI has begun to expand outside the United States to
investigate crimes against Americans overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh has made expanding the reach of the bureau a hallmark of
his tenure. He has sent agents to Tbilisi, Georgia, to help in the
investigation of the assassination attempt against President Eduard
Shevardnadze and here to Budapest, where Russian organized crime
has become a threat to economic stability.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau now has 32 offices overseas, including one in Moscow,
and negotiations are under way for the opening of an office in
China.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh said there were still about 100 FBI agents in Kenya and
Tanzania working on aspects of the embassy bombings in August. The
bureau is getting help from the authorities in a number of
countries, including the Comoros, a remote republic of islands off
the coast of East Africa, where agents raided several homes this
month seeking a suspect.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At the International Law Enforcement Academy that opened here
with FBI financing in 1995, Freeh addressed a class of more than 40
Russian, Polish and Estonian police officers selected to take part
in an eight-week course with U.S. law enforcement instructors.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 700 police officers from Central and Eastern Europe and
the former Soviet Union have taken part in the courses, which
relate to crimes like money laundering and weapons- and
people-smuggling as well as terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh also announced the formation of a U.S.-Hungarian organized
crime force to assist the Hungarian police in new techniques of
discovering computer-driven money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. ambassador to Hungary, Peter Tufo, said more than one
Russian-speaking organized crime group with involvement in the
United States now had headquarters in Budapest.

ONLY EIGHT FLIGHT 111 VICTIMS IDENTIFIED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Budgeted as Swissair-Valuables; i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TATSHA ROBERTSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia _ Although Navy divers have spent nearly
two weeks combing the ocean floor for remains from Swissair Flight
111, officials as of Monday had identified the bodies of only eight
of the 229 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
   The process is being slowed by the need to gather DNA and
medical records, said John Butt, chief medical examiner of Nova
Scotia. Some of the records also have to be translated.
</P>
<P>
   The mammoth diving and recovery process is still under way but
Butt said he believes there are no human remains scattered outside
the debris area, which leads officials to think they will probably
be found inside several large pieces of the fuselage.
</P>
<P>
   If the recovery process becomes too dangerous, said Butt, the
remains might have to be pulled up with the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't come to that point, yet,'' said Cmdr. Kevin Carle,
spokesman for the Canadian Navy. ``The navy's priority hasn't
shifted. It is still collecting the victim's remains.''
</P>
<P>
   But Carle said the recovery process is extremely dangerous and
slow. ``You have to understand that being down there is like
walking among a hedge of razor blades,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The USS Grapple, a salvage ship, is moored to large concrete
blocks, preparing to raise sections of the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, Navy divers found the second ``black box'' or
cockpit voice recorder. Officials are hoping conversations from the
tape, which records in 30-minute continuous loops, will help
explain the cause of the MD-11 crash on Sept. 2. However, Canadian
law prohibits disclosure of transcripts of the tape to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Swissair officials confirmed Monday, in a statement,
that the flight was carrying valuables on board, including an
original Picasso called ``Le Peintre,'' or ``the painter.'' The art
piece was worth $1.5 million. The plane was also carrying bank
notes, watches and jewelry, as well as another unknown art piece.
</P>
<P>
   The statement said Swissair carries some 200,000 valuable
consignments a year. Officials have also confirmed that a large sum
of money, maybe in the millions, was on the plane, secured in a
container. None of the valuables has been retrieved, said
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Police said poachers ``will not be tolerated and will be dealt
with swiftly.''

TOP CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS CALL ON CLINTON TO STOP LEGAL
`HAIR-SPLITTING'

 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The two Democratic leaders of Congress sharply
admonished the White House Monday to stop trying to make legal
justifications for President Clinton's misleading testimony about
his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. But buoyed by polls showing
the nation still reluctant to embark on impeachment, they also
called for quick decisions to resolve the nation's constitutional
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The similar statements by House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt
and Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle positioned them squarely in
synch with the perceived public mood. Their remarks were designed,
aides said, to head off any Republican efforts to have protracted
impeachment hearings lasting well into next year.
</P>
<P>
   But while Republicans pledged to move in timely fashion, they
appeared to be looking at precisely the kind of broad-reaching and
time-consuming inquiry that Democrats want to avoid. Rep. Henry
Hyde, R-Ill., the Judiciary Committee chairman and therefore the
person who oversees the impeachment process, said he would not rule
out expanding any inquiry beyond the president's affair with Ms.
Lewinsky and efforts to cover it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is certainly a possibility,'' he said, explaining that
Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth Starr could still send
Congress information on other matters he has investigated and that
``we would be duty bound to consider whatever he sends us.'' He
also did not rule out an extensive inquiry even if Starr did not
make another report, called a referral. ``It's possible,'' said
Hyde.
</P>
<P>
   The positioning in Congress came as members of the House and
Senate returned to Washington after a weekend of sampling
constituent opinion to the flood of sordid details about Clinton's
relationship with a White House intern. Sentiment varied from
district to district, with Republicans generally seeking punishment
of Clinton but Democrats saying both impeachment and resignation
are too harsh, and finding conflicting feelings from a nation that
wants Clinton rebuked but fears the trauma of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for a way to salvage the situation for the White House,
both Gephardt and Daschle _ in their first reactions since Starr's
report was made public on Friday _ warned President Clinton against
the kind of defense his lawyers put forth on weekend talk shows
when they continued to argue that he had not lied in legal
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly agree with those who have grown impatient with
hair-splitting over legal technicalities,'' Daschle said. ``There
is a basic understanding of the truthfulness that the president
failed to meet.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``The president and his advisers must accept that
continued legal jousting serves no constructive purpose. It simply
stands in the way of what we need to do: move forward and let
common sense guide us in doing what is best for the country.''

BLACK CAUCUS SUPPORTS EMBATTLED CLINTON 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Members of the Congressional Black Caucus, seeing
parallels between President Clinton's plight and the persecution of
African Americans, continue to support the embattled chief
executive despite allegations that he lied under oath, obstructed
justice and abused his power.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than expressing anger at the president, the group of 38
congressional Democrats have focused their wrath on independent
counsel Kenneth Starr. The special prosecutor last week issued a
report alleging 11 impeachable offenses by Clinton and containing
salacious details of the president's extramarital affair with
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black people have known what it's like to be hounded and
prosecuted and to be selectively investigated,'' Rep. Charles
Rangel, D-N.Y., said Monday. ``The ability to pursue somebody is
subjective. Prosecution ... can turn to persecution.''
</P>
<P>
   Other caucus members said many black Americans feel kinship with
Clinton _ a powerful white man _ based on their belief he is a
victim of a justice system that has singled him out for punishment
on questionable grounds and evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many African Americans ... feel that he has been railroaded,''
said Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., D-Ill., the son of the civil rights
leader. Black Americans need to be assured that Clinton will
receive ``due process of law, a sense of fairness and equal
protection under the law,'' Jackson added.
</P>
<P>
   ``That process must be fair,'' the congressman said of the House
Judiciary Committee's consideration of whether to launch an
impeachment inquiry. ``When the facts emerge, let the chips fall
where they may.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Danny Davis, D-Ill., said the president's efforts to reach
out to the African-American community have played a larger part in
the good will he is receiving than any parallels to black
persecution.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton has demonstrated awareness and some positive
movement toward issues that affect African-American life,'' Davis
said, referring to the president's efforts to protect low-income
assistance programs. ``They recognize that President Clinton has
stood between the low-income community and disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., echoed Rangel and Jackson,
saying black men have been unfairly targeted by police and
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``African-American people have felt so much pain,'' Cummings
said. ``Anything that smacks of abuse they can understand.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Cummings said, blacks will have an open mind as the
House weighs whether to proceed with the impeachment process.
``African Americans can handle results as long as the process is
fair,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The black caucus has no official position on the Clinton scandal
and has held no formal discussions on the president's situation.
Nevertheless, the panel's overwhelming support for Clinton mirrors
polling data that show widespread support among blacks for the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton enjoys a 90 percent overall favorable rating among black
Americans, according to a poll last week from the independent Pew
Research Center for the People &AMP; the Press. In addition, 91 percent
of blacks said Clinton should stay in office while 6 percent said
he should resign; in contrast, 76 percent of whites said the
president should remain while 20 percent called on him to quit.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 63 House members who voted Friday against the immediate
public release of independent counsel Kenneth Starr's report, 29
belong to the black caucus, including Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee,
D-Houston. Members who voted against the rule, which cleared the
way for the report to be put on the Internet, said it was unfair to
allow the public to see the document before the accused president
could.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the general public will not be deceived by this
Hollywood-type production and promotion of this issue by
independent counsel Ken Starr and the Republican-controlled
Congress,'' said Rep. William Clay, D-Mo. ``I saw nothing new in
the charges against President Clinton. The so-called 11 impeachable
items are a real legal stretch by a highly partisan prosecutor who
seemingly spent $40 million of taxpayer funds to produce a
government document to rival Hustler magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Eva Clayton, D-N.C., said the American ideal of equal
justice demanded that Clinton should have had a chance to respond
to the report before it was made public.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president should not have any more rights than any other
accused person, but he should not have any less,'' Clayton said in
voting against release of the Starr report without first allowing
the president to see it. ``Any citizen, similarly situated would be
entitled to know what the accusations are and who are the accusers.
It is a sad and dangerous day in the history of this nation when
the principles upon which this nation was founded bow to the
pressures of what is politic and what is fashionable.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangel, however, voted for the immediate release of the report
despite his misgivings. ``I didn't think I should be unfair and
deny the American people a chance to review it,'' Rangel said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's private attorney David Kendall did provide a rebuttal
to the report before it was released. But the response was based
solely on media accounts of what the report contained, Kendall
said. &QL;

SCANDALOUS LESSONS FOR CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   UNDATED - The gentleman on the telephone spoke loudly and
quickly and hung up before I could answer his question, which was:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, moron, what kind of sick lesson do YOU think this putrid
Clinton scandal is teaching our children?''
</P>
<P>
   Had he stayed on the line I would have told him that, near as I
can tell, there isn't one lesson to be taught, but many.
</P>
<P>
   For example, our children might learn that some of our most
opinionated citizens choose to speak anonymously.
</P>
<P>
   I received a number of such calls over the weekend. This one was
left on my answering machine by an unidentified woman:
</P>
<P>
   ``Reading your column in the paper, E.J., you are such a biased
(expletive). . .We just don't want Clinton to be president anymore.
Why can't you get that through your thick skull, you idiot!''
</P>
<P>
   This came from a brusk, confident-sounding but unnamed man:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, E-GAY. I feel your pain. You and that sick president,
E-GAY!''
</P>
<P>
   And this from another a self-assured fellow who, like the
others, chose not to identify himself:
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, Slick Willie's got the Democrat liberals looking like
roaches on their backs floating on a toilet seat. All kind of
twitchy. How's it feel, you little queer? How's it to see your boy
go down like this. Twisting. Agonizing. Does it hurt you, Montini?
You little queer. If this was a Republican, you'd be squealing like
the (expletive) little rat that you are. All right? But you just
want us to forget it and get on with life. Hey, Twitchy.
(Expletive).''
</P>
<P>
   From these people our children might learn is that, among
certain grown-ups, the most insulting thing you can say to someone
else involves an ugly variation on the word ``homosexual.''
</P>
<P>
   They'd also see that those who use such slurs rarely have the
guts to own up to it.
</P>
<P>
   That alone would be invaluable information to a child.
</P>
<P>
   And it's just the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   A concerned, polite father from Scottsdale telephoned to ask,
``If Clinton isn't impeached and removed from office, wouldn't that
tell our kids that lying has no consequences?''
</P>
<P>
   It might, but only if the public humiliation Clinton is going
through is inconsequential.
</P>
<P>
   Only if embarrassing your wife and daughter and ruining your
reputation is not a consequence.
</P>
<P>
   Only if making yourself the butt of an international joke is not
a consequence.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, some of Clinton's biggest detractors in
government said there would be no need for impeachment if he would
own up to his relationship with Monica Lewinsky and apologize for
what he'd done.
</P>
<P>
   He's been apologizing daily for about a month, now, but the
politicians have changed their minds, saying Clinton's repentance
wasn't quick enough and hasn't been ``sincere'' enough.
</P>
<P>
   Children could learn a lot from that about self-righteousness.
</P>
<P>
   And promises.
</P>
<P>
   If we wanted to, we even could teach children about Kenneth
Starr, the special prosecutor. He has called Clinton a liar and
wants him kicked out of office for it.
</P>
<P>
   Starr once represented the Brown &AMP; Williamson tobacco company.
</P>
<P>
   When was the last time a responsible American adult told
children to believe cigarette makers or their representatives?
</P>
<P>
   What lesson can our children learn from someone like Starr
pointing the finger at someone like Clinton?
</P>
<P>
   That it's OK to side with liars _ for a fat retainer?
</P>
<P>
   That's it's OK to lie in business but not in one's personal
life?
</P>
<P>
   If the politicians holding the rocks ever tossed a few at the
big glass houses of Congress, our children would see that the most
scandalous information to be learned from the Clinton affair has
nothing to do with sex, but with power.
</P>
<P>
   There is even a lesson or two for us adults. The most valuable
being:
</P>
<P>

STOCKS POST STRONG GAINS FOR 2ND STRAIGHT SESSION

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices posted strong, broadly based gains for
the second consecutive session Monday, buoyed at least in part by
wisps of optimism that a range of domestic and international
problems that seemed so destabilizing and insuperable a few weeks
ago may be ultimately resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 149.85 points, or 1.92
percent, to 7,945.35. Earlier in the session the blue-chip index
was up as much as 244 points.
</P>
<P>
   Broader market measures also posted strong gains. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index rose 20.66 points, or 2.05 percent, to
1,029.72. The Nasdaq composite index, which is heavily weighted in
technology issues, increased by 24.05 points, or 1.46 percent, to
1,665.69. The Russell 2000 index of small stocks rose 4.10 points,
or 1.16 percent, to 357.72. On the Big Board, advancing issues
outpaced stocks that fell in price by a ratio of two to one. Volume
was 714.4 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   The gains followed a good day on foreign equity markets and a
rally by the dollar on foreign exchange markets.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and traders said investors in this country and
elsewhere were encouraged by a number of recent developments,
including a spate of public opinion polls conducted over the
weekend that showed little or no erosion in support for President
Clinton despite the allegations in Special Prosecutor Kenneth
Starr's report to Congress. Analysts said some expressed relief
that much of the substance in the report had been leaked to the
media before it was formally released.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, word that the International Monetary Fund is
prepared to provide a financial package for Brazil, if necessary,
was seen as a positive.
</P>
<P>
   So too was a speech the president gave in New York Monday in
which he highlighted the need to pursue policies that promote
growth around the world. That view was reiterated later in the day
by officials representing the Group of Seven industrial nations.
Clinton's remarks and those by the G-7 follow a Sept. 4 speech by
Alan Greenspan, in which the Federal Reserve Board chairman said
inflation was not a near-term concern for the central bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is now acknowledging what the risks are, which is
reassuring,'' said David Hale, chief economist for the Zurich
Group. ``And the good news for Clinton is that the Starr report had
nothing new in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Smith, chief investment strategist at Prudential
Securities, said that in addition to hopes that key international
economic problems may be addressed on a coordinated basis,
investors were encouraged by announcements last week from Intel
Corp. and General Electric Co. that third quarter results will be
better than previously expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were a couple of really important announcements,'' he
said, ``GE for leadership reasons and Intel because of its
bellwether status in the high-tech group.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Okesky, head of block trading at Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter, said the tone of Monday's session was much like last
Friday, when stock prices also staged a broad advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our clients are definitely more relaxed'' than they were a few
weeks ago, he said. ``Not many are particularly bullish, but the
market has not fallen off a cliff, and that provides some relief.''
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of what might be a coordinated cut in interest
rates around the world, coupled with the promise of IMF help for
Brazil, helped to bolster bank and financial company stock prices,
whose shares have been battered in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Citicorp rose 5 a share Monday, to 101. American Express was up
3 5/16, to 81 11/16. Merrill Lynch gained 1 5/8, to 57 7/8.
</P>
<P>
   Drug stocks were also big gainers. Merck &AMP; Co. rose 4, to $132,
and Eli Lilly gained 1 5/16, to 76 3/16, after doctors at the
European Congress of Osteoporosis conference said their new drugs
offer new hope for treating the disease, which afflicts an
estimated 200 million women.
</P>
<P>
   And airline stocks were big gainers after the newspaper Barron's
reported over the weekend that these stocks represented very good
value at current price levels.
</P>
<P>
   AMR Corp., parent of American Airlines, gained 4 15/16, to 60
1/2; UAL Corp., holding company for United Airlines, rose 5 7/16,
to 69 3/16, and Delta Air Lines rose by 8 3/4, to 104 1/8.
</P>
<P>
   Deere &AMP; Co. and Walt Disney &AMP; Co. were among the losers for the
session, as investors sold shares after the companies said
quarterly earnings will be lower than previously forecast. Deere
dropped 1 3/4, to 31 7/16, and Disney lost 1 3/8, to 24 7/16.
</P>
<P>
   The market's recent performance has encouraged some technicians
to predict that the steep slide in prices may be over for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is at least a short-term bottoming or stabilizing
reaction, and could be the start of a rally that lasts for a month
or so,'' said Richard McCabe, chief market analyst at Merrill Lynch
&AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Still, few are prepared to pronounce that the political and
financial problems facing policy-makers here and around the globe
have been solved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Markets around the world seem to have concluded the president
will stay in office, and that we will have some leadership in the
United States at an extraordinarily tricky time,'' said Hugh
Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``But actions speak louder than words. Congress has to approve
the $17.9 billion requested for the IMF, not the $3.5 billion that
was voted out of the House Appropriations Committee last week. The
Fed has to cut interest rates. Japan has to reflate its economy and
reform its banking system. In short, we need to see things get
done. There is still a healthy level of skepticism.''

TOTAL SPENDING ON HEALTH CARE TO RISE STEEPLY IN NEXT DECADE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After five years of relatively slow growth, total
spending on health care in the United States will climb briskly
over the next decade, doubling by 2007, federal officials said on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   And in a reversal of recent trends, they said, private spending
will grow faster than public outlays.
</P>
<P>
   In a new report, the Department of Health and Human Services
predicted that health spending would rise to $2.1 trillion in 2007,
from slightly more than $1 trillion last year.
</P>
<P>
   The department said health care would account for a growing
share of the nation's total output: 16.6 percent of the gross
domestic product in 2007, as against 13.4 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   Sheila Smith, the main author of the report, published Monday in
the journal Health Affairs, said the growth in per capita health
spending, after adjusting for inflation, would ``be driven almost
entirely by rising expenditures in the private rather than the
public sector.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent actions by Congress, especially passage of the Balanced
Budget Act of 1997, are slowing the growth of Medicare and
Medicaid, the health programs for the elderly and the poor.
</P>
<P>
   But the authors of the new study foresee ``a rebound'' in
private health care spending, mainly because of ``increases in the
use and intensity of services'' rather than price increases.
</P>
<P>
   Government economists predict that private health insurance
premiums will rise an average of 7 percent to 8 percent a year in
the coming decade, much more than in the last few years. But the
Congressional Budget Office and some private experts on employee
benefits, like Jon Gabel of KPMG Peat Marwick, say the increases
will be more modest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since 1995, increases in premiums have been less than the
increase in the gross domestic product,'' Gabel said, and he
expects premiums to rise 4 percent to 5 percent a year in the
coming decade.
</P>
<P>
   The federal study says that increases in real per capita income
over the next decade will increase the demand for health care
services, because consumers will have more to spend on health care.
But it says that health maintenance organizations and other forms
of managed care ``will play a smaller role'' in controlling costs
than they have in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-five percent of the people with employer-sponsored health
insurance are already in some type of managed care. And the authors
say that HMOs do not save money for Medicare because the payment
rates are based on what is paid in Medicare's traditional
fee-for-service program.
</P>
<P>
   The number of people without health insurance has been
increasing by 1 million a year and now exceeds 41 million. In the
next few years, the report says, the number of uninsured may grow
more slowly, as more employers offer health benefits to attract
workers at a time of very low unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   But the authors said that the trend of recent years would
eventually resume, so that a larger proportion of Americans would
be uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   Population growth accounts for a relatively small share of the
increase in total health spending. The government predicts that
national health spending will average $7,100 for each American in
2007, up from $3,904 last year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the last five years, from 1992 to 1997, public spending on
health care rose twice as fast as private spending: 7.4 percent a
year, as against 3.7 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   But in the next five years, from 1997 to 2002, private health
spending will rise faster than public spending (7 percent a year,
as against 5.9 percent a year), the department predicts.
</P>
<P>
   The government foresees sharp increases in the growth of
spending for doctors' services and prescription drugs over the next
five years. But it predicts that spending for nursing homes and
home health care will grow more slowly than in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   From 1998 to 2000, the report said, ``Medicare spending for
inpatient hospital services is expected to grow at the lowest rate
in the program's history _ an average of 3 percent a year, compared
with 8.2 percent a year for 1993-1996.''
</P>
<P>
   Many doctors have harshly criticized HMOs, but the report says
that managed care will be responsible for much of the increase in
spending on doctors' services, since HMOs substitute outpatient
doctors' services for hospital care when possible.
</P>
<P>
   Spending for doctors' services increased an average of 3.6
percent a year from 1992 to 1997, but will rise an average of 7.3
percent a year in the coming decade, the government predicts.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith, the main author of the report, said that only some of
the new spending would show up as an increase in doctors' incomes.
Many doctors will, in effect, have to do more work. The total
volume of doctors' services will increase, as consumers demand more
access to medical specialists, free of the constraints imposed by
the most restrictive HMOs, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The report said increases in drug prices had been ``relatively
restrained'' since 1993. But the Department of Health and Human
Services said, ``Expenditures for drugs are expected to grow
rapidly through 2007 as more prescriptions are written and the mix
of prescriptions shifts to more expensive drugs.''

NASA TO BUY MORE RUSSIAN HARDWARE TO HELP FUN SPACE STATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASA has opened negotiations to purchase more Russian hardware
for the international space station in a bid to give that country
enough cash to keep up its end of the partnership.
</P>
<P>
   NASA hopes to begin assembly of the new orbital laboratory on
Nov. 20., the date it established late last May. But Russia,
suffering from an eroding economy, recently announced a new
three-month delay in completion of a crucial early component called
the service module.
</P>
<P>
   Denied most of its budget this year, the Russian Space Agency
needs the equivalent of $10 million to complete the service module,
said Joseph Rothenberg, NASA's associate administrator for space
flight.
</P>
<P>
   Lack of funding has forced the Russians to set back the launch
of the service module from April to July 1999. The 42,000 pound
module is required to house the new station's first occupants as
well as to keep the spacecraft circling at a safe altitude above
the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to assure funding and stop further delays of the
service module, NASA is negotiating for the purchase of two Russian
Soyuz crew capsules. The three-person Soyuz craft would be docked
to the new station in late 2002 to serve as life boats. The
capsules would allow the station's permanent population to grow
from three to six astronauts and cosmonauts.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the station's resident crew will grow to seven as
NASA replaces the Soyuz rescue craft with at least one seven-person
U.S. rescue ship that is permanently docked to the station.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, that will give the up front cash to the Russians
and they will be able to pay off (their contractors for) the
remaining parts they need to get the service module on track,''
Rothenberg said from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   He could not provide a cost estimate. The trade publication
Space News, however, citing Russian space officials, placed the
cost of a Soyuz capsule at about $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   According to Rothenberg, the service module lacks 10 relatively
small components for completion.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most vital of those are two of three star trackers,
optical devices that are needed for the guidance system to keep the
station correctly oriented in space.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are launch critical,'' said Rothenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Other components needed include sensors that relay pressure and
temperature readings to the ground as well as some communications
transmitters and a backup device for cleansing breathing air of
carbon dioxide.
</P>
<P>
   Previous funding problems with Russia's service module forced
NASA to delay its launching from April 1998 to April 1999. Each of
those in turn has prompted the United States to delay the start of
station assembly from November 1997 to November 1998.
</P>
<P>
   NASA seems determined to absorb the latest three-month slip in
the service module without new delays to the start of the station's
five-year construction.
</P>
<P>
   The new station's first module _ a U.S.-financed, Russian-built
guidance and propulsion device called the Zarya control module _ is
targeted for a Nov. 20 launching from central Asia.
</P>
<P>
   It is to be joined by the U. S.-financed and built Node 1 module
dubbed ``Unity'' in early December. Launched by the space shuttle
Endeavour on Dec. 3, Unity is equipped with six docking ports that
will link future U.S. and Russian modules.
</P>
<P>
   Those dates were agreed to by the station's U.S., Russian,
European, Japanese and Canadian partners late last May.
</P>
<P>
   The Nov. 20 and Dec. 3 launch dates can hold as long as the
launching of Russia's service module does not slip past September
of next year, Rothenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The control module has enough propellant and electrical power to
keep itself and the Unity node safely orbiting the Earth for 500
days before it must be joined by the service module.
</P>
<P>
   NASA plans to re-evaluate its decision to stick with the
November and December launching dates for the first of the stations
components during a series of meetings in Moscow to begin next
week. The last of the meetings should wrap up in mid-October.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Rothenberg said Monday the United States is taking
measures to safeguard it from future reliance on the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's financial problems make it increasingly unlikely the
country can keep a commitment to periodically launch unmanned
Progress cargo capsules to the new station. The Progress capsules
help re-boost the station and furnish the propellant needed by the
service module to boost.
</P>
<P>
   NASA plans to take measures to replace the need for Progress
capsules, including:
</P>
<P>
   Modifying its space shuttles so that steering thrusters on the
ships can boost the station while docked to the orbiting laboratory
as early as late in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Urging the White House for the funds needed for an American
propulsion module that could be launched to the station in early
2002.
</P>
<P>
   Launching an already developed U.S. ``interim control module''
to the new station sometime after the Russian service module
arrives. It was designed to meet propulsion requirements for at
least one year. &QL;

ULSTER ASSEMBLY STARTS, WITH DEBATES ON FLAGS AND LANGUAGES
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JAMES F. CLARITY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ The new Northern Ireland Assembly
held its first working session Monday. But instead of dealing with
how to enact the provisions of the peace settlement reached in the
spring, the Protestant and Roman Catholic members plunged into
debates about flags, party labels, the use of Gaelic and Ulster
Scots as official languages and whether it was proper to have a bar
in the basement.
</P>
<P>
   In effect the hostilities between Protestants and Catholics were
removed from the field of sectarian violence that has plagued the
province for 30 years and taken more than 3,200 lives. With all
major paramilitary groups, including the Irish Republican Army,
observing a cease-fire, the 108 Assembly members instead jumped to
traditional and predictable arguments over cultural and political
issues that have divided the province for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Absent was debate over the serious issues of how to effect the
drastic political changes envisaged in the peace accord,
principally changes that would give the minority Catholics added
power in this predominantly Protestant British province.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the
IRA, and a member of the Assembly, had said he would not sit in the
Stormont government complex because of the memories of Protestant
repression it represented for Catholics. But there he was, in a
white shirt and tie, facing political foes like the Rev. Ian
Paisley, who had vowed never to sit in a room with Adams, whom he
says is the representative of the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make friends with Dr. Paisley,'' Adams said. The
flamboyant clergyman did not reply, but neither did he perform a
dramatic walkout, as he has in the past when under fire.
</P>
<P>
   The day began with the flag-waving issue. Outside the Stormont
gates a small group of people, including children, waved signs
reading, ``Protestant Parliament for Protestant People,'' and
complained that no Union Jack was on the building.
</P>
<P>
   Adams said that the flag of the Irish Republic should be flown
along with the Union Jack and that Gaelic should be an official
language. To the consternation of some Protestant unionist
deputies, a Sinn Fein leader, Bairbre de Brun, spoke in Gaelic and
called for simultaneous translations of all Assembly speeches. A
small minority of Catholics and virtually no Protestants are fluent
in Gaelic.
</P>
<P>
   Adams, who like many other republicans studied Gaelic while in a
British prison, said that in addition to voting aye or nay, members
should be allowed to vote in Gaelic, ta or nil. Protestants
responded by saying that Ulster Scots, also rarely spoken here,
should be an official language.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is similar to the Tower of Babel,'' Ian Paisley Jr. said.
``People are going to be utterly confused.''
</P>
<P>
   Paisley's father, a fundamentalist preacher and the hardline
leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, questioned the need for a
basement bar. It would be, he said, ``a bar to heaven and a door to
hell.''
</P>
<P>
   After 90 minutes of debate the temporary Assembly speaker, Lord
Alderdice, adjourned the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Feeney, a political consultant and former Belfast City
councilman, said: ``It's depressing. It doesn't take us any further
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   John Taylor, a Protestant unionist leader whom Republican
machine gunners shot in the face in 1972, made a joke about the
illegal arms being held by the IRA. He noted that a British
shooting team had won a medal at an international competition,
adding: ``I'm glad to see Mr. Adams laughing. Those were legal
firearms.''
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon of war enemies' chuckling together over old
wounds may have begun in Northern Ireland.

 NEW YORK: Latin America. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The president also called for a global effort to help businesses
in Asia to emerge from ``crippling debt burdens,`` but Treasury
officials were unspecific about what kind of plan they had in mind,
saying they were not yet ready to attempt the kind of massive
restructuring of debt that the United States coordinated in Latin
America more than a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's speech on Monday was a long time in coming: For months
now, during visits to China and then Russia, he has discussed the
impact of the financial crisis that began in Asia 14 months ago but
offered few new, major initiatives. His aides defended the seeming
slowness of his response, saying that until the economic turmoil
spread to Russia and now to Brazil _ an economy far larger than
Russia's and more directly linked to the United States _ it would
have been difficult to develop an international consensus for
action.
</P>
<P>
   It may also be difficult to develop much domestic enthusiasm in
the midst of the most perilous political moment of Clinton's
presidency. The president's plan was an attempt to return to his
old campaign theme _ ``It's the economy, stupid,'' _ with a global
twist. Implicitly, he was making the case that while Congress was
reviewing the report about his liaison with a former White House
inter, the House of Representatives was, by refusing $18 billion in
funds to the IMF, endangering the welfare of ``our workers, our
businesses, our farmers.''
</P>
<P>
   As the economic storm has moved from Asia to Russia to Latin
America, he said, ``the clouds are closer, and you can hear the
thunder.''
</P>
<P>
   But the House majority leader, Rep. Dick Armey, immediately shot
back that ``instead of repairing his credibility, the president
today dug himself into a deeper hole'' by supporting the IMF. The
Fund, he said, is ``a destabilizing force that has helped cause the
financial crises in Asia and elsewhere.'' But the Republican head
of the House Banking Committee, Rep. Jim Leach, urged the passage
of the IMF funding and even stronger action by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a dangerous time, requiring firm, bipartisan American
leadership,'' he said. ``The honor, prosperity and security of the
United States are at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   The speech in the quiet confines of the Council on Foreign
Relations was the first major public appearance by Clinton since
the publication of the Whitewater independent counsel's explicit
recounting of the president's liaison with Monica Lewinsky, and it
was the unspoken subtext of the session.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, it was a carefully controlled event. The
invitees were members of the council, including network anchors,
Wall Street financiers, columnists and editors, and a cross-section
of foreign policy professionals. The scandal in Washington was
never far from their minds: Several members of the audience scanned
accounts of the Lewinsky affair as they waited for Clinton to
arrive. Just before he entered the room, they folded up their
papers and tucked them under their seats.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, sat beside him, and the
president periodically placed his hand on her arm as they worked
the room. Later, she accompanied him through an afternoon of
fund-raising events and an evening at the Broadway hit, ``The Lion
King.'' Clinton did not repeat last week's string of apologies for
his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, and when a network television
reporter raised questions about the possibility of striking a deal
for censure, instead of impeachment, in Congress, the reporter was
hissed down by the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the greeting he received was somewhat cool. His
speech was never interrupted by applause, though there was
sustained applause for his Treasury secretary, Robert Rubin, when
he was introduced before the speech.
</P>
<P>
   Some in Clinton's audience, which included some former officials
in his administration, said they feared his speech may have come
too late _ both because the economic turmoil has grown so fierce,
and because Clinton's own powers appear greatly diminished.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Briefing reporters after Clinton's speech, Rubin denied that the
president was trying to pressure Alan Greenspan, the chairman of
the Federal Reserve, to cut interest rates in the United States.
``The answer to that is absolutely not,'' he said, arguing that
Clinton would not interfere with the independence of the Fed.
</P>
<P>
   What Clinton may have been doing, however, was jumping on _ and
accelerating _ a train that Greenspan got rolling 10 days ago in
San Francisco. In a speech there, Greenspan signaled that the Fed
was now less worried about inflation, and increasingly worried
about the risks of economic slowdown. Clinton invoked Greenspan's
earlier speech, declaring, as Greenspan did, that the United States
cannot consider itself ``an oasis'' from global economic forces.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Clinton and Rubin have both shied away from
characterizing the current economic turmoil as the worst since the
end of World War II _ in part for fear of jarring the markets. But
in recent weeks, the damage has become so widespread that failure
to acknowledge the scope of the problem looked increasingly
strange.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton compared the American role in stabilizing the world
economy to what ``the World War II generation did'' fifty years
ago, and said that ``the United States is called upon once again to
lead.'' But at the same time, Clinton is clearly not yet prepared
to announce the equivalent of a Marshall Plan for a global economy.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's speech, for example, he made no mention of the
possibility of dipping into U.S. funds to aid countries if the
IMF's resources are depleted, or in restructuring the World Bank
and the Fund _ created in 1946 _ to meet the challenges of a very
different world economy.
</P>
<P>
   In private, however, administration officials have begun
discussing whether it would be politically feasible to once again
use an emergency fund, under the Treasury's control, that was used
to aid Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   It is a difficult calculation. Such a step would undoubtedly
raise an uproar in Congress, at a time Clinton has no political
capital left.

ARIZONA GROWTH SLOWS, BUT STATE STILL NO. 2 IN NEW JOBS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CATHERINE REAGOR  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - After several booming years, job growth is slowing as
expected in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise is that it's putting on the brakes just slightly,
and less than economists forecast it would a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona ranked No. 2, behind South Carolina and ahead of Nevada,
in the number of jobs created in June, according to the Blue Chip
Economic Forecast.
</P>
<P>
   And among large metro areas, Phoenix led the nation in creating
employment in June, posting a 5.6 percent jump in new jobs. From
June 1997 to June 1998, about 76,200 new jobs were added here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little surprising, the rate that Arizona continues to
grow,'' said Tracy Clark, senior economist of Arizona State
University's Bank One Economic Outlook Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Department of Economic Security recently reported
that the state will add 4.8 percent more payroll jobs this year
than it did last year, according to research administrator Dan
Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because the Valley's real estate industry has continued to
boom, creating more jobs, and people have continued to pour into
Arizona to fill those new positions, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevada has outpaced Arizona in new employment during the past
few years, but Arizona and Texas are the only Western states to
beat analysts' projections for new employment this year.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the West is at the other end of the spectrum,
creating jobs at an even slower rate than projected earlier this
year by the economists who put together the monthly Blue Chip
Economic Forecast. &QL;

REMEMBERING A LOVED _ AND HATED _ GOVERNOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RICK BRAGG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. _ For 65-year-old James Harper, sitting on his
tiny front porch in West Anniston with the day still brand-new, the
news that George Wallace was dead caused him to lower his eyes and
catch his breath for a second, as if some last, dying chorus of
``Dixie'' had lodged in his throat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know,'' he said. ``You here to talk about him? Sit
down. I voted for him. Every time. I liked him standing up there in
that school door, by God,'' he said, referring to Wallace's stand
in the doorway to prevent integration at the University of Alabama
on June 11, 1963.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the federals had to move him,'' said Harper, and then he
grinned. ``He was a man, by God. He wasn't no boy.''
</P>
<P>
   But when he was asked if he still respected the former governor
after a would-be-assassin's bullet crippled him in 1972, after old
age and history mellowed him and even made him say he was sorry,
Harper seemed not to hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved that man,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To many in Alabama _ the people who hated, feared or loved him _
that frail, apologetic old man who died Sunday night in Montgomery
failed to register in their memories as vividly as the young, fiery
one with slicked-back hair and rigid finger stabbing the air, the
one who promised ``segregation forever.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people said they could forgive him, and would even pray
for him, but many of them said they just wish he could have learned
he was wrong a lot sooner, and led his state out of racial hatred,
instead of into it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody can have my forgiveness if they ask the Lord to
forgive them,'' said 87-year-old John Lilley, making his way slowly
down Birmingham's 20th Street with the help of a cane.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did what he did to stay on the good side of the white
people. He did it to keep his job. But I forgive him.''
</P>
<P>
   He smiled a little when he was asked if the pain-racked,
paralyzed man had found peace in death. ``I don't know if George
Wallace is in heaven,'' said Lilley, walking away. ``The only thing
I know is he's been in hell long enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Young people, whites and blacks, know only the historical
Wallace, and spoke of him the way they would have spoken of a
Confederate statue on the courthouse lawn. But across the state,
people who are old enough to remember a time before his wheelchair
and who heard his voice before it was slurred, talk as if he was
not some distant politician in Montgomery but someone who protected
them, or threatened them. They take him personally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember being at ball games and having my parents come and
get us because they had heard the Klan was coming,'' said Ernestine
Abraham, who grew up in Birmingham in the 1960s. ``He could have
changed that. He had the power, and could have turned that tide. He
didn't,'' said Ms. Abraham, now 44 and an office manager at a
Birmingham bank.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If he had not been hurt, he never would have changed,'' she
said. And by then, it was too late, she said, because too many
people had been hurt in the era of racism that he had prospered in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man in the chair didn't matter,'' she said. ``The young
man who stood in the schoolhouse door mattered.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess,'' she said, ``he didn't have the courage to do it,
then.''
</P>
<P>
   As she talked, the first of the rush-hour traffic was beginning
to creep through downtown Birmingham, past Kelly Ingram Park where
marchers were once torn by police dogs and blown along sidewalks
like leaves by powerful fire hoses.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Wallace is very personal, here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up here when you couldn't sit here, and you couldn't
eat there, and you had to sit in the last row,'' said Rita
Kendrick, 50, who works for Alabama Power in downtown Birmingham.
``He tried to keep it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   But she believes he was sorry, that it was not just politics
when he begged for forgiveness later in his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have a big heart to forgive him,'' she said. ``I
can, but it's hard.''
</P>
<P>
   But the people who gave him his power, families who always voted
for him and who wept when he lay bleeding on the asphalt of a
Maryland shopping center, loved him then and now.
</P>
<P>
   They loved him when he was unrepentant, because he told them to
stand up and be proud. For many of the people in his power base,
the poor farmers and factory workers who had always lived beneath
the disdain of the aristocrats, his message was stronger than
moonshine.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you'd hear him talk, you knew he was for you and for
Alabama,'' said Gary Heathcock, a 46-year-old steelworker who lives
in Alexandria. ``My daddy always voted for him,'' he said, and once
the family even voted for Wallace's wife, Lurleen. It was really a
vote for George.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them had never been told that they were even good enough
for their place in Southern society, let alone better than anyone,
and now there was this man moving from town to town on the campaign
trail preaching to the crowded auditoriums and county fairs that
they were superior to a whole race of people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drove trucks for 30 years, and I worked in the pipe shop,''
said James Harper of West Anniston. ``Every time I wrote him a
letter, he wrote me back. I worshipped the ground he walked on.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not, said some of his older white supporters, that they
always agreed with him. Sometimes, said 76-year-old Ed Mullinax of
Anniston, ``I had to vote for him because he was the only one
running.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a fairly good fellow who had his faults,'' said
Mullinax, a retired millwright. ``It was a different world.''
</P>
<P>
   Blacks voted for him, as early as 1958, because they saw him as
a lesser evil. Cicero Bynum, a retired steelworker from Gadsden,
remembers meeting Wallace during the 1958 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did vote for him in 1958 because I couldn't vote for John
Patterson,'' said Bynum, 69. ``He was more evil than Wallace at
that particular time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We met with him when he was trying to drum up support. They
brought him in the back door of the building so the white folks
wouldn't see him coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace would repay them by claiming he lost because was
``out-niggered'' _ too soft on segregation _ and would vow never to
let it happen again.
</P>
<P>
   But in a way, said Bynum, Wallace's defiance served them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he hadn't made that stand in the schoolhouse door, we
wouldn't have come as far as we've come,'' he said. ``Our problems
wouldn't have been shown around the world.''
</P>

   Around the country, aging warriors in that struggle for civil
rights graciously spoke of Wallace as a changed man, as a sort of
tragic figure who was swallowed in a whirlwind of his own creation.
Historians said he was the perfect enemy, who gave the people who
believed in change someone to hate.

<P>
   If that is true, then they needed each other.

   ``All throughout history, if you have an ugly enemy, if your
enemy is cruel and monstrous or you can paint him as a monster,''
the battle over people's conscience can be won, said the Rev.

Leadership Council and one of the Rev. Martin Luther King's chief
aides in the 1960s.

<P>
   Tellabs Inc. called off its planned acquisition of Ciena Corp.
on Monday, after diminished financial prospects, scuttled sales and
a steep drop in the share prices of both companies made the deal
untenable.
</P>
<P>
   The already depressed shares of both companies hit new lows
after the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   When Tellabs announced in June that it would acquire Ciena in a
stock swap then valued at $7.3 billion, it was billed as the merger
of two rising stars in the fast-growing market for
telecommunications equipment. But Ciena, an early leader in a
technology for expanding the capacity of fiber optic networks, has
seen its star dim as larger, more diverse competitors like Lucent
Technologies Inc. have undercut its pricing to grab sales and gain
market share. Tellabs' growth has slowed as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``What really killed this deal was not the pretext of a
strategic fit, but that management and Wall Street's estimates of
Ciena's prospects were unreasonably high,'' said Greg Mesniaeff, an
analyst with Robinson Humphrey in Atlanta. ``It happened that all
the planets were misaligned.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed merger survived Ciena's loss last month of an AT&AMP;T
sale estimated at more than $100 million. But the deal unraveled
after the company last week lost a sale to Digital Teleport Inc.,
estimated to be worth about $25 million, to Pirelli S.p.A. Ciena
then had to announce that results for its third fiscal quarter,
which ended Aug. 1, would fall far below analysts' estimates and
that revenues and profit margins for the fourth quarter and next
year would also be reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Decimated by the string of negative events, Ciena shares closed
Monday at $13.19, down $2.75, a fraction of their 52-week high of
$92.37. Tellabs shares, after initially trading up on the
announcement, dropped after management disclosed in a conference
call with securities analysts that its third-quarter results would
fall below estimates. Tellabs closed at $37.69, down $7.31, down 40
percent from its 52-week high of $93.12.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tea leaves were just not right for us to proceed,''
Michael Birck, Tellabs' president and chief executive, said in the
conference call. The companies had revised the deal's share
exchange rate once to reflect Ciena's diminished growth prospects
and were not likely to find a new rate again that would satisfy
shareholders, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just looked at the revised Ciena prospects and factored in
the sentiment of the market,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Birck held out the possibility that Tellabs and Ciena might
collaborate in the future, but he noted that strategic alliances
that did not involve an equity stake were often more difficult than
mergers. He said Tellabs still regarded the technology pioneered by
Ciena _ dense wavelength division multiplexing, or DWDM _ as
strategic, but he added that its availability now from a number of
competitors had rapidly turned DWDM into something of a commodity.
</P>
<P>
   Ciena managers said they were disappointed that the deal fell
through but would proceed as an independent entity.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, our business fundamentals are strong,'' Patrick
Nettles, Ciena's president and chief executive, said in a telephone
interview. ``We've indicated we are going to be competitive on
price by reducing the expectations for profit margins going
forward.'' Though he would not rule out other mergers, he said,
``We're getting back to the business of running our business
first.''
</P>
<P>
   But analysts predicted that Ciena would have a tough time
competing as an independent company. Although most said that the
company retained a lead in technology, its competitors could not
only undercut its pricing, but could also offer a broader and
deeper array of products and services. It made sense for Ciena to
become a part of a larger company, but that will be difficult to do
now, they said, because the expectations created by the terms of
the Tellabs deal were not realistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``There might be another acquirer, but I don't think anybody
else is going to show up until the dust settles,'' said Steven
Levy, a managing director at Lehman Brothers. ``You've got a
falling star that has not stopped falling yet.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ciena reported third-quarter earnings of $2.1 million Monday, or
2 cents a share fully diluted, down from $35.7 million, or 36 cents
a share, in the comparable period a year ago. Sales rose 6 percent,
to $129.1 million, from $121.8 million in the third quarter of the
1997 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Exclusive of one-time charges associated with the settlement of
litigation with Pirelli and merger-related costs, Ciena earned
$16.1 million, or 15 cents a share, in the quarter. Prior to the
company's warning, analysts had expected Ciena to earn 32 cents a
share, according to First Call.
</P>
<P>
   Nettles said that the shortfall reflected not only the loss of
the sale to Digital Teleport but also delays of a number of smaller
sales that are now expected to close in the fourth quarter. As the
company's number of customers has grown, management's ability to
forecast sales and the timing of sales has been stressed, he said,
adding, ``We've got to learn to manage that better.''

YANG SHANGKUN, 91, LED CRACKDOWN ON CHINA'S TIANANMEN PROTESTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Yang Shangkun, a former president of China and the
military leader who orchestrated the crackdown on pro-democracy
demonstrators in 1989 on Tiananmen Square, died early Monday, the
Chinese government announced. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
   Yang was one of the last of the Old Guard of revolutionaries,
including the late Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping, who fought for
decades to create a Communist state and then ruled it into the
1990s, when a new generation led by the current Communist Party
chief and President, Jiang Zemin, took over.
</P>
<P>
   An eminent figure in the history of Communist China, Yang was
once widely seen as a potential successor to Deng as supreme
leader. But he overplayed his hand, and in 1992 Deng, who then
ruled China largely from behind the scenes, edged Yang from office.
Deng died last year.
</P>
<P>
   After his ouster Yang remained a respected party elder, with
strong ties in the military. Energetic and, up to this year, given
to making his own ``inspection'' tours of the provinces, he was
considered a thorn in the side of Jiang, with whom he had strained
relations.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang, who does not have a military background, has asserted his
own control over the military and is now engaged in the delicate
task of forcing the People's Liberation Army to give up its
extensive business operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jiang Zemin is rejoicing over this death, I would surmise,''
said David Shambaugh, an expert on Chinese politics at George
Washington University in Washington. ``This removes a big obstacle
to his control over the PLA.''
</P>
<P>
   An official obituary issued Monday called Yang ``a great
proletarian revolutionary, a statesman, a military strategist, a
staunch Marxist, an outstanding leader of the party, the state and
the people's army.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Born in 1907 to a land-owning family in the southwestern
province of Sichuan, Yang joined the Communist Party at 18 and in
1926 traveled to Moscow, where he studied at Sun Yat-sen
University.
</P>
<P>
   A military commissar in the civil war, Yang took part in the
legendary Long March of 1934-35, fleeing Chiang Kai-shek's forces.
Even before 1949, when the People's Republic was founded, and until
the mid-'60s, Yang was one of a handful of leaders who worked
closely with Mao. As head of the Central Committee General Office,
he directly oversaw most important Communist Party affairs.
</P>
<P>
   But by 1966, as the Cultural Revolution began, Yang, as with his
longtime comrade Deng, had fallen from favor with Mao. He was
branded a counterrevolutionary and, according to the obituary
issued Monday by the official New China News Agency, he spent 12
years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, Yang and Deng both regained power. In the next few
years, as Deng began to gain top authority and set the country on a
path of economic change, Yang was put in charge of shrinking and
modernizing the huge, backward army. He was given the rank of
general. In 1982 he was appointed to the party's powerful
Politburo.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Yang was given the prestigious if largely ceremonial
title of president. But his power lay in his position as vice
chairman of the central military commission.
</P>
<P>
   Many younger Chinese remember Yang from May 1989, when he
appeared on television along with Prime Minister Li Peng to
denounce what he called anarchy in Beijing, where student
demonstrators had occupied Tiananmen Square, and to defend the
imposition of martial law.
</P>
<P>
   Deng, who had decided that force had to quell the democracy
movement, called on Yang to mobilize the army and plan the
operation, which resulted in the killing of hundreds of students
and others on June 4 and subsequent days.
</P>
<P>
   Yang and his younger half brother, Yang Baibing, then purged the
army of officers who had failed to support the operations properly.
</P>
<P>
   In the years after 1989, Yang and his half brother spurred
growing suspicion and resentment among other military elders as
they packed the army's upper ranks with supporters. Many senior
leaders felt that the ``Yang family clique'' was trying to dominate
the army, if not positioning itself to rule when the ailing Deng
died, Shambaugh said. Deng decided that he had to force Yang to
give up his posts. Yang Baibing was also forced off the military
commission, although he remained at the Politburo until last year.
</P>
<P>
   As is common with Chinese leaders, little is known of Yang's
personal life. His wife, Li Bozhao, who had also been in the Long
March, died in 1985. He is believed to be survived by at least one
son.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ With the Starr report very much on the minds and lips
of her seniors at the Bronx High School of Science Monday morning,
Marilyn Reinhardt opened her fourth-period literature class by
scribbling three one-word questions on the blackboard: ``Psycho?
Devil? Victim?''
</P>
<P>
   She then asked her students whether President Clinton's behavior
with Monica Lewinsky, as well as his apparent attempts to cover it
up, was most like that of the mentally unstable Reverend Dimsdale
of ``The Scarlet Letter,'' the unrepentant killer Mersault of
Albert Camus' ``The Stranger'' or Jay Gatsby, whom she
characterized as a victim of the prevailing ethos of the Roaring
Twenties, which she defined as ``get rich quick by any means, but
then no one comes to your funeral.''
</P>
<P>
   From the back of the room, one 17-year-old girl raised her hand.
``I don't think he's any of the three,'' she said. ``He's just a
man. All men cheat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So it's biological destiny,'' Ms. Reinhardt replied, `` `Stand
by Your Man,' as Tammy Wynette said in that song.''
</P>
<P>
   If this had been any other September, Ms. Reinhardt would have
spent the third day of the school year Monday introducing her
students to Wordsworth, Keats and Jane Austen. But after reading
the report by the Whitewater independent counsel, Kenneth Starr,
over the weekend, she _ like so many other teachers across the
country _ concluded that her original lesson plan just could not
compete.
</P>
<P>
   And so, imploring their classes to cast aside any nervous
snickers, teachers at middle schools, high schools _ and even in
the older grades of some elementary schools, based on visits to
more than a dozen schools throughout the metropolitan New York
region Monday _ wove the scandal engulfing the president into their
lesson plans, often as a way to get their students to think about
larger issues like morality or impeachment that might otherwise
have put them to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   The teachers' only dilemma, it seemed, was not whether to
discuss Clinton's troubles, but in how much detail. And even then
there was surprising latitude.
</P>
<P>
   In Kitty Rooney's 12th-grade class at Bishop Loughlin Memorial
High School in Brooklyn, the words ``sex'' and ``sexual
intercourse'' flew around the room, with little giggling. Never
mind that the subject was government and the setting was a Catholic
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the Constitution class can be formulaic and dry,'' Ms.
Rooney said afterward, ``but now the students are very interested.
It's living history.''
</P>
<P>
   As the students struggled to form opinions, many found
themselves as conflicted as their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Bascio, a social studies teacher at Public School 111 in
midtown Manhattan, asked her seventh graders to write a paragraph
about whether the president should be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, because he shouldn't of cheated on his wife,'' one girl
wrote. ``No, because it is his personal business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some,'' the student concluded, ``think he should be punished
in a different way.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For any teacher who brought up currents events Monday, the
challenge was to keep the unvarnished language of the independent
counsel's report from spilling over into class and derailing any
meaningful conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Garvey, a social studies teacher at Intermediate School
195 in Harlem, navigated between the document's seamiest sections
likes a ship's captain steering clear of icebergs.
</P>
<P>
   In his seventh-grade class Monday, he described Monica Lewinsky
only as someone who ``wanted to be the president's girlfriend.'' He
said he was careful not to give his 12- and 13-year-old students
any more knowledge than they absolutely needed, because of the wide
range of their own experiences. Some have not yet reached puberty,
while one 12-year-old girl already has had a baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a sex education teacher,'' he said. ``I'm not about to
test the limits of what is allowed in the classroom.''
</P>
<P>
   In the social studies department office at Bronx Science Monday,
the talk among teachers between periods was of how far they should
go once behind the classroom door.
</P>
<P>
   Irene Blair, who teaches government and American history, said
that questions concerning the legalities of impeachment process
would be fair game in her class but that she would swat down any
questions that bumped up against ``sexual matters.'' She intended
to direct students to ``refer it to your families.''
</P>
<P>
   But as he prepared for his fifth-period American history class,
one in which he had decided to scratch his planned lecture on
post-Civil War reconstruction, Jim Uldrych said that he intended to
put no brakes on the discussion of Starr's findings among his
seniors. ``At a certain point, you gotta discuss that, too,'' he
said, speaking of some of the president's most lewd behavior. ``You
can't run from it.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, it was his students who reined in the
discussion to keep it G-rated.
</P>
<P>
   In response to Uldrych's initial question asking for general
reaction to the report, one girl in the front row scrunched her
face in disgust.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes way too far,'' she said. ``It's like a porn novel.
It's not necessary to the investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not interested in what went on,'' she added, ``and I'm
certainly not interested in what I know now.''
</P>
<P>
   The students in Eric Plak's third grade class at Public School
192 in West Harlem never raised the names Lewinsky and Clinton. But
that's not to say they were oblivious to the names of another
couple joined in the headlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're more interested in McGwire and Sammy Sosa,'' Plaks
said, invoking the hallowed names of the combatants in baseball's
record-shattering home run derby. ``They're all on Sammy's side.''
</P>
<P>
   To sate them, Plaks devised a line-up card's worth of word
problems _ all about calculating home runs _ to engage them Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In other schools, the students were eager to talk but found
their teachers were unprepared to.
</P>
<P>
   After school at Hackensack (N.J.) High School Monday afternoon,
four teachers who had gathered in the English and social studies
department office said that they were horrified to learn that their
students were better versed in the report's findings than they.
While several pledged to go home and study it, Bette Parslow would
have none of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my students I did not want to read it,'' said Ms.
Parslow, who teaches U.S. history. ``I know the gist of what it is
going to say. I'm a grownup. I know what goes on. I just don't need
to wallow in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Conflicted over what exactly to say to her students, Ms. Parslow
thought she might relate her own disillusionment with Clinton by
likening it to her father's reaction upon learning, years after
Franklin D. Roosevelt's death, that he had had an affair in and
around the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents idolized him,'' she said. ``My father didn't want
to believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, for all the talking they may have done in
schools, some children left far more confused than they had arrived
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the level of knowledge of her 10-year-old son Emil,
who is in the fifth grade at R.J. Bailey School in Greenburgh,
N.Y., Geraldine Wiles said: ``He's got Tara Lipinsky and Monica
Lewinsky's names mixed up.''

post-Civil War reconstruction, Jim Uldrych said that he intended to
put no brakes on the discussion of Starr's findings among his
seniors. ``At a certain point, you gotta discuss that, too,'' he
said, speaking of some of the president's most lewd behavior. ``You
can't run from it.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, it was his students who reined in the
discussion to keep it G-rated.
</P>
<P>
   In response to Uldrych's initial question asking for general
reaction to the report, one girl in the front row scrunched her
face in disgust.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes way too far,'' she said. ``It's like a porn novel.
It's not necessary to the investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not interested in what went on,'' she added, ``and I'm
certainly not interested in what I know now.''
</P>
<P>
   The students in Eric Plak's third grade class at Public School
192 in West Harlem never raised the names Lewinsky and Clinton. But
that's not to say they were oblivious to the names of another
couple joined in the headlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're more interested in McGwire and Sammy Sosa,'' Plaks
said, invoking the hallowed names of the combatants in baseball's
record-shattering home run derby. ``They're all on Sammy's side.''
</P>
<P>
   To sate them, Plaks devised a line-up card's worth of word
problems _ all about calculating home runs _ to engage them Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In other schools, the students were eager to talk but found
their teachers were unprepared to.
</P>
<P>
   After school at Hackensack (N.J.) High School Monday afternoon,
four teachers who had gathered in the English and social studies
department office said that they were horrified to learn that their
students were better versed in the report's findings than they.
While several pledged to go home and study it, Bette Parslow would
have none of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my students I did not want to read it,'' said Ms.
Parslow, who teaches U.S. history. ``I know the gist of what it is
going to say. I'm a grownup. I know what goes on. I just don't need
to wallow in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Conflicted over what exactly to say to her students, Ms. Parslow
thought she might relate her own disillusionment with Clinton by
likening it to her father's reaction upon learning, years after
Franklin D. Roosevelt's death, that he had had an affair in and
around the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents idolized him,'' she said. ``My father didn't want
to believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, for all the talking they may have done in
schools, some children left far more confused than they had arrived
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the level of knowledge of her 10-year-old son Emil,
who is in the fifth grade at R.J. Bailey School in Greenburgh,
N.Y., Geraldine Wiles said: ``He's got Tara Lipinsky and Monica
Lewinsky's names mixed up.''

 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The two Democratic leaders of Congress sharply
admonished the White House Monday to stop trying to make legal
justifications for President Clinton's misleading testimony about
his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. But buoyed by polls showing
the nation still reluctant to embark on impeachment, they also
called for quick decisions to resolve the nation's constitutional
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The similar statements by House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt
and Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle positioned them squarely in
synch with the perceived public mood. Their remarks were designed,
aides said, to head off any Republican efforts to have protracted
impeachment hearings lasting well into next year.
</P>
<P>
   But while Republicans pledged to move in timely fashion, they
appeared to be looking at precisely the kind of broad-reaching and
time-consuming inquiry that Democrats want to avoid. Rep. Henry
Hyde, R-Ill., the Judiciary Committee chairman and therefore the
person who oversees the impeachment process, said he would not rule
out expanding any inquiry beyond the president's affair with Ms.
Lewinsky and efforts to cover it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is certainly a possibility,'' he said, explaining that
Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth Starr could still send
Congress information on other matters he has investigated and that
``we would be duty bound to consider whatever he sends us.'' He
also did not rule out an extensive inquiry even if Starr did not
make another report, called a referral. ``It's possible,'' said
Hyde.
</P>
<P>
   The positioning in Congress came as members of the House and
Senate returned to Washington after a weekend of sampling
constituent opinion to the flood of sordid details about Clinton's
relationship with a White House intern. Sentiment varied from
district to district, with Republicans generally seeking punishment
of Clinton but Democrats saying both impeachment and resignation
are too harsh, and finding conflicting feelings from a nation that
wants Clinton rebuked but fears the trauma of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for a way to salvage the situation for the White House,
both Gephardt and Daschle _ in their first reactions since Starr's
report was made public on Friday _ warned President Clinton against
the kind of defense his lawyers put forth on weekend talk shows
when they continued to argue that he had not lied in legal
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly agree with those who have grown impatient with
hair-splitting over legal technicalities,'' Daschle said. ``There
is a basic understanding of the truthfulness that the president
failed to meet.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``The president and his advisers must accept that
continued legal jousting serves no constructive purpose. It simply
stands in the way of what we need to do: move forward and let
common sense guide us in doing what is best for the country.''

CLINTON CHOOSES TEAM OF SPIRITUAL ADVISERS 
</HEADLINE>

 By LAURIE GOODSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton has chosen two or perhaps three ministers to
serve as a team of personal spiritual advisers that will meet and
pray with him weekly, and help him resist what one of the ministers
called ``the temptations that have conquered'' the president in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   The president phoned the ministers and asked them for their help
on Labor Day evening, just as he and the nation were expecting
Special Prosecutor Kenneth Starr to release a report detailing the
president's affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the clergymen, both formidable evangelical preachers, are
the Rev. Tony Campolo, an outspoken liberal Baptist from
Pennsylvania known for his ministry to urban youth and for
controversial books advocating Christian acceptance of
homosexuality; and the Rev. Gordon MacDonald, senior pastor of the
nondenominational Christian church, Grace Chapel, in Lexington,
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   By his own account, MacDonald has faced his sin and sought
redemption. Twelve years ago, while he was president of a major
mission agency, MacDonald admitted to an extramarital affair,
resigned his position and left the ministry for almost two years.
He later wrote a book, ``Rebuilding Your Broken World,'' about his
experience.
</P>
<P>
   That book, which the president told MacDonald he has has read
twice, is one of the reasons the president selected MacDonald for
spiritual guidance, MacDonald said in a sermon to his congregation
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Since admitting to his affair with a White House intern, Clinton
has been struggling to persuade the American people that he
seriously regrets his actions and is taking steps to repent and
reform. Both ministers were defensive about the possible appearance
that Clinton had selected them as part of political damage control.
</P>
<P>
   According to Campolo, ``There are those who will say that Gordon
and I are being used and manipulated. Should this be true,it would
not be the first time that Christians have been taken in. But we
would rather be men of faith who believe that God is working in the
life of the president, than to join that army of cynics, many of
whom are religious leaders who cannot accept a plea for forgiveness
at face value.''
</P>
<P>
   Any publicity about Clinton's arrangement with the ministers is
also likely to suit the White House's need to persuade the public
that president Clinton has come to grips with the gravity of his
wrongdoing and is taking steps to repent and reform.
</P>
<P>
   Such informal ``accountability circles,'' usually held in utmost
privacy, are not uncommon among Christian evangelicals, and
particularly among leaders of large churches and organizations. Men
_ and it is most often men _ meet regularly with a small group of
peers to pray and provide support. Such a circle of three men,
named by the elders of Grace Chapel, met with MacDonald weekly
after he confessed his adulterous relationship, and eventually
helped restore him to the ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bring an understanding of what it is like to face the public
scrutiny when one has sinned,'' MacDonald said in his sermon. ``I
have gone through, and continue to go through, the breaking
process. I have known both the remarkable grace of forgiving,
restorative people and the lash of those who choose other options.
I am in a position to talk the language of repentance and what it
takes to find a deeper and more purposeful walk with God in the
midst of a personal tragedy.''

IRAN HINTS AT READINESS TO USE MILITARY FORCE AGAINST AFGHANISTAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ Iran on Monday issued its strongest threat yet
that it might use military force against Afghanistan unless the
militant Taliban movement in power there makes amends for ``past
errors'' and adopts a more conciliatory course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have so far prevented the lighting of a fire in this region
which would be hard to extinguish,'' the country's supreme leader,
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said in a statement read in stern and
solemn tones on Iranian television. ``But all should know that a
very great and wide danger is quite near.''
</P>
<P>
   Iran's army command quickly followed with a statement announcing
that its 500,000 troops were at ``full preparedness to implement
the leader's orders and to conduct any mission anywhere and under
any conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   After more than a month of tension inflamed by the killing of
nine Iranian diplomats in Afghanistan, the warnings appeared
intended to send a message that Iran's patience was wearing thin.
</P>
<P>
   Iran has built up its military forces along the Afghan border,
and has appealed in vain for international help in reining in the
Taliban's military advances.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's harsh public words were moderated somewhat by private
signals suggesting that no action is imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Resident diplomats from Britain, France, Russia and China were
summoned to Iran's Foreign Ministry on Monday to hear what one
participant described as a pledge that Iran is determined to
exhaust all diplomatic alternatives before resorting to force in
what is emerging as a showdown with the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, Iranian officials made clear Monday
their view that the crisis has assumed a new urgency with the
capture by the Taliban on Sunday of Bamiyan, the last major city
held by an opposition force Iran had provided with clandestine
military support.
</P>
<P>
   International human rights groups have said that Taliban forces
may have killed thousands of civilians, most of them Shiite
Muslims, after taking control last month of Mazar-i-Sharif.
</P>
<P>
   And though Taliban officials have pledged that civilians in
Bamiyan would not be harmed, U.N. officials said they were
``extremely concerned'' about the situation, and Iranian media
reports suggested that a wave of Taliban reprisals may have already
begun.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Iran's representative at the United Nations, Mohammad
Hadi Nejad-Hosseinian, met with Secretary-General Kofi Annan to
urge that the United Nations ``promptly and resolutely react'' to
avert what the Iranian warned could be killings on an even broader
scale.
</P>
<P>
   And in his statement Monday, Ayatollah Khamenei delivered a
fervent appeal that he addressed in particular to other Muslim
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do not let thousands of Afghanistan's disinherited people
become victims of the Taliban's mischief,'' he said. ``Do not allow
the religious war and blood-letting carried out by this ignorant,
backward and cruel group in Afghanistan to spread _ God forbid _ to
other parts of the Islamic world.''
</P>
<P>
   The Afghan Islamic Press, an independent news agency, quoted
Taliban spokesmen as saying Monday that the people of Bamiyan were
``voluntarily surrendering their weapons'' to the militia in
house-to-house searches aimed at confiscating guns.
</P>
<P>
   Iran, with its Shiite Muslim majority, has long looked askance
at the Taliban, extremist followers of a purist version of Islam's
dominant Sunni faith. Neither group regards the other as true
Muslims, and that suspicion has long spilled over into rivalry,
with Iran an important backer of the Taliban's opponents.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But it has only been in the last month, with the deaths of the
Iranian diplomats and with Taliban gains that have put the movement
in control of nearly all of Afghanistan, that Iran's opposition has
hardened into a military buildup and explicit threats.
</P>
<P>
   Some 70,000 Iranian Revolutionary Guards have been deployed near
the Afghan border since they carried out military exercises that
ended last week, and an additional 200,000 army troops are to take
part in a second round of war games in the border area later this
month.
</P>
<P>
   After more than a month of saying that they had no information
about 11 Iranian diplomats missing in Afghanistan, Taliban
officials admitted last week that ``either intentionally or
unintentionally'' Taliban forces had killed at least nine of the
diplomats when the Iranian consulate in Mazar-i-Sharif was overrun.
</P>
<P>
   Iranian officials have said that a crisis with Afghanistan could
be averted, but only if the Taliban responded favorably to a series
of Iranian demands.
</P>
<P>
   Some progress apparently was made Monday on one of the demands,
that the bodies of the dead diplomats be returned. Iranian
officials and representatives of the International Committee for
the Red Cross were permitted by the Taliban to land in
Mazar-i-Sharif on Monday, and Iranian television said they carried
the bodies of at least seven Iranian diplomats back to Teheran
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The television report said that Taliban officials had presented
the delegation with nine bodies, the number they claimed to have
recovered last week, but that only seven of them had been
identified as Iranian.
</P>
<P>
   In other areas, however, the two sides appear perilously far
apart. The Taliban leader, Mullah Mohammed Omar, has been quoted by
the Afghan press as saying that he was not sorry that the diplomats
had been killed, rebuffing Iranian demands for an apology. Taliban
officials have refused an Iranian demand that those who killed the
diplomats be surrendered to Iran for trial here.
</P>
<P>
   They have said that as many as 45 Iranians now in Taliban
custody would not be returned outright, as Iran has demanded, but
only as part of an prisoner exchange with Iranian-backed militia
groups.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks Monday, Ayatollah Khamenei said that a wider
regional conflict could be prevented only ``by obliging the leaders
of the Taliban group to submit to logic, to abandon actions which
lead to a catastrophe and to make up for their past errors.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also upped the ante by calling for an end to Pakistani
military intervention in Afghanistan on behalf of the Taliban, a
role that Pakistan has steadfastly denied. Ayatollah Khamenei
warned that Iranians who have spent the last three days mourning
the deaths of the diplomats were ``impatiently waiting for
decisions by state officials with a heart full of pain and anger.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Patrizio Bertelli, the chairman of Prada, stood on
Fifth Avenue before the smooth stone facade of his new store. His
face was alight with the idea that the company he and his wife, the
designer Miuccia Prada, had steered into the loftiest realms of
fashion is reaching downward to one of the most populist venues _
Fifth Avenue _ where the dreams of a diamond Tiffany engagement
ring and the reality of a Bugs Bunny T-shirt meet.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing could be more emblematic of Prada's grab for broad
acceptance than the opening of its large, four-level store on
Saturday at 724 Fifth Avenue (56th Street). ``When you're on
Madison Avenue you're in Manhattan; when you're on Fifth Avenue,
you're in America,'' Bertelli said. ``It's a special feeling. It's
a step in our history. It will help establish the brand more in the
American market.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan Bertelli and Ms. Prada have in mind is to reach a wider
audience than Prada is used to, while maintaining the brand's
considerable cachet. They seek to interest hoi polloi in a look
that has been the uniform of a strict, private club whose members
dress in expensive stark, black uniforms and whose insignia is a
discreet black and silver triangular badge adorning futuristic
nylon bags.
</P>
<P>
   It will not be an easy task. Expanding downward in fashion is
not unusual, and several companies like Calvin Klein, Giorgio
Armani and Ralph Lauren have done so successfully. But others _ the
Gucci of 10 years ago, Halston and Pierre Cardin _ have failed.
Cardin's fall 1998 men's show in Paris in July was an embarrassing
parade of accessory and clothing trinkets from a man who was once
an undisputed innovator.
</P>
<P>
   Bertelli and Ms. Prada think the time is right to push Prada
beyond cult status, because of strong sales, which are projected to
grow from $850 million worldwide this year to $950 million in 1999,
Bertelli said. The company is privately held, and last year,
profits reached approximately $100 million, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The new Fifth Avenue store, which has 16,000 square feet, is
only part of a broad expansion in the United States that includes a
smaller Prada Sport store at 116 Wooster St. in SoHo, Prada's
fourth in Manhattan; it is scheduled to open at the end of this
month. In July, the company opened a men's store on Rodeo Drive in
Beverly Hills, and there are plans for stores in the new Bellagio
casino-hotel in Las Vegas for October, and in Chicago for January
1999. The company's United States flagship, opened last year at 841
Madison Ave. (70th Street), is still the largest of its 98 stores
worldwide, with 18,000 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   To make Prada as accessible as Ralph Lauren, for instance,
Bertelli and Ms. Prada will put most of their emphasis on their
less expensive collections _ Prada Sport and Miu Miu, a youthful
line bearing Ms. Prada's nickname. Clothes in both collections cost
45 percent to 50 percent less than those of the top collection. Miu
Miu men's wear is to be introduced on the runway in February for
fall 1999, Bertelli said.
</P>
<P>
   Prada Sport is being positioned as a stand-alone collection. The
SoHo store, the first to sell Prada Sport exclusively, will appeal
on the basis of lower prices and a lower fashion bar than Ms. Prada
requires customers to hurl themselves over when buying her top
line. Easy-fitting anoraks, lightweight wind pants, simple tops in
colorful sports-inspired fabrics are meant to be accessible and
versatile.
</P>
<P>
   Some retail analysts questioned Prada's latest strategy. ``It's
easy volume to add these secondary lines and tertiary labels, but
let's not forget Gucci in the '80s,'' said Isaac Lagnado, president
of Tactical Retail Solutions, a market research company. ``When
your secretary starts wearing a derivative label of yours if you're
an executive at Morgan Stanley, do you really want that? Ralph can
get away with it, but I'm not sure it has been without cost.''
</P>
<P>
   And he added: ``It might be a touch late for them to be
expanding in the U.S. market. They have focused on international
expansion and they are very exposed in the Far East.''
</P>
<P>
   Bertelli revealed that Prada has suffered losses of up to 33
percent in some parts of Asia, but these have been offset by gains
in the Japanese market, as the Japanese travel less and buy more at
home.
</P>
<P>
   In Bertelli's and Ms. Prada's eyes, some of the risk inherent in
trying to appeal to a broader swath of customers can be nullified
by focusing on youth. ``A wider group of people, and even more
young people, are increasingly understanding design in clothing,''
Ms. Prada said.
</P>
<P>
   Young people today, Bertelli added, have a very different
attitude to dressing than they did in the '80s. ``It's not
necessary to wear sports things for a sports use,'' he said. The
Sport line, said Bertelli, who is entering a yacht in the America's
Cup competition, is not simply an active-wear line. ``It may become
a very popular or mass product, though that's not what it started
out as,'' he continued. ``It was for our customers to wear in their
leisure time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not elitist,'' he added, speaking of himself and his
wife. ``We like sophisticated things in fashion and in art, but
that's why we like young people, because they are the ones that
bring up new ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   As it expands, the company intends to keep tight control over
distribution of its clothes, which means owning nearly all of its
stores. Although franchising was popular with designer companies
seeking to expand in the late '70s and '80s, it fell from favor as
the designer business began to shrink, hot designers demanded
higher licensing fees and old names became less desirable. ``It's
so beautiful in the beginning,'' Bertelli said of the relationship
between franchiser and franchisee. ``Then it becomes a source of
conflict. All the major brands _ Armani, Versace, Gucci _ had to
buy back their franchised stores.''
</P>
<P>
   Bertelli's determination to keep a viselike grip on distribution
led to Prada's recent unceremonious exit from Bergdorf Goodman.
``It's their attitude that I didn't like,'' the Prada chairman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bergdorf executives would not comment on the situation directly.
They issued a statement pointing to the many boutiques like Chanel
and Gucci that exist a stone's throw from the store, yet enjoy good
business in Bergdorf's.

</P>
<P>
   Selling its clothes and accessories in its own stores does allow
Prada to keep control of the message of understated luxury that it
seeks to telegraph to the customer. An in-house team of architects
and designers in Italy worked on the new store, which features
interior walls of pistachio green, a Prada signature, and huge
plate glass walls looking onto Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, cashmere sweaters and clean leather bags are displayed
gallery-like on glass shelves and in rectangular cubbies. The store
carries Prada women's and men's lines, accessories and Prada Sport.
</P>
<P>
   No one familiar with the trajectory that has rocketed Prada to
the forefront of fashion would have thought that expansion into the
mass market would be its ultimate fate. Prada fashion has
communicated membership in a cool, secretly knowing and affluent
society, however pretentious that may sound. Since reviving the
family leather-accessories business with her nylon backpack in the
late '80s, Ms. Prada has denoted a new, tacit badge of success in a
world used to the showiness of Chanel. And just when that idea was
settling in in the early '90s, she proposed an equally startling
concept _ trailer-trash prints as high fashion, which challenged
good taste.
</P>
<P>
   In many regards, her brand has more in common with respected
labels of limited appeal like Comme des Garcons, Jean Colonna and
Issey Miyake than with more commercial lines like Armani, Gucci and
Chanel. But in her black nylon backpack, Ms. Prada found the edge
that could cut through to every level of consumer. In a sense,
Prada's real challenge now is to find the sequel to black nylon,
which has acquired the stature of a commodity.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 percent of Prada's business is done in black nylon
clothes and accessories, Bertelli said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Prada said: ``Black nylon became a basic, so diffused in
real life that we do not distinguish ours from the rest anymore. It
was a moment in my work. I think that it is helpful because it
taught me something important: Good design in fashion has to be
real, influencing the real way of dressing.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost half of Prada's sales come from accessories, 16 percent
from shoes, and the remainder, about 27 percent, from
ready-to-wear, Bertelli said. The women's business is almost double
that of the men's.
</P>
<P>
   Prada is a third-generation company, but the seeds of its
present form were planted in 1978 when Ms. Prada, who was once a
member of the Italian Communist Party, met Bertelli as a client at
one of his factories. They married in 1987 and went into business
together with Prada and its subsidiary, IPI _ I Pellettieri
d'Italia.
</P>
<P>
   The same factories still make Prada bags, but now both the
factories and the product are owned by the couple.
</P>
<P>
   Expanding beyond Prada itself, Bertelli shook the fashion world
earlier this year by acquiring 9.5 percent of the stock of an
archrival, Gucci.
</P>
<P>
   The current Asian crisis and Gucci's subsequent stock slide
would seem to give him cause to question his move, but Bertelli
remains cool on the surface. ``I have no particular feeling about
it,'' he said. ``The drop in stock is no big deal. It's not
necessarily a total picture of the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Although speculation about his motives was furious at the time
of the stock purchases, he has not moved since then to increase his
holdings. In an interview last week, he said, ``Because it's a
publicly traded company, whatever we think or say may have an
effect on its market performance.'' At the very least, the move may
go down as a brilliant strategy to rock the psychic calm of a major
competitor.
</P>
<P>
   But with their current Prada expansion, Bertelli and Ms. Prada
have other concerns closer to home to worry about as they attempt
the high-wire act of staying aloft even as they swoop down to
capture the attention of a wider fashion audience.

 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ President Clinton declared on Monday that the
economic turmoil on three continents constitutes ``the biggest
financial challenge facing the world in a half-century.'' Without
once discussing the calls for his censure or impeachment, he laid
out for the first time a strategy to quell the trouble before it
hits American shores.
</P>
<P>
   In a half-hour address to a friendly, carefully selected
audience at the Council on Foreign Relations in Manhattan, Clinton
said that the economic turmoil, if allowed to fester, would pose a
threat to American security and ``put our own prosperity at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's biggest initiative _ though one he couched carefully
to avoid appearing to interfere in interest rate policy _ was a
call for the world's leading economies to abandon their fear of
inflation and instead ``spur growth.'' He also urged the World Bank
to double its aid in Asia, where millions of people are suddenly
unemployed or sinking back into poverty, and he called for a
meeting of finance ministers from the world's largest economies and
from the hard-hit emerging markets ``within 30 days'' to develop
broader strategies.
</P>
<P>
   ``For most of the last 30 years, the United States and the rest
of the world has been preoccupied by inflation,'' he said. ``But
clearly the balance of risks has now shifted.''
</P>
<P>
   In a move coordinated by the Treasury Department over the
weekend to come within minutes of Clinton's speech, the finance
ministers and central bank governors of the world's seven largest
economies issued a parallel statment that was clearly intended to
open the door to coordinated interest-rate cuts _ a step that, if
skillfully executed, could help spur economic activity around the
globe. It was the first time that the Group Of Seven had vowed to
make a coordinated effort to reign in the economic disorder that
officials clearly fear is spinning out of control.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a general truth,'' one senior administration official
said after Clinton spoke, `that the magnitude of the
deterioration'' in recent week has been ``much greater than anyone
anticipated.''
</P>
<P>
   The finance ministers also endorsed another initiative announced
by Clinton: Support for the use of an emergency fund within the
IMF, now down to its last $15 billion, to combat the latest
economic turmoil in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The president also called for a global effort to help businesses
in Asia to emerge from ``crippling debt burdens,`` but Treasury
officials were unspecific about what kind of plan they had in mind,
saying they were not yet ready to attempt the kind of massive
restructuring of debt that the United States coordinated in Latin
America more than a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's speech on Monday was a long time in coming: For months
now, during visits to China and then Russia, he has discussed the
impact of the financial crisis that began in Asia 14 months ago but
offered few new, major initiatives. His aides defended the seeming
slowness of his response, saying that until the economic turmoil
spread to Russia and now to Brazil _ an economy far larger than
Russia's and more directly linked to the United States _ it would
have been difficult to develop an international consensus for
action.
</P>
<P>
   It may also be difficult to develop much domestic enthusiasm in
the midst of the most perilous political moment of Clinton's
presidency. The president's plan was an attempt to return to his
old campaign theme _ ``It's the economy, stupid,'' _ with a global
twist. Implicitly, he was making the case that while Congress was
reviewing the report about his liaison with a former White House
inter, the House of Representatives was, by refusing $18 billion in
funds to the IMF, endangering the welfare of ``our workers, our
businesses, our farmers.''
</P>
<P>
   As the economic storm has moved from Asia to Russia to Latin
America, he said, ``the clouds are closer, and you can hear the
thunder.''
</P>
<P>
   But the House majority leader, Rep. Dick Armey, immediately shot
back that ``instead of repairing his credibility, the president
today dug himself into a deeper hole'' by supporting the IMF. The
Fund, he said, is ``a destabilizing force that has helped cause the
financial crises in Asia and elsewhere.'' But the Republican head
of the House Banking Committee, Rep. Jim Leach, urged the passage
of the IMF funding and even stronger action by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a dangerous time, requiring firm, bipartisan American
leadership,'' he said. ``The honor, prosperity and security of the
United States are at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   The speech in the quiet confines of the Council on Foreign
Relations was the first major public appearance by Clinton since
the publication of the Whitewater independent counsel's explicit
recounting of the president's liaison with Monica Lewinsky, and it
was the unspoken subtext of the session.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, it was a carefully controlled event. The
invitees were members of the council, including network anchors,
Wall Street financiers, columnists and editors, and a cross-section
of foreign policy professionals. The scandal in Washington was
never far from their minds: Several members of the audience scanned
accounts of the Lewinsky affair as they waited for Clinton to
arrive. Just before he entered the room, they folded up their
papers and tucked them under their seats.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, sat beside him, and the
president periodically placed his hand on her arm as they worked
the room. Later, she accompanied him through an afternoon of
fund-raising events and an evening at the Broadway hit, ``The Lion
King.'' Clinton did not repeat last week's string of apologies for
his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, and when a network television
reporter raised questions about the possibility of striking a deal
for censure, instead of impeachment, in Congress, the reporter was
hissed down by the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the greeting he received was somewhat cool. His
speech was never interrupted by applause, though there was
sustained applause for his Treasury secretary, Robert Rubin, when
he was introduced before the speech.
</P>
<P>
   Some in Clinton's audience, which included some former officials
in his administration, said they feared his speech may have come
too late _ both because the economic turmoil has grown so fierce,
and because Clinton's own powers appear greatly diminished.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Briefing reporters after Clinton's speech, Rubin denied that the
president was trying to pressure Alan Greenspan, the chairman of
the Federal Reserve, to cut interest rates in the United States.
``The answer to that is absolutely not,'' he said, arguing that
Clinton would not interfere with the independence of the Fed.
</P>
<P>
   What Clinton may have been doing, however, was jumping on _ and
accelerating _ a train that Greenspan got rolling 10 days ago in
San Francisco. In a speech there, Greenspan signaled that the Fed
was now less worried about inflation, and increasingly worried
about the risks of economic slowdown. Clinton invoked Greenspan's
earlier speech, declaring, as Greenspan did, that the United States
cannot consider itself ``an oasis'' from global economic forces.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Clinton and Rubin have both shied away from
characterizing the current economic turmoil as the worst since the
end of World War II _ in part for fear of jarring the markets. But
in recent weeks, the damage has become so widespread that failure
to acknowledge the scope of the problem looked increasingly
strange.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton compared the American role in stabilizing the world
economy to what ``the World War II generation did'' fifty years
ago, and said that ``the United States is called upon once again to
lead.'' But at the same time, Clinton is clearly not yet prepared
to announce the equivalent of a Marshall Plan for a global economy.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's speech, for example, he made no mention of the
possibility of dipping into U.S. funds to aid countries if the
IMF's resources are depleted, or in restructuring the World Bank
and the Fund _ created in 1946 _ to meet the challenges of a very
different world economy.
</P>
<P>
   In private, however, administration officials have begun
discussing whether it would be politically feasible to once again
use an emergency fund, under the Treasury's control, that was used
to aid Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   It is a difficult calculation. Such a step would undoubtedly
raise an uproar in Congress, at a time Clinton has no political
capital left.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ With the Starr report very much on the minds and lips
of her seniors at the Bronx High School of Science Monday morning,
Marilyn Reinhardt opened her fourth-period literature class by
scribbling three one-word questions on the blackboard: ``Psycho?
Devil? Victim?''
</P>
<P>
   She then asked her students whether President Clinton's behavior
with Monica Lewinsky, as well as his apparent attempts to cover it
up, was most like that of the mentally unstable Reverend Dimsdale
of ``The Scarlet Letter,'' the unrepentant killer Mersault of
Albert Camus' ``The Stranger'' or Jay Gatsby, whom she
characterized as a victim of the prevailing ethos of the Roaring
Twenties, which she defined as ``get rich quick by any means, but
then no one comes to your funeral.''
</P>
<P>
   From the back of the room, one 17-year-old girl raised her hand.
``I don't think he's any of the three,'' she said. ``He's just a
man. All men cheat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So it's biological destiny,'' Ms. Reinhardt replied, `` `Stand
by Your Man,' as Tammy Wynette said in that song.''
</P>
<P>
   If this had been any other September, Ms. Reinhardt would have
spent the third day of the school year Monday introducing her
students to Wordsworth, Keats and Jane Austen. But after reading
the report by the Whitewater independent counsel, Kenneth Starr,
over the weekend, she _ like so many other teachers across the
country _ concluded that her original lesson plan just could not
compete.
</P>
<P>
   And so, imploring their classes to cast aside any nervous
snickers, teachers at middle schools, high schools _ and even in
the older grades of some elementary schools, based on visits to
more than a dozen schools throughout the metropolitan New York
region Monday _ wove the scandal engulfing the president into their
lesson plans, often as a way to get their students to think about
larger issues like morality or impeachment that might otherwise
have put them to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   The teachers' only dilemma, it seemed, was not whether to
discuss Clinton's troubles, but in how much detail. And even then
there was surprising latitude.
</P>
<P>
   In Kitty Rooney's 12th-grade class at Bishop Loughlin Memorial
High School in Brooklyn, the words ``sex'' and ``sexual
intercourse'' flew around the room, with little giggling. Never
mind that the subject was government and the setting was a Catholic
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the Constitution class can be formulaic and dry,'' Ms.
Rooney said afterward, ``but now the students are very interested.
It's living history.''
</P>
<P>
   As the students struggled to form opinions, many found
themselves as conflicted as their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Bascio, a social studies teacher at Public School 111 in
midtown Manhattan, asked her seventh graders to write a paragraph
about whether the president should be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, because he shouldn't of cheated on his wife,'' one girl
wrote. ``No, because it is his personal business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some,'' the student concluded, ``think he should be punished
in a different way.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For any teacher who brought up currents events Monday, the
challenge was to keep the unvarnished language of the independent
counsel's report from spilling over into class and derailing any
meaningful conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Garvey, a social studies teacher at Intermediate School
195 in Harlem, navigated between the document's seamiest sections
likes a ship's captain steering clear of icebergs.
</P>
<P>
   In his seventh-grade class Monday, he described Monica Lewinsky
only as someone who ``wanted to be the president's girlfriend.'' He
said he was careful not to give his 12- and 13-year-old students
any more knowledge than they absolutely needed, because of the wide
range of their own experiences. Some have not yet reached puberty,
while one 12-year-old girl already has had a baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a sex education teacher,'' he said. ``I'm not about to
test the limits of what is allowed in the classroom.''
</P>
<P>
   In the social studies department office at Bronx Science Monday,
the talk among teachers between periods was of how far they should
go once behind the classroom door.
</P>
<P>
   Irene Blair, who teaches government and American history, said
that questions concerning the legalities of impeachment process
would be fair game in her class but that she would swat down any
questions that bumped up against ``sexual matters.'' She intended
to direct students to ``refer it to your families.''
</P>
<P>
   But as he prepared for his fifth-period American history class,
one in which he had decided to scratch his planned lecture on
post-Civil War reconstruction, Jim Uldrych said that he intended to
put no brakes on the discussion of Starr's findings among his
seniors. ``At a certain point, you gotta discuss that, too,'' he
said, speaking of some of the president's most lewd behavior. ``You
can't run from it.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, it was his students who reined in the
discussion to keep it G-rated.
</P>
<P>
   In response to Uldrych's initial question asking for general
reaction to the report, one girl in the front row scrunched her
face in disgust.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes way too far,'' she said. ``It's like a porn novel.
It's not necessary to the investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not interested in what went on,'' she added, ``and I'm
certainly not interested in what I know now.''
</P>
<P>
   The students in Eric Plak's third grade class at Public School
192 in West Harlem never raised the names Lewinsky and Clinton. But
that's not to say they were oblivious to the names of another
couple joined in the headlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're more interested in McGwire and Sammy Sosa,'' Plaks
said, invoking the hallowed names of the combatants in baseball's
record-shattering home run derby. ``They're all on Sammy's side.''
</P>
<P>
   To sate them, Plaks devised a line-up card's worth of word
problems _ all about calculating home runs _ to engage them Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In other schools, the students were eager to talk but found
their teachers were unprepared to.
</P>
<P>
   After school at Hackensack (N.J.) High School Monday afternoon,
four teachers who had gathered in the English and social studies
department office said that they were horrified to learn that their
students were better versed in the report's findings than they.
While several pledged to go home and study it, Bette Parslow would
have none of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my students I did not want to read it,'' said Ms.
Parslow, who teaches U.S. history. ``I know the gist of what it is
going to say. I'm a grownup. I know what goes on. I just don't need
to wallow in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Conflicted over what exactly to say to her students, Ms. Parslow
thought she might relate her own disillusionment with Clinton by
likening it to her father's reaction upon learning, years after
Franklin D. Roosevelt's death, that he had had an affair in and
around the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents idolized him,'' she said. ``My father didn't want
to believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, for all the talking they may have done in
schools, some children left far more confused than they had arrived
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the level of knowledge of her 10-year-old son Emil,
who is in the fifth grade at R.J. Bailey School in Greenburgh,
N.Y., Geraldine Wiles said: ``He's got Tara Lipinsky and Monica
Lewinsky's names mixed up.''

INDONESIAN DEMONSTRATORS OPPOSE MILITARY'S ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Pressing the government to take important
powers away from the military, nearly 200 students staged a sit-in
at one of the Indonesian capital's busiest thoroughfares.
</P>
<P>
   In their second week of demonstrations, the protesters called
for an end to the armed forces' role in the nation's political
affairs. The issue has galvanized students from around the country.
</P>
<P>
   In a scene that would have been unimaginable several months ago,
heavily armed soldiers stood by and listened as a group of
university students lashed out at a tenet held sacred by the
military: its dual function, which gives the military legal powers
to take part in politics as well as in defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The involvement of the military in civilian matters has done
nothing but cause damage to the people and is in conflict with
democracy,'' the student group said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The Indonesian military has come under increasing scrutiny since
the resignation in May of former President Suharto, whose absolute
control over the armed forces helped him to maintain power for 32
years.
</P>
<P>
   Emerging evidence of the military's kidnapping and torture of
political dissidents during the Suharto years has outraged the
public. Human rights groups have called for investigations into the
atrocities that they believe claimed thousands of lives.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International announced Monday that it had been invited
last week to meet with the Indonesian government and military in a
gesture not seen in five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We actually do believe that there is an openness here that has
never been here before,'' Kerry Brogan, of Amnesty International,
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   President B.J. Habibie has vowed to review the role of the
military and to investigate the rights abuses alleged to have taken
place under his predecessor and longtime associate, Suharto.

   NEW YORK _
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Martin Margiela for Men &LR;
</P>
<P>
   For men who have hungered after the deconstructed trousers and
expert tailoring of Martin Margiela, the designer is about to
introduce a men's-wear line. It will be in stores like Barneys New
York in Manhattan and Los Angeles; Ron Herman, Fred Segal and
Maxfield's, all in Los Angeles, and Blake in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   He will present the line, called 10, side by side with his
women's wear on Oct. 15 during the women's collections in Paris,
said Catherine Jiacomiai, a Margiela spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Unisex clothes have been a hallmark of Margiela's past work. The
emphasis was on pieces like T-shirts, coats and trousers that were
the same design but sized differently. ``This is really a complete
wardrobe,'' Ms. Jiacomiai said.
</P>
<P>
   The new line will be designed from scratch for men and is likely
to attract those men who wear Margiela's unisex clothes, as well as
new customers. It is consistent with the new attitude in men's wear
of sharp but soft lines promoted by designers like Raf Simons and
Alessandro Dell'Acqua, said Vincent Ehly, a men's-wear buyer for
Barneys.
</P>
<P>
   Margiela's line, a large part of which is prewashed or creased
clothing, will cost about $360 for wool trousers, $120 for cotton
shirts and $185 for roomy chinos.
</P>
<P>
   As directional as Margiela's designs are, the men's line is
expected to appeal also to those in search of classic clothes.
``The women's collection is a major part of the women's store at
Barneys,'' Ehly said. ``So many women wear his tops and skirts like
basics.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Randolph Duke at Emmys &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The little problem of not having a business did not stand in the
way of Randolph Duke's creating clothing for the Emmy Awards show
on Sunday. Duke was in Los Angeles Monday, basking in the glow
reflected from three actresses who wore his dresses: Jane Leeves of
``Frasier,'' in an antique-green gown with paillettes and a boa;
Kim Delaney of ``N.Y.P.D. Blue,'' in a red matte jersey gown with
see-through insets, and Angelina Jolie of the movies ``Gia'' and
``George Wallace,'' in a nude-tone double-slip dress.
</P>
<P>
   Duke said that he did not accept a design fee for the dresses
and that he paid out of his own pocket to have them made. He
declined to say how much the custom-made gowns cost. The actresses
will not be receiving a bill, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided it was very important for me to keep up the
relationship with Hollywood, which has been very supportive,'' said
Duke, who, as the creative director of Halston until this summer,
dressed several stars, most famously Minnie Driver for this year's
Oscars ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of great relationships,'' said Duke, who is
looking for backing and talking with prospective employers. ``We
had calls from a lot of stars and stylists, and we called them,
too. I'm going forward. I have to.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Banana Republic Catalog  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The beauty of Banana Republic is that it is fashion made simple.
But apparently not so simple that some fashion-challenged customers
don't need to have their hands held.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the company introduced a team of style consultants to
work with customers of its new catalog. Reachable by telephone at
(888) 906-2800, the consultants advise on everything from fit to
accessorizing outfits. ``There are people who do call for
figure-type information, body types and fit,'' said Sarah
Gallagher, the company's senior vice president of catalogs. ``And
some like the fashion element.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the first Banana Republic catalog since 1992, toward the
end of its illustrious safari days, when it sold clothing suited to
living it up in, well, a banana republic. Along with the style
consultants have come other luxury services, like alterations and
the ability to return items to Banana Republic stores.

   NEW YORK _ It may have started with Voyage, or possibly Narciso
Rodriguez, this tendency to decorate a basic sweater, but by now it
has taken hold at many price levels. The latest versions, which
bear little relation to your mother's heavily beaded sweater from
the '50s, have a tracing of beads around the neck or a delicate
spattering down the front, so they can go out by day or night.
</P>
<P>
   Beaded sleeveless pullovers by Rodriguez are $650 at Barneys New
York, which also has Rebecca Taylor's pullover ($165), tank ($135)
and cardigan ($175), and Urchin's camisole ($110) and cardigan
($150), all with beading at the neck.
</P>
<P>
   Henri Bendel has bead-edged cardigans ($218 and $318) and a
bead-spattered cardigan ($358) with a matching camisole ($158), all
by Luna B, and a short-sleeved bead-dotted cardigan ($168) and
matching tube ($88) by William B.
</P>
<P>
   Chloe's bead-trimmed camisole ($220) and cardigan ($340) and
Rebecca Moses' sleeveless pullover with tracings of beadwork down
the front ($880) are all at Bergdorf Goodman.

GET READY, CONSUMERS: HERE COME THOSE ANNUAL AD BLITZES 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The week after Labor Day always brings a torrent of
advertising intended to stimulate consumers to step up their
shopping during the important fourth quarter. True to form, several
big advertisers in categories from retailing to media to packaged
goods are beginning multimillion-dollar marketing blitzes.
</P>
<P>
   Banana Republic, the upscale retail chain owned by Gap Inc., is
undertaking what it calls its first television campaign ever. The
commercials, which will appear in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York
and San Francisco, promote new suede merchandise and a 98-page fall
catalog of apparel and home furnishings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Television as a medium is a very powerful way to evoke how
people feel about the Banana brand,'' Amy Schoening, vice president
for marketing at Banana Republic in San Francisco, said in a
telephone interview Monday. ``This felt like the right time to go
out and do it big.''
</P>
<P>
   It is no coincidence that the campaign, created in-house, comes
after Gap Inc. spent heavily on splashy television commercials for
its two other chains, Gap and Old Navy. Sales at both have
increased since those spots began running.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being in the same company, it's hard for that not to be
contagious,'' Ms. Schoening said.
</P>
<P>
   Banana Republic's five eclectic, fast-paced commercials all
feature soundtracks with Nina Simone warbling a jazzy version of
``Feeling Good.''
</P>
<P>
   Interspersed with shots of stylish consumers cavorting in suede
outfits are unconventional images that range from a map of the
Ponderosa as seen in the opening credits of the old television
series ``Bonanza'' to a black-and-white clip of a saxophone player
to glimpses of the Manhattan skyline.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying to say is there's a sensuality and yet
there's fun,'' Ms. Schoening said. ``We don't take ourselves too
seriously, which fashion can tend to do.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the commercials and the catalog, there will be
print advertisements in national magazines, billboards and posters.
Ms. Schoening declined to specify spending other than to say that
the budget would be 350 percent more than what was spent last fall;
according to the Competitive Media Reporting unit of VNU N.V.,
Banana Republic spent $2.6 million from September through December
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to another campaign, the Discover Card is changing ads
for the first time in two and a half years as DDB Needham Chicago,
a unit of Omnicom Group, introduces a comprehensive campaign
carrying the theme ``Discover the feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, which starts with television commercials on
Thursday night, is meant to imbue the credit card with a warmer,
more emotional image than had been imparted in recent ads centered
on such celebrities as John Lithgow, Trisha Yearwood and Gregory
Hines.
</P>
<P>
   ``People do like to buy things,'' said Lisa Lampert, senior vice
president for marketing at the Discover Card unit of Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter &AMP; Co. in Riverwoods, Ill. ``The goal is to capture the
positive feeling about making special purchases.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lampert discussed the company's plans in an interview after
a news conference Monday morning in midtown Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The category is obviously very cluttered and competitive,''
she said, alluding to Discover Card rivals like American Express,
Mastercard and Visa, which have all intensified their marketing
efforts. ``This cuts through the sea of confusion to provide
logical and emotional reasons for using Discover.''
</P>
<P>
   Each spot depicts an average consumer making a typical purchase
with a Discover Card, which transforms the transaction into an
extraordinary event.
</P>
<P>
   In one spot, there is a star-spangled parade at an FAO Schwarz
toy store; in another, a clerk turns into an angel.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign also includes magazine and Internet ads,
billboards, radio commercials and unusual vehicles like ads on gas
pump handles. Promotional tie-ins include agreements with the
Universal Studios unit of the Seagram Co., the Anheuser-Busch
Adventure Parks and the Times Square 2000 organization coordinating
the celebration of New Year's Eve on Dec. 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Spending will be increased from last year, Ms. Lampert said, but
she declined to discuss details. Discover Card spent $77.4 million
on advertising in 1997, according to Competitive Media Reporting.
</P>
<P>
   A third big campaign in the works is for the ABC television
network, which is owned by the Walt Disney Co. A series of
promotional commercials that will feature stars of ABC series will
be presented at a news conference Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The commercials will start appearing next week as the network
introduces its 1998-99 prime-time schedule. The spots offer photo
montages of such ABC personalities as Tim Allen, Drew Carey, Jenna
Elfman, Michael J. Fox and Dylan McDermott.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, the commercials are not being created by the TBWA
Chiat/Day unit of Omnicom in Playa del Rey, Calif., which is
responsible for the familiar promotional campaigns for ABC that are
centered on the color yellow and carry such fanciful themes as ``TV
is good'' and ``We love TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather, they are being created by Pittard Sullivan in Culver
City, Calif., which specializes in media and entertainment brand
campaigns, credits for television series and promotional spots for
networks including CBS and the Nickelodeon unit of Viacom Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Sewell, a spokeswoman for ABC in New York, confirmed a
report about the Pittard Sullivan campaign that appeared in The
Daily News. The star-oriented spots are meant to complement the
TBWA Chiat/Day campaign, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Two other big campaigns began on Sunday during the NBC broadcast
of the 50th annual Emmy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   One was a brand image campaign for the Kraft Foods unit of the
Philip Morris Co. by the J. Walter Thompson Chicago unit of WPP
Group PLC. The $50 million campaign, intended to show how families
are brought together by cooking and eating at home, carries the
theme ``Let's make something good.''
</P>
<P>
   The other was a revamped version of a long-running campaign for
Sears, Roebuck by Young &AMP; Rubicam Advertising in New York. The
commercials retain the theme ``Come see the softer side of Sears,''
but add humorous elements like footage of long-ago fashions to urge
women to ``take another look'' because ``surprise, surprise,
there's so much more'' than they may expect from apparel sold at
Sears stores.

HOUSE COULD VOTE NEXT WEEK ON RESOLUTION FOR IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
and BENNETT ROTH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House could vote as early as this week on a
resolution laying out the scope of an impeachment inquiry against
President Clinton, Republican sources said Monday. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The resolution would cover the kind of subpoena authority and
other powers the Judiciary Committee would have if lawmakers decide
to hold hearings on independent counsel Kenneth Starr's report
about the president's relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   It appears inevitable that before leaving on Oct. 9 for fall
campaigning, the House will vote to conduct an impeachment
investigation on 11 charges suggested by Starr, ranging from
perjury to obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to see a vote very shortly that will determine
what powers the judiciary committee and the chairman will have to
compel witnesses to testify,'' said panel member Lamar Smith, R-San
Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and other members of the committee spent Monday afternoon
in a heavily guarded room in the Ford House annex building
reviewing some of the 2,000 pages of supporting documents and
evidence supplied by Starr, including a videotape of Clinton's Aug.
17 testimony to a federal grand jury in which he acknowledged for
the first time an ``inappropriate'' relationship with the former
White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   The House is expected to release more of Starr's material on
Sept. 28.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Republican and Democratic members of the
judiciary committee are jousting behind the scenes over how to
handle the inquiry and what kind of powers will be granted to
committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., and ranking Democrat John
Conyers of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde has promised a bipartisan process, and has hinted at
sharing responsibilities with Conyers. But the two are reportedly
already at odds over whether they should have joint subpoena powers
or whether the chairman should have sole authority to force
testimony from uncooperative witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans indicated Hyde will meet with Speaker Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga., and other members of the leadership team on
Wednesday to iron out the details.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and Democrats are also scrapping over whether the
committee should have the authority to raise other issues in the
hearings, including the Whitewater land deal, which was the basis
for Starr's original investigation of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes no sense to me that we would even think of giving
singular or unilateral powers to any chairman without the
cooperative and co-sharing power of the ranking member,'' said Rep.
Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Houston, who also serves on the Judiciary
Committee. ``This has to be a process above reproach.''
</P>
<P>
   There appeared to be a consensus among lawmakers that
impeachment hearings would not begin until after the Nov. 3
election.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional aides were already at work Monday on language to
be placed in the resolution ending the session next month that
would allow the Judiciary Committee to continue meeting through the
fall. It will also provide for the recall of Congress if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The country wants this over with,'' said Hyde spokesman Sam,
Strathman. ``It is not fair to the president that it be stretched
out any longer than necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic congressional leaders agreed on the need for speedy
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sooner this crisis can be resolved the sooner we can turn
our full energies to the promise of our policy agenda,'' House
Minority Leader Dick Gephardt said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri Democrat also warned the White House that the legal
strategy of trying to convince members the president did not commit
perjury when he denied having sex with Lewinsky may not be the
wisest approach to impeachment hearings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The considered judgement of the American people is not going
to rise and fall on the fine distinctions of a legal argument, but
on straight talk and the truth,'' Gephardt said.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., issued a
strong rebuke to the White House for trying to argue that
technically the president didn't not lie in his original court
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a basic understanding of the standard of truthfulness
that the president failed to meet,'' Daschle said. ``The president
and his advisers must accept that continued legal jousting serves
no constructive purpose. It simply stands in the way of what we
need to do: move forward and let common sense guide us in doing
what is best for the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt and Daschle joined the president and first lady in New
York Monday for a series of party fund-raising events.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., and a Clinton critic, left a
luncheon event before Clinton spoke. Kerrey chairs a committee of
senators trying to elect more Democrats to the upper chamber.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons and Vice President Al Gore later attended a
fund-raising dinner and a special theatrical presentation of ``The
Lion King.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton thanked the Democrats who gave him a warm welcome. ``For
Hillary and for me just your presence here, your enthusiasm and
personal support mean more than you will ever know,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Polls continue to indicate that most Americans oppose removing
the president from office, despite increasing calls by media
outlets and lawmakers for his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   A USA Today/CNN Gallup poll released Monday found that two out
of three people surveyed say the president should not be impeached.
The poll, conducted over the weekend, found that 64 percent of
respondents approved of the job the president is doing, slightly
higher than before the Starr report was released.
</P>
<P>
   However, the survey also indicated that the public holds an
increasingly dim view of the president personally. For example, a
majority of those surveyed said they did not respect Clinton and
disapprove of the way he has handled the current controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Polls taken by the Washington Post, Los Angeles Times and the
major networks found similar sentiments. But those who want Clinton
to resign or be impeached are loudly making their views known.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said that his office has logged more than 1,000 phone
calls from constituents in San Antonio about the Starr report, with
90 percent demanding the president's resignation or impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the concern of their constituents, two more
Republicans joined in the calls for Clinton's resignation Monday.
Rep. Greg Ganske, a moderate Republican from Iowa, and House Budget
Committee Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio, who is considering a run
for the presidency in 2000, both joined the resignation chorus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has brought dishonor on himself, the office of
the presidency, and our country,'' Ganske said. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At some indeterminate moment in the affair between
the president and Monica Lewinsky, the most powerful man in the
world seems to have begun to fear his former intern and the
emotional mess he had helped create.
</P>
<P>
   Was it the day she waited in the rain by his secretary's car,
desperate to deliver a small gift? When she made a scene outside
the White House after a guard let slip that Clinton was meeting
with another woman? When she imagined that she might be the next
Mrs. Bill Clinton? Or was it when she reached out and touched his
crotch across a rope line of major donors at his 50th birthday
extravaganza?
</P>
<P>
   A few months before their affair made news, he told her in a
late-night phone fight, ``If I had known what kind of person you
really were, I wouldn't have gotten involved with you.''
</P>
<P>
   The kind of person described in Kenneth Starr's narrative is a
mixed-up young woman who, despite her brazen behavior, was fragile
when she met Bill Clinton and deeply wounded by the experience of
their affair. She was so insecure that she initially assumed she
was just a replacement-worker mistress called in during the
government shutdown because ``maybe he had some regular girlfriend
who was furloughed.''
</P>
<P>
   The report also shows Ms. Lewinsky as worldly, smart and even
cunning, a manipulator who, after Clinton broke off the affair,
threatened to expose it unless he helped her get a job. That
endeavor ultimately had Clinton's closest friend, Vernon Jordan,
and at least a half-dozen important officials trying to mollify her
and find her work.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, she was easily deluded about a relationship she
had seemed to pursue with eyes wide open. At some point, as Jordan
later told the president, Ms. Lewinsky apparently became
``fixated'' on Clinton. And convinced, against considerable
evidence to the contrary, that the president was in love with her.
</P>
<P>
   The report chronicles, too, how Clinton fed both her fantasies
and her desperation. He even seemed to set her up for his later
claim that she was ``known as a stalker'' by suggesting that she
hang around outside his office so they could run into each other as
if by accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``His plan was that she would position herself in the hallway by
the White House Theater at a certain time, and he would invite her
to join him and a group of guests as they entered,'' the report
said. On that occasion, at least, Ms. Lewinsky signaled that she
perfectly understood the position Clinton was putting her in, and
responded that ``she did not want people to think she was lurking
around the West Wing uninvited.''
</P>
<P>
   After a time, the president began calling her only after seeing
her at a fund-raiser or other public event _ so she routinely
showed up for such functions, arriving hours early to ensure that
she would be positioned at the front of the rope line. ``Usually
when I'd see him, it would kind of prompt him to call me,'' she
told prosecutors. ``So I made an effort.''
</P>
<P>
   When it later became clear he was avoiding her, angry episodes
produced similar results. Eventually he would see her, soothe her,
give her some small presents. In one episode that she called a
``hysterical escapade,'' when she had raged and waited outside the
White House in the rain, she was finally allowed in, for two
minutes and a quick kiss, before Clinton left for a state dinner.
</P>
<P>
   And after she hinted in a letter that she might expose their
affair, he again agreed to see her, initially lashing out with a
warning that it was illegal to threaten the president. But later in
that same visit, she said, ``he was the most affectionate with me
he'd ever been.''
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Lewinsky and her family declined to speak about the
way she was depicted in the report, friends have consistently
portrayed the former intern as the opposite of menacing, a sweet
and achingly self-deprecating young woman who trusts too easily and
has genuine affection for Clinton, even now.
</P>
<P>
   When she began the affair, she was apparently so needy she was
willing to crawl around on bathroom floors for a man who took
telephone calls during their liaisons and did not get around to
having an extended conversation with her until after they had had
sex a half-dozen times.
</P>
<P>
   The president apparently understood the inherent imbalance of
power between them and realized that Ms. Lewinsky was emotionally
frail. Marcia Lewis, Ms. Lewinsky's mother, told the grand jury
that the president had once told her daughter that he knew she
``had been hurt a lot by different men and that he would be her
friend or he would help her, not hurt her.'' But it did not turn
out that way.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who can wince at the memory of some waiting-in-the-rain
moment will probably view Starr's extended and surpassingly unsexy
account of Ms. Lewinsky's anguished come-ons as mostly sad and
terribly human. Yet in the prosecutor's report, Ms. Lewinsky also
comes off as bold and savvy enough to credibly play chicken with
the president of the United States after their affair ended.
</P>
<P>
   She relentlessly pressured Clinton to get her a job, first
seeking a U.N. post and then sneering at it, even after Ambassador
Bill Richardson himself met with her. She presented the president
with a wish list of her ideal job _ one ``I don't want to have to
work for'' _ and suggested Jordan as the perfect person to help her
because he was outside the government.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky seemed like a woman with a plan from the beginning.
She told prosecutors that she and the president had been making
meaningful eye-contact at official White House functions for some
time before their first real meeting.
</P>
<P>
   In that encounter, at a birthday party in the White House in
November 1995, she seems to have won him over simply by flashing
the straps of her thong underwear. It is hard to imagine how this
gesture might have flowed naturally from even the most flirtatious
conversation. But if it raised any questions in the president's
mind about Ms. Lewinsky's stability or discretion, he ignored the
warning.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days of their affair, she seemed quite realistic
about the content of the relationship. After several sexual
encounters, she assumed he had forgotten her name when he called
her `Kiddo' in the hall.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton broke off their affair after only a few months, but soon
began calling again. And when she followed his suggestion that she
hang around to run into him, others in the West Wing noticed. After
a Secret Service agent eventually reported her, she was transferred
to the Pentagon in April 1996. When she tearfully told the
president, he promised to bring her back if he won re-election. She
didn't see him again that year.

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
So does this mean that Sammy gets a '62 Corvette, all shiny and
blue? Or do the Cubs wait to make it a '63, '64, '65 or even a '70,
figuring they'll get a better deal on a later model along with
accuracy?
</P>
<P>
   And just what were Buzz Aldrin's words when he stepped off that
ladder and became the second man on the moon?
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Sosa took two not-so-small (480-foot) steps on Sunday at
Wrigley Field and one giant leap back into the home-run race.
</P>
<P>
   Now, just when we thought it was safe to put away all the
flowery language that is often used to describe any big event in
baseball, here we go again, reaching for the poetry books.
</P>
<P>
   Roses are red, violets are blue. Watch out Big Mac, mon, Ah'm a
comin' after you.
</P>
<P>
   This time, it's chasing history with a calypso beat as the
smiling slugger from San Pedro de Macoris in the Dominican Republic
swings for the fences and his own Juanny-come-lately spot in the
Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Babe Ruth's record lasted 34 years. Roger Maris' record stood
for 37. Mark McGwire had the pedestal to himself for, oh, five
days.
</P>
<P>
   Who would have thought?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly not the geniuses of Major League Baseball who
apparently declared the race over when McGwire slugged No. 62 on
Sept. 8, with nearly three full weeks left in the season.
</P>
<P>
   As Sosa launched homers 61 and 62 onto Waveland Avenue,
commissioner-lite Bud Selig was conspicuously absent from the box
seats along the first-base line. So, too, was barnacle Bobby
Costas, TV's self-proclaimed keeper of the sacred baseball flame.
</P>
<P>
   No high-fives from opponents as he rounded the bases. No media
flock.
</P>
<P>
   There were no infrared markings on the baseballs, and No. 62 was
reportedly caught by a guy named Moe, who was promptly bitten on
the hand and beaten in a mad scramble and had it wrested away.
</P>
<P>
   How fitting.
</P>
<P>
   While McGwire's pursuit of Ruth and Maris was held in reverence
and awe, Sosa has spent the summer joyously dancing behind him, a
conga line in the shadows.
</P>
<P>
   And it seems that is the way most baseball fans outside of the
Dominican Republic wanted it. Remember, in polls taken two weeks
ago, 79 percent of Americans said they were rooting for Big Mac to
break the record compared to only 16 percent for Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   Is there the slightest tinge of a racial element there? One can
only wonder if Sosa would have been perceived differently all
season long if he were white and spoke flawless English.
</P>
<P>
   It is also possible that McGwire was the challenger of
preference to break the greatest of all American sports records
simply because he has the track record and looks more like a
home-run hitter. If somebody was going to pass Babe Ruth _ and to
many, Ruth's 60 was still the benchmark _ then it would certainly
help if that man seemed Ruthian in stature. And there is Big Mac,
Bunyanesque, like he just rode into town on the blue ox.
</P>
<P>
   But we can ponder whether McGwire would have been able to reach
the historic level without Sosa always there nipping at his heels.
Was it purely a coincidence that every time Slammin' Sammy would
sneak up into a tie or even take the lead, Big Mac came right back
with a couple of homers?
</P>
<P>
   And wasn't it Sosa, with his carefree, let's-enjoy-the-moment
attitude, who finally got McGwire to loosen up over the past month
of the record chase and who made last Tuesday night at Busch
Stadium so special with his happy hug and display of sportsmanship?
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the horse-track announcer says, down the stretch they
come, looking like Affirmed and Alydar in any one of the Triple
Crown races. This is Bird and Magic going one-on-one. It is Ali and
Frazier fighting for survival.
</P>
<P>
   Who gets the edge?
</P>
<P>
   Well, McGwire hasn't hit one out since breaking the record. He
left the Astrodome bothered by back spasms but may also be
suffering from an expected mental letdown following the big event.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire seems sapped. Sosa looks enervated. He and the Cubs also
have the electricity of the wild-card race to provide a charge.
</P>
<P>
   It's time to crank up the circus again. The Dominican Destroyer
is still hitting jonrons.
</P>
<P>
   It's time to put the special markings on the baseballs. And just
to make things right, as with the Maris sons on hand for Big Mac's
historic night, couldn't somebody at least ask the chubby little
McGwire kid to sit in the front row and watch Slammin' Sammy break
his dad's record?

 WASHINGTON: that year.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   While she waited, more or less patiently, she kept a calendar
with a countdown until Election Day _ which came and went with no
word from Clinton. Still, she did not give up hope, and early the
next year she quoted from Romeo and Juliet in a Valentine's Day
greeting to him in The Washington Post's personals that apparently
prompted him to renew the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   In May, he broke off with her yet again, and at that point, she
began repeatedly calling the president's secretary, Betty Currie,
often in tears, because she couldn't reach Clinton. She also wrote
him a number of letters; about 50 drafts were found in her
apartment when she consented to a search. And she continued to
shower the president with gifts, about 30 in all.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told the grand jury, ``I felt that it was a right thing
to do'' to respond by giving her presents in return.
</P>
<P>
   He also testified: ``After I terminated the improper contact
with her, she wanted to come in more than she did. She got angry
when she didn't get in sometimes. I knew that might make her more
likely to speak, and I still did it because I had to limit the
contact.''
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes he gave in, as he did in July 1997 after she wrote
an angry letter threatening to tell her parents about their
relationship. In fact, she had already told her mother, along with
10 other people, and had played the president's phone messages for
several of them. The day after her threat, she said, he was sweeter
than ever before, stroking her hair and telling her she was
beautiful and smart, and that he only wished he had more time for
her.
</P>
<P>
   She asked if he might have more time for her in a few years,
when he would be out of office, and again he obliquely encouraged
her, saying, ``I don't know _ I might be alone in three years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I said something about us sort of being together,'' Ms.
Lewinsky said. ``I think I kind of said, `Oh, I think we'd be a
good team,' or something like that.'' He responded to this talk of
forever by asking, ``What about when I'm 75 and have to pee 25
times a day?'' And yet when she walked away that day, ``I just knew
he was in love with me.''
</P>
<P>
   When it finally became obvious to her that their relationship
was over, she stayed in the president's life as a supplicant,
asking for a job, emotional support and an apology for his messing
up her life.
</P>
<P>
   The last time he agreed to see her was after she had been placed
on the witness list in the Paula Jones sexual harassment suit, and
he kissed her passionately, ``intimately,'' she said, just like old
times, and gave her some Christmas presents. Later that afternoon,
Mrs. Currie stopped by her apartment to retrieve them. She was glad
to turn them over, she said, as ``a little bit of an assurance to
the president that everything was OK.''

SOUTH AFRICAN OFFICIAL FREED FROM PRISON IN MOZAMBIQUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ A South African Foreign Ministry
official was released from a prison in Mozambique on Monday, six
months after he was arrested at a border town there and said to be
carrying thousands of dollars and trying to buy a cache of assault
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But what exactly he was doing remains a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Robert McBride, a famous anti-apartheid guerrilla, left the
prison with his wife, Paula, and returned to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   After landing at Johannesburg Airport, McBride said he had been
falsely implicated on charges of gun-running in Mozambique and that
he knew who had set him up. He said he was ready to reveal their
names ``to the relevant people.''
</P>
<P>
   McBride, who was involved in blowing up a crowded bar in Durban
in 1986 as a member of the armed wing of South Africa's ANC party,
was a high-level Foreign Ministry official last March when he went
to Maputo, Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
   McBride said he was investigating arms trafficking, trying to
track down who had been involved in supplying high-powered weapons
used in attacks on cash-carrying armored vehicles in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But the government has repeatedly distanced itself from him,
saying that he was not on official business and that the law must
take its course.
</P>
<P>
   McBride has been suspended from his job and on Sunday night a
spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, Marco Boni, said he could not
comment on McBride's release.
</P>
<P>
   Theories on what McBride was really doing have varied widely.
Some people have suggested that he was buying arms for the East
Timorese guerrilla movement. Others believe he may have been
stocking up on weapons for former anti-apartheid guerrillas now
involved in illegal activities.
</P>
<P>
   His supporters believe he was set up by right-wing elements in
the security forces. Soon after McBride's arrest, President Nelson
Mandela disclosed that he had received a report from the chief of
the army, Georg Meiring, linking McBride, several army generals and
the president's former wife, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, to a plot
to overthrow the government.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela said he believed the report was a hoax and a hastily
formed commission of inquiry soon agreed, though it said that
certain elements of the report needed further checking. Meiring
eventually retired early because of the incident. But relations
between government officials and McBride did not seem to warm.
</P>
<P>
   McBride has been charged in Mozambique with gun-running and
spying and a lower court judge has ruled there is enough evidence
to go to trial. Monday's ruling by a higher court allows McBride
bail while he appeals the lower court ruling.
</P>
<P>
   During the struggle against apartheid McBride was sentenced to
death, later commuted to life imprisonment, for a bomb attack on a
bar in which three women were killed in June 1986. He was released
by former President F.W. de Klerk, along with many other political
prisoners during the last days of apartheid.

GORBACHEV'S ADVISERS MAKE COMEBACK IN TIME OF CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Summoned back from a decade of obscurity, a group of
Gorbachev-era economists on Monday stood outside the gates of the
Russian government building, awaiting their turn to give advice on
how to rescue a floundering economy.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, these men were the talking heads of
`Perestroika,' the name given to reforms launched by then-Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev _ which in due course, led to the
collapse of communism and the end of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, they joined the alumni of Gorbachev's varsity squad
who find themselves back at the center of Russia's economic policy
debate. Russia's new prime minister, a top economic aide and the
new head of the central bank all served under Gorbachev.
</P>
<P>
   That the Russian government sought the help on Monday of so many
Gorbachev economists was a sign of the dearth of new ideas to save
Russia's economy. It was also a telling symbol of how last week's
political showdown has humbled President Boris Yeltsin.
Paradoxically, Yeltsin won the affections of Russian voters in 1991
by attacking Gorbachev's feeble efforts at economic reform, and by
extension the economists behind perestroika.
</P>
<P>
   This time, it is Yeltsin's team of young liberal economists who
are under attack for having shortchanged the Russian people by
clinging to free-market theories that have yet to take root here.
</P>
<P>
   Looking reinvigorated, if a bit rumpled, in the bright autumn
sunshine, the reassembled team measured their words carefully as
they waited for an escort to take them into a meeting with Prime
Minister Yevgeni Primakov's top deputy for economic affairs, Yuri
Maslyukov, a Communist.
</P>
<P>
   Among them were three top advisers to Gorbachev, Leonid Abalkin,
Nikolai Petrakov and Oleg Bogomolov.
</P>
<P>
   Their glee at having survived to see their services back in
demand was evident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now there is hope for a more realistic policy,'' said
Bogomolov, director of the Institute for Internal Economic and
Political Studies. ``Now it is not just one side that can express
their ideas, like our liberal radical economists. We are all in
favor of reforms, but not reforms for their own sake, but reforms
which serve people.''
</P>
<P>
   Primakov's government has yet to fix a clear economic policy to
pull Russia out of its crisis, but his choice of advisers has sent
strong signals that his approach will be a throwback to another
era, when economists tried to introduce some free market ideas
within a Soviet system.
</P>
<P>
   To Primakov's predecessors who favored free markets and tight
fiscal discipline, the return of the Soviet cast of characters is
eerie, even alarming: Not only is Maslyukov a member of the
Communist Party, he was also once director of Gosplan, the giant
bureaucracy that was the epicenter of the Soviet command economy
and the headquarters of its detailed five-year-plans.
</P>
<P>
   At a thinly-attended rally in Moscow Sunday, former Prime
Minister Yegor Gaidar issued dark warnings about the return of the
Communists to power, and the impending collapse of Russia's fragile
market economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main task today is to unite democratic forces to prevent
the downfall of Russia,'' said former Deputy Prime Minister Boris
Nemtsov, another young liberal reformer, speaking on television on
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also a more benign view of the return of a breed of
Soviet economists that many had assumed had become extinct. ``I
swear, I didn't even know he was still around,'' said one economic
researcher after reading a public appeal issued last week by
Abalkin, who is still director of the Institute of Economics.
</P>
<P>
   In his public comments, Primakov has indicated that his
government will put its emphasis on meeting the needs of the
Russian population, and Russian industry, without explaining where
the money to do so will come from.
</P>
<P>
   But it is a message with broad appeal that reaches beyond the
political debate, deep into a poor and exhausted society.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must not carry out reforms that have a bad effect on the
people,'' Primakov said on Monday at a government meeting. ``If
therapy drags on for decades, and there is no light at the end of
the tunnel, of course, this is not in the interest of the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   This was in many ways the language of perestroika, when
Gorbachev, during communism's waning days, tried to give the
economy a more human dimension, allowing room for personal
ambition, ability, freedom and a limited dose of capitalist greed.
Yeltsin, in his early days, also was able to connect with his
voters but in recent years, both he and his governments have seemed
distant, and unfeeling.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the Gorbachev-era economists _ most of them
heads of academic institutes _ have adapted to Russia's changing
reality and their views, too have changed.
</P>
<P>
   Their opinions also differ. Bogomolov, for instance, proposes to
increase the country's money supply by printing rubles, and issuing
new bank credits, while at the same time asking the West for a
postponement on debt payments. Abalkin, on the other hand, would
use the increased sales tax revenues to compensate those income
groups that have been hardest hit by rising prices.
</P>
<P>
   Abalkin, whose views were considered liberal in the Soviet
context, remembered the time when he and his colleagues were first
called together. ``It was under Andropov,'' he said, referring to
the former KGB chief, who as Soviet leader in the mid 1980s, first
opened the door to non-doctrinaire economic theory.
</P>
<P>
   Their heyday came during perestroika, even though they, like
Yeltsin's young liberal economists, complained that their ideas
were never carried out in full. ``The country's economy is now
going through a very difficult time,'' wrote Abalkin in 1988 in the
newspaper Argumenti I Fakti. ``The situation has not been this bad
in many years.``
</P>
<P>
   Like Gorbachev before him, Yeltsin has seen his political
authority and popularity shrink with the withering of the Russian
economy. And like Gorbachev, Yeltsin has been compelled by
political reality to shift his government's economic course.
</P>
<P>
   With his once favored liberal economic reformers now out of
government, and his Communist opponents now in their place,
Yeltsin's about-face promises to be as abrupt as Gorbachev's
decision to abandon a famous 500-day plan for economic reform in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   In another twist of Russia's recent history, a co-author of that
plan, Grigori Yavlinsky, head of a liberal opposition party, on
Monday said he could never join an economic team headed by s man of
Maslyukov's convictions. He has a different opinion on financial
and economic policy, said Yavlinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a different vision on ways to overcome the crisis.''

MORE DOCUMENTS AWAITED IN CLINTON CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER S. CANELLOS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With 445 pages of salacious material heating up
computer drives across town, Washington is turning its attention to
the 2,000 pages of Kenneth W. Starr's report that remain unreleased
_ and wondering what names, accusations, and sordid details lurk in
the ``supporting documents.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue are the reputations of scores of people interviewed by
Starr's prosecutors in a grand jury bound by rules of secrecy _
rules that suddenly have been superseded by the unique requirements
of an impeachment case.
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee is moving quickly to review the
supporting documents, and could release more papers within days,
according to a GOP committee source.
</P>
<P>
   The documents are expected to shed further light on glancing
references in Starr's report to President Clinton's friendships
with other women, the actions of his mid-level aides, and what
Secret Service agents did or did not see.
</P>
<P>
   But legal specialists, some of whom found the sexual
explicitness of Starr's narrative to be excessive, worried about
the extent to which officials involved in the impeachment process
are ignoring the usual rights of witnesses who appear before grand
juries.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal rules, grand jury testimony can only be unsealed
if the same witnesses are scheduled to appear at trial, and
only &UR;  &LR; to allow defense attorneys to investigate any discrepancies.
With a few additional exceptions, grand-jury materials remain top
secret.
</P>
<P>
   But not in this case.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a criminal case is brought, that doesn't mean the whole
grand-jury file is opened up,'' explained Gerard Lynch, a professor
at Columbia Law School and a former head of the criminal division
of the US attorney's office in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   A three-judge panel approved the release of Starr's report plus
the supporting documents to Congress last Thursday. The House voted
to make the main report public on Friday. Now, the 37-member
Judiciary Committee, which has until Sept. 28 to review the
supporting documents, is moving quickly, and should release more
information soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The committee is working expeditiously to review the documents
and will vote as soon as possible,'' the GOP source said. ``It
could be this week.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee's mandate from the full House obliges it to err on
the side of making more material public, the source said. Some
legal specialists, however, urged the committee to show greater
restraint.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Congress's decision and I think they should balance the
public's right to know against, dare I say it, decency and fairness
to people not accused of wrongdoing,'' Lynch said. ``But my guess
is they'll release everything, because that's the way things are
going these days.''
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of a huge trove of testimony coursing out over the
Internet alarms many observers, because the documents elaborate on
claims made in Starr's report _ some of which seemed hurtful to
innocent people without shedding light on claims of perjury or
obstruction of justice by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's narrative, for instance, quoted a friend of Monica S.
Lewinsky recalling a conversation in which Lewinsky said the
president was unsure whether he'd be married after his term ends.
It quoted Lewinsky recalling an insulting comment Clinton allegedly
made about White House volunteer Kathleen Willey.
</P>
<P>
   It also quoted Lewinsky, speaking on a tape made by Linda R.
Tripp, as saying she thought Clinton might be sexually involved
with a prominent Washington woman, who was named in the report. The
supporting documents would likely include both the full transcript
of the tape and copies of the woman's testimony to Starr's
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole way in which everything's been disclosed so quickly
and so broadly is troubling,'' said Fred Lawrence, associate dean
of Boston University Law School. ``More was made available than had
to be. Instead of stemming the rush to judgment, it's accelerated
the rush to judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence, a former federal prosecutor, believes none of the
supporting documents should be made public: ``Further disclosure
would make things worse, not better.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the Rules of Criminal Procedure, disclosure of grand-jury
material occurs only when a judge approves a defendant's request
for the testimony of witnesses who will appear against him at
trial; when a defendant makes a preliminary showing of abuses in
the grand jury; when one grand jury takes over an investigation
midstream; or when state police make a showing that the testimony
relates to a violation of state law.
</P>
<P>
   Secrecy is maintained for many reasons, including a need to
protect innocent people, legal specialists said. There are few
limits on what can be asked in a grand-jury session, and many
questions range far into the realm of speculation and would never
be admissible at a trial.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, grand-jury witnesses are not subject to cross
examination, raising concerns about fairness to the target of the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The grand-jury process is entirely one-sided,'' said Robert
Ullmann, a former assistant US attorney in Boston and a current
partner at Nutter, McClennen &AMP; Fish. ``Starr's report makes no
effort to show the public flaws in the evidence he's selected. For
example, Monica Lewinsky has some obvious credibility problems, but
you don't see those in Starr's report.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, both Ullmann and Lawrence believe the fault is less with
Starr than with Congress, which made no effort to shield innocent
people in Starr's main report, and which is now moving to release
at least some of the supporting documents. Starr himself has urged
Congress to keep private material that could invade the privacy of
innocent parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of wide disclosure is very dangerous,'' said BU's
Lawrence. ``If you're making a report to a deliberative body,
Congress, it's probably right to err on the side of inclusion, but
that doesn't mean Congress is obliged to make it public.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Sometime next year, if it is unable to raise fresh
money or delay payments, analysts expect that Russia will default
on as much as $200 billion in foreign debt _ the largest default by
any government in history.
</P>
<P>
   With only $12.3 billion in cash reserves in the treasury and
with Russian companies' pockets virtually empty, the economy is in
tatters. About $2 billion in debt comes due by the end of this
year, and another $17 billion is due in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   So, like a homeowner with outsized mortgage payments, enormous
bills and many mouths to feed _ and who has just lost a job and has
scant savings _ Russia is on the precipice.
</P>
<P>
   It has already missed $247 million in interest payments. A debt
moratorium is in place temporarily, but the bills will continue to
stack up.
</P>
<P>
   Financial markets around the world have been rocked in recent
weeks by the turmoil in Russia, and President Clinton called Monday
for the world's industrial powers to confront ``the biggest
financial challenge facing the world in a half-century.''
</P>
<P>
   With a new prime minister on board, Russia must address two
problems simultaneously: its staggering debt and a devastated
economy scarred by skyrocketing prices, unpaid wages, dwindling
food supplies and the threat of even worse to come as winter
approaches.
</P>
<P>
   How the Russian government tries to revive the economy, experts
say, will have a profound bearing on its ability to get lenders to
agree to restructure the debt.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has already damaged its credibility with foreign
creditors by imposing the debt moratorium, so it is doubtful that
any new solution will involve additional money.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, market purists have reacted with scorn to the
ascendance of Soviet-era economic advisers as Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov tries to assemble a new Cabinet. These purists
characterize Russia's new stewards as Stalinist retreads who desire
a larger role for the state in managing the economy and are ready
to print money to ease the cash crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The new regime's economic advisers say they want to preserve the
strengths of the market while imposing tighter regulatory controls.
</P>
<P>
   They also advocate reversing the government's move to
effectively devalue the ruble and impose a debt moratorium,
decisions that precipitated the economic crisis. And they have
invoked Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal as a model for helping the
Russian economy recover.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia has lost the trust of its citizens in its financial and
banking system,'' said Leonid Abalkin, a top Soviet economic
planner in the 1980s and now director of Moscow's Institute of
Economics, who met with government officials Monday to discuss
economic strategies. ``The first thing that one has to do is defend
people and make them safe from poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia is not alone in fashioning an alternative to the market
approach pressed by the Clinton administration and the
International Monetary Fund. Leaders of countries with economies as
diverse as Malaysia, China and Hong Kong have imposed or are
considering imposing tighter controls on capital.
</P>
<P>
   How the West approaches Russia's debt problem, and how open it
is to working with a Russia that wants to chart an economic course
of its own, is going to be a delicate balancing act.
</P>
<P>
   An economic historian, Robert Kuttner, noted that it was
international lenders' push for onerous debt repayments from Weimar
Germany in the 1920s that led to hyperinflation there and the rise
of the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you simply want Russia to repay its debts, the economy
collapses,'' Kuttner said. ``And if you only let currency
speculators determine the value of the ruble, then you'll have hot
money flying in and out of the country. What you need is for the
Russian government and the international community to work together
to control capital flight and the ruble's exchange rate and to
support Russia's version of the New Deal.''
</P>
<P>
   But other economists warn that printing rubles to stimulate
demand in Russia is a recipe for disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either the government cuts expenditures drastically, allows
banks to go bankrupt, and lets depositors receive only a share of
the liquidated bank assets _ in essence, lives within its means,''
the Russian-European Centre for Economic Policy said in a recent
report. ``Or the central bank issues credits to cover any or all
claims on the government. This is the path of hyperinflation. The
first imposes pain on many of the powerful guilty parties in the
current situation. The latter spreads the pain over all holders of
rubles, hitting the poor hardest of all.''
</P>
<P>
   But if loans are channeled to businesses and individuals, and if
the state spends wisely, printing rubles may not be a disaster,
proponents of the idea maintain.
</P>
<P>
   Americans do not have to look far for examples of the benefits
of easy money. When the stock market crashed in 1987, and when
American banks teetered on collapse shortly thereafter, Federal
Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan helped revive the economy by
sharply easing credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's terrible that the Western powers are suggesting
that Russia follows a model that none of them have followed during
times of crisis,'' said David Kotz, an economics professor at the
University of Massachusetts at Amherst. ``There's room for a strong
state role in guiding the economy and the claim that a departure
from the free market represents a leap back to the Soviet past
represents a serious misunderstanding of the Russian situation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not in the Western interest to see Russia collapse,''
said Oleg Bogomolov, a former top Soviet economist now with the
Russian Academy of Sciences who is advising the country's new
leaders. ``The policy of the West was mistaken and in part it will
have to pay. It gave recommendations that didn't work and it gave
credits that went to prolong a political regime rather than to
solve our economic problems.''

PRESSURE BUILDS FOR SWIFT ACTION ON CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER AND BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House inched closer Monday to a formal
impeachment inquiry of President Clinton, amid fears among
Republican leaders about a potential backlash and the harshest
rebuke yet by Democratic leaders of Clinton's ``hair-splitting''
legal defense.
</P>
<P>
   As pressure built for swift congressional action on Clinton's
sex scandal, Republican leaders said they expected the
GOP-controlled House to approve a formal impeachment investigation
as soon as the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   But in a sign the investigation could be scaled back to avoid
turning the proceedings into a tawdry spectacle, Republican leaders
expressed concern about the potentially devastating consequences of
full-scale hearings, which could be rife with lurid testimony from
witnesses such as Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody around here believes there is going to be a formal
inquiry,'' said Representative John A. Boehner, an Ohio Republican
who is chairman of the House Republican Conference. ``But it's
going to be a very difficult job for Congress to go through with,
and we've got some big decisions to make before we begin.''
</P>
<P>
   Concern spread among many House members as they returned from a
weekend of absorbing the salacious, 445-report from the independent
counsel, Kenneth W. Starr, and listening to constituents.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, sources on the House Judiciary Committee, which is
conducting a preliminary review of 11 impeachable allegations, said
the panel may begin releasing additional material from Starr's
grand jury investigation as early as the end of this week. A
special team of 23 lawyers and investigators assigned to the
preliminary review spent the weekend scouring 17 boxes of the
closely guarded material, including Clinton's videotaped
deposition.
</P>
<P>
   The panel must decide by Sept. 28 how much of the material to
release.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Henry Hyde, an Illinois Republican who is
chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said the panel has just
``begun the beginning'' of the process and has yet to consider how
much material to release or how much to narrow the scope of a
formal inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said he would consider proposals from GOP colleagues to
expand an impeachment inquiry to examine additional
Whitewater-related matters. But he expressed concern about
completing the process as swiftly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   If the House approves a formal inquiry, Hyde's staff said, the
Judiciary Committee would be permitted to conduct the proceedings
after Congress recesses for the year in early October. Members of
both parties want the issue resolved before a new Congress is
seated next January, if not sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a cloud hanging over Capitol Hill and the White
House, and the sooner it can be dissipated constitutionally, the
better,'' Hyde said. ``I don't know of anybody in either party who
wants to stretch this out.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Judiciary Committee already is split over a pivotal
issue: How much investigative authority the panel will receive, and
how much will be granted to the Democratic minority.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders, unable to reach an agreement acceptable to
committee Democrats, Monday abruptly abandoned plans to seek power
for the Judiciary Committee to interview witnesses and issue
subpoenas in its preliminary review.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Martin T. Meehan, a Massachusetts Democrat who
serves on the panel, said opposition to the initial GOP plan
centered on the fact, while it gave the committee broad
investigatory powers it did not afford the president a chance to
review the material before its release. Democrats on the committee
also chafed at the idea that only the committee majority could
issue subpoena.
</P>
<P>
   Meehan said the plan would give Democrats and Clinton fewer
rights than were afforded to committee Republicans and President
Nixon when Democrats controlled the House during Watergate
impeachment proceedings in 1974. ``I don't think the American
people want this president or any president to be railroaded,''
Meehan said.
</P>
<P>
   As for expanding the hearing to examine Whitewater-related
matters, Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat who
sits on the committee, said the exercise would be ``ludicrous,''
considering Starr has investigated for four years and has not filed
allegations against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, an increasing number of lawmakers and news outlets
called on Clinton to resign, even as some congressional Democrats
expressed support for punishing the president with a formal censure
rather than possible impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic leaders in the House and Senate, facing the
possibility of Clinton's scandal destroying their strategy to pick
up seats in the November elections, also issued terse statements
denouncing the White House legal defense strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly agree with those who have grown impatient with
hair-splitting over legal technicalities,'' said Senator Tom
Daschle of South Dakota, the Senate minority leader. ``The
president and his advisers must accept that continued legal
jousting serves no constructive purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   The House minority leader, Representative Richard A. Gephardt,
of Missouri, said: ``The considered judgment of the American people
is not going to rise or fall on the fine distinctions of a legal
argument but on straight talk and the truth. It is time for the
president and the Congress to follow that common sense for the good
of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials acknowledged the pointed complaints of
Democratic and Republican lawmakers. But in that acknowledgement
there was sign of a plan to change the strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a legal definition that he doesn't believe and his
lawyers don't believe fits,'' said Paul Begala, Clinton's White
House counselor, of the perjury allegation. ``But I hope nobody
thinks he is relying on the technical legal definition of
perjury...as an excuse for having an affair and misleading people
about it. People may be worried that he is using the legal niceties
to obscure the fundamental realities. I don't think he is.''
</P>
<P>
   White House aides also said they had no more plans for Clinton
to continue apologizing. In New York, Clinton launched into what
aides called a post-report phase, in which he tried to appear
presidential with a speech on the economy that was void of any
references to the Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week it was the contrition mission,'' Begala said. ``It
was enormously, personally painful. He got through it. He had to do
it. He owed it to the Cabinet, the clergy, the Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was part one,'' Begala continued. ``There are two parts,
to try to make right what you've done wrong. The second is to get
back to doing the work that the people want him to do. You can't
spend all your time apologizing.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials, led by deputy chief of staff John
Podesta, continued to push to bring new lawyers with political
savvy into Clinton's campaign for redemption, with the idea being
to hire new conduits of significant stature between the White House
and Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Former Senate majority leader George Mitchell of Maine remained
in the running, officials said. Podesta has also held discussions
with Greg Craig, a state aide and a former foreign policy adviser
to Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts. Craig, a lawyer by
trade, was described by former colleagues as an amiable presence
deeply familiar with the ways of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the White House is continuing with plans to have
Clinton appear in Boston at a pair of fund-raisers Thursday night
that are expected to bring in $1 million to the party.
</P>
<P>
   One senior Clinton strategist described Boston Monday as `` a
good place for Clinton right now'' with ``many friendly faces.''
During the stopover, Clinton is expected to attend a reception at
the Back Bay townhouse of Jack Manning, the president of Boston
Capital, then dine at a fund-raising dinner at the Park Plaza Hotel
nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The fund-raising stops are part of what Democrats are describing
as ``unity'' events, in which the Democratic National Committee,
the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee, and the Democratic
Congresional Campaign Committee split the proceeds for the November
election.
</P>
<P>
   The pricetag on the fundraisers is hefty: $25,000 to attend the
private reception; $1,000 to attend the dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know of anyone who has said I'm staying away,'' said
Steven Grossman, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee,
in a telephone interview Monday. ``I really trust the voters, and
they want to get beyond this. They don't want to put it aside
forever, but they want to get back to issues.''

COMMENTARY: MUDDYING THE WATERS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By ANTHONY LEWIS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Clinton controversy puts two questions to the
country. One is whether we are outraged by the president's personal
behavior and public deceptions. The other is whether we believe he
should be impeached and removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   They are distinct questions: constitutionally distinct. It is
crucial to the future of our political system that we keep them
separate. But from various points on the political compass there
are efforts to muddy them together.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Starr has worked ferociously to obliterate the
distinction. His aim is to destroy Bill Clinton, politically and
personally. His strategy has been to arouse public opinion against
the president and drive him from office. The president's sexual
idiocy, and attempts to conceal it, gave Starr the opportunity that
other allegations had not.
</P>
<P>
   The leaks that poured from Starr's office were calculated to
condition public opinion. Then, when his report was ready, there
was the P.R. tactic of parading boxes past waiting cameras: guilt
by volume.
</P>
<P>
   As to the report itself, any reader could understand without
prompting by the president's lawyers that its massive irrelevant
sexual detail was designed to degrade the president. What does
masturbation have to do with anything? Would responsible
prosecutors have pried so incessantly at Monica Lewinsky for sexual
detail? Would they have degraded her by forcing her to answer in
such detail as the price of immunity from prosecution?
</P>
<P>
   But it was not just the sex. The number of supposed grounds for
impeachment listed by Starr, 11, was designed to make people think
there must be something there. Starr went so far as to argue that
asking the courts to give Secret Service agents a privilege against
testifying _ which President Bush and many others thought they
should not have to do _ was a ground for impeachment. Could any
lawyer not blinded by hate think a president should be impeached
for making a legal argument?
</P>
<P>
   We ARE outraged by Bill Clinton's behavior. That is an easy
question. But outrage is not a reason to drive a president from
office. Impeachment of a president has to be a grave step. Scholars
argue about what the constitutional test of ``high crimes and
misdemeanors'' means. But it surely must be more than sexual
dalliance and attempts to conceal it.
</P>
<P>
   However Kenneth Starr tries to trick it up as abuse of office,
Clinton's wrongdoing is a long way from a fundamental offense to
our system. It is about illicit sex and the usual deceitful
aftermath. A British columnist detached from our obsessions, Simon
Jenkins of The Times of London, wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``To seize an initial lie about his sex life to trap him on an
escalator of mendacity does not require much ingenuity. The trick
is familiar to any tabloid journalist or tort lawyer ... What we
should care about is the ease with which a president can have the
trick played on him ... The process is claimed as constitutional,
but every well-tooled coup claims that.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the world is bewildered at the spectacle of an American
president under attack by a prurient prosecutor. On Irish Radio the
other day a Northern Ireland Assemblywoman, Brid Rogers, said:
</P>
<P>
   ``We find it just grotesque that somebody's private life should
be laid bare. None of us could stand that.''
</P>
<P>
   But because Clinton's behavior has been laid bare, people want
to express their disappointment in him. And that has led to a
blurring of the line between outrage and impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   A number of newspaper editorials have called on Clinton to
resign. Some people who have supported him in the past have taken
the same position, arguing that he can no longer be effective.
</P>
<P>
   Urging resignation is a way to avoid the hard question of
impeachment. But for a president to resign because he is
politically weak would do terrible damage to the role of the
presidency in our constitutional structure. It would move us toward
a parliamentary system. It would encourage the forces of
demagoguery to attack any president. It would intensify the already
corrupting criminalization of our politics.
</P>
<P>
   Those dangers are far worse than living with a damaged
president. Against them we should resolutely set our face.

CLINTON DELIVERS POLICY SPEECH ON WORLD ECONOMICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Traveling outside Washington for the first time since
the release of Kenneth W. Starr's impeachment report, President
Clinton Monday dispensed with apologies and tried to turn the focus
from the biggest scandal of his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   As Congress weighed whether to proceed with impeachment
hearings, Clinton projected a business-as-usual image, speaking to
the Council on Foreign Relations on the global financial crisis and
headlining a series of Democratic fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biggest financial challenge facing the world in a
half-century,'' Clinton said of the turmoil in international
financial markets. ``And the United States has an absolutely
inescapable obligation to lead.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Clinton's first major policy speech since the lurid
details of Starr's report to Congress became known, and the first
chance for New Yorkers to see the president since learning of his
exploits with former White House intern Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Before Clinton spoke, Pete Peterson, chair of the Council on
Foreign Relations, said, ``Mr. President, we've always admired your
ability to focus when a lot is going on around you, and we need
that focus today.''
</P>
<P>
   Untypically, Clinton's speech was not once interrupted by
applause. The only noticeable response from the audience came when
Peterson told the president, ``From Main Street to Wall Street,
people sleep better because Bob Rubin is the secretary of the
treasury.'' Rubin accompanied the president.
</P>
<P>
   The crowds that stopped to watch the Clinton motorcade as it
moved through Manhattan were also noticeably subdued. People
stared, but few waved. When the motorcade arrived at the Council on
Foreign Relations, a small group chanted, ``Free Clinton, Jail
Starr.'' Later, as the motorcade left the council, two people stood
with their thumbs pointed down and holding a sign that said
``Resign.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech to the council, Clinton said that a quarter of the
world's population now lives in countries with declining economic
growth. ``All of us in this room know that our future prosperity
depends upon whether we can work with others to restore confidence,
manage change, stabilize the financial system and spur robust
global growth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, Wall Street was posting strong gains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growth at home depends upon growth abroad,'' Clinton said,
pointing out that 30 percent of America's growth since he took
office has come from international trade. ``That's why ordinary
Americans should care if Asia or Russia or South America is on
solid economic footing. These people are our customers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After he spoke, finance ministers and central bank presidents of
the world's seven richest countries issued a joint statement
pledging to cooperate in dealing with the spreading economic crisis
and endorsing Clinton's view that the greatest risk now is
recession not inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Clinton attended a Democratic fund-raising luncheon at a
posh, two-story 5th Avenue penthouse owned by Denise Rich, a New
York socialite and philanthropist. Some 60 couples paid $50,000
each to dine on grilled sea bass, crabmeat salad, and lemon cake.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Grossman, a Massachusetts native and chairman of the
Democratic National Committee, offered Clinton a ringing
endorsement at the luncheon. He told the president: ``You have
demonstrated ... a higher commtiment to the kind of moral
leadership that I value in public service and public policy than
any person I have ever met.'' Grossman said he prayed that Clinton
``will continue to provide the kind of moral leadership to this
country that has enriched the life of virtually every citizen.''
</P>
<P>
   Also at the fund-raiser were House Majority Leader Richard A.
Gephardt, Senate Majority Leader Thomas A. Daschle and Senator Bob
Kerrey, Democrat of Nebraska, who heads the Democratic Senatorial
Campaign Campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Guests were seated in three rooms. Gephardt and Daschle emerged
from other rooms to deliver their speeches. Neither one approached
the president nor looked at him when he spoke, though Daschle at
times pointed toward Clinton. Kerrey was spotted leaving before the
program began and Gephardt excused himself before Clinton spoke.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was joined by Vice President Al Gore and his wife,
Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike last week's tour of contrition, during which Clinton
seemed to apologize for lying about his relationship with Lewinsky
at every turn to Democratic supporters, he barely alluded to his
problems Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that I speak for Hillary when I say we thank you for
your personal friendship and your support. It means more now than
ever, and we'll never forget it,'' he said in one of the few
references to his troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton suggested that Democrats might be able to turn ``the
adversity of the moment'' into their advantage, saying it had
spurred a higher turnout for Monday's fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest enemy for Democrats in the election, he said, is the
good economy that might create complacency among voters. Noting
that the party of the incumbent president has lost seats in midterm
elections since the Civil War, he said, ``I think we're going to
beat history.''
</P>
<P>
   DNC officials said that Monday's fund-raisers, which included
the luncheon, a dinner at The Supper Club, and an exclusive
performance of the Lion King at the Amsterdam Theatre netted more
than $4 million, $1 million more than had been projected.

STARR MAY BE PURSUING ANOTHER WOMAN'S CLAIM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While the report by the independent counsel,
Kenneth W. Starr, focuses mostly on President Clinton's
relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky, legal analysts said it also
provides clues that the prosecutor may still be examining Clinton's
encounter with Kathleen Willey.
</P>
<P>
   Willey, unlike Lewinsky, has said she rebuffed the president's
advances. But Willey, a former White House volunteer, also said
Clinton committed perjury in a deposition when he denied touching
certain parts of her body.
</P>
<P>
   Legal analysts said Starr seemed to indicate in his report to
Congress that he is continuing to investigate the Willey case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Additional events arising from the Lewinsky matter have also
come under scrutiny, including possible perjury and obstruction of
justice related to former White House volunteer Kathleen Willey,''
the report said. Yet the report does not detail the Willey case,
which some legal analysts interpreted as a signal that Starr is
continuing to collect evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Willey has alleged that Clinton made an inappropriate sexual
advance toward her in 1993. Lewinsky, the former White House
intern, gave her one-time friend, Linda R. Tripp, a document of
``talking points'' in which Tripp was supposed to say that she knew
nothing about an inappropriate meeting between Clinton and Willey.
</P>
<P>
   A former federal prosecutor, Bruce Yannett, said, ``I read the
report to say that the Kathleen Willey event is still under
investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the report makes clear that Starr wants more
information from White House deputy counsel Bruce Lindsey. The
report notes phone logs indicate that Lindsey had many
conversations with the president at key times, but Lindsey has
cited attorney-client privilege and has refused to answer certain
questions for the grand jury. The issue is pending before the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   A number of news organizations have raised questions about
whether Lindsey was involved in writing the talking points,
suggesting that the memo was written evidence that the White House
was involved in obstruction of justice, with perhaps even Clinton
involved.
</P>
<P>
   But as White House officials have pointed out, the Starr report
makes no reference to Lindsey or anyone else at the White House
being involved in the talking points.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no `talking points' smoking gun,'' according to the
White House rebuttal of the report.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky reportedly testified that she wrote the talking points
herself. Tripp has denied having written or suggested any of the
points.
</P>
<P>
   Given all the attention earlier this year to talking points,
legal specialists said they received suprisingly little notice in
the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``The absence of a discussion of the talking points was a
mystery to me,'' said former federal prosecutor Dennis Saylor of
Boston, noting that Starr did not conclude who was the author or
whether someone at the White House participated in writing them.
</P>
<P>
   Saylor also found it noteworthy that Starr had not made any
judgments about the Willey-Clinton story. In an interview on CBS'
``60 Minutes'' this year, Willey said the president ``had his arms,
they were tight around me, and he touched me. ... He touched my
breasts ... and I was just startled.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in his January deposition in the Paula Jones sexual
harassment case, was asked about Willey.
</P>
<P>
   Q. ``Did you ever attempt to touch her breasts?''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton: ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   Willey said on ``60 Minutes'' that she believed Clinton
committed perjury in the Jones deposition. But the Starr report,
which alleges that Clinton perjured himself in denying sexual
relations with Lewinsky, does not come to a conclusion regarding
Willey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if that means Starr concluded Clinton told the
truth about Willey, or he thought he lied about it and he couldn't
prove it,'' Saylor said.
</P>
<P>
   The Starr report does not detail Willey's meeting with Clinton,
but it does say that Lewinsky told the president that an article
about Willey might be published. ``I was concerned that the
president had no idea this was going on and that this woman was
going to be another Paula Jones and he didn't really need that,''
Lewinsky testified.
</P>
<P>
   The report said Lewinsky thought Clinton might be able to ``make
this go away'' by finding Willey a job. But, the report said, ``The
president responded that the harassment allegation was ludicrous''
because he would never be attracted to someone like Willey.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, who is still presenting evidence to a grand jury,
recently set off a round of speculation by filing a motion in a
separate civil case that indicated he might soon seek indictments.
But Starr did not indicate whether the indictments would be related
to the Whitewater land deal, which he was originally appointed to
investigate, or other matters such as the firing of the White House
travel office or the misuse of government personnel files.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a day of respite from the intense debate going on
in Washington, President Clinton came to New York Monday in pursuit
of money and perhaps solace, and found some of both.
</P>
<P>
   Making his first trip since the release of the Starr report and
accompanied by his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Clinton gave a
speech on the global economy before a foreign policy group and
circulated at three crowded Democratic fund-raisers, including an
evening performance of ``The Lion King.'' Among a populace long
supportive of him, he was largely greeted with encouragement to
proceed with his job, though he also encountered his share of
dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   In a city in which presidential visits are humdrum and often
disdained for the gridlock they add to already car-choked streets,
there was keener interest than usual in Clinton's itinerary in the
wake of the scathing report of the Whitewater independent counsel,
Kenneth Starr. Here was a chance to glimpse the man of the moment
at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like what he did, but I'm not angry at him,'' said
Mary Kane, a medical administrator trying to catch a view of the
president as he arrived for his speech Monday morning on East 68th
Street, down the block from where she works. ``I'd love to see him.
I'd tell him, `Good luck and I wish you well.'''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout a day that the Democratic Party said raised more than
$4 million, there seemed to be more affirmation than antipathy
among hundreds who lined the avenues as Clinton's motorcade wound
its way from a speech at the Council on Foreign Relations on 68th
Street and Park Avenue to the trio of fund-raisers, before a
late-night return to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   People pressed against police sawhorses along Park Avenue
clapped and waved as he proceeded to lunch on 60th Street. There
were only a handful of picketers. One man, who acknowledged being a
veteran Clinton foe, displayed a white banner with ``RESIGN''
inscribed in red, while two women held up their own sign saying,
``RESIGN NOW.'' In the back seat, Clinton waved and smiled to the
onlookers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think what he did was necessarily awful,'' said Adam
Gana, a freshman at Hunter College, which is situated just across
from where the president was speaking. ``I think maybe he should
have been a little more considerate and not lied. But I like the
president. I don't think he's a bad guy. If I could get a word with
him, I'd ask him about the universal health coverage rather than
the stupid affairs he's had.''
</P>
<P>
   Later on, as Clinton passed down Fifth Avenue on the way to the
Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, people were lined 7 and 8 deep for 10
blocks, craning for a look at him, and some of them waited
patiently for more than an hour. When he approached the hotel,
about half of the crowd there cheered and the other half booed.
</P>
<P>
   Some called for his resignation. ``I feel he should resign,''
said Ivan Richards, 30, a Manhattan therapist. ``It's put a stop on
our country. We can't get anything done.''
</P>
<P>
   Others wanted him to fight on. ``I'm out here because it's still
exciting to see the president,'' said Andrea DeMaso, 25, a
marketing executive from Dix Hills, N.Y. ``I think he's doing a
good job and has only done what all the presidents before him have
done.''
</P>
<P>
   At his various stops, Clinton sidestepped any discussion of the
Lewinsky matter. His morning speech was before about 150 people,
who were politely warm but not especially enthusiastic or all that
friendly. Some council members who had been invited stayed away,
council members said, because they did not want to shake the
president's hand.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those who did come were reading newspaper coverage of
the Lewinsky matter and then hastily tucked the papers away when
word came that the president had arrived. Theodore Sorensen, who
attended the speech, summed up the feelings of many by saying that
if Clinton lied under oath, it was ``inexcusable.'' But, he said,
``it does not amount to high crimes and misdemeanors.'' Some
others, who insisted on anonymity, were more critical and said that
Clinton's conduct had diminished the presidency and they hoped that
he would resign.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton took no questions, and when a reporter twice shouted to
him whether he would accept censure from Congress, Clinton ignored
him.
</P>
<P>
   At a $50,000-a-couple fund-raising luncheon on Fifth Avenue,
Clinton did allude to the latest events when he said, ``The
adversity of the moment, I think, has led us to this record
turnout. Why? Because people made a decision and they thought they
were needed and they stood up.''
</P>
<P>
   The luncheon was held in the two-story penthouse of Denise Rich,
a socialite, philanthropist and lyricist, whose ex-husband, Marc
Rich, is a fugitive commodities trader who fled the country rather
than face prosecution in a tax case. Sixty couples filled tables
arranged in three rooms, and others were turned away because of
lack of space. Clinton had his grilled sea bass in a different room
from his wife. Vice President Al Gore and Rep. Dick Gephardt of
Missouri, the minority leader, attended, though Rep. Charles Rangel
of Manhattan was the solitary New York politician to show up.
</P>
<P>
   John Catsimatidis, chief executive of the Red Apple Group, said
donors made their positions clear to party leaders at a recent
luncheon in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the point was made very clearly to the senators and
the congressmen there that New Yorkers feel very strongly about the
president, and support him, and any congressman who won't support
him, don't come back to New York for money,'' Catsimatidis said.
``If you can't stand up next to your friend, who you've called a
friend for the last few years, then you don't deserve our
support.''

</P>
<P>
   In his introduction, Steve Grossman, the chairman of the
Democratic National Committee, said, ``Mr. President, it seems to
me that you have demonstrated, at least in my adult lifetime, a
higher commitment to the kind of moral leadership that I value in
public service and public policy than any other person I've ever
met.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in his brief remarks, said, ``I know that I speak for
Hillary when I say we thank you for your personal friendship and
support. It means more now than ever, and we'll never forget it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon, Clinton stopped at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel,
on Park Avenue, the lodging choice of presidents since the days of
Hoover, where he had a rest break before his evening appearances.
He called Sammy Sosa and congratulated the Chicago Cubs outfielder
on matching Mark McGwire's record 62 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the dignitary-hardened hotel staff said there was
more excitement than customary given recent news developments. ``I
have no problem with him being here,'' said Geraldine Grays, a
lobby attendant polishing the brass banisters. ``Just leave him
alone. Let him do the job. I know some of the guests said he should
be seen today. He needs all the support he can get.''
</P>
<P>
   James Dowd, a doorman on the Park Avenue entrance, said this
time he was hearing more presidential jokes than usual, most of
them risque.
</P>
<P>
   In the evening, Clinton and his wife dined with 400 people who
had paid $10,000 a plate at the Supper Club, a dinner and dancing
establishment on West 47th Street. The president's arrival
interrupted guests trying to reach their rooms at the Hotel Edison
next door to the club. Police officers lined them up and admitted
them two at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Several New York politicians put in appearances at the dinner,
including Mark Green, Geraldine Ferraro and Charles Schumer, the
three Democratic candidates for Senate.
</P>
<P>
   People began arriving for the dinner at 4:30, though the
Clintons, accompanied by the Gores, did not get there until about
6:45. By then, most of the crowd had finished their buffet meals.
The donors, including an infusion of celebrities like Christie
Brinkley, Roberta Flack and Kevin Spacey, applauded Mrs. Clinton
for a full 25 seconds. Clinton received a briefer, though equally
hearty, welcome. In addressing the audience, the Clintons spoke of
each other in glowing terms. Mrs. Clinton said of the president,
``He wakes up and worries about what he can do to help the American
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the Clintons watched the ``The Lion King'' at the New
Amsterdam Theater on Times Square in the company of 1,700 people
who had bought tickets at prices ranging from $350 to $1,000.

 &HT;    Tiger helps open new Atlanta course
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- To have a golf course bear your name is honor enough,
85-year-old Charlie Yates decided Monday as the afternoon shadows
lengthened behind him, overlooking the first tee. To have it happen
for the benefit of junior golf on a piece of ground once more
crime-ravaged than any in the city _ the failed public housing
project known as East Lake Meadows _ took the dream to near-fantasy
proportions.
</P>
<P>
   ``To see all denominations and all races coming together in this
marvelous spot ... I wish you all could feel the depth of my
emotions,'' said Yates, the former British Amateur champion and
current president of East Lake Golf Club. ``Bob Jones would have
been so happy to be here standing with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's official opening of the first nine holes of the Charlie
Yates Golf Course, a Rees Jones layout that will serve as the home
site of the East Lake Junior Golf Academy, brought politicians,
leaders of the Atlanta golf community and even Tiger Woods to the
revitalized area.
</P>
<P>
   Woods' entrance was detached _ three security guards in red
shirts and black pants flanking him in rock-concert style _ but his
words and commitment were truly warm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always say I want golf to look like America,'' Woods, 22,
said, ``and you know what? We're here. Look at us. This is what
it's all about. I'm honored to be here and to be a part of it. I
love seeing the smiles on the kids' faces and I'm proud of what
they stand for and what they will do in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The official kickoff was the presentation of a bronze plaque to
Yates from Joe Rogers, who lifted the drape along with two of the
honoree's grandchildren and said, ``Charlie, here's your golf
course.'' Following that, 10 children from the East Lake Junior
Golf Academy and Woods simultaneously hit ceremonial shots down the
first fairway.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, accompanied by his father Earl, told the audience that
the course, which will be operated by the East Lake Community
Foundation as yet another step of developer Tom Cousins' amazing
project, ``is a perfect example of how dreams can come true.''
</P>
<P>
   Scheduled to open for public play in mid-October, the course,
according to architect Jones, was designed as a sort of miniature
East Lake. Nine more holes will be added later on the property that
once was the site of East Lake's other course, along Glenwood
Avenue. The youth course, with a first nine of 2,000 yards, has par
3s ranging from 110 to 207 yards and three par-4s, the longest at
340 from the back tees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted it to be a challenge, but we also wanted to
encourage youngsters to play it, so we didn't want it to be too
hard,'' said architect Jones, who took no design fee for the
project.

MORE MINORITIES ENROLL AS FRESHMEN AT UT DESPITE AFFIRMATIVE ACTION
BAN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LYDIA LUM 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   More of the state's top black and Hispanic students enrolled as
freshmen at the University of Texas this fall, despite an
affirmative action ban.
</P>
<P>
   But the total number of black and Hispanic freshmen dropped this
year at UT. The actual number of Hispanic freshmen at UT dropped
from 807 to 762 this fall, while black freshmen rose from 163 to
165.
</P>
<P>
   This freshman class is about 10 percent smaller than last year's
because of efforts by the administration to limit overall
enrollment at UT, one of the nation's largest universities with
48,857.
</P>
<P>
   UT officials, however, focused their attention on the higher
numbers of minority students who graduated in the top 10 percent of
their high school classes. Texas passed a law last year
guaranteeing admission to state-supported colleges to all high
school seniors in the top 10 percent of their classes, regardless
of race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was gratifying to see the increase,'' said Bruce Walker, UT
admissions director. ``The top 10 percent admissions law has
allowed the university to focus our recruitment activities, and to
attract a highly qualified, diverse freshman class.''
</P>
<P>
   Among black UT freshmen this year, 38 percent were top 10
percent graduates, compared with 31 percent last year. And 54
percent of UT's Hispanic freshmen graduated in the top 10 percent
of their classes this year, vs. only 44 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   The top 10 percent legislation was in response to public, and
even some private, colleges in Texas dropping affirmative action in
admissions and scholarships. Lawmakers had hoped the admissions
guarantee for high-achieving students would make Texas colleges
more appealing than those outside the state.
</P>
<P>
   National attention has focused on Texas colleges since an
appeals court found unconstitutional UT law school's former
admissions policy, which had considered Hispanics and blacks
separately from white applicants.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Attorney General Dan Morales subsequently decided the
court ruling applied not only to UT, but to other Texas colleges,
and applied to scholarships as well. So, many Texas colleges have
dropped race-based admissions and scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, black and Hispanic enrollment at many Texas colleges,
including UT, declined. Educators largely blamed the many
universities outside this state still offering minority
scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   However, privately administered minority scholarships in this
state may have helped boost enrollment at some schools, including
UT law, officials said. Private groups and foundations are not
affected by the affirmative action ban.
</P>
<P>
   At UT law, at least eight black and 39 Hispanic first-year
students enrolled this year, compared with four blacks and 28
Hispanics last year. UT officials said 35 of their 482 first-year
students did not disclose their ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Rice University in Houston has drawn 40 black
freshmen this year, compared with 30 last year. And 73 Hispanic
freshmen enrolled at Rice, vs. 59 a year ago.

 &HT;    On Deck: Philadelphia Phillies
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When: 7:40 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Where: Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   TV/radio: TBS; 750-AM.
</P>
<P>
   Probable starting pitchers: RHP Kevin Millwood (15-8, 4.34 ERA;
3-0, 2.06 lifetime vs. Phillies) vs. RHP Tyler Green (6-10, 4.79;
3-1, 3.24 lifetime vs. Braves).
</P>
<P>
   Notes: The Braves did something July 23 they'd never done
before: They beat Tyler Green. It took seven tries, but Atlanta
defeated the right-hander 3-2 at Veterans Stadium, thanks to
back-to-back solo homers by Javy Lopez and Curtis Pride in the
sixth inning. Inexplicably to the Braves, Green remains 3-1 against
them with a 3.24 ERA during his career. He's 15-22 with a 5.30 ERA
against everybody else. In addition to Atlanta, his only other
winning records in the NL are 1-0 each against Chicago, San Diego
and Arizona. He is effective against the Braves primarily because
they are a free-swinging team, and Green's menu of sliders,
off-speed curves and change-ups is hard for Atlanta to pass up. He
faced Atlanta twice in the first two weeks of the season, allowing
two runs in 10 innings with a victory and a no-decision. Millwood,
who has four victories in his last six decisions, continues to give
up a load of hits, but he has a devastating strikeout rate. In his
last 49 innings, he has yielded 54 hits and struck out 55 batters.
His strikeouts per nine innings rate of 8.4 is tied for sixth in
the NL and in the Braves' rotation is second only to John Smoltz
(9.2).

 &HT;    HR drama has become Sosa's stage
 &HT;    By Terrence Moore
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- What we're seeing here with Mark McGwire and Sammy
Sosa is another manifestation of Biblical prophesy. Indeed, the
first shall be last, and the last shall be first. That means there
shall be much weeping and moaning among the masses when Sosa is
crowned king of kings in regard to slamming home runs during a
season.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa isn't the people's choice. Well, not unless those people
live in his native Dominican Republic or know that McGwire isn't
the only person in this wonderful saga who is a treasure on and off
the field.
</P>
<P>
   As a youth, Sosa was so poor that he sold oranges when he wasn't
shining shoes on the streets of San Pedro de Macoris. As for now,
he donates much of the $10 million per year he makes with the
Chicago Cubs to charities in the United States and the Dominican
Republic. He spent last December distributing thousands of gifts to
children in schools and hospitals in both countries as somebody
called ``Sammy Claus.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's another thing: The man can hit. He joined McGwire over
the weekend in making Babe Ruth and Roger Maris just footnotes.
Sosa also is performing well enough as a complete player to push
the Cubs toward a playoff date that McGwire's Cardinals only can
dream about until next season.
</P>
<P>
   Little of this matters to the masses. In a USA Today poll last
month, 5,800 readers were asked to choose whom they wished to pass
Ruth and Maris in this cozy chase. Sosa received 16 percent to
McGwire's 79.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, for the masses, McGwire is becoming the other guy
to the other guy. We're not surprised. It's been a week since
McGwire slammed No. 62 in St. Louis against the Cubs, but two
memories remain for a columnist who visited both clubhouses that
night after much of the media had dwindled to three.
</P>
<P>
   Memory 1: It was near midnight, when McGwire and his son, Matt,
returned from a back room to a virtually empty home clubhouse.
McGwire spoke again of hitting Nos. 60, 61 and 62 within a four-day
period that featured more drama than you could stuff into a novel,
and then he hinted that Superman would become Clark Kent for a
while.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just took a couple of Advils to get rid of a headache,'' he
said with a deep sigh. He resembled somebody who had climbed the
highest mountain and wished to return slowly to the ground in an
overstuffed chair on an elevator.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I finally did it'' _ hit No. 62 in the fourth inning _
``it was sort of like, 'Oh, my God. I've got five more innings
left.' I mean, what else can you do after something like that?''
</P>
<P>
   You can go into a slump, which McGwire did, especially with his
team just playing out the season.
</P>
<P>
   Memory 2: Soon after the third or fourth wave of reporters left
Sosa's locker after McGwire's No. 62, Sosa lost the sloppy smile
he'd owned during most of the two-game series. Was he thinking
about going oh-for-the-moment while McGwire prospered or about the
Cubs dropping both games during a pennant race?
</P>
<P>
   Neither. Sosa told a columnist, ``I have to wait for my time.
And my time will come.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa's time is now. Whether the masses like it or not.
</P>

 &HT;    Bean fights lightweight reputation
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Those who count ticket sales and sell cable TV
subscriptions have gone to great lengths to tell you that Evander
Holyfield's next opponent is the world's No. 1-ranked heavyweight
contender, even if that's in the blurred vision of the IBF. They
point to the 31-1 record and shout, as his manager Butch Lewis did,
``This will be a September to remember!''
</P>
<P>
   Except that, even listening for nearly two months to circus
barking, many fight observers still view Vaughn Bean to be as
intimidating as Jello.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not paying attention to anybody's opinions,'' said Bean,
the heavyweight division's 25-year-old obscurity, who meets
Holyfield in the Georgia Dome and on the Showtime cable network
Saturday night. ``I'm here to fight. I'm here to do a job.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Turner, Holyfield's trainer, said Bean ``isn't nearly as bad
as people make him out to be.'' And the notion that the credentials
of a boxer with such a high success rate would be questioned does
seem strange, especially when Bean's only loss was a narrow
decision last year to then-IBF champion Michael Moorer.
</P>
<P>
   But in boxing, contenders are judged by the quality of wins. And
when Bean's resume is slipped under a microscope, it bears a strong
resemblance to that of Peter McNeeley, who was 36-1 against
convenience-store clerks until being floored by Mike Tyson in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Bean, who is unranked by the sport's other two major governing
bodies, claimed wins against boxers with a composite record of
152-294-14 at the time of the bouts. It gets worse. Those opponents
went on to a current combined mark of 181-511-19. Only three have
winning records _ not that Warren Williams (10-8-1), Maurice Harris
(11-9-2) or Issac Brown (12-10) have cracked any rankings.
</P>
<P>
   The one fact that separates Bean from McNeeley is that Bean has
faced a champion. The loss to Moorer was a narrow decision
(116-113, 115-113, 114-114), but those scores were more a
reflection on the lack of punches thrown than on fierce
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Even Bean admitted, ``I was worried about his southpaw style
instead of just fighting him. I was waiting for him to make a wrong
move, and he was waiting for me to make a wrong move. So we were
just standing there, taking pictures of each other.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Bean was ranked fifth by the IBF, despite having
never fought a top-10 opponent. IBF president Bob Lee constantly
has had to answer criticism about the rankings. His standard
response: ``He's been one of the most active heavyweights, and he
was undefeated going into the Moorer fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee said he was somewhat vindicated by the closeness of the
Moorer fight, although others might point to Moorer's lack of
enthusiasm and his trainer, Teddy Atlas, telling him before the
fight that he was quitting.
</P>
<P>
   Bean's 15 minutes of fame soon turned into a half-hour. Lewis,
who once maneuvered Leon Spinks into a title fight against Muhammad
Ali after only seven bouts, argued with Lee that Bean lost the
decision because the judges were influenced by prefight negative
media attention. Lee bought it and made Bean a mandatory challenger
for Moorer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Butch, `I want to kiss your feet,' '' Bean recalled.
</P>
<P>
   The rematch with Moorer never took place. Bean received a
$350,000 ``step-aside'' payment to allow Moorer to fight Holyfield
first, with the promise that he would fight the winner; Holyfield
and Moorer split the payoff. Holyfield knocked down Moorer five
times, and Bean now has his second title shot in 18 months, along
with a nearly $2 million payday.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said, ``He used to come to me and say, `Butch, let me
fight somebody. They're laughing at me in the gym.' I said, `Just
wait until you're fighting for the championship.' Now where are the
wisecracks?''
</P>
<P>
   He has come a long way from his childhood on the south side of
Chicago. When Vaughn was 13, Brenda Bean, a single mother of two,
was killed on Valentine's Day after her car slid across an icy
highway and was hit head-on by another vehicle. Bean lived with an
aunt until moving out on his own when he was 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``The criticism doesn't bother me, because I've dealt with a lot
of obstacles in my life,'' Bean said. ``This fight is just one more
hurdle.''

 &HT;    A Gator jinx on Vols
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. _ Over the past five years Tennessee has won 50
games, and 10 wins a year isn't bad in anybody's league. The Vols
have won an SEC championship. They've been in the Top 10 for 38 of
the last 39 polls. They've watched Peyton Manning come, create a
legend, and go on to the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Tennessee's football team and fans have been able to
celebrate just about everything you could name in that five-year
span. Everything, that is, but a win over Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Not since 1992, when Phillip Fulmer was an interim coach for the
ailing Johnny Majors, has Tennessee tasted victory over the Gators.
Except for 1994's 31-0 loss in Knoxville, Tennessee has had chances
to win each game. But invariably Florida would make the key play,
force the big turnover, and find a way to come out on top.
</P>
<P>
   For Fulmer, there is nothing mysterious about Tennessee's
five-game losing streak to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Florida is a very talented, well-coached team and if you don't
play well ... if you don't block and tackle well and take care of
the football, chances are you are not going to win,'' said Fulmer,
pointing to the fact that Tennessee has committed significantly
more turnovers (18-8) in the five losses.
</P>
<P>
   But fans keep looking for something beyond the physical to
explain why Tennessee has been unable to get over this Gator-made
hump. On talk shows and in other media has come the strong
suggestion that after five straight years, the hump has become more
mental than physical.
</P>
<P>
   They point to last season, when Fulmer took his team down to
Florida a day early, camping out in nearby Ocala in hopes of
getting the players better acclimated to the heat. But when the
Vols turned it over three times and lost 33-20, Fulmer's critics
said the move served to further tighten what was already a tight
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't buy that at all,'' said wide receiver Jeremaine
Copeland. ``We might have gotten a little uptight but I don't think
it's been the difference in the game. The difference is they made
the plays and we didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   But sophomore running back Jamal Lewis believes the hurdle
Tennessee must overcome to finally beat the Gators is found in the
mind, not the body.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way those guys have more talent than we do,'' said
Lewis, who played sparingly in last year's game as a freshman. ``I
think part of it is mental. And you overcome that by keeping your
cool and playing your game. That's what we have to do on
Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   Fulmer does not believe he or his staff is doing anything to
make his team uptight before it plays the Gators.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they've tightened up it's because of the maturity level of
the football team,'' said Fulmer. ``We were able to come back
against Auburn in the SEC championship game because by that time,
our team had matured.''
</P>
<P>
   Fulmer believes a coach must be careful about buying into
psychological explanations for winning and losing. He witnessed the
same situation as an assistant to Johnny Majors, whose stumbling
block was Alabama. Every year Majors would tighten up the week of
the Alabama game and try different things to get his team ready to
play. Not many of them worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you try to do something that's not your nature it doesn't
come across as genuine,'' said Fulmer. ``Ultimately, it comes back
to whether or not you blocked and tackled them the way you were
supposed to.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he concedes that until Tennessee beats Florida, this will
be a yearly question. He and the Vols would like to put it to rest
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It bothers me that we haven't won, particularly in a couple of
games where I thought we were as good or maybe better,'' said
Fulmer. ``As well as we've played here, we should have won our
share. As a competitor, that digs at you.''

 &HT;    Hallen, German to be used more
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the Falcons are going to take the next step in coach Dan
Reeves' grand plan, they will have to beat the San Francisco 49ers.
And to do so, they will need more help from some of the team's high
draft choices.
</P>
<P>
   That opportunity is coming. After this Sunday's bye, the Falcons
play at San Francisco on Sept. 27, and some players who haven't
dressed for a game yet might get a chance to help.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves said Monday that second-round draft choice Bob Hallen, a
guard/center, and third-round draft choice Jammi German, a
receiver, stand good chances of being active for the 49ers game.
</P>
<P>
   No changes are imminent on the offensive line, Reeves said, but
they could happen in the future. Left guard Calvin Collins and
right guard Gene Williams have not been impressive. The way Hallen
is used in practice today might offer some clues. He has been
working at backup left guard for about five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way Bob Hallen is going to be ready ... is to get ...
some playing time,'' Reeves said. ``We've got guys playing there
now making mistakes, and there's no difference in a rookie making
those mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Hallen) has got speed and quickness. He's very good pulling,
has quick hands, quick feet, great athletic ability. Probably the
thing he needs to improve on is ... assignments, which comes from
being in there.''
</P>
<P>
   German, Reeves said, would get a look as a return man, as an
outside coverage man on punts and ``maybe as the third or fourth
receiver,'' spots currently held by Todd Kinchen and rookie Tim
Dwight. Reeves also said seventh-round draft choice Ken Oxendine, a
running back, could dress for the first time.

 &HT;    Brat Pack making Davenport more marketable
 &HT;    By Todd Holcomb
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Lindsay Davenport says it never bothered her that the
most marketable players on the WTA Tour lately have been four
self-assured, if not cocky, teenagers _ Martina Hingis, Anna
Kournikova and Venus and Serena Williams _ even though without
Hingis the whole group has won exactly one singles' title.
</P>
<P>
   Now, following her first U.S. Open women's championship and 17th
title overall, Davenport could credit the four indirectly for
shaping her suddenly marketable image into that of the
anti-brat-packer, the one who wasn't glamorous, didn't boast, never
complained. She just got to work and did it.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's American, and she's normal,'' said Tony Godsick,
Davenport's IMG agent. ``I'm not saying the other women aren't
normal, but Lindsay is American as apple pie. ... She likes to
spend time with her mother and her friends. She really tries to
stay out of the spotlight.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport won the U.S. Open on the birthday of her mother, Ann.
The two are roommates in Davenport's home in Newport Beach, Calif.
Davenport invited her in after she and Davenport's father, Wink,
divorced four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's the one that used to drive me hours and hours to
practice since I was 6,'' Davenport said. ``It's a great story.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport is still close to her father, although he didn't
attend her final.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport went to work Monday as a new celebrity, doing an
interview with CNN and appearing on ``CBS This Morning.'' Later,
she did photo shoots for People and New York Times magazines, then
a taping for the ``Rosie O'Donnell Show,'' which will air
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Remaking Kournikova
</P>
<P>
   Advantage International will announce this week the signing of
former IMG clients Kournikova and her pal Sergei Fedorov of the
Detroit Red Wings. One of the goals of Advantage will be to tone
down Kournikova's racy image. Advantage president Phil de Picciotto
told Sports Illustrated he wants to ensure that ``her tennis
excellence is what makes her attractive.'' Her tennis excellence
somehow was underplayed in a recent Rolling Stone story, in which
she was pictured in high heels and a miniskirt that bared her
underwear. Kournikova has beaten Hingis, Davenport, Monica Seles
and Steffi Graf this year but has not won a WTA Tour title.
</P>
<P>
   An Australian revolution
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Open men's final was the first involving two
Australians since 1970, when Ken Rosewell beat Tony Roche, and
Patrick Rafter is the first Australian to win back-to-back titles
since Neale Fraser in 1959-60. ``You know, it was quite normal to
expect two Australians to get through to a Grand Slam final, but it
hasn't happened in 25 years, which means that anyone under 25 has
no idea what I'm talking about,'' said Geoff Pollard, the president
of the Australian tennis federation. Pollard also noted that Rafter
did it ``the Australian way,'' a serve-and-volley, net-attacking
style. Pollard said Australians were beginning to wonder ``whether
the Australian game was passe; whether we should teach our players
the continental game. Others said, 'Don't copy; you'll never catch
them. Don't replicate Europe.' ``
</P>
<P>
   Nuveen field announced
</P>
<P>
   The field for the Atlanta stop on the Nuveen Tour, to be played
Sept. 30-Oct. 4 at Atlanta Athletic Club, has been set. It includes
Jimmy Connors, Mats Wilander, Andres Gomez, John Lloyd, Mikael
Pernfors, Mel Purcell, Johan Kriek, Gene Mayer, Mansour Bahrami,

 SPOOKED BY GHOST STORIES FROM '78 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ What makes them the Red Sox is their insistence that
the past has nothing to do with the present, followed by
performances that appear infinitely predestined.
</P>
<P>
   And so they came to Yankee Stadium Monday night, losers of 8 of
10, a woeful 3-8 in September, looking at their onetime wild card
lead of nine games (on Aug. 27) shriveled to three with 15 to play.
</P>
<P>
   There were ghosts in the eyes of those who were here 20 years
ago, the older men who wore the Red Sox uniform for the collapse
against which all others are measured.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Eckersley today is a 43-year-old middle reliever who won
20 games for the 1978 Red Sox. Jim Rice is a 45-year-old batting
coach who had his MVP season for the '78 Sox. Sox broadcaster Jerry
Remy, 45, was an All-Star second baseman for the '78 Sox and hit
the ninth-inning playoff single that somehow found its way into the
glove of a sun-blinded Lou Piniella.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yes, and then there is Don Zimmer. The inimitable Zim,
target of Bill Lee and his bleacher minions in '78, today is a
bench coach with the muscle-flexing New York Yankees. Twenty years
ago, Zim steered the pro sports equivalent of the Exxon Valdez,
running it aground and unleashing a toxic spill from which New
England has never recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Before Monday night's Red Sox-Yankees joust at The House That
Ruth Built, the ghosts of '78 were asked about flashbacks and the
panic mentality that has taken hold of Greater Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand,'' said Eckersley. ``It's the nature of the
tradition. That's profound, huh? Actually, I don't remember '78
that well. I know we won the last eight in a row and 14 of our last
16 to tie. I remember winning a big game here in September. It was
a big game just like this is a big game tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer said, ``Because of the way things have happened there
over the years, I can understand how people are feeling.
Personally, I'm rooting for the Red Sox and the Cubs _ two teams
that fired me. But as a manager you just have to make sure you keep
your club playing hard. Boston's still got the best of it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a stretch to compare '98 to '78. Twenty years ago, the Red
Sox were one of the dominant teams in baseball, an All-Star cast of
home run thunder. They roared to a 62-28 record and led the
defending champion Yankees by 14 games on July 20. Then came the
free fall, lowlighted by the Boston Massacre, and a humiliating
stretch of sloppy baseball that put them 3 1/2 games behind the
hated Yanks.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Boston rallied to win its last eight games and force
a playoff, but no one remembers the '78 Sox as a clutch bunch. They
are etched in hardball history as the Manila Folders _ a team that
won 99 games but is remembered only for blowing a big lead, then
losing the one-game playoff because of Bucky Dent's homer.
</P>
<P>
   Remy stood in the clubhouse Monday night, chatting with Rice,
another soldier in the war of '78.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nah, we hardly get asked about '78 at all,'' Remy said
sarcastically. ``Just every time the Sox lose five in a row.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice rolled his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Even the veteran writers had flashbacks. New York Times baseball
sage Murray Chass, who covered the Yanks for the Globe in '78 (the
Times was on strike), said, ``They'e doing a pretty good imitation
of that year.''
</P>
<P>
   Could it happen again? Sox fans are trained to fear the worst, a
trait that's become painfully obvious to Boston manager Jimy
Williams. After Sunday's loss Williams answered a pessimistic
question with, ``Only in Boston ...''
</P>
<P>
   Only in Boston? What about Toronto in 1987, when Williams's Blue
Jays led the Tigers by 4 1/2 games with a week to play, then saw it
dissolve in a hail or close losses to Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't the first time I've been through this,'' said
Williams, citing his days as a coach with the Braves and some minor
league pennant races. ``It's the nature of the game. You never get
too high or too low.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams believes the negativity is media-driven. He chuckled
and said, ``I've got tinted windows in my car. And I turn the sound
way up.''
</P>
<P>
   Kidding some more, he said, ``Do they have talk shows in
Boston?'' Then he said he might make a call to the other clubhouse
and invite Zimmer to come visit.
</P>
<P>
   Zim would be able to tell him some stories _ such as the time he
got booed carrying the lineup card to home plate for the Fenway
opener, six months after winning 99 games and finishing tied for
first. Zim could tell Jim about driving home over the Tobin Bridge
and hearing his daughter weep in the back seat because of the
treatment her dad got from the Boston fans.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Williams needs no reminders. He went through
pennant-race hell as a major league manager in 1987 and no doubt
the scars are deep.
</P>
<P>
   This is the way it is for Red Sox fans. This is why they worry
as the games dwindle to a precious few. Fourteen to play, starting
tonight, against the Yankees. Again.

ACCOUNTANTS CALL   FOR ACTION OVER   STUDIO BOOKKEEPING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hollywood executives face a nightmare soon from
something far more frightening than Freddie Krueger _ the nation's
accountants.
</P>
<P>
   Proposed changes in how movie studios report the finances of
their blockbusters and bombs are causing as much consternation as
the prospect of $25 million star salaries. One analyst has
estimated studios will have to take a collective hit topping $2
billion if the rules are altered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proposals are being contested rather heatedly,'' said
Steven Cesinger, an investment banker with Greif &AMP; Co. ``They have
not been well-received.''
</P>
<P>
   The Financial Accounting Standards Board of the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants will meet Friday in
Norwalk, Conn., to discuss staff proposals to change FASB Statement
53, which concerns rules covering how Hollywood reports movie
results.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, studios have considerable latitude in how they report
earnings, making it legal to pretty up results by declaring most
film revenues up front while holding off on disclosing expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's currently some diversity in practice,'' said Dan Noll,
a technical manager for the AICPA who helped write the proposals.
``That means investors and analysts can't adequately compare one
movie company to another.''
</P>
<P>
   Noll stresses AICPA and FASB aren't trying to bury Hollywood.
``This started because analysts, preparers and accountants were
asking for more guidance and we're trying to be responsive to their
cries for help,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   FASB 53 hasn't been changed since 1981. Frank Scheuerell, FASB's
project manager, said, ``At the time, there were mainly two markets
_ theaters and free TV _ so it doesn't have the specific details
for home video, pay TV and cable.''
</P>
<P>
   How is it that Hollywood is able to operate under such oddball
rules in the first place? Cesinger points out that the accounting
practices reflect the essentially speculative nature of the
business of making films.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big issue with movies is that you're dealing with
intangible assets and how you exploit those over time,'' he said.
``That gives you huge latitude over how you report. So the film
industry is definitely an animal unto itself that requires
different rules.''
</P>
<P>
   If the board agrees the rules need to be changed, it would then
open a 90-day public comment period next month, followed by a final
review next year and implementation as early as the year 2000.
Proposals would allow studios no longer to mask losses through
tactics such as deducting marketing costs over several years while
booking projected TV revenues up front.
</P>
<P>
   The rules would also halve the period over which costs must be
written off from 20 years and bar profits from promotional
merchandise in revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're proposing will make the balance sheet tighter,''
said Scheuerell. ``If it's an unprofitable movie, you'll be able to
tell a lot faster.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles-area resident Steven D. Sills, an auditor-attorney
specializing in studio contracts, says the changes reflect the need
for studio accounting to better match costs of doing business with
revenue streams. ``Ten years is still a pretty long time but it
does make Judgment Day come a lot faster,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Studios have not commented much officially _ ``We prefer not to
comment'' was a Walt Disney Co. spokesman's response _ but
executives have claimed the new rules will lead to incorrect
presumptions about movie successes and failures.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the proposed restrictions could force publicly
traded Hollywood companies to take a one-time charge of more than
$2 billion, according to analyst David Londoner of Schroder &AMP; Co.,
who helped write the proposed rules.

`HAIR-SPLITTING'

 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The two Democratic leaders of Congress sharply
admonished the White House Monday to stop trying to make legal
justifications for President Clinton's misleading testimony about
his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. But buoyed by polls showing
the nation still reluctant to embark on impeachment, they also
called for quick decisions to resolve the nation's constitutional
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The similar statements by House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt
and Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle positioned them squarely in
synch with the perceived public mood. Their remarks were designed,
aides said, to head off any Republican efforts to have protracted
impeachment hearings lasting well into next year.
</P>
<P>
   But while Republicans pledged to move in timely fashion, they
appeared to be looking at precisely the kind of broad-reaching and
time-consuming inquiry that Democrats want to avoid. Rep. Henry
Hyde, R-Ill., the Judiciary Committee chairman and therefore the
person who oversees the impeachment process, said he would not rule
out expanding any inquiry beyond the president's affair with Ms.
Lewinsky and efforts to cover it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is certainly a possibility,'' he said, explaining that
Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth Starr could still send
Congress information on other matters he has investigated and that
``we would be duty bound to consider whatever he sends us.'' He
also did not rule out an extensive inquiry even if Starr did not
make another report, called a referral. ``It's possible,'' said
Hyde.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said that he did not believe
the House would be able to do anything more than vote on whether to
open an impeachment inquiry before Congress recesses in early
October for the November elections. He said of a full-fledged
impeachment process: ``How you get that done before Christmas would
be a miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   The positioning in Congress came as members of the House and
Senate returned to Washington after a weekend of sampling
constituent opinion to the flood of sordid details about Clinton's
relationship with a White House intern. Sentiment varied from
district to district, with Republicans generally seeking punishment
of Clinton but Democrats saying both impeachment and resignation
are too harsh, and finding conflicting feelings from a nation that
wants Clinton rebuked but fears the trauma of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for a way to salvage the situation for the White House,
both Gephardt and Daschle _ in their first reactions since Starr's
report was made public on Friday _ warned Clinton against the kind
of defense his lawyers put forth on weekend talk shows when they
continued to argue that he had not lied in legal proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly agree with those who have grown impatient with
hair-splitting over legal technicalities,'' Daschle said. ``There
is a basic understanding of the truthfulness that the president
failed to meet.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``The president and his advisers must accept that
continued legal jousting serves no constructive purpose. It simply
stands in the way of what we need to do: move forward and let
common sense guide us in doing what is best for the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt said, ``The considered judgment of the American people
is not going to rise or fall on the fine distinctions of a legal
argument but on straight talk and the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's legal team has consistently argued that Clinton did
not commit perjury in his appearance before a grand jury on Aug. 17
and in an earlier deposition in a sexual misconduct lawsuit brought
by Paula Jones. Perjury, however, was one of the offense cited by
Starr as possible cause for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   By day's end, White House spokesman Jim Kennedy said, ``The
president has made it clear that he does not want the work of his
lawyers to get in the way of his admission that he had an improper
relationship and he misled people to keep it private. No legalisms
should obscure the fact that it was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Daschle also opened the door to censure of the president,
mentioning the possibility of ``other means to address the
president's conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gephardt did not. And several key Republicans _ including
Lott _ showed resistance to such a route for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our responsibility under the law and under the Constitution is
to examine whether there's sufficient basis for an impeachment
inquiry,'' said Rep. W. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., who is on the
Judiciary Committee. ``It would be premature to look at censure.''
</P>
<P>
   With members of the Judiciary Committee poring through the 17
boxes of backup materials Starr sent along with his report,
Republicans said they were considering making public more of the
materials within the next few days, including Clinton's testimony
to the grand jury. That would answer any questions about whether
Starr quoted the president out of context in his report.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to a grand jury though closed circuit television,
Clinton testified about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky and
defended his statements that and he and Ms. Lewinsky did not have a
sexual relationship in a deposition in the sexual harrassment case
brought by Mrs. Jones.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans also put off, for now, any further votes on the
procedures to be followed by the Judiciary Committee, in an effort
to avoid a bruising partisan confrontation until it can no longer
be avoided.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and Democrats are battling over issues crucial to
the course of an investigation, such as subpoena powers and the
authority to take depositions, grant immunity for witnesses and
cite witnesses for contempt. ``I expect some contentious issues to
surface, and some decibels to be raised,'' Hyde said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As the deliberations went on, the rank-and-file in Congress
seemed divided along party lines about what course their
constituents wanted them to take, with some just uncertain what
they should do next.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., who is on the Judiciary Committee,
said, ``People are saying you want to impeach the president over a
private sexual affair,'' Nadler said. ``They think it's a vendetta.
They are very angry at Starr for putting this salacious material
out.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Denny Hastert, R-Ill., said he went out of his way to
visit a county fair over the weekend and that 95 percent of the
people who walked up and talked with him argued for impeachment or
resignation. ``They were saying kick the guy out,'' Hastert said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Michael Forbes, R-N.Y., who represents a Long Island
district that can swing in its party allegiance, said, ``There's a
lot of frustration among people who believed in Bill Clinton. But
people are truly in a quandary. They're not saying, 'Go impeach
him.' But they're also not saying, `Don't impeach him.' The biggest
question they're asking me is, 'What are you going to do?' ''

 &HT;    FBI hope trash will lead to fugitive
 &HT;    By Kathy Scruggs
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANDREWS, N.C. _ Federal officials say they have ``additional
evidence'' possibly linking Birmingham bombing suspect Eric Robert
Rudolph to a series of Atlanta explosions. But they declined to say
what the evidence was.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI's Woody Enderson, inspector in charge of the Southeast
Bomb Task Force, stopped short of calling Rudolph a suspect in the
Atlanta cases.
</P>
<P>
   During a news conference, Enderson was pressed on why federal
law enforcement officers haven't named Rudolph a suspect or charged
him with the July 1996 deadly pipe-bomb explosion in Centennial
Olympic Park, the January 1997 double blast at a Sandy Springs
abortion clinic or a February 1997 bomb at an Atlanta gay
nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a (U.S.) Department of Justice decision,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Agents have said they want to question Rudolph in those bombings
and that they are in no hurry to charge him in the Atlanta cases,
because they have a warrant for him in the Jan. 29 bombing in
Birmingham that killed an off-duty police officer and maimed a
nurse.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Monday if they had tied Rudolph to the Atlanta crimes,
Enderson said, ``We've developed additional evidence'' since
January.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph's truck was seen leaving the area of the Birmingham
bombing, and the fugitive disappeared Jan. 30 into the western
North Carolina mountains. Sales receipts showed he had six months'
worth of food, including BI-LO California raisins, BI-LO Harvest
Choice Cut Green Beans, BI-LO Old Fashioned Oatmeal, Planters
Peanuts and Star Kist Tuna.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's news conference was called to display those items for
bear hunters, in the hope their dogs will unearth the remains and
wrappers when bear season begins Oct. 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``To us, these items and their packaging represent evidence,''
Enderson said. ``But to Eric Rudolph, most of this is now nothing
but trash.''
</P>
<P>
   Agents found trash in July after Rudolph came out of the woods
to get six more months of food, NOW and Nature's Plus minerals and
vitamins, supplies and a truck from George Nordmann, a 71-year-old
Andrews health food store owner. Nordmann was away when the truck
was taken.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time Monday, Enderson said Rudolph was ``given''
some of those items ``in an encounter with a local witness.''
</P>
<P>
   Nordmann has not been charged with aiding Rudolph.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph also has a brown paper bag the texture of a dog food bag
and Cayenne pepper that could be used to try to disguise his scent
from bloodhounds, Enderson said.

LOS ANGELES:   the proposed rules. 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Londoner has projected write-offs will include $400 million at
Viacom Inc., parent of Paramount; $375 million at News Corp.,
parent of 20th Century Fox; and $475 million at Time Warner, parent
of Warner Bros.
</P>
<P>
   The changes, Scheuerell says, are aimed at preventing unfair
interpretations of the rules such as those that occurred at Cannon
Films and Orion Pictures in the late 1980s. Sills, who co-wrote
``Movie Making: Understanding Hollywood's (Creative) Accounting
Practices,'' points to Cannon as the prime abuser of FASB 53.
</P>
<P>
   Cannon, an action-film specialist, overestimated revenues and
slowed down amortization of production costs, leading to an
artificially high stock price. Cannon ran afoul with the Securities
and Exchange Commission, agreed to change accounting methods, saw
profits become huge losses and closed up shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``The changes may be about 10 years too late,'' said Sills.
``Major studios are part of conglomerates more interested in cash
flow than manipulating profits.''
</P>
<P>
   David Davis, a vice president at investment banker Houlihan
Lokey Howard &AMP; Zukin, notes that since studio parents will all take
the hit at the same time, the long-term impact may not be
particularly severe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the majors are already using very conservative
methods,'' he said. He added it makes sense for FASB to institute
new rules so that investors can better understand the values of the
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important to have companies on an even footing,'' said
Davis, noting that one difference in current accounting practices
is that smaller studios often spread marketing costs over a
seven-year schedule rather than as the money is spent. ``It makes
sense to clarify and eliminate confusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Cesinger notes that final rules may be significantly different
than proposed. ``Ideally, the FASB wants to set out something that
everyone agrees to,'' he said. ``They don't like controversy. They
want something that's implementable.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood already has a notorious reputation for murky
accounting practices for profit participation, although the new
FASB rules won't cover that area. In the most famous case, filed a
decade ago by humorist Art Buchwald, Paramount declared that the
Eddie Murphy feature ``Coming to America'' didn't show a net profit
even though it generated over $340 million at the box officer
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   A judge found Paramount had used ``unconscionable'' accounting
practices to deny the humorist and producer Alain Bernheim their
share of profits. Paramount appealed and the case was settled in
1995 and that led to further suits over concealed profits.
Screenwriter Ron Shelton won $9.8 million last year over the
profits from the 1992 hit ``White Men Can't Jump.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood's reputation received another black eye a month ago
when the SEC fined Sony $1 million for misleading investors on the
value of its movie studios prior to a $2.7 billion write-off. The
fine was equal to the highest ever in a securities case that did
not involve fraud; the SEC also ordered, in the first such move in
its history, that auditors examine details of Sony's 1994 annual
report.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, books like ``Movie Money'' represent a further
assault on studio power by disclosing Hollywood's methods in
limiting net profits for actors who sign profit-participation
deals. Under it, studios can subtract a wide range of questionable
expenses from revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Will all this mean reduced power for studios? Sills doesn't
think so, saying, ``The reality is that the studios still write the
contract.'' &QL;

SPOOKED BY GHOST STORIES FROM '78 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ What makes them the Red Sox is their insistence that
the past has nothing to do with the present, followed by
performances that appear infinitely predestined.
</P>
<P>
   And so they came to Yankee Stadium Monday night, losers of 8 of
10, a woeful 3-8 in September, looking at their onetime wild card
lead of nine games (on Aug. 27) shriveled to three with 15 to play.
</P>
<P>
   There were ghosts in the eyes of those who were here 20 years
ago, the older men who wore the Red Sox uniform for the collapse
against which all others are measured.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Eckersley today is a 43-year-old middle reliever who won
20 games for the 1978 Red Sox. Jim Rice is a 45-year-old batting
coach who had his MVP season for the '78 Sox. Sox broadcaster Jerry
Remy, 45, was an All-Star second baseman for the '78 Sox and hit
the ninth-inning playoff single that somehow found its way into the
glove of a sun-blinded Lou Piniella.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yes, and then there is Don Zimmer. The inimitable Zim,
target of Bill Lee and his bleacher minions in '78, today is a
bench coach with the muscle-flexing New York Yankees. Twenty years
ago, Zim steered the pro sports equivalent of the Exxon Valdez,
running it aground and unleashing a toxic spill from which New
England has never recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Before Monday night's Red Sox-Yankees joust at The House That
Ruth Built, the ghosts of '78 were asked about flashbacks and the
panic mentality that has taken hold of Greater Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand,'' said Eckersley. ``It's the nature of the
tradition. That's profound, huh? Actually, I don't remember '78
that well. I know we won the last eight in a row and 14 of our last
16 to tie. I remember winning a big game here in September. It was
a big game just like this is a big game tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer said, ``Because of the way things have happened there
over the years, I can understand how people are feeling.
Personally, I'm rooting for the Red Sox and the Cubs _ two teams
that fired me. But as a manager you just have to make sure you keep
your club playing hard. Boston's still got the best of it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a stretch to compare '98 to '78. Twenty years ago, the Red
Sox were one of the dominant teams in baseball, an All-Star cast of
home run thunder. They roared to a 62-28 record and led the
defending champion Yankees by 14 games on July 20. Then came the
free fall, lowlighted by the Boston Massacre, and a humiliating
stretch of sloppy baseball that put them 3 1/2 games behind the
hated Yanks.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Boston rallied to win its last eight games and force
a playoff, but no one remembers the '78 Sox as a clutch bunch. They
are etched in hardball history as the Manila Folders _ a team that
won 99 games but is remembered only for blowing a big lead, then
losing the one-game playoff because of Bucky Dent's homer.
</P>
<P>
   Remy stood in the clubhouse Monday night, chatting with Rice,
another soldier in the war of '78.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nah, we hardly get asked about '78 at all,'' Remy said
sarcastically. ``Just every time the Sox lose five in a row.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice rolled his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Even the veteran writers had flashbacks. New York Times baseball
sage Murray Chass, who covered the Yanks for the Globe in '78 (the
Times was on strike), said, ``They'e doing a pretty good imitation
of that year.''
</P>
<P>
   Could it happen again? Sox fans are trained to fear the worst, a
trait that's become painfully obvious to Boston manager Jimy
Williams. After Sunday's loss Williams answered a pessimistic
question with, ``Only in Boston ...''
</P>
<P>
   Only in Boston? What about Toronto in 1987, when Williams's Blue
Jays led the Tigers by 4 1/2 games with a week to play, then saw it
dissolve in a hail or close losses to Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't the first time I've been through this,'' said
Williams, citing his days as a coach with the Braves and some minor
league pennant races. ``It's the nature of the game. You never get
too high or too low.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams believes the negativity is media-driven. He chuckled
and said, ``I've got tinted windows in my car. And I turn the sound
way up.''
</P>
<P>
   Kidding some more, he said, ``Do they have talk shows in
Boston?'' Then he said he might make a call to the other clubhouse
and invite Zimmer to come visit.
</P>
<P>
   Zim would be able to tell him some stories _ such as the time he
got booed carrying the lineup card to home plate for the Fenway
opener, six months after winning 99 games and finishing tied for
first. Zim could tell Jim about driving home over the Tobin Bridge
and hearing his daughter weep in the back seat because of the
treatment her dad got from the Boston fans.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Williams needs no reminders. He went through
pennant-race hell as a major league manager in 1987 and no doubt
the scars are deep.
</P>
<P>
   This is the way it is for Red Sox fans. This is why they worry
as the games dwindle to a precious few. Fourteen to play, starting
tonight, against the Yankees. Again.

GINGRICH TO PAY ALL OF FINE WITHOUT DOLE LOAN
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Speaker Newt Gingrich said Monday that he did not
need to borrow any money from former Sen. Bob Dole after all to
help pay the fine levied on him last year by the House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker's office offered no explanation for why Gingrich
would not take Dole up on his offer, extended soon after the fine
had been imposed, but one Republican suggested that Gingrich had
earned more money from sales of his book this year than he had
expected.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, who was fined and reprimanded by the House in January
1997 for misleading the House ethics committee about his use of
tax-exempt groups for political purposes, has already paid $100,000
of the $300,000 penalty. The House panel, formally the Committee on
Standards of Official Conduct, said Monday that he would pay the
rest in two installments, one in November and one in January, and
confirmed that Dole was now released from restrictions, to which he
had agreed, against speaking to Gingrich on behalf of clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was glad to do it,'' Dole was quoted by a spokesman as
saying of his offer. ``That's what friends are for.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole, who had joined the Washington law firm of Verner Liipfert
Bernhard McPherson &AMP; Hand after losing the 1996 presidential
election, initially offered to lend Gingrich the entire $300,000.
But that early arrangement raised questions of a sweetheart deal:
The accord did not require Gingrich to begin repaying Dole until
2005, by which time Gingrich might well have left Congress, and
critics, including the public-interest lobby Common Cause,
suggested that Dole was trying to buy influence for his firm, which
represented tobacco interests among other powerful groups.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was renegotiated. Under the new arrangement, the
amount that Dole could lend was scaled back to no more than
$150,000. He proclaimed his intention not to register as a lobbyist
during the life of the loan and promised that if he did, the loan
would be transferred to a commercial lender. He also promised not
to ``directly or indirectly contact Speaker Gingrich on behalf of
any clients.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich initially anticipated using revenue from the book,
``Lessons Learned the Hard Way,'' along with his house in Marietta,
Ga., to secure the loan from Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Yet ``Lessons Learned the Hard Way'' was never expected to
generate the kind of revenue earned by his first book, ``To Renew
America,'' and, sure enough, had to be heavily discounted.
HarperCollins, the publisher of both books, printed only 150,000
copies of ``Lessons Learned,'' in contrast to its run of 450,000
copies of ``To Renew America,'' published in 1995 at the dawn of
the Gingrich-led Republican revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``To Renew America'' earned Gingrich $1.2 million in royalties
that first year and was on The New York Times best-seller list for
12 weeks, compared with one week for ``Lessons Learned.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, publishing officials said Gingrich had aggressively
promoted ``Lessons Learned,'' with two dozen autograph sessions,
and the book is still moving. HarperCollins, however, would not
disclose sales figures.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When it came to the grand finales of this year's U.S.
Open, anticlimactic was the word _ for all but two players, that
is.
</P>
<P>
   For Patrick Rafter of Australia and the homegrown heroine
Lindsay Davenport, whose 1998 Open titles not only conveyed
million-dollar benefits but also conjured the distinct prospect of
gaining No. 1 rankings, the Open was a passport to self-respect. By
defending his title, Rafter proved that he was not, as John McEnroe
had fretted this June, going to fall into the trap of whiling away
the rest of his tennis life as a one-Grand-Slam wonder. By winning
her first Grand Slam title, Davenport proved to herself, and to the
legion of skeptics who questioned her passion for competition, that
hers is a major talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't a gem to start with; it just took some polishing by a
lot of patient people, me included,'' the 22-year-old Davenport
said after dethroning Martina Hingis in the women's final, which
again took a back seat to football in the minds of CBS and was
sandwiched between the men's semifinals on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Open was finally over, despite the dubious
entertainment value of the first all-Australian men's final in 28
years, history had not been made.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Rafter's diligence in his semifinal against the
four-time champion Pete Sampras, Roy Emerson's dozen Grand Slam
crowns still stand alone as the career benchmark. Sampras, whose
Wimbledon title this year brought his own collection to 11, went
home wounded in spirit and quadriceps. He refused to answer a query
about when, or whether, he would stay healthy and hungry long
enough at a Grand Slam event to match Emerson's record, or perhaps
eclipse it.
</P>
<P>
   Like the top-ranked Sampras, the top-ranked Hingis went away
mad: not even a generous runner-up check for $400,000 could assuage
her disgust at leaving the Open without becoming, at 17, the
youngest champion to mount a successful defense. Also like Sampras,
Hingis' inability to grab a title here at the year's final Grand
Slam event had a doubly depressing significance: it left her with
only a single Grand Slam championship to remember 1998 by, and left
her in imminent danger of losing her No. 1 ranking to the player
who defeated her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice to get a final again,'' said Hingis, who settled
for semifinal finishes at the French Open and Wimbledon, ``but it's
always a better feeling to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Venus Williams, after falling a round short of reprising her
surge to the final in her controversial Open debut last year, vowed
to purchase a coffin and bury the red, white and blue tennis outfit
she would not be unveiling in the final round. Not one to defer to
her rivals, Williams, whose tennis philosophy has evolved along the
lines of bigger is better, found herself in the uncomfortable
position of having to admit that the Davenport who gave her a
straight-set semifinal tuning is bigger and better than her.
</P>
<P>
   Better late than never for Davenport, said Williams, who also
warned that 22 is perilously close to over the hill in women's
tennis. But the birth certificates of the eight different players
who surfaced as 1998 Grand Slam champions defied that teen-age
logic: the four female champions ranged from Hingis at 17 to
Wimbledon's queen for a day, Jana Novotna, at 29. And on the men's
side, the winners ranged from 22-year-old Carlos Moya at the French
Open to 29-year-old Petr Korda at the Australian.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's starting to happen more and more,'' said Rafter,
25, of the trend toward Grand Slam-sharing instead of the Grand
Slam-hoarding represented by Hingis' three 1997 titles. ``The most
amazing thing is that it happened on the women's side. The men's
side is no big shock, but it's starting to become a bit more
competitive on the women's side as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's what prompted Sampras to rethink his strategy for
the Grand Slam he has never won, Roland Garros, where he may have a
chance next year to break Emerson's record _ if he can tie it first
at the 1999 Australian Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to enter the ladies' event next year,'' Sampras
said. ``Maybe I'll get lucky and win that.'' According to sages
like Emerson, Rod Laver and Don Budge, Sampras needs a French Open
crown on his resume. The alternative, they have said, would be
anticlimactic.

THE PARTY'S NOT OVER, BY A LONG SHOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is probably the best time to send out the first national
sports memo. It could be faxed to the country. It could be sent via
overnight mail. It could be e-mailed. We could even call up a Starr
investigator, have him prepare a special report, and reveal the
details in newspapers. But no matter how we sent our baseball memo,
the message in all subject headings would be the same: You can't
determine when historic parties are supposed to stop; they fade
themselves out.
</P>
<P>
   We all should have known better, right?
</P>
<P>
   Only a week ago, Mark McGwire was being called the king of home
runs. The Cardinals first baseman flicked aside previously magical
numbers by Hack Wilson, Babe Ruth, and Roger Maris. He appeared on
the front pages of nearly every paper in the country. Television
programming was rearranged and interrupted to watch him scale
Maris's magical 61-homer mountain (Maris's family was at Busch
Stadium to watch). Bud Selig, baseball's commissioner, was in St.
Louis when McGwire made history. And when the slugger hit No. 62
last Tuesday, the Hall of Fame came looking for his bat and jersey.
All angles were covered. All except the Sammy Sosa angle.
</P>
<P>
   People in Chicago celebrated when Sosa, the Cubs right fielder,
hit his 61st and 62d home runs of the season Sunday. But the nation
did not pause and throw a party. The nation had already
(itals)stopped(unitals) the party, having given all the verbal
gifts to McGwire. Selig? He was nowhere near Wrigley Field. And a
media crew that once numbered 700 had shrunk to its normal size. So
Sosa was not the sports story of the day, instead blending in with
an NFL Sunday, the US Open, and baseball's playoff pushes.
</P>
<P>
   I say again: We should have known better. Baseball players
always recite cliches, saying that the long season should be played
day by day by day. Maybe everyone got tired of the boring remarks,
because not many people listened during McGwire Week. In a season
when McGwire and Sosa have gone on home run binges, why anoint
McGwire as a history-maker when there was plenty of baseball to be
played? Now he is bothered by back spasms, while Sosa seems to be
getting hot again. Sixty-one has lost its aura. The new standard
will be near 70. And it could be held by Sosa. Or McGwire. Or both.
We won't know until the end of this month. Until such time, both
men should be seen as Co-Home Run Kings. In Waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Monday morning, the phones were buzzing in the Globe's sports
department. Several angry callers wanted to know why McGwire got
pages to himself as well as his own special section while Sosa got
a comparative slap on the back. Many said that what they perceived
to be a slight was racist and that they were canceling their
subscriptions.
</P>
<P>
   I don't agree with them, but I don't blame them. I also do not
think their rage is overblown, nor reactionary, nor foolish. There
is a strong element that doesn't want a dark-skinned man to set the
home run record. Anyone who doesn't believe that should step
outside and smell the fumes of America. And a legitimate argument
can certainly be made that one man got more publicity than the
other even though they accomplished the same thing. But I also
believe that if the order were reversed _ if Sosa had hit 62 first
_ Sosa would have received all the attention that McGwire got,
while McGwire would have been the secondary newsmaker.
</P>
<P>
   While in Pittsburgh, Sosa was asked about a national poll. It
indicated that most Americans wanted McGwire to set the sacred
record, not him. He was asked if he thought the fact that he is a
black man from the Dominican Republic had anything to do with it.
He said no. He said he expects Americans to root for McGwire
because McGwire is American. Good analysis.
</P>
<P>
   The rush to crown an all-time home run champion is truly a
modern American tale. Which is to say that the hype of the moment
came to a crescendo and erased reason. Judgment, too. We all
approached the story wrong, didn't we? This year, the person
reaching 60 or 61 or 62 (itals)first(unitals) was irrelevant. It
was definitely worth the coverage it received, since the record
stood for 37 years. But no one should have been talking about the
mark and asking, as I heard some people asking, how long the mark
would stand. (itals)How long will it stand?(unitals) Well, try five
days. And when someone hits 63, that may not stand for 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The point is that many of us have missed the beauty of the
history we are now witnessing. The current record that is being set
and reset has very little to do with the one Maris set in 1961,
save for the number: 61. That's what makes this home run race so
intriguing. In the end, Maris did not have someone chasing down the
record with him. Maybe his hair wouldn't have fallen out and he
wouldn't have become sullen if he had ESPN, endorsement
opportunities, and a microphone pointing in his direction into
which he says, ``I'm going to Disney World.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a season-long pursuit. We do not know what the number to
beat is; we have to wait. We do not know what number Ken Griffey,
McGwire, and Sosa will be asked about at the beginning of Spring
Training '99; we have to wait. And since both men are having great
seasons in the same league, we even have to wait to say who will be
the National League MVP (I would give it to Sosa).
</P>
<P>
   We should have known better. The party's music never stopped.
People just left early. If Selig was going to be in St. Louis, he
should have been in Chicago, too. Even Bill Clinton took time away
from his very, um, busy office schedule to call McGwire
(itals)and(unitals) Sosa after they hit their 62d. We are watching
the pursuit of a great record. We won't know how great it is and
who is the greatest until the end of the month.

 HOLBROOKE DISCLOSES GIFT OF FREE LODGING 
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON _ Richard Holbrooke, the veteran diplomat whose
nomination as chief U.S. delegate to the United Nations has hit a
snag, has amended his financial-disclosure statements to reflect a
gift worth more than $12,000 in lodgings from a former U.S.
ambassador to Switzerland, Holbrooke's lawyer said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said his initial failure to
list the gift on his disclosure statements to the Office of
Government Ethics did not pose a threat to the nomination of
Holbrooke, the architect of the 1995 peace agreement that ended the
war in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday President Clinton again voiced support for the
nomination. ``I hope, if we can overcome the inertia of Congress,
he will soon be a member of the team again,'' Clinton said in a
speech in New York to an audience that included Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the relationship between Holbrooke and the former
ambassador, the late Larry Lawrence, may prove to be an obstacle to
Holbrooke's nomination to the U.N. post.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, the former ambassador to Germany, lived in the
Washington home of Lawrence and his wife, Shelia, for more than a
year after he returned from Germany in 1994 to take up the post of
assistant secretary of state for European and Canadian affairs. The
Lawrences, who were then in Switzerland, did not charge Holbrooke
rent.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said State Department investigators
were studying the relationship between the two men as part of a
larger, previously disclosed investigation by the State and Justice
departments of Holbrooke's financial-disclosure statements and his
contacts with former State Department colleagues after leaving the
department two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The officials acknowledge that as a result of the
investigations, Holbrooke's nomination will not be considered by
the Senate until at least early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence gained notoriety after his death in 1996 when it was
discovered that he had fabricated a heroic World War II military
record that had, with Holbrooke's support, allowed him to be buried
at Arlington National Cemetery. His remains were exhumed last year
as a result of the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   An adviser to Holbrooke, speaking on condition that he not be
named, said that the investigators may be studying whether
Lawrence, while ambassador to Switzerland, helped Holbrooke obtain
his current job as vice chairman of Credit Suisse First Boston, the
investment banking company controlled by Credit Suisse, the giant
Swiss bank. The adviser said that in fact Lawrence ``had nothing to
do'' with Holbrooke's employment.
</P>
<P>
   At the urging of his lawyer, friends said Monday, Holbrooke has
in recent weeks filed a revised 1996 financial-disclosure statement
to reflect the use of the home as a gift, valued at $1,000 a month.
``Mr. Holbrooke has amended his forms to reflect his stay in the
Lawrence home as a gift,'' said his lawyer, Richard Beattie. ``And
this is no longer a significant issue for the investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The adviser to Holbrooke said that Holbrooke had been careful
throughout his stay in the Lawrence home to reimburse Lawrence for
groceries, telephone calls and a household maid.
</P>
<P>
   ``He even paid the social security for the housekeeper,'' the
adviser said. ``He only used one room of the house. He was very
careful about all of this.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that Holbrooke prepared his disclosure statements in
1996 with the help of an accountant, and that the accountant had
not felt the need to list the use of the house as a gift.
</P>
<P>
   When Beattie reviewed the financial-disclosure statements in
recent weeks in preparation for Holbrooke's confirmation hearings
in the Senate, the adviser said, the lawyer ``respectfully
disagreed'' with the decision not to declare the use of the house
as a gift, and the disclosure statements were amended and filed
with the Office of Government Ethics.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton had intended to demonstrate support for Holbrooke
on Monday in his speech to the Council on Foreign Relations, his
remarks may have done more harm than good.
</P>
<P>
   His remark about ``the inertia of the Congress'' drew an angry
response from Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., chairman of the Foreign
Relations Committee, which would review the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fail to see how inertia in Congress is to blame for keeping
Holbrooke from the U.N. post,'' Helms' spokesman, Mark Thiessen,
said in a statement. ``President Clinton never actually nominated
Holbrooke to the U.N. post, and failed last week to meet a Sept. 10
deadline for getting his paperwork to the Foreign Relations
Committee. The Foreign Relations Committee cannot act on a
nomination that the president has not sent up to us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But then we shouldn't be surprised,'' he said. ``It's par for
the course for this administration to blame all of its troubles on
someone else.''

JUDGE DELAYS, BUT WON'T DISMISS MICROSOFT ANTITRUST CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal judge Monday refused to dismiss the
antitrust case against Microsoft, but agreed to postpone the trial
for three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson narrowed the case
somewhat, throwing out one element of the legal attack brought by
state and federal law enforcement officials against the software
giant. But Jackson, in a 54-page ruling, said that far too many
facts are in dispute for him to rule on the overall case without a
trial.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, generally expected, was greeted with predictable
joy by government lawyers and unhappiness by Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very pleased with the court's decision, and look
forward to the upcoming trial,'' said Justice Department
spokeswoman Gina Talamona.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft spokesman Jim Cullinan said ``While we are
disappointed the court did not grant our entire motion, we are
pleased that the court narrowed the lawsuit somewhat by dismissing
one of the government's claims. ... We believe the facts and the
law are on our side, and look forward to presenting a powerful case
when we go to trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who had originally scheduled the trial to begin Sept.
8, had already agreed to postpone it until Sept. 23 and Monday
acquiesced to a request by lawyers from both sides to further
postpone the trial until Oct. 15. The delay was sought because
neither the government nor Microsoft has finished pre-trial
questioning of witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   At the trial, the attorneys general of the United States, 20
states and the District of Columbia will attempt to prove that
Microsoft has violated national and state antitrust laws with
anti-competitive conduct. The government lawyers allege that
Microsoft has illegally attempted to maintain a monopoly on
computer operating systems and to extend that monopoly into the
market for Internet browsers.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft denies any wrongdoing, and says the government has
mistaken aggressive competition for illegality.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday' ruling, Jackson threw out one claim brought by the
state attorneys general alleging that Microsoft unlawfully used its
operating system monopoly to obtain a competitive advantage in the
browser market. That allegation _ which is technically different
from the government's more serious charge that Microsoft has
attempted to monopolize the browser market _ is based on a
controversial legal theory called ``monopoly leveraging'' that
Jackson said has been discredited.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft sought some solace in Jackson's decision to dismiss
that element of the case, because the company believes it will be
harder for the government to prove that Microsoft attempted to
monopolize the browser market than it would have been to prove that
Microsoft merely attempted to gain a competitive advantage.
Microsoft believes that the government will be unable to prove it
attempted to monopolize the browser market because the Netscape
Communications Corp. maintains a majority share of that market.
</P>
<P>
   But the states minimized the importance of the dismissal of the
monopoly leveraging claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pleased with this,'' said a spokeswoman for New York
Attorney General Dennis Vacco.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also said it was pleased that Jackson appeared to
question one of the government's proposed remedies: that Microsoft
be forced to market a version of Windows 98 that does not include a
browser. The version of Windows 98 now on the market contains both
an operating system and Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser, and
the company contends that the two functions are inextricably
integrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Government lawyers) rely on the declaration of Edward W.
Felten, Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Princeton
University, for the proposition that Web browsing functionality can
be removed from Windows 98 without damaging the underlying
operating system,'' Jackson wrote. ``Whether Dr. Felten's
`mechanism' actually removes the `browser,' or merely removes code
that `look(s) more like a key to opening Internet Explorer than
anything that could plausibly be considered Internet Explorer
itself,' remains to be seen,'' he added, quoting a Microsoft legal
filing.

MEXICAN PRICES FEEL THE SQUEEZE OF WORLD ECONOMIC TROUBLE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By SAM DILLON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The manager of a store selling imported kitchen
utensils says many customers walk out when they see his prices.
</P>
<P>
   Some auto repair shops report that car owners are not retrieving
their repaired vehicles, apparently because as Mexico's economic
difficulties grow, they cannot scrape together the money.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a salesman at a Mexico City Chevrolet dealership says that
he is still selling about 20 new cars a month, the same as usual,
despite soaring interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't feel like we're in crisis here,'' the auto salesman,
Roberto Aviles, said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the peso has lost 18 percent of its value,
interest rates have soared above 40 percent, and many companies on
the Mexico City stock exchange, have lost more than half their
value. But the Mexican economy was growing at such a robust rate
before the financial storm hit that so far, signs that the market
turbulence is contaminating the broad economy remain anecdotal and
mixed.
</P>
<P>
   Figures for August, when the devaluation of the Russian ruble
heightened an investor stampede from emerging markets, will only be
released here next month. Analysts expect to see signs of a
downturn then, but growth was so strong in 1997, at 7 percent, and
during the first half of this year, at 5.4 percent, that many
believe Mexico will still see 4 percent growth or more in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's expecting a slowdown, but we can't see strong,
unequivocal signs yet,'' said Jonathan Heath, an independent
economics consultant here. ``A train that is going 500 miles an
hour doesn't stop instantly.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday the stock market had a good day, with the main index
rising 3.64 percent. The peso traded here late Monday around 10.4
to the dollar, improved over Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in Latin America, Venezuela's main market index rose
1.64 percent. Stocks in Chile were down 1.2 percent. In Argentina,
the benchmark Merval index rose 5.45 percent. Brazilian shares were
stronger still, soaring 7.79 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Global economic troubles hit Mexico early in the year, when
world prices for basic commodities including metals, grain and oil
began to plunge. One Mexican steel company laid off 3,000 workers
in July. And since oil exports make up about a third of its
revenue, the government has cut the 1998 budget three times,
slicing a total of $2.8 billion from an original $58.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The government cuts have hurt hundreds of companies whose
prosperity depends on public contracts, especially heavy
construction companies, said Francisco Caballero, director of the
Center for Economic Studies, which examines 116 manufacturing
sectors.
</P>
<P>
   And since late last month, when the markets plummeted, the peso
accelerated its slide and interest rates began to soar, the
financial turbulence has translated into falling demand in more
areas of business, although most Mexican companies still have not
been affected, Caballero said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Domestic demand is dropping, but the majority of our
industries still haven't felt it yet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two that have felt the turbulence have been the domestic
construction and auto industries, which are particularly sensitive
to interest rate shifts.
</P>
<P>
   With rates above 40 percent, banks have simply stopped extending
mortgages. ``It's a good assumption that housing will be one of the
industries affected in the short run,'' said Gordon Lee, a
construction analyst with Deutsche Bank Securities. But investors
have exaggerated the degree to which the largest builders will be
hurt, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, share prices of Casas Geo, Mexico's largest
builder of residential housing, have fallen 77 percent this year.
Yet there seems to be little reason for such pessimism, since about
85 percent of the company's clients are low-income buyers who
receive government financing that is not pegged to commercial
interest rates, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic auto sales also seem likely to suffer because most, if
not all, of dealers have in recent days canceled generous financing
programs that helped spur a boom this year.
</P>
<P>
   And there are other anecdotal signs of a downturn. Andres
Gonzalez, an analyst with the Spicer division of the auto parts
giant DESC, said that in the last two months, many independent
repair shops had fallen behind in paying parts suppliers because
car owners who delivered vehicles for repair were not picking them
up, apparently suddenly short of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's giving us a lot of problems,'' Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Moreno, a shopkeeper who sells glass kitchenware, much of
it imported, said his store had enjoyed strong sales until the
world financial crisis reached Mexico. With the slide in the peso's
value, most of his prices have sharply risen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now they just look at our prices and go out the door,'' Moreno
said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ With the Starr report very much on the minds and lips
of her seniors at the Bronx High School of Science Monday morning,
Marilyn Reinhardt opened her fourth-period literature class by
scribbling three one-word questions on the blackboard: ``Psycho?
Devil? Victim?''
</P>
<P>
   She then asked her students whether President Clinton's behavior
with Monica Lewinsky, as well as his apparent attempts to cover it
up, was most like that of the mentally unstable Reverend Dimsdale
of ``The Scarlet Letter,'' the unrepentant killer Mersault of
Albert Camus' ``The Stranger'' or Jay Gatsby, whom she
characterized as a victim of the prevailing ethos of the Roaring
Twenties, which she defined as ``get rich quick by any means, but
then no one comes to your funeral.''
</P>
<P>
   From the back of the room, one 17-year-old girl raised her hand.
``I don't think he's any of the three,'' she said. ``He's just a
man. All men cheat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So it's biological destiny,'' Ms. Reinhardt replied, `` `Stand
by Your Man,' as Tammy Wynette said in that song.''
</P>
<P>
   If this had been any other September, Ms. Reinhardt would have
spent the third day of the school year Monday introducing her
students to Wordsworth, Keats and Jane Austen. But after reading
the report by the Whitewater independent counsel, Kenneth Starr,
over the weekend, she _ like so many other teachers across the
country _ concluded that her original lesson plan just could not
compete.
</P>
<P>
   And so, imploring their classes to cast aside any nervous
snickers, teachers at middle schools, high schools _ and even in
the older grades of some elementary schools, based on visits to
more than a dozen schools throughout the metropolitan New York
region Monday _ wove the scandal engulfing the president into their
lesson plans, often as a way to get their students to think about
larger issues like morality or impeachment that might otherwise
have put them to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   The teachers' only dilemma, it seemed, was not whether to
discuss Clinton's troubles, but in how much detail. And even then
there was surprising latitude.
</P>
<P>
   In Kitty Rooney's 12th-grade class at Bishop Loughlin Memorial
High School in Brooklyn, the words ``sex'' and ``sexual
intercourse'' flew around the room, with little giggling. Never
mind that the subject was government and the setting was a Catholic
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the Constitution class can be formulaic and dry,'' Ms.
Rooney said afterward, ``but now the students are very interested.
It's living history.''
</P>
<P>
   As the students struggled to form opinions, many found
themselves as conflicted as their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Bascio, a social studies teacher at Public School 111 in
midtown Manhattan, asked her seventh graders to write a paragraph
about whether the president should be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, because he shouldn't of cheated on his wife,'' one girl
wrote. ``No, because it is his personal business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some,'' the student concluded, ``think he should be punished
in a different way.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For any teacher who brought up currents events Monday, the
challenge was to keep the unvarnished language of the independent
counsel's report from spilling over into class and derailing any
meaningful conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Garvey, a social studies teacher at Intermediate School
195 in Harlem, navigated between the document's seamiest sections
likes a ship's captain steering clear of icebergs.
</P>
<P>
   In his seventh-grade class Monday, he described Monica Lewinsky
only as someone who ``wanted to be the president's girlfriend.'' He
said he was careful not to give his 12- and 13-year-old students
any more knowledge than they absolutely needed, because of the wide
range of their own experiences. Some have not yet reached puberty,
while one 12-year-old girl already has had a baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a sex education teacher,'' he said. ``I'm not about to
test the limits of what is allowed in the classroom.''
</P>
<P>
   In the social studies department office at Bronx Science Monday,
the talk among teachers between periods was of how far they should
go once behind the classroom door.
</P>
<P>
   Irene Blair, who teaches government and American history, said
that questions concerning the legalities of impeachment process
would be fair game in her class but that she would swat down any
questions that bumped up against ``sexual matters.'' She intended
to direct students to ``refer it to your families.''
</P>
<P>
   But as he prepared for his fifth-period American history class,
one in which he had decided to scratch his planned lecture on
post-Civil War reconstruction, Jim Uldrych said that he intended to
put no brakes on the discussion of Starr's findings among his
seniors. ``At a certain point, you gotta discuss that, too,'' he
said, speaking of some of the president's most lewd behavior. ``You
can't run from it.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, it was his students who reined in the
discussion to keep it G-rated.
</P>
<P>
   In response to Uldrych's initial question asking for general
reaction to the report, one girl in the front row scrunched her
face in disgust.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes way too far,'' she said. ``It's like a porn novel.
It's not necessary to the investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not interested in what went on,'' she added, ``and I'm
certainly not interested in what I know now.''
</P>
<P>
   The students in Eric Plak's third grade class at Public School
192 in West Harlem never raised the names Lewinsky and Clinton. But
that's not to say they were oblivious to the names of another
couple joined in the headlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're more interested in McGwire and Sammy Sosa,'' Plaks
said, invoking the hallowed names of the combatants in baseball's
record-shattering home run derby. ``They're all on Sammy's side.''
</P>
<P>
   To sate them, Plaks devised a line-up card's worth of word
problems _ all about calculating home runs _ to engage them Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In other schools, the students were eager to talk but found
their teachers were unprepared to.
</P>
<P>
   After school at Hackensack (N.J.) High School Monday afternoon,
four teachers who had gathered in the English and social studies
department office said that they were horrified to learn that their
students were better versed in the report's findings than they.
While several pledged to go home and study it, Bette Parslow would
have none of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my students I did not want to read it,'' said Ms.
Parslow, who teaches U.S. history. ``I know the gist of what it is
going to say. I'm a grownup. I know what goes on. I just don't need
to wallow in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Conflicted over what exactly to say to her students, Ms. Parslow
thought she might relate her own disillusionment with Clinton by
likening it to her father's reaction upon learning, years after
Franklin D. Roosevelt's death, that he had had an affair in and
around the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents idolized him,'' she said. ``My father didn't want
to believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, for all the talking they may have done in
schools, some children left far more confused than they had arrived
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the level of knowledge of her 10-year-old son Emil,
who is in the fifth grade at R.J. Bailey School in Greenburgh,
N.Y., Geraldine Wiles said: ``He's got Tara Lipinsky and Monica
Lewinsky's names mixed up.''

 PHONE DEAL IN AFGHANISTAN CATCHES MANY BY SURPRISE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A privately owned telephone company in New Jersey has signed a
$240-million contract to build a cellular telephone system for the
Taliban, the Islamic fundamentalists who control most of
Afghanistan and who the White House says are harboring Osama bin
Laden, the suspected mastermind of the embassy bombings in Nairobi,
Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, last month.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone Systems International of Parsippany, N.J., said that
it would start work in a few weeks and that within two years at
least 1 million telephones would be available in 15 cities in
Afghanistan, which has been so ravaged by two decades of war that
only about 26,000 lines remain from the antiquated telephone system
that the Russians built in Kabul, the capital.
</P>
<P>
   The system will be built using equipment from Motorola, AT&AMP;T,
Nokia and Ericsson, said Gary Breshinsky, who identified himself as
one of three owners of the company. A second owner is Ehsan Bayat,
an Afghani who lives in New York. Breshinsky declined to name the
third owner.
</P>
<P>
   There are no federal restrictions on U.S. companies doing
business with the Taliban, officials at the Commerce, State,
Treasury and Justice departments said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said it was unaware of the deal but looked on it
favorably as a means to ease the tight controls the Taliban have
placed on access to the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that increases the Afghani people's access to
information, ideas and the global economy is a good thing,'' said
David Leavy, the spokesman for the National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Export of advanced technology with potential military
applications requires an export license from the Commerce
Department if the equipment is built by a U.S. company or uses U.S.
technology, a Commerce Department official said.
</P>
<P>
   Breshinsky said no export licenses would be needed for the
cellular system his company would build based on the GSM system
used for cellular phones in most countries outside the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all simple technology,'' said Breshinsky, who said
other companies he owns have built similar systems since 1981 in
Malaysia, China and parts of Africa.
</P>
<P>
   He said the system would give Afghani users direct-dial access
to the rest of the world and access to the Internet. He said the
Taliban were requiring the use of software to block anti-Taliban
Web sites ``and what one of them called smut.''
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban representative in New York, Noorullah Zadran, said
the contract was signed Sept. 2 at the Inter-Continental Hotel in
Kabul.
</P>
<P>
   ``This contract contains an equal-opportunity provision under
which women can work side by side with men for the same pay,''
which showed that the Taliban were not the enemies of women, Zadran
said.
</P>
<P>
   Breshinsky said it took 51 days to negotiate the contract, which
was first disclosed in reports from Kabul on Sept. 2 by Reuters and
The Associated Press. Those reports received so little attention
that on Monday none of the federal officials interviewed said they
had heard of the contract or the company the Taliban hired to build
the system and run it for 20 years.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Telephone Systems International was incorporated in June in
Parsippany, N.J., specifically to build a cellular telephone system
for the Taliban, Breshinsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Breshinsky and Zadran said Motorola would be the main supplier
of equipment. But a spokeswoman for Motorola, Margot Brown, said
the statements by Breshinsky and Zadran about using Motorola
technology ``are not true.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not signed any contracts in Kabul and we have never
heard of a company called Telephone Systems International,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Breshinsky would not say what he had done for a living before
1981 and he declined to identify who would finance the system. He
said that finding paying customers in Afghanistan would not be a
problem, and estimated that 5 million people would want, and be
able to afford, telephones.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the government that doesn't have the money,'' he said.
``The people have money _ the longer they have been free and away
from the Soviets, the more cash they have and walk around with, a
lot more cash than I ever carry.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton has chosen a circle of two or three ministers
to serve as a team of personal spiritual advisers that will meet
and pray with him weekly and help him resist what one of the
ministers calls ``the temptations that have conquered'' the
president in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton phoned the ministers and asked them for their help on
Labor Day evening, as he and the nation were preparing for the
report that Kenneth Starr delivered to Congress two days later
concerning the president's relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The ministers, the White House has confirmed, include two
formidable evangelical preachers: the Rev. Tony Campolo, an
outspoken liberal Baptist from Pennsylvania known for his ministry
to urban youth and for controversial books advocating Christian
acceptance of homosexuality, and the Rev. Gordon MacDonald, senior
pastor of a nondenominational Christian church, Grace Chapel, in
Lexington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Since admitting a month ago that he had had an inappropriate
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, Clinton has been struggling to
persuade the American people that he seriously regrets it and is
taking steps to repent and reform. Both Campolo and MacDonald were
defensive about the possible appearance that Clinton had selected
them as part of political damage control.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are those who will say that Gordon and I are being used
and manipulated,'' Campolo said in a statement. ``Should this be
true, it would not be the first time that Christians have been
taken in. But we would rather be men of faith who believe that God
is working in the life of the president than to join that army of
cynics, many of whom are religious leaders, who cannot accept a
plea for forgiveness at face value.''
</P>
<P>
   By his own account, MacDonald has faced his own sin and sought
redemption. Twelve years ago, while president of a major mission
agency, he admitted to an extramarital affair, resigned his
position and left the ministry. He returned to the ministry after
two years and later wrote a book, ``Rebuilding Your Broken World,''
about his experience.
</P>
<P>
   That book, which the president told MacDonald he had read twice,
is one reason Clinton selected him for spiritual guidance,
MacDonald said in a sermon to his congregation on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Such informal groups of spiritual advisers, sometimes called
``accountability circles,'' are not uncommon among Christian
evangelicals, particularly among leaders of large churches and
organizations. Men _ and it is more often men _ meet regularly with
a small group of peers to pray and provide support for those facing
personal crises. A circle of three men, named by the elders of
Grace Chapel, met with MacDonald weekly after he confessed his
adulterous relationship, and eventually helped restore him to the
ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bring an understanding of what it is like to face the public
scrutiny when one has sinned,'' MacDonald said in his sermon. ``I
have gone through, and continue to go through, the breaking
process. I have known both the remarkable grace of forgiving,
restorative people and the lash of those who choose other options.
I am in a position to talk the language of repentance and what it
takes to find a deeper and more purposeful walk with God in the
midst of a personal tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House did not announce, but has confirmed, the
president's arrangement with the ministers. MacDonald mentioned it
in his most recent Sunday sermon, and Campolo, after consulting
with the White House staff, made available a statement through
Eastern College in St. Davids, Pa., where he is a professor of
sociology. Both have said they will not grant interviews. A third
minister, alluded to in McDonald's sermon, has not publicly
identified himself.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the president seeks pastoral guidance, he is bringing in
new legal and political advisers in anticipation of possible
impeachment hearings.
</P>
<P>
   The White House plans to announce this week the hiring of
several lawyers and advisers to shore up relations with restive
Democrats on Capitol Hill and to devise a new legal strategy as the
investigation of the president moves from the courthouse to the
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Among those expected to be part of the White House defense team
are Gregory Craig, a senior State Department official with
extensive contacts in Congress, and Peter Kadzik, the private
lawyer for John Podesta, White House deputy chief of staff. Several
current and former members of Congress are also being enlisted to
assist in the White House damage-control effort, which will be
directed by Podesta and Lawrence Stein, the White House director of
legislative affairs.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear Monday whether the new advisers would be on the
White House payroll or serve more informally as outside
consultants.
</P>
<P>
   David Kendall, Clinton's lead personal lawyer, has in essence
been demoted and will play a much less central role in formulating
the future response to the impeachment report of Starr, the White
House independent counsel. White House aides expressed deep
disappointment Monday in Kendall's defense of the president in a
press briefing on Friday and in a television appearance on Sunday.
They said that the time for legalistic hairsplitting was past and
that the president's case would now be made by advisers with more
sensitive political antennae.
</P>
<P>
   Also mentioned as possible additions to the White House
damage-control squad are two former aides with experience on
Capitol Hill, Steve Ricchetti and Susan Anne Brophy.
</P>
<P>
   Campolo and MacDonald, the president's new spiritual advisers,
say they are concerned only with his spiritual _ and not political
_ redemption.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be assured,'' Campolo said, ``that we will not offer what the
German martyr Dietrich Bonhoeffer called `cheap grace''; cheap
grace takes sin lightly and does not call for repentance and
change. But neither do we come in a spirit of loveless
condemnation.''
</P>
<P>
   Campolo, a minister with the American Baptist Churches USA,
first met the president in 1993 at a meeting on inner-city poverty.
Several years ago he publicly criticized Rev. Jerry Falwell for
marketing a videotape accusing Clinton of murder and drug-dealing.
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald also became acquainted with the president in 1993,
through friends, and says he has spoken with him about the ways in
which he has estranged many evangelicals.
</P>
<P>
   David Neff, executive editor of Christianity Today, a national
evangelical monthly, said, ``I think both of those men can
challenge the president at points where he might otherwise be a
little easy on himself.''
</P>
<P>
   If spiritual counseling is not sufficient to help the president,
said James Dunn, executive director of the Baptist Joint Committee
for Public Affairs, neither of these men will hesitate to recommend
some type of additional psychological counseling or treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they thought he needed the kind of help that was more than
they could give,'' Dunn said, ``they would be the first to suggest
it.''

<P>
   Spurred by competition from a commercial venture, the National
Human Genome Research Institute said Monday it would move up by two
years, to 2003, its target for completing the sequence of the human
genome.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, one-third of the genome, containing about half of
the genes, will be completed by 2001, said Dr. Francis Collins, the
institute's director.
</P>
<P>
   Sequencing the genome means determining the order of the 3
billion units of DNA that constitute the genetic programming of
human cells. So far, only the genomes of single-celled organisms
like bacteria and yeast have been sequenced, and these typically
contain 1 to 10 million units of DNA.
</P>
<P>
   The project is expected to revolutionize the practice of biology
and medicine. Although understanding the human genome is a task
that will take decades, decoding the full sequence would be a giant
first step. The achievement would, in principle, lead to
molecular-level insights into both the normal operation of the
human organism and of the mechanisms that go wrong in disease.
Medical treatments could be tailored to an individual, based on the
analysis of his genome. The genome also contains a wealth of
information about human evolutionary history and early migration
patterns.
</P>
<P>
   The new target date intensifies a race between two formidable
groups of biologists. Each is convinced that its own approach will
succeed and the other will fail.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of sequencing the human genome was formally embraced in
1990 when the National Institutes of Health began a program to
complete the genome in 15 years at a cost of $3 billion. The 2005
goal was ambitious enough, and the new target date of 2003 is even
more so.
</P>
<P>
   What has spurred NIH, and the consortium of university
sequencing centers it funds, is the surprise entry into the human
genome field of Celera, a commercial company formed by the
scientific instrument-maker Perkin-Elmer and Dr. J. Craig Venter, a
biologist who pioneered the sequencing of bacterial genomes. Venter
said in May that he would start sequencing the human genome next
year and complete it by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   If Venter should finish first, the NIH consortium might have
little to show for its efforts. But his methods and goals have been
attacked by biologists who said his risky approach, even if it
worked, would not produce DNA sequence of the completeness and
accuracy required.
</P>
<P>
   The university biologists have nonetheless now decided to
restate the goals of their program, bringing forward the target
date and planning to attack the gene-rich regions of the genome
first.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Dr. James Watson, co-discoverer of the structure of DNA and a
former director of the NIH's Human Genome Project, said the new
goal could be achieved and that the startup problems had now been
worked out. Besides, he said, 2003 ``is the 50th anniversary of the
discovery of the double helix.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins, his successor as director, said the new plan is to
focus first on the gene-rich regions of DNA. Half of the genes are
located in one-third of the genome, he said, and by 2001 this third
would be completed, along with a rough draft of 90 percent of the
remainder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Celera has promised coverage by 2001 but our product will be
substantially different in character,'' Collins said. He and other
biologists said Venter's project would leave gaps in regions of the
DNA.
</P>
<P>
   Collins also emphasized that the NIH consortium is sticking to
its map-based approach as contrasted with Venter's shotgun method.
In the map approach, the DNA is broken into fragments and the
position of each fragment on the chromosome is first located.
Venter's method is to sequence millions of DNA fragments and piece
them together through their overlaps, without the bother of
creating a map first.
</P>
<P>
   Venter strongly disputes that his genome sequence will be less
complete or less accurate than that of the NIH consortium. He says
his sequence will in fact be far more useful in scientific terms
because it will be based on the complete sequence of three and
maybe five distinct individuals whereas the NIH project will yield
a single sequence with bits and pieces drawn from many different
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   The Celera project will thus bring to light many polymorphisms,
the DNA sites at which a gene has a variant spelling and which are
the genetic basis of the differences between individuals. NIH will
search for these polymorphisms separately.
</P>
<P>
   The NIH project ``is putting humanity in a Waring blender and
coming up with a patchwork quilt,'' Venter said. ``We will have
between 10 and 30 million single nucleotide polymorphisms in our
data base whereas the government will have virtually none from its
sequence.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the Celera project believe that Venter will find it
very difficult to assemble his many different fragments of DNA into
complete chromosomes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bet on the NIH group,'' said Dr. William A. Haseltine,
president of Human Genome Sciences and a former Venter partner.
``The more I have looked at it, the more difficulty I think they
will have in assembling a coherent picture with the shotgun
approach.''

THE MAN WHO WOULD BE (HOME RUN) KING  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL DEDMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Relaxing at home in his 55th-floor condominium before
a game, Sammy Sosa is the same as at the ball park: focused but
funny, exuberant but reserved. He is in a strange country,
conversing in two languages, but his every movement displays a
combination of confidence and humility.
</P>
<P>
   He does not want to talk about his wealth, or his charity, or
even to appear to be restraining the impulse. ``I don't want to get
a big head,'' he says. ``I was raised religious, and I'm scared
what would happen to me if I did that.''
</P>
<P>
   Staying humble just got harder, as Sosa's glorious weekend put
him dead even in the chase for the most glamorous record in sports:
most home runs in a single season. After the record had been all
but conceded to Mark McGwire of St. Louis, Sosa's four home runs in
three days tied him with McGwire. As Sosa's Cubs begin a series
Monday night in San Diego and McGwire's Cardinals played at home
against Pittsburgh, each player had hit 62 home runs in 150 games.
Two weeks remain in the season.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm rooting for Mark McGwire,'' Sosa said last week. ``I look
up to him the way a son does to a father. I look at him, the way he
hits, the way he acts, and I see the person and the player I want
to be. I'm the man in the Dominican Republic. He's the man in the
United States. That's the way it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Sosa grew up without a father in the back of a converted
public hospital in San Pedro de Macoris, a dusty seaside town in
the Dominican Republic. His father, Juan Montero, died when Sosa
was 5. Sosa shared two bedrooms with his mother, four brothers and
two sisters. To help out, he shined shoes for two pesos.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at age 29, Sosa has a four-year, $42.5 million contract.
Besides the condo, he has two other homes and was able to give his
mother, Mireya, a house for Mother's Day. But ask him about his
wealth, and he will find an excuse to leave the room. If prodded to
name the favorite of all his automobiles, he will allow, ``Probably
the Rolls,'' and change the subject.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago last week, Sosa entertained guests before a night
game at Wrigley Field. Wearing Versace jeans instead of Cubs
pinstripes, he offered a glass of white wine and a tour of his
condo _ really four condos combined into one _ in a tower rising
above Navy Pier.
</P>
<P>
   In the den, where the windows reveal Lake Michigan, Sosa's two
agents occupied the sofa, eating shrimp and fielding offers for an
advertising deal in Japan. In the dining room, decorated with a
wraparound view of the Loop skyline, his wife, Sonia, was setting
out the good china for a lunch with friends. Their 5-year-old
daughter, Keisha, was at school, and the three younger children
were finishing their naps. Sammy's brothers were around, back among
the eight bedrooms.
</P>
<P>
   When Babe Ruth hit 60 home runs in 1927, his biographer noted
his boast, ``Sixty, count 'em, 60!'' Now Ruth has been matched, and
bested, by Roger Maris, Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa. Not a braggart
in the bunch.
</P>
<P>
   When he came into the major leagues six years ago, Sosa gained a
reputation as a selfish player, as a flashy underachiever, ``Sammy
So-So.'' His teammates, coaches and friends say he has grown
tremendously, as a baseball player, as a father and as a team
player. ``Sammy is showing a grace that blows my mind,'' said Tom
Reich, who is one of his agents. ``He is so intuitive. He draws
everyone into his loop with his good will and generosity.''
</P>
<P>
   Back home in San Pedro de Macoris, there is a statue of Sosa. In
the winter he visits hospitals to deliver presents to children and
schools to give new computers. They call him ``Sammy Claus.'' Pesos
thrown in his fountain are given to the shoeshine boys of Macoris.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the United States, Reich and his partner, Adam Katz, are
taking their time working through offers for endorsements. They
will let most of the deals wait until the season is over, so as not
to distract Sosa from the task at hand: helping the long-frustrated
Cubs make the playoffs for the first time since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa says he does not mind the greater attention that has been
given to McGwire since the season began back at the end of March.
As to the suggestion that his dark skin color might account for his
lack of acclaim compared with McGwire's, Sosa laughs and says:
``What? Come on, man, it's 1998.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Sosas moved in to their million-dollar home in June from a
smaller one a few blocks away. It appears almost unlived in, with
little of the debris of life scattered about. The only book is a
Spanish-language Bible by a bed. The Sosas' winter home is in Santo
Domingo, the Dominican capital, about 40 miles west of San Pedro de
Macoris on the southern coast of the Caribbean island of
Hispaniola. And they have a stopping-off place in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   A few treasures are on display in the Chicago home: photos of
their children. A plaque from friends in the Dominican Republic
(including the President, Leonel Fernandez) in honor of Sosa's
record-setting 20 home runs in a single month. An award from the
Cubs honoring his community service, the Roberto Clemente award,
named for his hero, whose uniform No. 21 Sosa adopted.
</P>
<P>
   A plaque rests on a cabinet in the living room: ``My house is
small, no mansion for a millionaire. But there is room for love and
there is room for friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Sammy and Sonia met 12 years ago in the Dominican Republic. With
the help of a maid, she takes care of the children: two girls,
Keisha, 5, and Kenia, 3; and two boys, Sammy Jr., nearly 2, and
Michael, almost 1.
</P>
<P>
   On this quiet afternoon, the children woke up just in time for a
family photograph and lunch before batting practice. The children
know Sosa plays baseball, but they have no idea of his fame.
Occasionally, on a replay, they do see the trademark two-fingered
kisses that he blows their way.
</P>
<P>
   ``They see me on TV and say, `Papi! Papi!' he said. ``I am very
proud of them.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The front desk of the Regency Hotel, home of the Park
Avenue power breakfast, is in full-throated warble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello, Mr. Buchwald!''
</P>
<P>
   ``How are you, Mr. Buchwald?''
</P>
<P>
   Art Buchwald, the humor columnist and Washington institution who
last week made the Regency _ and New York _ his official home,
loves the fuss.
</P>
<P>
   ``See?'' he said. ``I told you they take care of me.'' Or, as he
said over breakfast: ``I think if I did it again, I'm not sure, but
I'd marry a concierge.''
</P>
<P>
   This is obviously a story about a famous columnist forever
associated with Washington who surprises everyone and moves to New
York, his childhood home. A lot of it is funny. Buchwald, for
example, addressed the question of what it's like going out with
women when you're 72: ``The definition of dating now is very weird.
If you say you're dating, does that mean you're going to bed with
someone? If it means you're going to the movies with someone, then,
yes, I'm dating.''
</P>
<P>
   This is also a story about a victim of depression who left his
wife of 40 years, Ann, but went back to her as she was dying of
cancer, in 1994. A lot of it is not so funny. ``There are some
mornings when I say I wish I could have a woman who could pack for
me,'' Buchwald said. ``Or a woman who says, `We're going to Bedford
today,' and I say, `Oh, is that where we're going?' When you're not
married, no one tells you where to go. There's no center.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Buchwald is marrying the funny and not-so-funny
in a book-in-progress, ``Stella in Heaven: Almost a Novel,'' about
a dead wife who is running her husband's life from the clouds.
</P>
<P>
   And what is Stella telling Buchwald now?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, there's some discussion about finding another wife,''
Buchwald said. ``The problem is, the ones she selects for me are
not too good, because she doesn't want them to be better than she
is.'' Stella's search committee did find one good prospect,
Buchwald said, but she turned out to be a kleptomaniac. ``They also
selected a motorcycle policewoman for me,'' Buchwald said. ``And
she's pretty nice, except she's got herpes.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchwald joked last week in the Regency's dining room, quiet
after the departure of the dry-toast executive crowd. ``This room
we're sitting in now, this is the power room,'' Buchwald said. ``I
would like some of it to rub off on me.'' Buchwald said the place
reminded him of the Sans Souci, the original Washington power
restaurant, long closed, that was his second home.
</P>
<P>
   Here are his reasons for leaving Washington: ``After a certain
amount of time, there's nothing new. Restaurants are the same,
stores are the same, your buddies are the same. And some of them
disappear on you.'' His close friend Edward Bennett Williams, the
Washington lawyer, has died. Another close friend, Ben Bradlee, the
former editor of The Washington Post, has a family. ``The circle
was getting smaller,'' Buchwald said. ``Maybe it's me, maybe it's
them. But I'm a bachelor.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help that his column, syndicated in 350 newspapers,
was moved off the front of The Washington Post's Style section in
the spring. ``They were very nice about it,'' Buchwald said. ``They
didn't have to be.'' Friends say Buchwald has always known when
it's time to move on. ``I do think one of the purposes of my move
was to keep going,'' Buchwald said. He'll continue his 400-word,
twice-weekly column of political satire from New York, even though
one of the biggest political sex scandals in history is unfolding
in his old home. ``I can sit up here and know as much as people in
Washington,'' Buchwald said, crediting CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Buchwald has good friends here _ Mike Wallace, the ``60
Minutes'' correspondent, and the author William Styron, who lives
in Connecticut. All three men have suffered from depression; Styron
wrote a successful book about his. ``He and I had depressions at
the same time,'' Buchwald said. ``And the only difference is, he
made a million on his, and I didn't make a dime on mine. We argue
about who had the worst depression. He says his was 9.9 on the
Richter scale, and mine was a rainy day at Disneyland.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchwald's childhood was not funny at all. To know that, all you
have to do is read the first paragraph of his 1993 memoir,
``Leaving Home:''
</P>
<P>

I was taken away from my mother. This was done because she was
mentally ill. She suffered from severe chronic depression, which
required that she be committed to a private sanitarium. She never

his childhood in foster homes. He joined the Marines, became a
columnist in Paris, fell in love with Ann, adopted three children,
became a columnist in Washington and won the Pulitzer Prize for
commentary in 1982. In ``Leaving Home,'' he wrote: ``People ask

INDONESIAN DEMONSTRATORS OPPOSE MILITARY'S ROLE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Pressing the government to take important
powers away from the military, nearly 200 students on Monday staged
a sit-in at one of the Indonesian capital's busiest thoroughfares.
</P>
<P>
   In their second week of demonstrations, the protesters called
for an end to the armed forces' role in the nation's political
affairs. The issue has galvanized students from around the country.
</P>
<P>
   In a scene that would have been unimaginable several months ago,
heavily armed soldiers stood by and listened as a group of
university students lashed out at a tenet held sacred by the
military: its dual function, which gives the military legal powers
to take part in politics as well as in defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The involvement of the military in civilian matters has done
nothing but cause damage to the people and is in conflict with
democracy,'' the student group said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The Indonesian military has come under increasing scrutiny since
the resignation in May of former President Suharto, whose absolute
control over the armed forces helped him to maintain power for 32
years.
</P>
<P>
   Emerging evidence of the military's kidnapping and torture of
political dissidents during the Suharto years has outraged the
public. Human rights groups have called for investigations into the
atrocities that they believe claimed thousands of lives.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International announced Monday that it had been invited
last week to meet with the Indonesian government and military in a
gesture not seen in five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We actually do believe that there is an openness here that has
never been here before,'' Kerry Brogan, of Amnesty International,
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   President B.J. Habibie has vowed to review the role of the
military and to investigate the rights abuses alleged to have taken
place under his predecessor and longtime associate, Suharto.

GIANTS: OUTPLAYED ON THE FIELD AND ON THE SIDELINES AS WELL  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS GEORGE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ The Oakland Raiders say the Giants arrived and
expected the Raiders to fall flat on Sunday. After six straight
losses, including this season's opener, the Raiders were a basket
case. And not a good football team.
</P>
<P>
   It was not that simple.
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders are not a Super Bowl-caliber team, but they have
plenty of good players, especially on offense. They certainly have
more speed than the Giants, and in their 20-17 victory, the Oakland
defense outplayed the Giants' strength _ their defense.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Giants have plenty to ponder. Three areas require tough
scrutiny. Finding answers will save the Giants heartburn over their
next 14 games.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE RUNNING GAME &LR;  _ This team is built on the run. It seemingly
has always been that way with this franchise. But when the running
game goes kaput, frequently the Giants do, too. On seven of their
13 possessions on Sunday, they offered three plays and a punt.
There were 23 carries for 71 yards, an average of 3.1 yards a gain.
</P>
<P>
   When Napoleon Kaufman dashed through the middle of the Giants'
defense for a sensational 80-yard touchdown run to open the game,
he reminded the Giants of something they don't have _ pure speed in
the backfield. Tiki Barber gives them something, but he looks
heavier and a step slower this season than last year as a rookie.
Sometimes younger players between their first and second seasons
put on weight thinking they must be bigger to play in the National
Football League. Whether this is the case with Barber, he and none
of the other Giants backs hit the holes with gusto on Sunday. They
were laboring.
</P>
<P>
   This brings us to Tyrone Wheatley, who has not played in the
first two games. He has to get a shot now. In the long run, he
boosts the Giants' rushing game.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THIRD-DOWN PLAYS &LR;  _ The Giants were 1 of 14 on third-down
conversions. They made only three rushing first downs. They gained
more first downs via Raiders penalties (four).
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side, the Raiders converted 8 of 18 third-down
situations and had 5 first downs rushing and 15 more passing. They
kept finding holes in the Giants' defense, especially the
secondary, for big plays on third downs. It was as if the Giants
fell asleep after big sacks that put the Raiders in third-and-long
situations. More attention is required.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; COACHING &LR;  _ The players weren't ready for the Raiders and the
coaching staff wasn't, either. The calls on offense, especially
when the Giants attempted to run wide, were widely anticipated. It
was no accident that on Kaufman's run, the Raiders recognized the
defensive set and exploited it. The Giants gave a strong rush look
and backed off. The Raiders slammed the Giants up the middle before
they could recover.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Fassel, the Giants' head coach, and John Fox, the defensive
coordinator, used to be Raiders coaches. The Raiders attacked both
of them in play-calling as if they knew them well. Obviously, they
did. And the Giants' Fassel and Fox didn't respond adequately.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Raiders' safeties kept cheating toward the line
to offer run support, and all the Giants needed to do to make them
pay was run the ball up the middle, toss it back to the quarterback
and then throw deep. That would have burned the safeties. Also, the
Giants' speediest player, receiver David Patten, didn't touch the
ball enough to stretch the defense. Receiver Amani Toomer could
have provided more answers. And receiver Chris Calloway caught a
20-yard touchdown pass but had only 3 other catches for 23 yards.
Not enough balls were thrown his way.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' defense seemed so concerned with giving up a big
play to the speedy James Jett that it left Tim Brown alone too
often in single coverage. He made a touchdown grab of 22 yards in
man-to-man coverage provided by Conrad Hamilton. In the fourth
quarter, Brown made a 29-yard catch on third-and-8 with Carlton
Gray covering him alone down the sideline. Gray joined the Giants
only last Wednesday. Brown burned the Giants with 6 catches for 127
yards.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, the Giants will do their homework and prepare for
Dallas on Monday night with a rebound in mind. Heads might not
roll. It's early. But attention to these details is essential.

REMEMBERING A LOVED _ AND HATED _ GOVERNOR 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. _ For 65-year-old James Harper, sitting on his
tiny front porch in West Anniston with the day still brand-new, the
news that George Wallace was dead caused him to lower his eyes and
catch his breath for a second, as if some last, dying chorus of
``Dixie'' had lodged in his throat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know,'' he said. ``You here to talk about him? Sit
down. I voted for him. Every time. I liked him standing up there in
that school door, by God,'' he said, referring to Wallace's stand
in the doorway to prevent integration at the University of Alabama
on June 11, 1963.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the federals had to move him,'' said Harper, who is white,
and then he grinned. ``He was a man, by God. He wasn't no boy.''
</P>
<P>
   But when he was asked if he still respected the former governor
after a would-be-assassin's bullet crippled him in 1972, after old
age and history mellowed him and even made him say he was sorry,
Harper seemed not to hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved that man,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To many in Alabama _ the people who hated, feared or loved him _
that frail, apologetic old man who died Sunday night in Montgomery
failed to register in their memories as vividly as the young, fiery
one with slicked-back hair and rigid finger stabbing the air, the
one who promised ``segregation forever.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people said they could forgive him, and would even pray
for him, but many of them said they just wish he could have learned
he was wrong a lot sooner, and led his state out of racial hatred,
instead of into it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody can have my forgiveness if they ask the Lord to
forgive them,'' said 87-year-old John Lilley, making his way slowly
down Birmingham's 20th Street with the help of a cane.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did what he did to stay on the good side of the white
people. He did it to keep his job. But I forgive him.''
</P>
<P>
   He smiled a little when he was asked if the pain-racked,
paralyzed man had found peace in death. ``I don't know if George
Wallace is in heaven,'' said Lilley, walking away. ``The only thing
I know is he's been in hell long enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Young people, whites and blacks, know only the historical
Wallace, and spoke of him the way they would have spoken of a
Confederate statue on the courthouse lawn. But across the state,
people who are old enough to remember a time before his wheelchair
and who heard his voice before it was slurred, talk as if he was
not some distant politician in Montgomery but someone who protected
them, or threatened them. They take him personally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember being at ball games and having my parents come and
get us because they had heard the Klan was coming,'' said Ernestine
Abraham, who grew up in Birmingham in the 1960s. ``He could have
changed that. He had the power, and could have turned that tide. He
didn't,'' said Ms. Abraham, now 44 and an office manager at a
Birmingham bank.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If he had not been hurt, he never would have changed,'' she
said. And by then, it was too late, she said, because too many
people had been hurt in the era of racism that he had prospered in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man in the chair didn't matter,'' she said. ``The young
man who stood in the schoolhouse door mattered.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess,'' she said, ``he didn't have the courage to do it,
then.''
</P>
<P>
   As she talked, the first of the rush-hour traffic was beginning
to creep through downtown Birmingham, past Kelly Ingram Park where
marchers were once torn by police dogs and blown along sidewalks
like leaves by powerful fire hoses.

 BIRMINGHAM, Ala.: fire hoses.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wallace is very personal, here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up here when you couldn't sit here, and you couldn't
eat there, and you had to sit in the last row,'' said Rita
Kendrick, 50, who works for Alabama Power in downtown Birmingham.
``He tried to keep it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   But she believes he was sorry, that it was not just politics
when he begged for forgiveness later in his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have a big heart to forgive him,'' she said. ``I
can, but it's hard.''
</P>
<P>
   But the people who gave him his power, families who always voted
for him and who wept when he lay bleeding on the asphalt of a
Maryland shopping center, loved him then and now.
</P>
<P>
   They loved him when he was unrepentant, because he told them to
stand up and be proud. For many of the people in his power base,
the poor farmers and factory workers who had always lived beneath
the disdain of the aristocrats, his message was stronger than
moonshine.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you'd hear him talk, you knew he was for you and for
Alabama,'' said Gary Heathcock, a 46-year-old steelworker who lives
in Alexandria. ``My daddy always voted for him,'' he said, and once
the family even voted for Wallace's wife, Lurleen. It was really a
vote for George.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them had never been told that they were even good enough
for their place in Southern society, let alone better than anyone,
and now there was this man moving from town to town on the campaign
trail preaching to the crowded auditoriums and county fairs that
they were superior to a whole race of people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drove trucks for 30 years, and I worked in the pipe shop,''
said James Harper of West Anniston. ``Every time I wrote him a
letter, he wrote me back. I worshipped the ground he walked on.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not, said some of his older white supporters, that they
always agreed with him. Sometimes, said 76-year-old Ed Mullinax of
Anniston, ``I had to vote for him because he was the only one
running.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a fairly good fellow who had his faults,'' said
Mullinax, who is white, a retired millwright. ``It was a different
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Blacks voted for him, as early as 1958, because they saw him as
a lesser evil. Cicero Bynum, a retired steelworker from Gadsden,
remembers meeting Wallace during the 1958 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did vote for him in 1958 because I couldn't vote for John
Patterson,'' said Bynum, 69. ``He was more evil than Wallace at
that particular time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We met with him when he was trying to drum up support. They
brought him in the back door of the building so the white folks
wouldn't see him coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace would repay them by claiming he lost because was
``out-niggered'' _ too soft on segregation _ and would vow never to
let it happen again.
</P>
<P>
   But in a way, said Bynum, Wallace's defiance served them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he hadn't made that stand in the schoolhouse door, we
wouldn't have come as far as we've come,'' he said. ``Our problems
wouldn't have been shown around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the country, aging warriors in that struggle for civil
rights graciously spoke of Wallace as a changed man, as a sort of
tragic figure who was swallowed in a whirlwind of his own creation.
Historians said he was the perfect enemy, who gave the people who
believed in change someone to hate.
</P>
<P>
   If that is true, then they needed each other.

   ``All throughout history, if you have an ugly enemy, if your
enemy is cruel and monstrous or you can paint him as a monster,''
the battle over people's conscience can be won, said the Rev.
Joseph Lowery, the past president of the Southern Christian
Leadership Council and one of the Rev. Martin Luther King's chief
aides in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't need to do that. We just had to reveal him,'' he
said. ``He did reveal himself, for that matter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So he will wear that,'' said Lowery. ``Although I'm sure that
there are some people who will remember that like the prodigal son,
he came to himself.''
</P>
<P>
   He points out that Wallace had once been a politician in the
mold of Jim Folsom, the more moderate former governor. And as he
became older and admitted his mistakes, he seemed to try to return
to that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beginning was like the end,'' Lowery said.
</P>
<P>
   Many, especially young people, will remember only the one in the
middle, the demagogue.
</P>
<P>
   Cedrick Rembert, a black junior at the University of Alabama,
knows only that legacy of division. ``I don't hate him,'' he said,
but ``I have never heard anything positive about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Some will not remember him at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't think he's going to have a legacy,'' said
Angela Davis, a black sophomore at the University of South Alabama
in Mobile. ``There are a lot of people on campus who don't even
know who he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Harper knows.
</P>
<P>
   His Wallace never got old, never capitulated. His Wallace was
almost president.
</P>
<P>
   And while Wallace may have apologized for what he did, Harper
will not apologize for the pride he once felt at being part of his
climb, his legend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worshipped the ground he walked on,'' he said.

 &HT;    Maddux injury traced to triceps
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- It's not Greg Maddux's armpit. It's the top of his
right tricep. And it's much better, thank you.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fine. I'll be there,'' Maddux said whan asked if he'll
make his next start.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux came out of Sunday's game after 83 pitches, 30 fewer than
his previous start in Montreal, when he first developed some
soreness where the triceps tapers into the armpit area. He reported
Monday feeling much better than he did after the Montreal game and
expects to be ready for his next scheduled start Friday in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should always be concerned,'' said manager Bobby Cox.
``But where it's located, it's not life-threatening.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddux will under go a week of therapy _ ultrasound,
eletro-stimulation, stretching _ and reiterated his premature
departure from Sunday's game after six innings was nothing more
than precautionary. The fact that he had put together a string of
10 scoreless innings before leaving Sunday's game implies he has
regained his form. Maddux (17-8) is winless in his last four starts
and is 5-6 in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just a thing where it's that time of the year and you
have to think what's in front of us,'' he said. ``You're better
safe than sorry. I know we're fighting to have the best record.''
</P>
<P>
   Rotating the rotation
</P>
<P>
   Cox's pitching plans are about to change by week's end. Kevin
Millwood will move to the bullpen to prepare for the postseason and
the club will look for an opportunity to skip John Smoltz, as the
schedule allows, to give his elbow a break. That will give rookie
left-hander Bruce Chen at least one and probably two more starts
before the regular season ends.
</P>
<P>
   While Smoltz will make his next scheduled start Wednesday and
then wait to see how the final 11 days of the season break down, as
well as how the postseason rotation sets up, before his plans are
set, Millwood becomes a reliever after his start tonight. He has
thrown just two relief innings all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physically, it's not much of a change. You still have to go
out and pitch,'' Millwood said. ``Mentally, it's a little
different. As a starter, you have to think about setting up
hitters. In the bullpen, you go hard all the time and you don't
have to pace yourself at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The case for Norm
</P>
<P>
   After yielding a run in his Braves debut Aug. 12, reliever Norm
Charlton has strung together six scoreless appearances entering
Monday night. His candidacy for the postseason roster is best
stated in his 1.35 ERA, the lowest on the team. If Kerry
Lightenberg, Rudy Seanez and Millwood have October reservations
wrapped up, has Charlton earned one of the remaining three spots?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any idea,'' he said. ``It's up to me and it's not
up to me. It's up to me, based on the way I go out there and pitch.
It's not up to me because it's not my decision.''
</P>
<P>
   With one single and three walks yielded in his last 5 2/3
innings, Charlton has just one strikeout as a Brave but the league
is only hitting .190 against him. This has been his best stretch of
work all season. He never went more than five innings with
Baltimore without yielding a run and had a 6.94 ERA when the
Orioles released him. Charlton still is not satisfied with this
work here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really haven't thrown breaking balls at all,'' he said.
``They've all been situtations where we need to gets guys out and
they're swinging at the first or second pitch and making an out, or
I'm behind 1-0 and I'm not in a situation where I'm going to throw
a breaking ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Crunch time
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Keith Lockhart could not play Monday night
because of continued right hamstring problem. He has started in
just three of 13 games this month and with the postseason set to
begin two weeks from today, there is a growing concern that the
second baseman who started 83 games this year may not be ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not fun,'' Lockhart said. ``It's different from the
shoulder, where you can play with what pain you can tolerate. A
hamstring you really have no control over. That's one where the
body will tell you when you can play.''

 &HT;    Byrd turns into a find for Phillies
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- He has a new job, a new nickname and, best of all, a
future. Yet of all the goodness that has come Paul Byrd's way
recently, the best of all was the bike ride.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 18, Byrd was riding an exercise bicycle in the Phillies'
weight room in Veterans Stadium. Suddenly, he had company on the
bike beside him. A 6-foot-10 left-hander sat down and starting
pedaling. ``Man,'' Randy Johnson asked, ``where have you been?''
</P>
<P>
   The night before, Byrd was on the mound, making his first start
since being waived by Atlanta while at Class AAA Richmond and
claimed by Philadelphia Aug. 14. ``They said, `Go out there and
just enjoy yourself,' '' Bird recalled. ``I wanted to win. It was
the opportunity of a lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   Some opportunity: Paul Byrd, ex-Met, ex-Brave, waived at
Richmond to make room for Norm Charlton, vs. Randy Johnson, the
1995 AL Cy Young winner who'd gone 3-0 since being traded from
Seattle and was fresh off consecutive shutouts. Yet on the exercise
bike, all Johnson could do was gush about Byrd. Go figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's the Big Unit sitting next to me and saying he's really
impressed with my stuff,'' said Byrd, who'd beaten Johnson and the
Astros 4-0 on a four-hitter. ``That really did a lot for my
confidence, even more than how I pitched against the Astros.''
</P>
<P>
   That was merely the new beginning. In his next start, Byrd threw
another complete game, holding the potent Rockies to five hits and
just one run. For all that, Byrd was named the National League
player of the week.
</P>
<P>
   This from a guy the Phillies claimed because they needed another
arm to give them some innings to finish out the season. Yet in six
starts with Philadelphia, Byrd has five quality starts, a 4-2
record, a 2.84 ERA and a nickname: ``Frasier,'' for his resemblance
to actor Kelsey Grammer. He knows he has stunned people. After his
only bad outing (Aug. 27, when the Padres rocked him for nine hits
and seven runs in 5 2/3 innings), Byrd approached his next start as
a proverbial big game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know everybody's waiting for the wheels to fall off,'' he
said after limiting the Dodgers to two hits and a run in six
innings. Byrd has won his last two starts, going seven innings
Sunday (three hits, one run) to beat Pittsburgh 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got him off the waiver wire and I don't think you expect to
get a 20-game winner there,'' manager Terry Francona said. ``But
he's certainly pitched his way into our plans. ... My feeling right
now is that he isn't a fluke.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People are shocked but I've never had a shot in the big
leagues where I got the ball every five days,'' said Byrd, who was
4-4 with a 5.26 ERA last season while with Atlanta, then 0-0, 13.50
in one appearance this year before going 5-5, 3.69 in 17 starts in
Richmond. ``I was really pleased (Philadelphia) wanted to give me a
shot as a starter. I felt I could start in the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I didn't like about the Braves was there was no
opportunity for me. I enjoyed Bobby (Cox) and the coaches, the
front office, the players, but middle relief in Atlanta is no job
at all. But everybody here's happy for me. Makes me feel good.''

 &HT;    For third year, GSU paper prints questions about Holocaust
 &HT;    By Ernie Suggs
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In her role to help maintain the cultural identities of Jewish
college students in metro Atlanta, Heidi Berger annually finds
herself perplexed with the attitudes of student journalists at
Georgia State University.
</P>
<P>
   For the third consecutive year, The Signal, GSU's student-run
newspaper, has run an advertisement paid by Bradley Smith's
Committee for Open Debate on the Holocaust that questions if the
Holocaust really happened.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing in the Sept. 8 edition, the ad offers $250,000 to
anyone who can arrange a nationally televised debate between CODOH
and the Anti-Defamation League, which combats anti-Semitism and
other forms of discrimination, on such issues as whether gas
chambers were used to exterminate Jews and if ``The Diary of Anne
Frank'' is fiction, not fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe and understand that this is not an issue of free
speech,'' said Berger, the Metro Campus Program director for
Atlanta YAD, the Jewish Young Adult Agency. ``But this is ethically
wrong. For a university that talks about diversity, allowing an ad
to run like this doesn't reflect well on them. People forget that
Jewish students are another type of minority group.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger said her organization has tried to talk with
representatives of The Signal, but that the students who run it,
``haven't understood our perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Smith, editor of The Signal, said it isn't a matter of
understanding a perspective.
</P>
<P>
   She said The Signal's ad policy states that ads will not be
rejected because of the political or personal views of the person
or group running it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a noble thing not to offend anyone, but the implication
of picking and choosing what you are going to run based on what you
like and identify with scares me very much,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Two GSU Jewish student groups haven't met yet this year, so
there has been no discussion of the ad, said Mark Budnitz, a law
professor and faculty adviser.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speaking as an individual, I think a newspaper has a greater
obligation than printing anything that someone pays for,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not a freedom of speech or debate issue. This is just
a bunch of scurrilous charges that are creating bad feelings among
the student body.''
</P>
<P>
   But Smith said only about 10 students have asked her about the
ad.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Scott, vice president for student services at GSU, said the
paper is partially funded by the university through student
activity fees but ``we can't tell the paper what they can print and
what they can't print.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sort of leave it to their judgment to make the decision.''
John Day, director of diversity education programs at GSU, said the
incident can be used to stimulate dialogue on campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, through the educational process, we will help
students understand different groups and show them that this is
offensive to them.''

A BILL TO BAN MCGWIRE DRUG  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ New Jersey would become the first state to ban
sales to minors of androstenedione, the testosterone-boosting
hormone used by Mark McGwire, under a bipartisan bill introduced
Monday in the State Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Herbert Conaway, a Democrat from Delran who
co-sponsored the bill, said that children might be tempted to
imitate the record-breaking home run hitter. Conaway, a doctor,
said that there have not been adequate safety studies of the drug,
which has been banned by the International Olympic Committee and
the National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark McGwire is a grown man and is free to decide what legal
substance he puts into his body,'' Conaway said in a statement.
``But as a highly respected role model to millions of kids, his
actions could send the wrong message: that improved performance on
the field is worth the health risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, people who sold or offered androstenedione to
minors would be fined $250 for a first offense, $500 for a second
offense and $1,000 thereafter. The bill would not make it illegal
for children to possess or use the drug, however. The measure now
goes to the Assembly Health Committee for consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Courtney, a spokesman for Major League Baseball, declined to
comment on the bill. He noted that last month league doctors began
a review of unregulated nutritional supplements.

ANGRY FASSEL LOWERS THE BOOM ON BOTH OFFENSE AND DEFENSE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL PENNINGTON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The head coach was red-faced and angry,
the offensive linemen were under siege again, jobs were being lost
in the defensive secondary and the linebackers were all limping.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody was having a very good day inside the Giants' locker room
on the day after the team's 20-17 loss to the Oakland Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   Weary from their overnight flight from the West Coast, players
and coaches Monday afternoon trudged into the videotape rooms,
where they studied their Sunday mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jim Fassel promised it would be a long, censorious
viewing. No one expected to be home in time for dinner _ if they
had the stomach to eat after watching a performance filled with 15
Giants penalties, just 71 yards rushing and no pass play longer
than 20 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to be smiling around this group for quite a
while,'' Fassel said. ``And I'm not talking about just this week.
They got my dander up, and it's going to stay up for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel has many complaints, but most of all he singled out the
offensive line. ``Poor execution, poor everything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And the coach said that the playing time of the rookie safety
Shaun Williams would be reduced. Carlton Gray, a new cornerback,
will take Williams' place in the nickel defense packages beginning
with Monday's game against the Dallas Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel then went on to criticize just about everyone on the
team, except quarterback Danny Kanell, running back Tiki Barber,
tackle Roman Oben and three defensive players _ ends Michael
Strahan and Chad Bratzke and cornerback Phillippi Sparks.
</P>
<P>
   Of the rest of the team, Fassel said, ``They were asleep at the
wheel.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel put the blame for the Giants' running-game woes on the
line, which he said routinely missed its assignments. He suggested
that there would be changes on the line if play did not improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll play somebody else,'' he said. ``I don't care who they
are.''
</P>
<P>
   But the possibilities at any of the line positions have been
tried before: the reserve Jerry Reynolds at tackle for Scott Gragg
or center Derek Engler for the starter Lance Scott. Beyond the
threats, the real consensus is that the starting five on the line,
a group that worked together effectively last season, will have to
find a way to come together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Running the football and blocking for it is an attitude,'' the
Giants' offensive line coach, John Matsko, said. ``We have to have
more determination to get that job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel played down his comments after Sunday's game about using
running back Tyrone Wheatley this week against Dallas. Fassel
reaffirmed that it was a possibility, but his praise of Barber made
it plain that Wheatley was not likely to step into the starting
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   More likely, Wheatley will take the place of the backup running
back Gary Brown. Brown has 21 yards on 10 carries in two games this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel said little about the injuries to linebackers Jessie
Armstead (sprained ankle), Scott Galyon (Achilles' tendon soreness
and calf-muscle strain), Corey Widmer (strained knee) and Marcus
Buckley (bruised hip).
</P>
<P>
   But it appears that Galyon may not be ready for the Cowboys and
that is a significant loss because Galyon is the team's most
dependable linebacker in pass coverage.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he is Armstead's backup, and Armstead could have
used a backup Sunday. Armstead was not himself against the Raiders
and would have sat out much of the game had Galyon been able to
play.
</P>
<P>
   The injuries to Widmer and Buckley are not considered serious.
</P>
<P>
   In so many ways, the Giants were a team licking its wounds
Monday, wondering what went wrong and wondering whether they were
better prepared for early season adversity than the 1997 Giants,
who won their opener and then slid to 1-3.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel said he was confident that this year's team was
different.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel confident in how they will react,'' he said. ``Last
year, I didn't know how they would react.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, heading to Oakland knowing it would take discipline to
defeat the unpredictable and generally undisciplined Raiders, the
Giants jumped offside six times. They converted on just 1 of 14
third-down plays.
</P>
<P>
   The defense forced just one turnover. There was no downfield
threat in the passing game and barely time in the pocket for Kanell
to consider the slower developing, long pass plays.
</P>
<P>
   Worst of all, the Giants gave up an 80-yard touchdown run on the
first play from scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   ``No less than five guys made mental mistakes on that play,''
Fassel said.
</P>
<P>
   Responsibilities were ignored, rotations missed based on the
formation and motion, and assignments botched once the play began.
Seventeen seconds later, the Giants trailed by 7-0.
</P>
<P>
   If only it had been the lone lapse for the Giants' vaunted
defense. But the Raiders had 414 total yards and were successful on
8 of 18 third-down plays _ some of them very long third-down plays.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel would not say whether he was contemplating any other
lineup changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't make decisions when I'm angry and I'm tired,'' he
said.

PIECES OF HISTORY, OR JUST RUINING IT?  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD SANDOMIR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the baseball Hall of Fame preserves history by stocking up on
bats, balls, jerseys and other artifacts connected to Mark McGwire
and Sammy Sosa, one company is chopping history into tiny bits.
</P>
<P>
   The Upper Deck Co. is carving a bat Babe Ruth used in games into
200 pieces for eventual mounting on trading cards, which will be
inserted into hundreds of thousands of 1999 card packs.
</P>
<P>
   Can collectors possibly covet one two-hundredth of a bat? Will
the richest collectors try to corner the slivers to try to
reconstruct the bat?
</P>
<P>
   It would seem that any piece of memorabilia connected to Ruth _
no matter how small _ deserves to be kept intact. That's the way it
is with history. You want to guard it, not carve it into
1{-by-1{-inch pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Even if a Ruth bat should not be mistaken for an artistic
masterpiece, it deserves preservation, not a fate determined by a
woodcutter. ``It goes against everything we would do, to grind up
something, rather than preserve it,'' said John Ralph, a spokesman
for the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   How does Upper Deck justify its repugnant merchandising? On two
grounds. First, according to its documentation, Ruth did nothing
momentous with the bat. Second, such rare memorabilia is expensive
_ Upper Deck paid $23,000 for the bat _ so chopping it up lets the
poor folk own a tiny part of a legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our way to spread the wealth,'' said Mary Mancera, an
Upper Deck spokeswoman. Ah, desecration for the public benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Mancera called the company's chopping-block mode of marketing
``product innovation.'' She offered a splendid assurance that if
this were the last game-used Ruth bat left, the company would not
cut it up. The company's research found that 50 to 100 Ruth bats
are still around.
</P>
<P>
   So, chop the company must, as long as there is a remaining
supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how it works sometimes,'' Mancera said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't matter if there were 5 or 50 Ruth bats left,''
Ralph said. ``They all need to be preserved.''
</P>
<P>
   Upper Deck purchased a Michael Jordan jersey last month for
$26,400 and will cut it into 138 swaths to be inserted into card
packs. But Jordan is alive and, unless he retires, still playing
and creating new game-worn memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth, deceased, hasn't swung a bat in a real game in 63 years.
Now, one bat with which he might have got a hit _ or maybe taken a
mighty whiff on a third strike _ is being desecrated, not
preserved.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in Upper Deck's parlance, it is ``pieces of history.''
</P>
<P>
   Pieces of shame.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The TV Home Run Derby &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Once Mark McGwire hit his 62d home run last Tuesday, the rush
for Fox and ESPN to add more games involving McGwire and Sammy Sosa
abated.
</P>
<P>
   But when Sosa hit No. 62, the frenzy returned. ESPN will carry
the Pittsburgh-St. Louis game at 8 p.m. Wednesday on ESPN2 and the
Chicago Cubs-San Diego game at 10:30 p.m. on ESPN, and is looking
for any opening it can find. Fox is looking to add Cubs or
Cardinals games to its Saturday afternoon slots, to Fox Sports Net
on Thursday nights and to FX on Saturday nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to see the games, whether it's home run 64 or
67,'' said Dick Glover, an ESPN executive vice president. ``You
want to take advantage of these opportunities. Maybe the 63d home
run will last for another 37 years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our initial interest was in who would break the record,'' said
Vince Wladika, a Fox spokesman. ``Now, it's who will hold the
record.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, ESPN cut into its programming to carry live each of
Sosa's at-bats and Sosa's news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Fox Sports Net _ which asked, ``Where would you
turn for the best sports news?'' in newspaper ads Monday _ showed
taped cut-ins of the home runs. It showed none of the news
conference on its cable affiliates like the MSG Network (which
showed soccer) and Fox Sports New York (which carried motorcycle
racing) until its Fox Sports News came on hours later.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a gray area whether more people will see a press
conference in our news or in the middle of a soccer game,'' said
Arthur Smith, executive vice president of Fox Sports Net. ``The
home runs are the news, the press conference is reaction to the
news. His reaction is just as valid two hours later.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Fox Sports Net and Fox Sports News, its news operation,
are to be taken seriously, they must carry news as it happens, not
when it's convenient.

 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
AUSTIN _ There were no kind words for Major Applewhite around the
University of Texas campus Monday. No one stopped him to offer best
wishes _ or condolences. No one stopped him at all.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not that Applewhite's fellow students don't care about such
things as who starts at quarterback. Applewhite, however, is about
as anonymous as a Texas quarterback can be. And at a glance, there
is no chance they would guess that the slender, freckled redhead in
front of them is a football player.
</P>
<P>
   When he was in high school, Applewhite was called ``Opie,''
apparently not looking quite tough enough to be Richie. On his
recruiting visit to Texas, he said, linebacker Cedric Mitchell
``thought I was a fraternity guy hanging around the hotel to see
what recruits were in.'' His role model at quarterback is not quite
Brett Favre or John Elway. It's former Alabama role player Jay
Barker.
</P>
<P>
   But Richard Walton, who in two weeks had given Texas the Big
12's top passing offense, is out for four to six weeks with a
fractured right hand. And Applewhite, a redshirt freshman with no
career starts and seven career passes, will take over when the
Longhorns face No. 5 Kansas State and the nation's top-rated
defense Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Friends have peppered Applewhite with questions about his state
of mind, now that he finds himself a starting quarterback awaiting
such a difficult baptism.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody else has seemed to notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't know who I am,'' Applewhite said. ``They just see a
6-foot-tall, redheaded kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas coaches, however, see a player who adjusted to a new
offense remarkably quickly. And though he is not as strong-armed or
experienced as Walton, Applewhite has had his moments in the
Longhorns' two games.
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite's appearances were just cameos, but in two games he
has completed five of seven passes for 59 yards. He led a pair of
scoring drives against UCLA on Saturday and even had the presence
of mind to notice the Bruins' starters were still in the game and
still blitzing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very intense about his football,'' Texas coach Mack Brown
said. ``He takes great pride in knowing what to do, where to go. He
watches football all the time. It's not like he hasn't prepared for
this time. He studied film every day in spring practices like he
had a game that night. He's very competitive. I think he's very
confident. I've never walked around him where I didn't think he
felt good about himself, which is a great trait for a college
football player, especially a quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great opportunity for him. There's pressure on all of
us. But the opportunity is great if he plays well and helps us win
the football game. Maybe you got this great opportunity before you
were ready for it. But you'd better go take advantage of it. That's
what we need Major to do.''
</P>
<P>
   His position as the Texas starter is unexpected for reasons
beyond the injury to Walton or Applewhite's physical appearance.
</P>
<P>
   He was a lifelong Alabama fan, named after former Crimson Tide
running back Major Ogilvie. Making the 5{-hour ride from his home
in Baton Rouge, La., to Tuscaloosa _ or the 6{-hour drive to
Birmingham _ was a family ritual. After one game when he was an
eighth-grader, Applewhite slipped into the Alabama locker room to
beg for a few sweaty gloves and wristbands. He posed for a
photograph with Barker and celebrated when Barker led 'Bama to the
1993 national championship.
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite prayed for a chance to play for the Tide. But when
Applewhite was a popular recruit, pursued by Texas, LSU, Texas A&AMP;M
and Mississippi State, Alabama was in the middle of a coaching
change after Gene Stallings' retirement and told him it would not
sign a quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite promptly changed his plans and committed to Texas
A&AMP;M. But when Steve Ensminger was fired as the Aggies' offensive
coordinator after the 1996 season, Applewhite changed his mind
again and committed to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, unanswered prayers work out best,'' he said. ``This
is my love now. I love Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   But his love had gone unrequited on the depth chart. He and Greg
Cicero were running even for the backup position until Cicero tore
knee ligaments in a scrimmage. Recruit Adam Dunn, who will now be
Applewhite's backup, was considered the Texas quarterback of the
future.
</P>
<P>
   But Applewhite will start Saturday and likely for a month to
come. And the Longhorns seem comfortable with the change.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's smart, and he knows football,'' UT defensive tackle Casey
Hampton said. ``Nothing he does surprises me, because I know he
knows the game.''
</P>
<P>
   He knows enough to understand how difficult his charge will be.
But a player who became a quarterback only because an eighth-grade
teammate fell and fractured a bone in his right hand looks at
facing the nation's top defense as a boon rather than a burden.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely a tough spot to be in,'' Applewhite said.
``But I enjoy it. I wouldn't want to play football if we played a
softy every week and beat teams 66-0. I'll enjoy playing a team
like this. It's going to be a great experience.''
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Relaxing at home in his 55th-floor condominium before
a game, Sammy Sosa is the same as at the ball park: focused but
funny, exuberant but reserved. He is in a strange country,
conversing in two languages, but his every movement displays a
combination of confidence and humility.
</P>
<P>
   He does not want to talk about his wealth, or his charity, or
even to appear to be restraining the impulse. ``I don't want to get
a big head,'' he says. ``I was raised religious, and I'm scared
what would happen to me if I did that.''
</P>
<P>
   Staying humble just got harder, as Sosa's glorious weekend put
him dead even in the chase for the most glamorous record in sports:
most home runs in a single season. After the record had been all
but conceded to Mark McGwire of St. Louis, Sosa's four home runs in
three days tied him with McGwire. As Sosa's Cubs begin a series
Monday night in San Diego and McGwire's Cardinals played at home
against Pittsburgh, each player had hit 62 home runs in 150 games.
Two weeks remain in the season.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm rooting for Mark McGwire,'' Sosa said last week. ``I look
up to him the way a son does to a father. I look at him, the way he
hits, the way he acts, and I see the person and the player I want
to be. I'm the man in the Dominican Republic. He's the man in the
United States. That's the way it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Sosa grew up without a father in the back of a converted
public hospital in San Pedro de Macoris, a dusty seaside town in
the Dominican Republic. His father, Juan Montero, died when Sosa
was 5. Sosa shared two bedrooms with his mother, four brothers and
two sisters. To help out, he shined shoes for two pesos.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at age 29, Sosa has a four-year, $42.5 million contract.
Besides the condo, he has two other homes and was able to give his
mother, Mireya, a house for Mother's Day. But ask him about his
wealth, and he will find an excuse to leave the room. If prodded to
name the favorite of all his automobiles, he will allow, ``Probably
the Rolls,'' and change the subject.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago last week, Sosa entertained guests before a night
game at Wrigley Field. Wearing Versace jeans instead of Cubs
pinstripes, he offered a glass of white wine and a tour of his
condo _ really four condos combined into one _ in a tower rising
above Navy Pier.
</P>
<P>
   In the den, where the windows reveal Lake Michigan, Sosa's two
agents occupied the sofa, eating shrimp and fielding offers for an
advertising deal in Japan. In the dining room, decorated with a
wraparound view of the Loop skyline, his wife, Sonia, was setting
out the good china for a lunch with friends. Their 5-year-old
daughter, Keisha, was at school, and the three younger children
were finishing their naps. Sammy's brothers were around, back among
the eight bedrooms.
</P>
<P>
   When Babe Ruth hit 60 home runs in 1927, his biographer noted
his boast, ``Sixty, count 'em, 60!'' Now Ruth has been matched, and
bested, by Roger Maris, Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa. Not a braggart
in the bunch.
</P>
<P>
   When he came into the major leagues six years ago, Sosa gained a
reputation as a selfish player, as a flashy underachiever, ``Sammy
So-So.'' His teammates, coaches and friends say he has grown
tremendously, as a baseball player, as a father and as a team
player. ``Sammy is showing a grace that blows my mind,'' said Tom
Reich, who is one of his agents. ``He is so intuitive. He draws
everyone into his loop with his good will and generosity.''
</P>
<P>
   Back home in San Pedro de Macoris, there is a statue of Sosa. In
the winter he visits hospitals to deliver presents to children and
schools to give new computers. They call him ``Sammy Claus.'' Pesos
thrown in his fountain are given to the shoeshine boys of Macoris.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the United States, Reich and his partner, Adam Katz, are
taking their time working through offers for endorsements. They
will let most of the deals wait until the season is over, so as not
to distract Sosa from the task at hand: helping the long-frustrated
Cubs make the playoffs for the first time since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa says he does not mind the greater attention that has been
given to McGwire since the season began back at the end of March.
As to the suggestion that his dark skin color might account for his
lack of acclaim compared with McGwire's, Sosa laughs and says:
``What? Come on, man, it's 1998.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Sosas moved in to their million-dollar home in June from a
smaller one a few blocks away. It appears almost unlived in, with
little of the debris of life scattered about. The only book is a
Spanish-language Bible by a bed. The Sosas' winter home is in Santo
Domingo, the Dominican capital, about 40 miles west of San Pedro de
Macoris on the southern coast of the Caribbean island of
Hispaniola. And they have a stopping-off place in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   A few treasures are on display in the Chicago home: photos of
their children. A plaque from friends in the Dominican Republic
(including the President, Leonel Fernandez) in honor of Sosa's
record-setting 20 home runs in a single month. An award from the
Cubs honoring his community service, the Roberto Clemente award,
named for his hero, whose uniform No. 21 Sosa adopted.
</P>
<P>
   A plaque rests on a cabinet in the living room: ``My house is
small, no mansion for a millionaire. But there is room for love and
there is room for friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Sammy and Sonia met 12 years ago in the Dominican Republic. With
the help of a maid, she takes care of the children: two girls,
Keisha, 5, and Kenia, 3; and two boys, Sammy Jr., nearly 2, and
Michael, almost 1.
</P>
<P>
   On this quiet afternoon, the children woke up just in time for a
family photograph and lunch before batting practice. The children
know Sosa plays baseball, but they have no idea of his fame.
Occasionally, on a replay, they do see the trademark two-fingered
kisses that he blows their way.
</P>
<P>
   ``They see me on TV and say, `Papi! Papi!' he said. ``I am very
proud of them.''

FOLEY HAS TRYING WEEK AS JET STARTER  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By GERALD ESKENAZI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Glenn Foley's numbers as a starter aren't
pretty _ 1-6 in his career _ and the Jets have begun this season
0-2. Foley will start his third consecutive game on Sunday for the
first time as a pro. This week will be a big test for Foley.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of those things where your quarterback has to be a
fighter,'' Coach Bill Parcells said. ``One of the lead fighters. He
has to demonstrate to the team that he is going to respond. And I
think he will.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells has been unhappy with many of Foley's passing decisions
over the two games _ especially throwing into double coverage in
the end zone in Sunday's 24-10 loss to the Baltimore Ravens. ``His
performance was excellent the first half, no question,'' Parcells
said. ``You couldn't throw the ball too much better.'' Foley,
without a running game from Curtis Martin, was 13 for 18 for 177
yards and a touchdown in the opening half.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second half, you couldn't throw it that much worse,''
Parcells added. Foley was 9 for 15 with 3 interceptions, 3 sacks,
and a total of 70 yards passing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just can't go by one bad half and judge him,'' Parcells
said. ``The sacks belonged to the quarterback, three of them. These
are the kinds of things quarterbacks have to go through.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells believed Foley had some lucky breaks in his brilliant
415-yard performance in the opener against the San Francisco 49ers,
a game the Jets lost in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Foley continued his alliance with Keyshawn Johnson, who remains
the American Football Conference's leading receiver with 15
catches. Wayne Chrebet has also expanded his role from being merely
a good-hands third-down receiver to an every-down player who is
actually averaging more yards a reception (18) than Johnson (13.8).
</P>
<P>
   Now Foley will lead the Jets as a favored team for a second
straight week as they play the Indianapolis Colts at the
Meadowlands. Foley's counterpart this time will be the most
acclaimed college quarterback to go into the draft in the 1990s:
Peyton Manning of Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Foley, out of Boston College, was the last pick of the draft for
the 1994 Jets. No matter. He is in charge now and the players will
be watching.
</P>
<P>
   He was unavailable to reporters Monday because he was having his
battered body tended by the Jets' trainers. Foley has never had to
go through this sort of pounding, and losing, for weeks at a time.
This week can answer questions that not only Parcells has, but
Foley's teammates as well.
</P>
<P>
   Without a running game, there is greater pressure on Foley. In
his fourth year, Martin has never been so unproductive in
consecutive games in which he had at least 20 carries. He agreed
that he should be running more aggressively. Parcells is reluctant
to criticize Martin, who signed a $36 million contract and has
amassed 116 yards, averaging 2.6 yards, in two games. Nevertheless,
the coach suggested that Martin might be running with a little
higher stride and not as forcefully.
</P>
<P>
   With the score tied at 7-7 in the second quarter against the
Ravens, Martin was halted four times in one series that began at
the Baltimore 3-yard line, the final three times from only a yard
out. ``There was one time I was undecided and started to cut to the
outside,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Martin is fifth in total yardage in the AFC with 217,
including 101 yards receiving.
</P>
<P>
   Vinny Testaverde, who has started 129 times as a pro
quarterback, can relate to Foley's woes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's up to a quarterback to be in charge,'' said Testaverde,
who has not had to put on his helmet this season. ``Now you're
beaten up. Now you have to show by example.''
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde was in the locker room at lunchtime, while Foley, who
was sacked four times by the Ravens on Sunday, was receiving
treatment. So far, Foley's body has stood up and he has not missed
a snap.
</P>
<P>
   And Testaverde? The 34-year-old has been listed as third string.

 CORNELL HONORS THE RENAISSANCE MAN WHO, OH YES, WROTE `LOLITA' 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MEL GUSSOW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ITHACA, N.Y. _ On July 1, 1948, Vladimir Nabokov, a 49-year-old
Russian emigre, arrived at Cornell University. For the next 11
years, his longest residence at any one place in the United States,
he taught Russian literature and other courses. During that period
he wrote his signature novel, ``Lolita,'' along with ``Pnin,''
about the comic misadventures of a Russian emigre to an American
campus very much like Cornell. He also began to conceive ``Pale
Fire,'' which many Nabokovians regard as the pivotal book in his
considerable body of work.
</P>
<P>
   In honor of the 50th anniversary of the author's advent at
Cornell and in anticipation of the celebration in 1999 of the
centenary of his birth, the university sponsored a three-day
Nabokov festival. ``I wanted to celebrate him as a Renaissance man,
maybe one of the last we will witness,'' said Gavriel Shapiro,
chairman of the department of Russian literature at Cornell and the
director of the festival.
</P>
<P>
   In the years since his death in 1977, Nabokov _ as novelist,
memoirist and translator _ has become a towering figure on the
international scene, often placed alongside James Joyce and Marcel
Proust as one of the great innovative writers of the 20th century.
As an artist, he stubbornly followed his own unconventional path,
found his voice (in two languages) and became an influence on
writers who followed him, novelists as diverse as John Updike and
Don DeLillo.
</P>
<P>
   Nabokov's books _ 17 novels; a memoir, ``Speak Memory''; short
stories; essays and criticism _ are now widely in print in many
languages. He is read and discussed over the Internet as well as in
university classrooms. The recent Adrian Lyne film of ``Lolita''
will presumably bring new readers to his work, as did the 1962
Stanley Kubrick film.
</P>
<P>
   The Cornell festival was a cornucopia of Nabokoviana, with more
than 30 scholars from Seattle to Zagreb presenting papers on
diverse and often arcane aspects of the writer's career. By the
count of one participant, among them they had written 43 books
about the author. Other academics listened and asked questions
about the virtuosity of Nabokov as writer, teacher and expert
lepidopterist. The dramatic highlight was a performance of ``Dear
Bunny/Dear Volodya,'' a dialogue adapted from the correspondence of
Nabokov and Edmund Wilson, with Dmitri Nabokov playing his father
and William F. Buckley Jr. playing Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Nabokov himself might have been amused by the deep and sometimes
overreactive textual analyses at the festival. He was clear about
his detestation of symbols and allegories. In his afterword to
``Lolita,'' he scoffed at readers who alternately described the
book as ``Old Europe debauching young America'' and ``Young America
debauching old Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   His approach was to emphasize details, not generalities. He
loved the limpidity of language, and with infinite finesse he made
English dance to his wit and imagination, as he had apparently done
with his earlier works in Russian. As an experimentalist, he is a
most natural subject for spectroscopic examination, as practiced by
a floating body of dedicated Nabokovians.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Boyd, the author of a two-volume biography of the
novelist, who came to the conference from his home in Auckland, New
Zealand, said: ``He was a little like Joyce, who said he put
puzzles in his work to keep professors busy for a thousand years _
the only way of insuring your immortality. There are a lot of
inquisitive readers here who have discovered the hidden plums.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   Boyd delivered a paper on ``Pale Fire,'' confronting that
crucial quandary: did Shade (the poet) invent Kinbote (the
commentator) or vice versa? After a heated debate on the Internet,
Dmitri Nabokov, the man at the center of the Cornell conference,
settled the issue: ``My father said it would make just as much
sense to say that they reciprocally invented each other. Basically
people seem to forget that Nabokov invented both.''
</P>
<P>
   During the conference, one Nabokov scholar delivered a learned
but debatable paper equating the character of Lolita with the
monster in Mary Shelley's ``Frankenstein,'' suggesting that both
deal with the ``betrayal of a child's innocence.'' Another speaker
read her entire paper in Russian, severely testing the language
ability of the other participants. A professor who is also a
professional cartoonist talked about the importance of comic strips
to Nabokov and described him as ``a novelist of astounding visual
acuity'' whose ``medium was language.'' Several drew parallels
between his art and his lifelong passion for collecting and
categorizing butterflies.
</P>
<P>
   There were also fascinating glimpses into his life in Russia and
in Ithaca, where he and his wife, Vera, became serial renters,
moving from house to house, occupying the homes of professors on
leave. Even in residence at Cornell, he maintained his nomadic
existence.
</P>
<P>
   The festival featured a library exhibition of Nabokov's books
including rare copies of his earliest works; his first book of
poems, privately published in 1916; and his Russian translation of
``Alice in Wonderland,'' for which he was paid $5.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Dear Bunny/Dear Volodya,'' adapted by Terry Quinn, Dmitri
Nabokov and Buckley filled their respective roles with dry
acerbity. In this friendship that eventually turned into a feud,
Wilson often seemed to express a critical cutting edge, as in his
early suggestion that Nabokov limit his punning. Nabokov, in turn,
could be forcefully dismissive in his literary assessments,
banishing Faulkner (despite Wilson's protestations) and admitting
that he was prejudiced against all female writers.
</P>
<P>
   Dmitri Nabokov, who gave the keynote speech at the festival, is
a basso who made his debut with Luciano Pavarotti in ``La Boheme''
in Italy in 1961 and put aside his flourishing operatic career to
devote himself to what he called his ``literary patrimony.''
Explaining his switch in professions, he said: ``I thought there
were fewer Nabokovs around than bassos. Actually there was only one
Nabokov, so I thought the best thing I could do for him and for art
was to occupy myself with the stewardship.''
</P>
<P>
   At the conference, Nabokov briefly returned to his previous
career, performing a concert of songs related to the work of his
father, including one of his own composition.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Jan Parker, who studied with Nabokov at Cornell in 1958
and teaches at the University of Kansas, said that in the 15 years
since the first Nabokov festival at Cornell, ``there has been an
explosion of information and sources, criticism and commentary.'' A
fledgling Nabokov Society has grown into an international one,
there is an active Web site and the Library of America published
three volumes of his writings.
</P>
<P>
   And, Parker said, there is an urge to position Nabokov as a
modernist, a post-modernist, a post-post-modernist, a
metafictionist _ ``or none of the above.'' He added, ``I can
imagine Nabokov gently smiling at all this commotion.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the mid-1980s, when Nabokov's books began to be published
in Russia, he has been embraced there as well. Russia has its own
Nabokov journal. During the centenary, there will be celebrations
around the world _ in London, Paris, Berlin, Montreux and Moscow.
New York will offer an exhibition of his work at the Berg
Collection of the New York Public Library (the primary repository
of Nabokoviana), and there will be an evening at Town Hall, with
Nabokov showing clips from film and television representations of
his father's work. He supervises publication and translation, as
well as authorizes dramatic and film adaptations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God my father had two birthdays, one by the old
calendar, one by the new,'' he said. ``This way I can satisfy those
who want to have a birthday celebration in St. Petersburg on April
10'' while also toasting his father in another city on April 23.
</P>
<P>
   Currently he is helping to restore a family estate near St.
Petersburg (which he will turn into an arts foundation) and is
completing a book about his father's butterflies.
</P>
<P>
   At the core of Nabokov's reputation, of course, is ``Lolita.''
It is now accepted as a modern classic, but it had a most difficult
birth. The author said that in writing it he faced the task of
``inventing America'' and several times was at the point of burning
the manuscript. His son recalled: ``He didn't think it would ever
be published. He was on the way to the incinerator with it when
Mother stopped him.''
</P>
<P>
   Once it was published (by Maurice Girodias of the Olympia Press
in Paris), it became infamous. Surrounded by outrage and threats of
censorship, ``Lolita'' survived intact. A turning point was Graham
Greene's praise in The Sunday Times of London. He named it as one
of the three best books of 1955.
</P>
<P>
   When it was finally published in the United States, ``Lolita''
became a phenomenal success, allowing the author to leave Cornell.
Although Nabokov said he was sick of teaching, his son said that he
``deeply loved Cornell, a university that gave him untrammeled
academic freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   With the profits from ``Lolita,'' he was able to become a
full-time writer. At the Montreux Palace Hotel in Switzerland, he
completed ``Pale Fire,'' wrote ``Ada'' and other major works and
also revised his historic translation of Pushkin's ``Eugene
Onegin.'' In his final years, he was working on a novel entitled
``The Original of Laura.''
</P>
<P>
   As his father's heir, Dmitri Nabokov is still undecided about
what to do with the uncompleted manuscript. Written on index cards,
the text, if printed, would run about 30 pages. It would have been,
he said, ``a brilliant, original and potentially totally radical
book, in the literary sense, very different from the rest of his
ouevre.''
</P>
<P>
   But he does not think the work could stand alone. ``My father
gave the order to destroy it,'' he said. ``He was against
publishing anything that was not finished. If I burn it, it's gone
forever. If I don't and don't publish it, eventually it will fall
into somebody's hands. Probably the right thing to do would be to
make a rare contravention of my father's wishes and make what there
is available to scholars.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking back on his childhood, Nabokov said, ``Father never
failed to allot to me what is vulgarly called quality time,
teaching me sports, chess, entymology.''
</P>
<P>
   It is with gratitude that the son has taken up his Nabokovian
career. Tracing the arc of his father's fortunes, he said: ``Ten or
so years after a writer's death, he either slides downhill into the
bottom drawer or he stays on hold _ or else he begins a gradual
ascent into a wonderful pantheon in the sky. The last seems to be
what's happening with my father. Undoubtedly, he would have gone to
the pantheon without me, but I think I'm helping things along.''

   &UR; New Year's in Paris &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My husband and I will be in Paris during the New Year's
holiday, and we would like suggestions on how to celebrate. _ Susan
Reynolds Baime, Essex County, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   A. You won't find a French version of the Times Square
experience, but there are plenty of entertaining ways to spend New
Year's Eve _ or Reveillon, as it's called in Paris _ particularly
if it involves eating.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the city's well-known restaurants plan New Year's menus
and events, although representatives for the following
establishments said details won't be complete until later in the
fall. They also said that they expect to be booked by the end of
October, so make reservations soon. Prices for six-course meals
will probably range from about $170 to $340 a person, including
wine. Among the restaurants planning special menus are the
three-Michelin-star Taillevent, 15 Rue Lamennais, telephone (33-1)
44.95.15.01; the three-star Arpege, 84 Rue Varenne, (33-1)
45.51.47.33; and the two-star Ledoyen, Carre Champs-Elysees, (33-1)
45.41.47.33. At Les Ambassadeurs restaurant in the Crillon Hotel,
(33-1) 44.71.15.00, there will be an orchestra and dancing. Les
Muses at the Hotel Scribe, (33-1) 44.71.24.24, will have an
Egyptian theme for its menu presentation and decor, and there will
be fireworks in the gardens for diners and hotel guests at Plaza
Athenee, 25 Avenue Montaigne, (33-1) 53.67.66.65.
</P>
<P>
   For a less expensive evening you might consider a Left Bank
institution like La Coupole on the Boulevard de Montparnasse,
(33-1) 43.20.14.20. For about $70 it offers a la carte dining and
dancing until dawn.
</P>
<P>
   Several dance halls just east of the city, along the Marne
River, are pretty venues in which to spend New Year's Eve, with
dinner, music and dancing for about $100. The Guinguette du Moulin
Vert in Champigny-sur-Marne is a 20-minute drive east of Paris on
the A4 highway, (33-1) 47.06.00.91. The Guinguette de L'Ile du
Martin Pecheur is in the same suburb, (33-1) 49.83.03.02.
</P>
<P>
   Boat companies with tours along the Seine will be operating at
full capacity on New Year's Eve. Among those offering a five-course
dinner, including Champagne, and dancing, are Bateaux Parisiens
(the cost is $300; access beside the Eiffel Tower), (33-1)
44.11.33. 44, and Bateaux Vedettes du Pont Neuf ($200; access under
the Pont Neuf), (33-1) 53.00.98.98.
</P>
<P>
   The Ballet Company of the Paris Opera offers another New Year's
Eve option, with its staging of ``Don Quixote'' at the Palais
Garnier at 7:30, choreographed by Rudolf Nureyev. Tickets range
from about $5.50 to $75. On the same day and time, the Bastille
Opera will present ``The Happy Widow,'' a three-act operetta by
Victor Leon and Leo Stein, directed by Jorge Lavelli and starring
Nancy Gustafson as Hanna Glawari. Tickets cost $10 to $110. Call
(33-1) 40.01.17.39 for reservations for both.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Hudson Valley in the Fall &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you know of fall events at Hudson Valley sites, such as
Sunnyside, that would appeal to my 7-year-old? _ Miles Ellsbach,
New York, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A. The Historic Hudson Valley, the organization in Tarrytown
that manages Sunnyside, Philipsburg Manor, Van Cortlandt Manor,
Union Church of Pocantico Hills, Montgomery Place and Kykuit, has
information on a number of good possibilities. The number is (914)
631-0089. Here are a few options:
</P>
<P>
   At Sunnyside, the 17th-century cottage that belonged to the
writer Washington Irving, there will be a daylong festival on Oct.
4 celebrating children's literature. Authors like Jean Craighead
George (``Julie of the Wolves''); Lloyd Moss (``Zin! Zin! A
Violin''), who will lead musical activities, and Richard Devins and
Norman Sandler, who will demonstrate some moves from their book
``Martial Arts for Kids,'' will be on hand, as will costumed
characters from the Magic School Bus book and TV series (including
Ms. Frizzle). A variety of hands-on workshops and nature walks will
also be offered. Admission is $8, $7 for seniors and $4 for
children 5 to 17; children under five are free. Information: (914)
591-8763.
</P>
<P>
   Also at Sunnyside, on Oct. 25, there will be ``An Evening of
Scary Tales With Robert Klein.'' The actor and comedian will read
some spooky stories, and visitors can take candlelight tours of the
cottage beginning at 6 p.m. The reading will be from 7:30 to 8:30
p.m. Admission is $15. Reservations are necessary. Call (914)
631-8200, extension 618.
</P>
<P>
   The Harvest Fair at Montgomery Place on Columbus Day weekend
(Oct. 10 and 11) is another good bet. Your child can gather apples
from the estate's orchards, press cider, square dance, take a
hayride or pony ride and help make a scarecrow. The setting is the
434-acre grounds of a grand early-19th-century mansion, former home
of the horticulturist Janet Livingston Montgomery (the widow of the
Revolutionary War hero, Gen. Richard Montgomery). Hours for the
fair are 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on both days. Admission is $5; $3 for
children. Mansion tours are an additional $2, as are the pony
rides. Information: (914) 758-5461.
</P>
<P>
   The Historic Hudson Valley sites are also open throughout the
week (closed in January and February; Kykuit, the Rockefeller
estate, is closed from Nov. 1 until May). Hours and prices vary.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Newsletter for Diabetics &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I've heard there is a travel newsletter for diabetics, but I
have not been able to find it. Can you help? Mary T. Haker, San
Francisco
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, there is such a publication. The Diabetic Traveler, a
six-page quarterly newsletter is designed to encourage people with
diabetes to travel and to do so safely. It is edited and published
by Maury E. Rosenbaum, an insulin-dependent diabetic.
</P>
<P>
   The newsletter focuses on specific locations _ Vancouver,
Acapulco and Paris are among the cities covered in past issues _
and types of travel, like spa vacations and rail or air travel.
Travel tips, including all-night pharmacies in particular cities,
insulin adjustment for air travel, generic and
foreign-manufacturer's drug names, are also included.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenbaum also has some free publications, including a list of
diabetes associations in 84 countries and an insulin-adjustment
guide for travelers crossing multiple time zones. To receive them,
send a self-addressed, stamped business envelope to The Diabetic
Traveler, Post Office Box 8223-RW, Stamford, Conn. 06905. A year's
subscription to The Diabetic Traveler costs $18.95, and can be
ordered through the above address, or the newsletter's Web site:
www.ishops.com/diabetes.

SWISSAIR JET IN CRASH HELD A PICASSO PAINTING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia _ The cargo hold of the Swissair jet that
crashed off the coast here Sept. 2 held currency, diamonds and
jewelry, along with a painting by Pablo Picasso that is believed to
have been destroyed when the jet slammed into the water, Swissair
officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually those kind of paintings are sent in some kind of
wooden construction that is really not a shockproof container,''
said Urs Peter Naef, a spokesman for Swissair's cargo-handling unit
in Zurich, Switzerland. ``We don't know for sure, but we assume
that because of the heavy impact it was probably destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Swissair declined to identify the owner of the painting, or say
to whom it was being shipped. The painting was identified as ``Le
Peintre'' (The Painter) and was shipped as general cargo, not
valuable cargo, which would have entailed extra care, the airline
said.
</P>
<P>
   Swissair officials said the shipping company, which it refused
to identify, estimated the painting to be worth $1.5 million.
Because that figure is based on the shipper's estimate, not the
owner's, it could vary widely from the painting's true value.
</P>
<P>
   A painting called ``Le Peintre'' was sold at auction at
Sotheby's London in December 1996 for the equivalent of $867,000.
The 36-inch-high oil canvas was painted in 1963 in tones of blue,
black and white. It depicts a bearded artist holding a palette.
</P>
<P>
   But Matthew Weigman, a spokesman for Sotheby's New York, said
that records indicated that Picasso did at least six paintings with
that title in 1963. ``Without seeing a photograph, there is no way
of telling if the painting sold by Sotheby's was the one that was
on the plane that crashed,'' Weigman said.
</P>
<P>
   The revelation of the jet's valuable cargo adds another
dimension to the crash that cost the lives of all 229 passengers
and crew. Although electrical problems are suspected, investigators
have not reached any conclusions about the cause of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   As news spread of the jetliner's valuable cargo, the Canadian
authorities warned away any would-be treasure hunters. ``The crash
site is still a protected zone and any attempt by anyone to
infiltrate or pilfer the site will not be tolerated,'' said Cpl.
Carl Hubley of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in Halifax.
</P>
<P>
   Divers searching the wreckage have not reported coming across
any of the valuables from the Swissair cargo hold. Searchers found
some currency on the surface, but that is believed to have been
money held by passengers, not part of the shipment.
</P>
<P>
   It is not unusual for a commercial jet like the McDonnell
Douglas used by Swissair to carry commercial cargo along with
baggage, company officials said. The jet that crashed was carrying
16 tons of cargo, which Swissair said was well within usual
operating limits.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the cargo consisted of textiles, machine parts and
computer equipment, as well as 530 pounds of express mail and 440
pounds of regular mail. The valuables and their packaging totaled
132 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Swissair handles about 200,000 consignments of valuables each
year, the company said. Shippers are charged by weight, not
content. All cargo shipments are insured for less than $10 a pound,
but shippers usually add their own insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Naef of Swissair would say little about the valuables that were
shipped on Flight 111 beyond what was on the jet's manifest. Each
item is listed by weight, including the packaging. The plane held
more than 100 pounds of currency that an American bank was shipping
to one of its branches in Switzerland, about 10 pounds of jewelry,
4 pounds of watches and 2 pounds of diamonds and their packaging.
</P>
<P>
   The airline would not give the value of the money or the
jewelry, or identify the owners.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the paintings, the money and jewelry were shipped
in a protective container provided by Swissair. It had a locked
aluminum door and metal seal.
</P>
<P>
   But this type of container is not shockproof or fireproof,
according to the company, and may not have been strong enough to
withstand the crash.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Canadian divers continued Monday to search through the tangled
wreckage of the Swissair MD-11 jet for human remains. So far, the
remains of only eight of the 229 victims have been positively
identified.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Butt, the Nova Scotia medical examiner, said Monday
that nearly all of the human remains had been retrieved from the
ocean floor in the area where the debris from the jet was found. He
said the head of Navy diving operations told him that it might be
too dangerous to enter the large, jagged sections of fuselage lying
on the ocean floor to recover remains still inside.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the fuselage fragments may have to be raised while they
hold the shattered bodies, Butt said.

MOUSE BUCKS BULL; MARKET   BUFFETS   DISNEY   AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ On a day when the bulls ruled Wall Street,
investors hammered Walt Disney Co. stock following a bleak earnings
forecast and knocked shares down to their lowest point in almost a
year and a half.
</P>
<P>
   Shares fell $1.375 to $24.4375, completing a decline of 42
percent since Disney stock hit its all-time high in early May.
Monday's sell-off, accelerated by eight analysts downgrading the
stock, saw 23.7 million shares change hands in the largest volume
during a single session since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Disney was also by far the biggest loser among the 30 components
of the Dow Jones industrial average, which rose 149.85 to 7945.35.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's punishment reflects a growing perception among
investors that the global recession has become a flat tire on what
had been the entertainment industry's fastest vehicle over the past
decade. Even with Monday's decline, shares have doubled in value
over the past four years and are worth five times as much as they
were a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's downgrades and sell-off stemmed from Disney's
announcement late Friday that its fourth quarter, ending Sept. 30,
would come in at 15 cents or 16 cents a share, well below Wall
Street's consensus estimate of 21 cents. It blamed a variety of
problems: Asia's economic turmoil, slack demand for consumer
products and home videos overseas, and rising costs for films and
its ABC network.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts, many who issued downgrades and cut estimates earlier
in the summer, admitted Disney's problems aren't limited to this
quarter and may not go away quickly. ``This is a more significant
speed bump than we expected,'' said ING Barings Furman Selz analyst
Stewart Halpern, a longtime Disney bull who downgraded the stock
from ``buy'' to ``hold'' and lowered his year-end price target to
$35 from $42.
</P>
<P>
   Halpern said new revenue sources _ such as a cruise line, ESPN
magazine, stores and restaurants, new theme parks, international
expansion _ will take longer than expected to overcome current
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Jill Krutick of Salomon Smith Barney, who noted she had
sliced estimates June 30 and since has seen the stock fall 35
percent, agreed. ``While some of the issues are quarter specific,
we believe the announcement underscores longer-term challenges as
well,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the ongoing problems include poor ratings at ABC, the
soaring costs of TV programming such as pro football and the
cannibalization of attendance at its Florida theme parks by its own
Animal Kingdom and by Universal's planned Islands of Adventure
attraction.
</P>
<P>
   Krutick, who downgraded her rating to ``neutral'' from
``outperform,'' warned that Chairman Michael Eisner's goal of 20
percent gains in earnings has become more difficult to achieve now
that Disney pulls in annual revenues of more than $20 billion. ``We
believe the bar is raised for Disney going forward,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The downbeat forecast means that for the fiscal year ending
Sept. 30, Disney will eke out a slight gain in profit of 88 cents
to 89 cents a share, up from 86 cents a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Disney is in the process of cutting back its live-action films _
one of its least profitable sectors _ to about 15 films a year
while ramping up its cornerstone animated film operation. Analysts
believe its strongest prospects are in the latter category, led by
``A Bug's Life,'' due out in November in partnership with Steven
Jobs' Pixar Animation. ``Tarzan'' and ``Toy Story 2'' are potential
animated blockbusters due in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Still, analysts believe the outlook will eventually brighten.
They cite Eisner's willingness to invest aggressively to expand
Disney's lucrative franchise. Krutick said the cruise line, new
animated films and gaining control of Web search specialist
Infoseek are particularly attractive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to believe in the long-term investment merits of
Walt Disney,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Bannister of Edward Jones &AMP; Co. reiterated her ``strong
buy'' rating while cautioning that Disney may need several quarters
to begin posting significant profit growth again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think Disney has been investing very wisely for the long
term with the cruise line, the new park in Anaheim and Animal
Kingdom,'' she said. ``Longer term, shareholders are going to be
fine. It's had these kind of problems before with the recession in
1991 and Euro Disney in 1993.'' &QL;

Sammy Sosa has a high profile at the ball park but a quiet life at
home. He and his wife, Sonia, play with three of their four
children in their 55th-floor condominium. The Sosas moved in to
their million-dollar home in June from a smaller one a few blocks
away. It appears almost unlived in, with little of the debris of

   (NYT27) NEW YORK -- Sept. 14, 1998 -- WELFARE-HISPANICS-2, 9-14

OREGON STATE'S ROOTS RUN DEEPLY INTO USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Oregon State might be overwhelmed by USC from the
standpoint of talent, but the Beavers will certainly be more
familiar with the Trojans than any other team on their schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Head coach Mike Riley was USC's offensive coordinator for four
seasons, but he's far from the only connection to the Trojans
football program. Riley also hired former USC assistant Mark Banker
in 1996 to coach the secondary last season.
</P>
<P>
   And he's added a couple more Trojans recently. Beavers defensive
line coach Jeff McInerney spent two seasons at USC before being
fired after John Robinson was dismissed. Oregon State video
coordinator Mark Preto left USC last spring after refusing to
accept a demotion; he was eventually hired by Riley over the
summer. Preto had been USC's video coordinator for three years.
</P>
<P>
   __ Quarterback derby?: USC coach Paul Hackett had only good
things to say about his quarterbacks, although sophomore Mike Van
Raaphorst seems entrenched as the starter _ for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Mike was a week better,'' Hackett said of the
Trojans' win over San Diego State. ``I thought Carson did some good
things. He made a silly throw. He showed poise. He's got a presence
about him.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Drought in L.A.: Oregon State has not defeated USC in Los
Angeles since 1960, which was John McKay's first season. The
Beavers have lost 24 straight games to USC, a Pacific-10 record.
Oregon State last defeated the Trojans in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon State is winless in the Pac-10 since 1996 and last won a
conference road game in 1994, when it upset UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   __ Gibson honored: Linebacker David Gibson was named Pac-10
defensive player of the week for his performance against San Diego
State. Gibson had eight tackles, forced three fumbles, recovered a
fumble and sacked the quarterback three times.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson also won the honor last year after the Trojans' victory
over Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   __ Injury update: It appears Eric Denmon could be out for a
while with a sprain high in his ankle. Denmon is officially listed
as questionable, but he is wearing a boot on his ankle, which
usually means more than one week off. Linebacker Mark Cusano
(sprained ankle) is probable, although he might not practice every
day.
</P>
<P>
   __ Good start: If the Trojans defeat Oregon State, they will be
3-0 for the first time since 1995 and 3-0 for the just the third
time since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   __ Rushing totals: With its 232 yards rushing, USC moved up to
47th overall in the NCAA team-rushing statistics. Last week, the
Trojans ranked 69th. The Trojans ranked 111th out of 112 Division
I-A teams after two games last season.

ALLIED SIGNAL TAKEOVER BID FOR AMP GAINING SUPPORT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., N.J.)  (lb) 
 By SHARON R. KING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Allied Signal Inc.'s hostile $9.8 billion takeover battle for
AMP Inc. escalated Monday as investors owning 72 percent of AMP
stock agreed to sell their shares to Allied Signal.
</P>
<P>
   Allied said it would buy as many as 40 million shares of AMP, or
about 18 percent of its outstanding stock, for $1.8 billion. That
amount falls short of spurring an AMP anti-takeover provision,
which goes into effect if anyone buys more than 20 percent of the
shares. Previously, Allied said it would only buy shares if the
takeover provision was removed.
</P>
<P>
   The share purchases should make Allied Signal the largest
shareholder and could put the company one step closer to completing
its plan to buy AMP, a leading maker of electronic equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, when Allied Signal announced its hostile cash bid
for AMP, AMP dismissed the offer as too low. AMP's new chairman and
chief executive, Robert Ripp, said there were no synergies between
the two companies and AMP was not interested in a combination.
</P>
<P>
   Allied Signal is also trying to force a vote that would give
investors, rather than the Harrisburg, Pa., company's board, the
ability to rescind the anti-takeover provision, or poison pill.
</P>
<P>
   Investors holding more than 157 million AMP shares offered their
stock for sale, an Allied official said. As a result, the
Morristown, N.J., maker of aerospace and automotive products, plans
to prorate its offer, buying a percentage of shares from each
investor who wants to sell. The tender offer expires on Sept. 25.
</P>
<P>
   Allied Signal plans to continue its offer to buy the remaining
shares for $44.50 each, if the poison pill is removed.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Bossidy, Allied Signal's chief executive, said the high
percentage of shares offered ``is a vote of no confidence in
management's restructuring plan and a mandate in favor of Allied
Signal's offer.''
</P>
<P>
   But AMP's chairman, Ripp, disagreed. The results indicate ``AMP
shareholders want value and that's what we'll deliver,'' he said.
Allied Signal knows, he added, ``the initial round of tenders does
not translate into support for its bid.''
</P>
<P>
   The battle between the two companies escalated Monday, as AMP
newspaper advertisements asked Allied Signal investors how Allied's
executives and board could manage both businesses at once if it
were to gain control of AMP.
</P>
<P>
   AMP has urged shareholders to reject Allied's advances, and
promised improved profits. As part of its revamping plan, AMP
expects to generate an operating margin of 13.5 percent in 1999,
with earnings per share of about $2.30 and about $3 per share in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of AMP rose $3.0625 Monday, to $42.0625. AMP has been
struggling recently because of weakness in Asia, which accounted
for 20 percent of 1997 sales. In July, AMP announced a plant
closing and elimination of 3,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts believe that Allied's persistence could prompt an
offer from a rival bidder, or force changes at AMP. ``Obviously
shareholders are looking to send a real message to this
management,'' said Steven Cohen, director of research at Kellner,
DiLeo &AMP; Co., a New York merger arbitrage firm. ``You have a
management saying, `Trust us, don't worry.' If shareholders are
skeptical about believing these kinds of things, no one can blame
them.''

   Clinton Details His Policy for Economic Growth
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ President Clinton declared that the economic turmoil
roiling three continents constituted ``the biggest financial
challenge facing the world in a half-century.'' In a half-hour
address to a friendly audience at the Council on Foreign Relations
in Manhattan on Monday, he detailed a strategy to quell the trouble
before it puts ``our own prosperity at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called on the world's leading economies to abandon their
fear of inflation and instead ``spur growth.'' The finance
ministers and central bank governors of the world's seven largest
economies issued a parallel statement intended to open the door to
coordinated interest-rate cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 4/32, to 104 4/32 in
response to the Group of Seven and to an Atlanta Fed report that
Southern manufacturing growth was slowing.
</P>
<P>
   John F. Smith Jr., chairman of General Motors, urged the Federal
Reserve to reduce interest rates to avert a recession.
</P>
<P>
   Anna Murdoch Leaves News Board
</P>
<P>
   Anna Murdoch, the estranged wife of News Corp. Chairman Rupert
Murdoch, has left the company's board. Murdoch has always said she
made a major contribution as a director and, should he die, she
could easily serve as chairman, until his adult children, whom he
is grooming to run the company, were ready. Wall Street had little
reaction.

   Russia Turns to Economic Veterans
</P>
<P>
   A half-dozen alumni of President Mikhail Gorbachev's varsity
economic squad are again at the center of Russia's economic policy
debate, commandeered by Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov to
recommend a reconstruction of the Russian economy.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expect Russia to default on up to $200 billion in
foreign debt next year, unless it can raise fresh funds or delay
payments.

   Economic Blows in Vigorous Mexico
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's once robust economy has been hit in recent weeks by an
18 percent drop in the peso's value, a 40 percent surge in interest

   Brazilian Market Regaining Footing

   Brazil's stock market appeared to regain equilibrium after

   Allied Signal Bid for AMP Advances
</P>
<P>
   Allied Signal's hostile $9.8 billion takeover battle for AMP, a
maker of electronic equipment, escalated, as investors owning 72
percent of AMP stock agreed to sell their shares to Allied Signal,
which said it would buy 40 million, or 18 percent. That would make
it the largest shareholder without setting off AMP's anti-takeover
provision.

 &HT;    Knees or not? Nicole Miller goes for cover-up
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Which came first: the ``chicken'' or the leg?
</P>
<P>
   Put another way: Are women prone by nature to prefer the modest
look of long skirts, or are the lower hemlines that will carry over
from this fall/winter season into spring/
</P>
<P>
   summer merely a designer dictate women follow against their
wishes?
</P>
<P>
   That's the question to ponder now that the spring/summer '99
women's wear previews are under way. And it's a question Nicole
Miller appears disinclined to answer definitively.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's show Monday led off this week of presentations by a
splinter group of New Yorkers daring to unveil their collections
before the Europeans get their chance. And rather than make a
declarative statement on hemlines, Miller sought a compromise
between her own preference for shorter skirts and the industry's
fixation with length.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're showing a lot of longer looks,'' Miller's national sales
manager, Lisa Brigham, said,``but we're not giving up on short.''
</P>
<P>
   If she's not giving up, Miller's collection of skirts and
dresses cut to the knee or midcalf indicate she's giving in. The
abundance of satiny ballerina shoes that Miller's models wore was
another sign that the designer who'd scoffed at flats during a
recent visit to her Lenox Square boutique can't resist following
the trends entirely.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's main fabrications were synthetics, and her colors of
choice were blue (pale, Pacific and ink), pistachio green and
pomegranate red. Her prints were floral, reptilian or wafflelike.
She designed a number of simple separates in stretch denim,
loosened the silhouette of Capri pants to make them look more like
gauchos and offered a large sampling of sweater sets with eyelet
detailing.
</P>
<P>
   Other designers showing collectively Monday at the Fashion
Coterie trade show were much more resolute in their adherence to
dominant trends.
</P>
<P>
   Clingy knit tops and dresses _ in cutting-edge synthetics or
cashmere _ and long skirts as well were everywhere. Rebecca
Danenberg, a New Yorker who's developed a star-studded clientele
that includes Courtney Love, Claire Danes and Jennifer Lopez,
showed knits that featured plunging necklines, sheer tanks under
matching, buttonless cardigans, hooded short-sleeved pullovers and
strapless body dresses.
</P>
<P>
   Diane von Furstenberg, who _ according to daughter Alexandra _
is ``still in discussion'' over whether to stage a runway show in
November, showed her trademark temptress dresses in subtle prints
shaded blue or pastel pink in either silk or jersey knit. Most
dresses were long enough to skim the calf, and all sleeves were
cropped just below the elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sweaters are tighter, skirts are looser and pants are
shorter,'' Julie Chaiken of Chaiken &AMP; Capone announced as she
sifted through racks of knits colored pink, purple, mint and
yellow, A-line skirts with elastic waistbands and drawstring pants
cropped at the ankles. ``Since skirts are getting roomier, you need
that tight sweater so you have something fitting close to the
body.''

DAUGHTER OF LAPD CHIEF HELD IN COCAINE STING
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attention Las Vegas editors.) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``n'' California news file.) 
BY PATRICK McGREEVY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The 37-year-old daughter of Los Angeles Police
Chief Bernard C. Parks has been booked in Las Vegas on suspicion of
felony sale of cocaine after she allegedly drove a car containing a
man who tried to sell drugs to an undercover police detective,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Parks was released on her own recognizance after her
booking Monday by a judge pending a Sept. 29 arraignment on charges
of conspiracy to sell cocaine and trafficking in the drug,
according to Scott Mitchell, chief deputy district attorney for the
Clark County District Attorney's Office.
</P>
<P>
   A clerk typist at the Los Angeles Police Department's Pacific
Division, Michelle Parks appeared in court after an arrest warrant
was issued stemming from an incident in Las Vegas on the evening of
June 24, 1998, court records indicate.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell said Michelle Parks allegedly drove a car containing
Reginald Gathwright, 21, to a movie theater parking lot at 9 p.m.,
where Gathwright allegedly tried to sell 20 grams of cocaine to an
undercover Las Vegas police detective.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor said his office will try to prove in court that
Parks knew that her passenger intended to sell cocaine and
therefore was a co-conspirator.
</P>
<P>
   The drug-trafficking charge carries two to 15 years in prison
and a fine of up to $100,000, said Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   Although those charged with the mid-level offense are not
eligible for probation, Mitchell said such cases are commonly
plea-bargained down to a charge where probation is possible.
</P>
<P>
   Gathwright and Parks were allowed to leave the scene after
meeting with an undercover detective but were stopped later by a
traffic officer who obtained their identification for the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, Parks allegedly told the Las Vegas police officer
that she was the daughter of the chief and an employee of the LAPD.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Steve Meriweather, a spokesman for the Las Vegas Metro
Police Department, refused to provide additional details.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an ongoing investigation being conducted by our narcotics
unit,'' said Meriweather, adding that providing details ``would
either prejudice her rights or jeopardize the case.''
</P>
<P>
   He denied that the refusal to provide details had anything to do
with the defendant's stature as daughter of the Los Angeles Police
Department chief.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Parks declined comment through a spokesman, saying the
case is not within the LAPD's jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Parks joined the LAPD as a civilian clerk typist in
August 1996, went out on medical leave after surgery in November
1997 and remains on medical leave, according to LAPD Cmdr. Dave
Kalish.
</P>
<P>
   Kalish said there is an internal administrative investigation
into the actions of the chief's daughter. The LAPD has a
zero-tolerance policy when it comes to drug crimes, so officials
said Parks could lose her job if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Parks is the fourth relative of the chief to face controversy
involving the law.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Chief Parks' other daughter, Trudy Jackson, admitted to
filing a false theft report with the LAPD after her estranged
husband took her car and did not return it.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1997, Parks' nephew Winston Parks was three days
from graduating from the Police Academy when he resigned after
being told he would be dismissed for failing to disclose being
arrested but not charged as a juvenile for theft.
</P>
<P>
   In July of this year, Parks' 32-year-old niece, Darcelle M.
Parks, was arrested on suspicion of credit card fraud and forgery
after she allegedly submitted a false application for a credit card
in the Los Angeles area.

AMERICAN LEAVING U.N. DEVELOPMENT POST

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The highest-ranking American in the U.N.
system, James Gustave Speth, administrator of the U.N. Development
Program, said Monday that he would be leaving the organization next
summer.
</P>
<P>
   European Union nations are expected to campaign for the job,
which has traditionally been held by an American. Among Europeans,
there is growing resentment against the United States, which owes
about $1.5 billion in unpaid assessments, while Europe shoulders
nearly half the organization's budget.
</P>
<P>
   The position is one of several that will open to international
competition in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   Speth, a founder of the World Resources Institute in Washington
and its president when he was appointed to the development agency
in 1993, will join Yale University as dean of the School of
Forestry and Environmental Studies.
</P>
<P>
   Under Speth's tenure, the agency expanded its work
significantly, from basic development projects to broad involvement
in fostering better government.

GM CHAIRMAN URGES RATE CUT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.)  (lb)

<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The chairman of General Motors Corp. publicly urged
the Federal Reserve Board on Monday to reduce interest rates _ part
of what is likely to be a series of such statements by top
Midwestern manufacturing executives.
</P>
<P>
   John F. Smith Jr., GM's chairman, said that spreading economic
troubles overseas could cause a recession in the United States if
the Fed did not lower rates soon. Lower short-term rates, which the
Fed controls, would stimulate the domestic economy and make it
easier for other countries to lower their rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is whether the Fed will wait until the recession
is imported and then act, or act now,'' Smith said at a meeting of
the Detroit Economic Club. ``GM believes it should act now.''
</P>
<P>
   In a separate news conference, Smith said that while he did not
have a specific rate cut in mind, ``about a half percent would be a
good move.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee will meet
on Sept. 29.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has always closely watched the
sales and other statistics of the steel and auto industries as a
gauge of the overall economy's health.

EDITORIAL: THE WALLACE PARADOX 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Sept. 15:
</P>
<P>
   George Wallace's was a fate not to be wished on any man. He
lived long enough to be a relic.
</P>
<P>
   In that regard, his passing invites our thoughts to stray to the
Gothic era in Southern politics, a time when it was sometimes hard
to draw a line between fact and fiction. The larger-than-life Huey
Long begets the fictional Willie Stark, and then suddenly out of
the Alabama outback springs this truculent little gamecock who
seemed concocted of their best and worst parts.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Kingfish, Wallace believed in books and schools, but he
had a dictator's heart that regarded his state's police and
treasury as personal assets. Like the hero of ``All the King's
Men,'' he believed that because he stood up for the downtrodden,
the rules of political morality and personal loyalty did not apply
to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an awful lot of mythology in Wallace's makeup, and
the best of it was that he identified with `the little man,'''
recalled Ray Jenkins, the former editor of The Alabama Journal and
a perceptive Wallace critic. But he added, ``The one thing that
ruled Wallace's life more than anything was political pragmatism.''
</P>
<P>
   There you have the tragedy of George Wallace in a nutshell. For
the sake of expediency, this progressive New Dealer of the '40s and
'50s transformed himself in the watershed year of 1963 into
America's foremost racist. He demonized the little people with
black skins in order to win the loyalty of those with white skins.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace's excuse was that race-baiting was the only way to win
in Alabama at that time, and that once in office he had installed
programs like free textbooks that helped poor whites and poor
blacks.
</P>
<P>
   He died in denial about the fact that the ``pragmatic'' step he
took to win the statehouse triggered a murder epidemic that took
the lives of 10 people who were either demonstrating for civil
rights or simply breathing in Alabama while being black.
</P>
<P>
   Yet on the day he surrendered the governorship for the last of
four times, old and broken, he told his son that he worried about
who would take care of the little people now. For all the manifest
failures and betrayals of his career, he still saw himself as a
person with a caring heart.
</P>
<P>
   This aspect of Wallace's life defined, in its most extreme form,
the dilemma that has haunted Southern populists throughout this
century. As the region's candidates shed the burden of racism and
moved into the national arena, this tension between means and
results, between noble motivations and seedy tactics, has become a
part of the national debate as well.
</P>
<P>
   Even when you take race out of the picture, where does a
candidate draw the line between pandering and leadership? If a
candidate intends to do good in office, what corners can be cut to
get there? Once elected, if an officeholder is serving the people,
how much should the public care about his finances, personal
behavior, the dispensation of patronage or legislative deal-making?
</P>
<P>
   Among Southern populists, this often destructive dichotomy
between elevated goals and personal weakness surfaced in the failed
career of the movement's founder, the Georgia congressman Tom
Watson.
</P>
<P>
   It shoots through the bifurcated career of Lyndon Johnson, the
first of the modern era's Southern populist presidents. The author
of the Great Society was also a stealer of elections known as
``Landslide Lyndon.'' To the end of his days, he thought his good
intentions on civil rights and the alleviation of poverty ought to
earn him forgiveness for the folly of the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   The next Dixie populist, Jimmy Carter, to earn the White House
avoided the corruption associated with Johnson and came closer than
any to maintaining the humanitarian purity of his vision. But even
he touched the dark side in his 1970 gubernatorial campaign, when
his supporters circulated racist pictures of a rich rival ridiculed
as ``Cufflinks Carl,'' and Carter sent a racial signal by promising
to have Wallace address the Georgia legislature.
</P>
<P>
   This regional political tradition is important in understanding
both the campaign style and the psychology of aggrievement that
drives our current president.
</P>
<P>
   Like Wallace, Lyndon Johnson and even Carter, Bill Clinton
believed that doing good in office may require getting gamy in the
campaign. Hence the use of private detectives to vilify hapless
women who made the mistake of doing sexual favors for the
candidate. Hence the psychology that casts health-care opponents as
right-wing conspirators and insists that the blame for the
president's lying under oath and his sexual indiscretions rests
with those who exposed the behavior rather than with the man who
committed it.
</P>
<P>
   None of this argues for screening the populist strain from
national politics. Shorn of its racial aberration, it represents,
along with Northeastern social-welfare progressivism, the nation's
most humane impulses toward the afflicted and the powerless. With
its emphasis on the little people and its agrarian roots, Southern
populism also serves as a healthy antidote to the money-driven
influence of corporations and Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   In Wallace's career, of course, all these high-minded elements
got overpowered by the twisting power of hate. His wrecked body
became a metaphor for what he had done to his soul in 1962 and
1970, his most famously racist campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Later this week, his self-harmed and ever-restless spirit will
go at last into the flat prairie country he loved. In a
demonstration of the healing efficacy of democracy, he will be
preached home by the black Alabamians he strove so mightily to harm
and the white citizens whose aspirations and angers he so
poignantly embodied.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace yearned to be remembered for paving the way for Southern
Democrats like Carter and Clinton and for Main Street Republicans
like Ronald Reagan. Even so, the unalterable verdict of history is
upon Wallace as a politician of inborn gifts whose career was
blighted by his opportunistic alignment with bigotry.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the larger lesson of his life for national politics may not
be one he would have imagined. He established Southern populism as
an important strain of the national political environment. He also
showed that while the populist mind-set is noble in its
aspirations, it tends toward paranoia and demagoguery in the hands
of those of variable character.

IRAQ ASSEMBLY THREATENS END TO INSPECTION COOPERATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The Iraqi Parliament, which diplomats often
consider an advance-warning system on Baghdad's policy, threatened
on Monday to stop all remaining cooperation with a U.N. arms
inspection system.
</P>
<P>
   In a vote after a long session, the 250-member National
Assembly, dominated by President Saddam Hussein's Baath Party,
demanded that the Security Council reverse its decision last week
to stop all reviews of sanctions until Iraq allows on-site
inspections to resume. Without sanctions reviews, Iraq can never
hope to escape from an embargo imposed in 1990 after its invasion
of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   If the council does not resume reviews, Parliament's speaker
said in a statement after the session, the assembly would ask the
government ``to cut all relations with the United Nations Special
Commission and not cooperate with it in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the State Department spokesman, James Rubin, said
the United States would ask the Security Council to take further
steps against Iraq if it suspended the activities of all weapons
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would constitute yet another flagrant violation of U.N.
Security Council resolutions and a direct challenge to the
authority of the council,'' he said at a daily briefing. ``In that
event, the council would have to consider further action.''
</P>
<P>
   The special commission, known as UNSCOM, is in charge of
dismantling prohibited Iraqi weapons systems and ensuring that the
country does not have the means to rebuild them. Stopped by Iraq on
Aug. 5 from making on-site inspections, the commission's experts
based in Baghdad are able to monitor Iraqi activities with
sophisticated video cameras and air, water and soil sampling
devices.
</P>
<P>
   But the Iraqis have already barred some follow-up inspections by
monitors from both the special commission, which keeps track of
biological, chemical and missile systems, and the International
Atomic Energy Agency, which watches nuclear issues, despite the
requirement that long-term monitoring be allowed to continue, not
only now but also after sanctions are lifted in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq also said on Aug. 5 that what monitoring goes on will be
permitted only as an ``interim'' gesture, pending Security Council
action. The council's resolution last week was that action.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some experts have always assumed that Iraq would dismantle the
long-term monitoring system at some point, or render it minimally
useful to the inspectors over the long term. U.N. officials say
unannounced or short-notice inspections are really the heart of any
monitoring system, however. Without the ability to follow
suspicions, the value of the commission's work is very much
diminished.
</P>
<P>
   UNSCOM has about 125 experts in Iraq, including 40 Chilean
helicopter pilots and crews used for aerial inspections. No U.N.
staff are armed. Their security is provided entirely by the Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
   In Baghdad on Monday the National Assembly also renewed threats
against British and U.S. inspectors, in what is apparently another
attempt to divide Security Council opinion by provoking Washington
and London.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago Iraq provoked a crisis by expelling all U.S.
inspectors, and the commission chairman, Richard Butler of
Australia, withdrew his team for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the U.S.-sponsored council resolution last week
suspending sanctions reviews, a decision by the United States to
begin broadcasting Radio Free Iraq into the country in Arabic from
Europe has upset the Iraqi leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Last week David Newton, U.S. ambassador to Iraq from 1984 to
1988, was named to head the new service, which hopes to broadcast
from Prague, pending agreement from the Czech government. Iraq has
asked the Czech government not to permit the broadcasts.

   JERICHO, West Bank _ In the shimmering heat of the desert, a
fancy new mirrored building, the Oasis, rises like a mirage on the
highway between Jerusalem and the Dead Sea.
</P>
<P>
   With a dash of Las Vegas and a sprinkle of Abu Dhabi, the Oasis,
which opens on Tuesday night, is Yasser Arafat's capitalist gamble:
a glitzy, Austrian-run casino that will cater to Israelis and bar
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first large, for-profit international investment in
Palestinian territory, a $50 million project intended to generate
millions in tax revenues for the cash-strapped Palestinian
Authority.
</P>
<P>
   The managing company, Casinos Austria, sees the Oasis as an
airtight bubble inside the contentious Middle East, a gilded palace
of slot machines and blackjack tables that _ with its lack of
windows and its heavy air conditioning _ could be anywhere in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come to a casino basically to forget about the
situation outside,'' said Alexander Tucek, the casino director.
</P>
<P>
   But the Oasis, ringed by a steel fence, directly faces a
hardscrabble refugee camp. And it sits at the edge of a sleepy
Muslim town of 20,000 whose fundamentalist residents, though they
live in the shadow of the biblical Mount of Temptation, disapprove
of gambling. It is a venture riddled with the contradictions of the
region.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli government, on religious grounds, forbids casinos,
but many Israelis love to gamble, flocking to Taba, Egypt, just
across the border from Eilat.
</P>
<P>
   They will be the customers, albeit somewhat begrudgingly because
of their anxieties about personal security.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian Authority, on the other hand, permits casinos,
but most Palestinians, on religious grounds, do not gamble. And if
they did, the Palestinian Authority, bowing to Islamic
fundamentalists, wouldn't let them in.
</P>
<P>
   They will be part of the work force, also somewhat begrudgingly,
because they have to reconcile their traditional values with their
economic needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a form of cooperation between Israelis and
Palestinians that the signers of the Oslo agreement didn't foresee
when they met on the White House lawn,'' said David Makovsky, the
diplomatic correspondent for the Israeli newspaper Haaretz.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the absurdist mix are scores of young Europeans who
man the gambling tables. They commute to Jericho from the large,
quasi-suburban Jewish settlement of Maale Adumim, where the casino
company provides them with housing, and they are somewhat oblivious
to the great divide they cross daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite a nice bubble in here, actually,'' said Ian McCann,
28, a casino inspector from Manchester, England.
</P>
<P>
   For the depressed residents of Jericho proper _ the oldest city
in the world _ the casino offers a Hobson's choice. Jobs there pay
almost double the wages of day labor in Israel, when it can be had.
But for some they are tainted jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be frank, we are not proud to say we work in the casino,''
said Mazen, 21, a janitor at Oasis who would not give his last
name. ``All the neighbors say, `Better you should starve,' that
it's dirty money. But what's my option? I have a B.A. in accounting
and I'm unemployed.''
</P>
<P>
   Squatting on a box in her convenience store, Umohammed Merayi
said: ``Why is Israel refusing the casinos and we are permitting? I
hope by God's will that this place will be destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   And hers was by no means the strongest antipathy in town.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a small town, a peaceful people, mostly Puritans,''
said Saeb Erekat, a close adviser to Arafat and a Jericho resident.
``We're scared that this will bring crime, mafia, drugs,
prostitution.''
</P>
<P>
   The casino is the first part of a planned resort complex.
Investors include Casinos Austria, which is partly owned by the
Austrian government, several European investors and some
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   One-third of the shares are indirectly held by the Austrian
National Bank, and the deal was cemented during a visit to Austria
by Arafat. A Palestinian official said a company owned by Arafat's
economic adviser, Khaled Salaam, held an almost 30 percent share,
but Casinos Austria representatives said Salaam was not a
shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   After the initial investment is recovered, the Palestinian
Authority will take 25 percent to 30 percent of the casino's
revenues in taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Tawfiz Nuweiser, a store owner who is Christian, is a minority
voice in Jericho. He says his neighbors should welcome anything
that brings the town back to life.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've heard of the Dead Sea?'' he said, sitting in front of a
row of Johnnie Walker Scotch bottles and musing about conditions
since the Palestinian uprising that began in late 1987. ``We are
the dead town. Before the intifada, Israelis used to come here all
the time. Then they started to be afraid. Forget about Netanyahu
and Arafat. Let us make peace between people. Or at least we can
take their money.''

ALLEN QUITS FOR TRACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA's young secondary got considerably younger
Monday when reserve cornerback Damian Allen quit the team to
concentrate on his track career.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came in (and said), `Coach, my heart's not in it,''' Bruins
coach Bob Toledo said. ``There was no way I was going to talk (him)
out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen, a third-year sophomore, finished second in the 100 meters
and third in the 200 meters at the Pac-10 championships in May. But
he was better on the track than on the field. Heavily recruited at
Damien High School in LaVerne _ Nebraska offered a scholarship _
Allen never seemed comfortable with the defense and shied from
contact.
</P>
<P>
   His departure means junior Ryan Roques, a former tailback, is
the top reserve cornerback behind starters Marques Anderson and
Jason Bell. In addition, the Bruins probably will use true freshman
Julius Williams, who expected to redshirt, as the No. 4 cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Julius will have to play,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Rookie update: The most impressive true freshman against
Texas wasn't tailback DeShaun Foster, who rushed for 44 yards and a
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Linebacker) Robert Thomas played really well,'' Toledo said.
``Looking at the tape ... he's going to be a super player. He made
some instinctive plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite a broken right hand and limited snaps, Thomas, a reserve
inside linebacker, made three tackles. Expect his playing time to
increase Saturday at Houston. The same goes for reserve nose guard
Ken Kocher, whose size and strength are desperately needed on the
young defensive line. If Kocher's tender ankle holds, he'll play
plenty.
</P>
<P>
   __ Injury update: Fullback Craig Walendy (allergic reaction to
bug bites) is questionable for Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Also, left guard Oscar Cabrera is out several weeks with a
sprained right ankle. Cabrera suffered the injury in the first
quarter Saturday and was replaced by Matt Phelan.
</P>
<P>
   With Phelan starting, junior college transfer James Ghezzi
becomes the top reserve at both tackle and guard. Josh Webb, who
switched from defense two weeks ago, is learning to play right
tackle. David Wilford (tackle), Ed Anderson (guard) and Troy Danoff
(center) are available if needed.
</P>
<P>
   __ It didn't matter, but ...: The Bruins appeared to have a
second-quarter touchdown, or safety, when linebacker Brendan
Ayanbadejo knocked the ball from Texas quarterback Richard Walton
near the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   It rolled into the end zone, where UCLA's Micah Webb and Texas'
Roger Roesler fought for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit the quarterback and out of the corner of my eye I saw
the ball roll into the end zone and a pile of guys jump on it,''
Ayanbadejo said. ``I thought, `Sweet, it's a safety or touchdown.'
''
</P>
<P>
   The officials saw differently, awarding Texas possession at its
1.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the worst call I've ever seen,'' Ayanbadejo said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Same play, different result: Tailback Jermaine Lewis' 7-yard
touchdown run came on the same off-tackle play (called Power 2) as
his botched fourth-and-1 attempt last year at Washington State.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of turning upfield before the hole developed, Lewis
stayed behind his blockers and eventually found a huge opening over
right tackle.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a difference a year makes and what a difference a play
makes,'' Lewis said. ``As soon as it went wrong (last year), the
coaches lodged it in my head not to do that again.''

READER'S DIGEST TO SELL ART AT PUBLIC AUCTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By GERALDINE FABRIKANT and CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The financially troubled Reader's Digest Association,
owner of an exceptional art collection, will be selling an
estimated $100 million worth of Impressionist and 20th-century
works by masters like Cezanne, Monet, Modigliani and Matisse at
public auction in New York in November, several experts close to
the negotiations said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   While both Sotheby's and Reader's Digest refused to comment, art
experts said that the York Avenue auction house had been chosen to
sell the works in a special evening sale during the height of the
fall art season. The auction is a big coup for Sotheby's, which
competed fiercely for it against archrival Christie's.
</P>
<P>
   But the choice, experts said, was an obvious one, since
Sotheby's has been working with Reader's Digest for years, doing
its appraisals and last May selling two paintings _ a Monet and a
van Gogh _ which totaled $6.2 million. Around the same time,
Reader's Digest also sold a Braque still life privately.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, the best of Reader's Digest art holdings _ works
carefully collected by the publisher's founders Lila Acheson
Wallace and her husband DeWitt Wallace since the 1940s _ will be up
for sale. The highlights of the collection include two Modigliani
portraits, a Matisse still life, a Cezanne landscape, two Monets _
a landscape the artist painted while he was at Vetheuil and one of
the artist's famous waterlilies _ and a Van Gogh, which the artist
painted in Auvers-sur-Oise in 1890.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to sell this season is partly timed to take
advantage of the strong prices realized at auctions of the last
several years. The company is hardly the first corporation to sell
its art at Sotheby's. In recent years both IBM and CBS, under
financial pressure, sold parts of their collections. IBM's most
valuable American paintings brought record prices when they were
offered three years ago. CBS also made money selling about 100
works of contemporary art two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But Reader's Digest is under enormous pressure to improve its
performance because the company's results have been very
disappointing over the last several years.
</P>
<P>
   Today, under its new chairman and chief executive, Thomas Ryder,
its financial situation is somewhat better than several months ago,
when it had a negative net worth. Not only has it sold some art,
but it has laid off some staff and closed some operations. Still,
its $100 million in cash is a far cry from the flush days when the
Reader's Digest balance sheet carried $700 million in cash. At its
late 1992 high, the stock traded at $56.375 a share. It closed
Monday at $17.6875.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company can meet its debt obligations, but they need
capital to fund new ventures,'' said Mandana Hormozi, an analyst at
Lazard Freres and Co.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hormozi and other analysts greeted the news of the pending
sale of art as a positive for the company and noted that Ryder had
said a sale was likely and that nothing was any longer sacred at
the company. The previous chief executive, George Grune, had been
reluctant to sell the collection.
</P>
<P>
   Though analysts are impressed with Ryder's no-nonsense approach
_ not only has he already sold several pieces of art, he has also
sold the corporate jet _ Reader's Digest's problems are deep.
</P>
<P>
   The books and home entertainment products are still not getting
strong responses to mailings, Ms. Hormozi said. And the revenue for
the magazine is down, in large part due to currency fluctuations.
In addition, Reader's Digest failed to meet its rate base to
advertisers of 15 million readers in 1998, delivering 14.7 million.
Under these circumstances it is not unusual for publications to
give advertisers free space to compensate for the readers they paid
for but did not get.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hormozi said that she had scaled back her expectations for
fiscal 1999, which will end June 30, from strong growth to moderate
growth. However she and other analysts said they were waiting to
hear Ryder's extensive presentation to analysts scheduled for
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The company has a unique structure. About 71 percent of its
voting stock is held by two charitable foundations established by
the Wallaces. Underneath the big foundations are seven charitable
funds, each of which supports a major cultural institution. The
funds once owned a total of 42 percent of the nonvoting shares.
However, Reader's Digest cut its dividend last year, and with the
stock doing poorly, some foundations lobbied for, and received, the
right to sell some stock.

BERG MIGHT SLIP AWAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Restricted free-agent defenseman Aki Berg
said Monday he's close to signing a new contract but not with the
Los Angeles Kings.
</P>
<P>
   Berg, the third player chosen in the 1995 NHL draft, said he is
close to a deal with TPS, his former team in his native Finland. He
is scheduled to fly Wednesday to Finland and also is believed to be
receiving interest from another Finnish team and one in Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   Berg added that he has not given up on playing for the Kings
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully,'' Berg, 21, said through a translator when reached
by telephone in Ottawa. ``I've always wanted to play for the Kings.
But right now, it seems like it's not in the cards at all.''
</P>
<P>
   A source close to Berg said that among the Kings' offers is a
one-year contract for $467,500, which represents a 10-percent raise
on last season's base salary of $425,000.
</P>
<P>
   A 10-percent raise is the minimum allowed by the NHL
collective-bargaining agreement for a player with his experience.
Berg, who had no goals and eight assists last year, has played 164
games in three seasons with the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   Berg and his agent, Larry Kelly, said he deserves to be paid in
excess of the $825,000 he earned last season when factoring in a
portion of the $1 million bonus he received for first signing with
the Kings in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``How we decided to structure the compensation is irrelevant,''
Kelly said of the original contract. ``There's no way in the world
he would accept less than $825,000.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kings general manager Dave Taylor said he views signing
bonuses and base salary as separate, and the 10-percent rule does
apply only to base salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll continue to try to work out a deal with him,'' Taylor
said.
</P>
<P>
   Berg said he is not sure he can get a contract in Europe that
would leave him an out if he eventually comes to terms with the
Kings but added he'd be willing to sign a deal lacking such a
clause. If Berg were to play even one game in Europe after the Oct.
9 start of the NHL season, then sign with the Kings, he would have
to clear waivers before rejoining them. And that almost certainly
would not happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he plays over there at any time after the start of the
(NHL) season,'' Taylor said, ``he won't be coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   Berg insisted his goal is to play in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big disappointment,'' he said. ``I've been training
hard.... And it's the best league in the world. But I'm going to
play 80 or 90 games for TPS and the Finnish national team, 30
minutes a game, so I don't think this will ruin my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Movement has been minimal, as well, in negotiations with the
other unsigned Kings: defenseman Rob Blake, goalie Jamie Storr and
enforcer Matt Johnson.

COMMENTARY: CONTRITION DOESN'T RIGHT ALL WRONGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By CLYDE HABERMAN  
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The First Supplicant was back in town Monday, and for
the usual reason. He needed money.
</P>
<P>
   Do you ever get the feeling that President Clinton looks upon
New York as nothing but an ATM, to be tapped when he or the
national Democratic Party needs a cash infusion, which is often? It
seems only fair for the city to take a cue from some banks and
charge a fee for the privilege, given all the police overtime and
other costs that it must cover whenever Clinton finds himself a few
dollars short.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it might not be a bad idea if City Hall toted up in
advance the extra expenses anticipated for a presidential visit,
and then sent Clinton a check for that amount, on the condition
that he stay home. Taxpayers would lose nothing, and there would be
some obvious benefits. Traffic in midtown would be less ferocious,
to name one.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving money out of it, the president could not have picked a
more congenial spot than New York for his first foray outside
Washington since Kenneth Starr sent his report on the Lewinsky
affair to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   One could perhaps accuse him of having a tin ear in staging a
fund-raiser Monday in the 42nd Street theater where ``The Lion
King'' is playing. Did it not dawn on anyone at the White House
that the tabloids could have a field day with headlines about ``The
Lyin' King''? But that glitch aside, New York provided as welcoming
a place as a confessed sinner could desire.
</P>
<P>
   This is, after all, a live-and-let-live town, where people don't
much care what their neighbors do as long as it doesn't scare the
horses, to borrow from Mrs. Patrick Campbell, the actress.
</P>
<P>
   What better time for a penitent to come than the week when the
liturgical focus in Roman Catholic churches is on the tale of the
prodigal son? Or when, in a city that still responds to the
imperatives of the Jewish calendar, the High Holy Days of
self-reflection and atonement are about to begin?
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that a quick poll in The Daily News over the weekend is
not crazy, 77 percent of New Yorkers are willing to forgive Clinton
and want him to finish his term. Wall Street certainly showed that
the Starr report was not making it flinch. In the last two trading
days, the Dow Jones industrial average has climbed 330 points.
</P>
<P>
   But while basking in a warm New York glow, the president would
have been well warned that here, as elsewhere, contrition has its
limits. Apologies do not absolve all sins, even when they are
offered right away and with apparent feeling, not on the
installment plan that Clinton has preferred.
</P>
<P>
   Despite vast differences in the circumstances, the president
might consider the case of a New York police officer, Joseph
Locurto. Along with two city firefighters, this officer has been
suspended for having been among the geniuses in Broad Channel,
Queens, who put on blackface and rode in a Labor Day float that
mocked the vicious killing of a black man in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Locurto was a study in contrition on Saturday. Pleading that he
was not a racist, he said: ``I made a mistake, and I apologize for
it.'' This was, mind you, a full-throated apology, not the
mealy-mouthed locution often favored by politicians, the one in
which they say they are sorry if they have offended anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I did was wrong,'' Locurto said forthrightly. ``I admit
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani wants the policeman and the
firefighters to be dismissed, not just suspended.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has praised Locurto for having apologized. He also
agrees that city employees have an ``absolute right'' to be
offensive while off duty. But Giuliani argued Monday that the
citizens of New York also have rights. One of them is to make sure
that ``the power of life and death'' is not put in the hands of
someone who shows he has no ``mature understanding of how to relate
to human beings of all sorts of different races and backgrounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Count on the New York Civil Liberties Union fighting the mayor
hard on this one, while waving the banner of the First Amendment.
The civil libertarians just might win. Giuliani strikes out in the
courts more often than not in cases of this type. That having been
said, many New Yorkers no doubt agree when he says that statements
of contrition from one who has seriously sinned should carry only
so much weight.
</P>
<P>
   It is a lesson that the supplicant president, too, might wish to
absorb.

<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton has chosen two or perhaps three ministers to
serve as a team of personal spiritual advisers that will meet and
pray with him weekly and help him resist what one of the ministers
calls ``the temptations that have conquered'' the president in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton phoned the ministers and asked them for their help on
Labor Day evening, as he and the nation were preparing for the
report that Kenneth Starr delivered to Congress two days later
concerning the president's relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The ministers, the White House has confirmed, include two
formidable evangelical preachers: the Rev. Tony Campolo, an
outspoken liberal Baptist from Pennsylvania known for his ministry
to urban youth and for controversial books advocating Christian
acceptance of homosexuality, and the Rev. Gordon MacDonald, senior
pastor of a nondenominational Christian church, Grace Chapel, in
Lexington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Since admitting a month ago that he had had an inappropriate
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, Clinton has been struggling to
persuade the American people that he seriously regrets it and is
taking steps to repent and reform. Both Campolo and MacDonald were
defensive about the possible appearance that Clinton had selected
them as part of political damage control.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are those who will say that Gordon and I are being used
and manipulated,'' Campolo said in a statement. ``Should this be
true, it would not be the first time that Christians have been
taken in. But we would rather be men of faith who believe that God
is working in the life of the president than to join that army of
cynics, many of whom are religious leaders, who cannot accept a
plea for forgiveness at face value.''
</P>
<P>
   By his own account, MacDonald has faced his own sin and sought
redemption. Twelve years ago, while president of a major mission
agency, he admitted to an extramarital affair, resigned his
position and left the ministry. He returned to the ministry after
two years and later wrote a book, ``Rebuilding Your Broken World,''
about his experience.
</P>
<P>
   That book, which the president told MacDonald he had read twice,
is one reason Clinton selected him for spiritual guidance,
MacDonald said in a sermon to his congregation on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Such informal groups of spiritual advisers, sometimes called
``accountability circles,'' are not uncommon among Christian
evangelicals, particularly among leaders of large churches and
organizations. Men _ and it is more often men _ meet regularly with
a small group of peers to pray and provide support for those facing
personal crises. A circle of three men, named by the elders of
Grace Chapel, met with MacDonald weekly after he confessed his
adulterous relationship, and eventually helped restore him to the
ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bring an understanding of what it is like to face the public
scrutiny when one has sinned,'' MacDonald said in his sermon. ``I
have gone through, and continue to go through, the breaking
process. I have known both the remarkable grace of forgiving,
restorative people and the lash of those who choose other options.
I am in a position to talk the language of repentance and what it
takes to find a deeper and more purposeful walk with God in the
midst of a personal tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House did not announce, but has confirmed, the
president's arrangement with the ministers. MacDonald mentioned it
in his most recent Sunday sermon, and Campolo, after consulting
with the White House staff, made available a statement through
Eastern College in St. Davids, Pa., where he is a professor of
sociology. Both have said they will not grant interviews. A third
minister, alluded to in McDonald's sermon, has not publicly
identified himself.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the president seeks pastoral guidance, he is bringing in
new legal and political advisers in anticipation of possible
impeachment hearings.
</P>
<P>
   The White House plans to announce this week the hiring of
several lawyers and advisers to shore up relations with restive
Democrats on Capitol Hill and to devise a new legal strategy as the
investigation of the president moves from the courthouse to the
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Among those expected to be part of the White House defense team
are Gregory Craig, a senior State Department official with
extensive contacts in Congress, and Peter Kadzik, the private
lawyer for John Podesta, White House deputy chief of staff. Several
current and former members of Congress are also being enlisted to
assist in the White House damage-control effort, which will be
directed by Podesta and Lawrence Stein, the White House director of
legislative affairs.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear Monday whether the new advisers would be on the
White House payroll or serve more informally as outside
consultants.
</P>
<P>
   David Kendall, Clinton's lead personal lawyer, has in essence
been demoted and will play a much less central role in formulating
the future response to the impeachment report of Starr, the White
House independent counsel. White House aides expressed deep
disappointment Monday in Kendall's defense of the president in a
press briefing on Friday and in a television appearance on Sunday.
They said that the time for legalistic hairsplitting was past and
that the president's case would now be made by advisers with more
sensitive political antennae.
</P>
<P>
   Also mentioned as possible additions to the White House
damage-control squad are two former aides with experience on
Capitol Hill, Steve Ricchetti and Susan Anne Brophy.
</P>
<P>
   Campolo and MacDonald, the president's new spiritual advisers,
say they are concerned only with his spiritual _ and not political
_ redemption.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least one of us will meet with the president weekly,''
Campolo said in his statement. ``We will pray with him, study
Scripture together, and do our best to help him as he searches his
heart and soul. We want him to understand what went wrong with him
personally that led to the tragic sins that have so marred his life
and the office of the presidency. We want to provide all the help
that we can to spiritually strengthen him against yielding to the
temptations that have conquered him in the past.''

   ``Be assured,'' Campolo said, ``that we will not offer what the
German martyr Dietrich Bonhoeffer called `cheap grace''; cheap
grace takes sin lightly and does not call for repentance and
change. But neither do we come in a spirit of loveless
condemnation.''

   Campolo, a minister with the American Baptist Churches USA,

said James Dunn, executive director of the Baptist Joint Committee

   ``If they thought he needed the kind of help that was more than
they could give,'' Dunn said, ``they would be the first to suggest
it.''

MONDAY NIGHT GAMES LOSE HOUR, TAVERN ATTENDANCE, L.A. BAR OWNERS
SAY
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The hour-earlier start of Monday Night Football may have East
Coast tavern owners cheering wildly, but their counterparts in the
West think someone fumbled the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Area bar operators who traditionally have counted on Mondays
during football season for a large chunk of their income say
business has dropped as much as 25 percent because of the new 5:10
p.m. game start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say we're probably down 15 to 20 percent,'' said Dave
Flemming, general manager of the Corbin Bowl Sports Bar in Tarzana,
a Los Angeles suburb. ``It seems like (previous customers are) just
(going) straight home and are not coming out.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Football League agreed this year to start its
showcase Monday night games an hour earlier to appease East Coast
viewers who have complained that previous years' games ended too
late.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with kickoffs at just after 8 p.m. in the East, a typical
game will end in time for viewers to watch their local 11 p.m. news
or get home from the neighborhood bar before midnight.
</P>
<P>
   The change may be good for business for bars out East, West
Coast bar owners say, but the new kickoff is just too close to
quitting time for many people.
</P>
<P>
   George Salameh, owner of The Bull's Eye Grill &AMP; Tavern in
Northridge, an L.A. suburb, said he saw a nearly 25 percent drop in
business during this season's first Monday Night Football game
Sept. 7. Before the change, the Monday night crowd accounted for up
to 20 percent of Salameh's weekly revenues.
</P>
<P>
   This year, people are ``just getting out of work, they don't
have time to go to a local tavern and watch the game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the quality of competition doesn't have anything to do
with the smaller crowds. The Labor Day game was between the Denver
Broncos _ who won the Super Bowl in January and is considered one
of the best teams this year _ and the New England Patriots, a
playoff team last season. Monday's game was between the San
Francisco 49ers and the Washington Redskins, two of the NFL's most
popular teams.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Tracy, owner of the MVP Sports Bar and Grill in Simi
Valley, Calif., said it's still too early to tell how much business
will fall because of the time change.
</P>
<P>
   But he fears it could drop as much as 20 percent, in part
because the tavern offers electronic interactive football games in
which patrons compete with other bars across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys that have been playing for years, it's very
difficult for them to play and have a fair chance, because the game
now starts an hour earlier,'' said Tracy. ``So it causes a pretty
big problem for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Tracy said that those responsible for the time change could have
kept in mind the needs of West Coast football fans who are just
getting out of work at kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could have done a happy medium and maybe started the game
at 5:30,'' said Tracy.
</P>
<P>
   Business also has dropped a little bit at The Broiler in
Northridge, but not enough to worry manager Chris Watson too much.
</P>
<P>
   Some fans, he said, seem to be waiting until about the game's
third or fourth quarter to show up at the bar. ``The crowd still
comes, but it's just a later crowd,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But since they're coming later, they're buying less. ``There's
less money spent,'' he conceded.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating the change, The Broiler and other area taverns are
offering dinner specials or other promotions to entice customers to
stay longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game used to do it pretty much, but you have to
improvise,'' said Watson.
</P>
<P>
   Salameh said he thinks fans will adjust to the change and start
coming back to the Bull's Eye to catch the games on his big-screen
television or the seven other TVs scattered throughout the tavern.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's not going to bring it up to the same volume that
we've had in past years,'' said Salameh said.
</P>
<P>
   Flemming said Corbin Bowl doesn't depend to a great extent on
Monday night crowds so his business will do OK, even though
attendance at this year's first Monday game dropped about 25
percent from the previous year's.
</P>
<P>
   The tavern has a number of bowling leagues and other activities
that bring in paying customers. ``It's just a small part of
business,'' Flemming said about the Monday Night Football crowd.
``It's not going to crush the bar.'' &QL;

BRAZILIAN STOCKS REBOUND, EASING PANIC SOMEWHAT
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ The Brazilian stock market on Monday
appeared to regain equilibrium after dizzying losses last week,
shored up by higher interest rates, government stock purchases and
suggestions that the International Monetary Fund would step in to
prevent disaster.
</P>
<P>
   But without a government program to reduce the swollen budget
deficit, the Brazilian economy appears caught in a race against
time, pitting investors' nervousness toward emerging markets
against the approach of national elections on Oct. 4.
</P>
<P>
   In Sao Paulo, the benchmark Bovespa index closed up 7.79 percent
Monday, after a rise of 13.39 percent on Friday. Given a loss of
15.82 percent Thursday and persistent, lesser losses earlier,
Friday's and Monday's bounces were encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   But the flow of dollars out of the country continued unabated,
with some $1.6 billion in cash reserves leaving on Friday. By
Monday, that had slowed, with market informants saying that $410
million had left foreign exchange coffers by 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly it's a reprieve, but a clear indication of turning
the corner would embody structural fiscal reforms as well as
stabilization in the international arena,'' said Lawrence Goodman,
chief economist at Santander Investment. Those, he said, were
unlikely before President Fernando Henrique Cardoso runs for
re-election next month. ``Don't hold your breath,'' Goodman
remarked.
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday, the central bank increased the ceiling on
interest rates to 49.75 percent from 29.75 percent, the second rise
in less than 10 days. The next day, IMF officials said that as much
as $15 billion could be made available for Brazil in an emergency.
While Brazilian officials had not formally requested such aid, the
offer was seen as insurance against a currency devaluation or
default, and recognition that Brazil's economy, with $27 billion in
loans from U.S. banks, was too important for Washington to do
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are reducing the probabilities of a default and a major
devaluation,'' said Edmar Bacha, president of BBA Securities.
``Foreign investors were taken by panic in Russia, and they don't
want to be taken by surprise again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that the economy has turned the corner, but there's a
reversal as people reassess the probability of failure versus the
probability of success,'' Bacha added.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, investment analysts said, the government-run
National Bank for Economic and Social Development buoyed stocks on
Friday by buying up a larger-than-average volume of shares.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the bank declined to provide figures, but said
the purchases were not intended to raise stock prices. ``We're
always buying and selling,'' she said. ``What happened was simply
that the price dropped so low that it was a good time to buy. When
the price goes up, we'll sell.''
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, the steps appeared to calm panic. On the
black market, dollars were selling for 1.35 reais Monday, down from
1.45 on Thursday. In currency market trading late Monday, the
dollar sold just under 1.18 reais.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some voices have risen here suggesting that Cardoso should match
the promises of help with word of specific fiscal changes that his
government will seek from Congress after the elections. Cardoso,
whose main opponent in the race, Luis Inacio Lula da Silva of the
leftist Workers Party, has tried to play down the extent of changes
that will be necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Ricardo Steinbruch, president of the Vicunha textile group, the
second largest in the country, said the president feared that
disclosing post-election austerity measures now would ``become
ammunition for the other side.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, industry has supported the measures that Cardoso has
ventured to take, despite the difficulty that high interest rates
represent. Official unemployment is expected to reach 10 percent
next year, double last year's level, and expectations of growth
have slowed to 1 to 2 percent for this year and next.
</P>
<P>
   ``Preserving the victories gained through stability and the
transformations that flow from it have to be the priority of the
government and of society as a whole,'' Arthur Joao Donato, acting
president of the National Confederation of Industry.
</P>
<P>
   But Donato added that administrative, social security and tax
reform would have to come soon. If the higher interest rates
prevail through December, they will drive up public debt by $20
billion. Even before the increases, the deficit was expected to
reach 8 percent of the gross national product by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   The president does appear to have room for a more forceful
stance. According to polls, the economic turbulence has only
bolstered Cardoso's standing. Voters largely consider him the
candidate best equipped to confront economic uncertainty, and say
they would accept government cutbacks to support the currency.
</P>
<P>
   The Real Plan, named for the new currency it introduced, has
resulted in nominal inflation, compared with 2,400 percent at its
peak.
</P>
<P>
   In the most recent survey last week, 47 percent of Brazilians
said they would vote for Cardoso, up from 44 percent two weeks ago.
da Silva's standing in the same period dropped to 23 percent from
25 percent.

 &HT;    Braves clinch in comeback
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- A team restless over a second season still two weeks
away paused for a few moments Monday night to salute itself. The
Braves clinched the National League East and an unprecedented
seventh straight postseason berth.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Tucker and Chipper Jones each hit solo homers as the
Braves came from behind twice to beat Philadelphia 4-2, giving the
Braves four wins in five games but, with some relief, a title they
had been favored to win since around last Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Glavine worked a 2-2 game through the sixth but was the
winning pitcher over Curt Schilling to become the league's first
19-game winner.
</P>
<P>
   If the Braves downplayed the moment, so did the crowd. Just
33,367 paid to witness this history at Turner Field, some 17,000
less than capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta took its first lead on Jones' homer in the sixth,
putting the Braves up 3-2. The home run was Jones' 33 of the year,
the most by a Braves third baseman since Darrell Evans hit 41 in
1973.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker, who had hit just one home run the entire second half,
drove a 1-1 pitch over the wall in right for his 13th homer of the
season to tie it 2-2 in the fifth. That left Tucker 3-for-9
lifetime versus Schilling, all three hits homers. The Phillies had
taken a 2-1 lead in the top of the inning when Wendall McGee's
two-out single drove in Scott Rolen.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta tied it 1-1 in the fourth and only Schilling kept it
from getting worse. Jones opened the inning with his 27th double
and after Andres Galarraga went down swinging for the second
straight at-bat, Ryan Klesko delivered an opposite field double to
left, scoring Jones. The double was Klesko second in three games,
giving him five RBIs in a span of 10 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   But Schilling left Klesko standing on second, ending the inning
by striking out Javy Lopez and getting a groundout from Andruw
Jones. Still, the single run was a moral victory. The Braves scored
as many earned runs off Schilling in the first four innings than
they had in two April starts (18 innings) early in the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies had Glavine figured early, racking up four hits,
including two doubles, in the first two innings, which matched
total he had yielded in his last start in Montreal. The Braves were
fortunate to trail just 1-0, Glavine stranding five men in the
first four innings, three of them in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies took the lead in the first, after Desi Relaford
singled and stole second without a throw, Lopez losing his grip on
the ball. Two batters later, Rico Brogna waited out a full count
before ripping a line drive over Andruw Jones' head to the wall in
center for a RBI double.

   The news came in the company's annual report, in which Murdoch
reviewed the events of the year and thanked his wife for her
contribution as a board member. The report was released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The couple are in the midst of a divorce, and although it was
originally said to be amicable, one associate of Murdoch said
Monday that it appeared to be less amicable than had been reported.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview several years ago, Murdoch had said that in the
case of his death, his wife could easily serve as chairman until
his children were old enough to take over.
</P>
<P>
   In her own right, Mrs. Murdoch is a novelist, who has published
``Family Business'' and ``In Her Own Image.'' She is 54 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Murdoch, 67, has three children: Lachlan, 27, Elizabeth, 30, and
James, 25. Murdoch is grooming all of them to run the company.
</P>
<P>
   Murdoch owns 31 percent of News Corp.'s voting stock and has
made no secret about his hopes to have his children take over.
</P>
<P>
   According to one person close to Murdoch, he has said that the
stock is in a trust for the children, and not part of his own
assets. That has helped mitigate Wall Street's reaction to the
divorce, where it appears to have had relatively little impact so
far. News Corp. stock closed at $25.4375 a share, down from its
52-week high of $33.50 on July 21, but far above its 52-week low of
$17 a share in October.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman said the company could have a further announcement
this week about the divorce settlement, but declined to be
specific.
</P>
<P>
   However, Murdoch appears to be under some pressure to meet his
estranged wife's requirements in the settlement. He has put their
home on Angelo Drive in Los Angeles up for sale, with a price of
$19.5 million. He paid roughly $6 million for the house in 1991. At
that time, he sold his Fifth Avenue apartment in New York and
leased a smaller residence on Central Park South.
</P>
<P>
   Though he sold his home in Aspen, Colo., several years ago, he
still owns a ranch in Carmel, Calif., and a sailboat. However,
Murdoch has never been known as a man who poured millions into art
collections or other costly holdings. A workaholic, he travels to
his company's far-flung businesses frequently.

 &HT;    Hispanic, black freshmen gain ground at UT
 &HT;    By Mary Ann Roser
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN -- The University of Texas, trying to build a diverse
student body without affirmative action, enrolled slightly more
black and Hispanic freshmen this fall, indicating that a law
requiring state colleges to admit freshmen in the top 10 percent of
their high school class could be helping.
</P>
<P>
   However, official head counts done on the 12th day of classes
were not available Monday from other state universities, and the UT
data are open to interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear at UT is that a higher percentage of black and
Hispanic freshmen came from the ranks of the top 10 percent than
those enrolled in the past two years. The 1997 Legislature passed
the law to combat declines in black and Hispanic enrollments at the
state's premier universities, the result of a 1996 federal court
ruling that effectively ended affirmative action in admissions,
scholarships and other student programs.
</P>
<P>
   UT's medical and dental schools, meanwhile, have made
significant gains in Hispanic and African American enrollments
since the so-called Hopwood ruling and admitted a first-year class
similar to what they had in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``By broadening the scope of who we invited in for interviews
and by looking at a number of different factors . . . we were able
to reach a level of diversity close to the pre-Hopwood years,''
said Budge Mabry, director of the medical and dental applications
center for the UT System.
</P>
<P>
   Among undergraduate freshmen, UT-Austin enrolled 198 blacks, or
2.9 percent, of the entering class of 6,744 students, and 891
Hispanics, or 13.2 percent of the class.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when the Hopwood ruling fully took effect, UT
enrolled 190 blacks, or 2.7 percent of 7,085 freshmen, and 892
Hispanics, or 12.6 percent. That compared with 266 blacks, or 4.1
percent, of 6,430 freshmen in 1996, and 932 Hispanics, or 14.5
percent, of the total.
</P>
<P>
   UT Admissions Director Bruce Walker attributed this year's
modest increases to the new top-10-percent law, along with stepped
up recruitment efforts and minority-targeted scholarships offered
for the first time by the private UT Ex-Students' Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can now walk into any high school in Texas and know,
without a doubt, there is a group of students who are qualified to
be in UT-Austin,'' Walker said. ``We're headed in the right
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The top-10-percent law was seen as a way to boost African
American and Hispanic enrollments _ groups historically
underrepresented in Texas higher education _ because there are many
public high schools in Texas dominated by students in those two
groups. Only grades go into figuring a student's class rank;
college entrance exam scores are not considered.
</P>
<P>
   About 42 percent of the freshmen enrolled at UT-Austin were in
the top 10 percent of their high school class. Of the 198 black
freshmen, 73, or 36. 9 percent, were top-10-percent students. Among
891 Hispanic freshmen, 436, or 48.9 percent, were in that category.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 28.4 percent of the blacks were in the top 10 and
41.9 percent of the Hispanics were. That compares with 35 percent
of black freshmen in 1996 and 43.8 percent of Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   At UT's four medical schools, 40 blacks were in this fall's
entering class of 801, compared with 24 out of 800 last year and 41
out of 782 in 1996. Among Hispanics, 133 enrolled this fall,
compared with 100 last year and 134 in 1996. At the two dental
schools, there were two African Americans among 148 entering
students, compared with two among 144 last year and one out of 143
in 1996. Among Hispanics, there were 19 this fall, seven in 1997
and 12 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   There was virtually no difference in grades and medical school
test scores over the three years, according to UT data.
</P>
<P>
   Enrollment figures also have been finalized at the law school.
In a class of 465, 29 are Mexican American, 13 are other Hispanics,
eight are black, 29 are Asian Americans, five are American Indian,
313 are Anglo and 68 did not identify their race. In 1997, UT
enrolled four blacks and 26 Mexican Americans, compared with 26
blacks and 42 Mexican Americans in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   UT System Regent Tony Sanchez of Laredo, the only minority on
the nine-member UT System Board of Regents, said that while he was
aware of efforts taken to boost minority enrollments, he was far
from satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm extremely disappointed in the law school,'' he said.
``It's an elitist school, and a lot of the kids who apply are not
being given the same kind of overall scrutiny as the kids that
apply to medical schools. I don't know what it's going to take.''
</P>
<P>
   Law school officials interviewed several hundred applicants for
the first time this year and broadened criteria for judging
students to go beyond grades and test scores. The Ex-Students'
Association also provided minority-targeted scholarships.

QUARK QUITS ITS QUEST FOR ADOBE SYSTEMS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The graphic software publisher Quark Inc. on
Monday dropped its quirky bid to acquire rival Adobe Systems Inc.,
saying Adobe had spurned its advances and that it did not want to
pursue a hostile deal. Quark had never stated a price or specified
how it intended to finance its unsolicited offer.
</P>
<P>
   Quark announced its offer last month, after an initial exchange
of letters in which it was rebuffed by Adobe's senior management.
Although Adobe's weak earnings in recent quarters have depressed
its shares and left it vulnerable to such unwanted overtures, few
analysts took the proposal seriously, because Quark is a far
smaller, privately held company, with no shares to use as currency.
</P>
<P>
   And though hostile offers such as Mentor Graphics' bid to
acquire Quickturn have lately proliferated, they rarely succeed in
the technology industry. Products and technologies rapidly become
obsolete, and the most valuable assets in any high-technology
company, the engineers, can walk out the door at any time.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing basically died of its own lack of credibility,''
said Peter Rogers, an analyst with Volpe Brown Whelan in San
Francisco. ``I think Quark perceived that with the recent earnings
disappointment and the departure of three senior executives, Adobe
was in a weakened and confused state and that this would provide an
opportunity to coerce management and shareholders to consider a
combination.''
</P>
<P>
   Adobe shares closed Monday at $28.50, up 50 cents in Nasdaq
trading. Quark made its announcement after the close of the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since last week, we have again tried to open a dialogue with
Adobe, but to no avail _ they have not returned our phone calls,''
Fred Ebrahimi, Quark's president and chief executive, said in a
statement. ``We wanted to engage in friendly discussions regarding
the specifics of our proposal, but Adobe is not even willing to do
that. Adobe has made it clear that it is not interested in pursuing
any type of friendly transaction, even if it would benefit the
Adobe stockholders.''
</P>
<P>
   In a joint statement, John E. Warnock, Adobe's co-chairman and
chief executive, and Charles M. Geschke, co-chairman and president,
said: ``Adobe is pleased that Quark decided not to further pursue
an acquisition of Adobe. We are very grateful for the tremendous
support we have received from our business partners, customers and
our employees. We continue to focus on the exciting opportunities
available to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Quark, which is based in Denver, makes Xpress, an industry rival
of Adobe's Pagemaker, a page layout program. Adobe, which is based
in San Jose, Calif., successfully developed the Postscript
language, which began a standard for the publishing industry and
was crucial to the early success of Apple's Macintosh computer.
Adobe's Photoshop and Illustrator are mainstays of professional
graphics producers.
</P>
<P>
   Although Adobe has developed a number of products for creating
Web pages, it has not achieved the same industry standard position
there that it enjoys in desktop publishing. Adobe reported a 33
percent drop in earnings on a 3 percent drop in revenue for the
third quarter, and a work force reduction of about 13 percent.

HOLGER JANNASCH, EXPLORER OF DEEP SEA, DEAD AT 71 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Calif., Germany)  (nk) 
 By WILLIAM J. BROAD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Holger W. Jannasch, who probed the dark recesses of the sea for
the tiniest forms of life and helped discover how they constitute a
hidden biosphere that dominates the planet and may be the place
where life itself arose, died on Sept. 8 at his home in Woods Hole,
Mass. He was 71.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was lymphoma, said colleagues at the Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution on Cape Cod.
</P>
<P>
   Known for his acumen, cooperative spirit and high standards of
scientific inquiry, Jannasch was a senior scientist at Woods Hole.
He was born in Germany, trained there as a biologist and joined
Woods Hole in 1963 when he moved to the United States. Throughout
his career he worked to understand microbial ecology in the deep
sea, helping discover, map and analyze the workings of a strange
and important world.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists now suspect that the planet has a secret
biosphere of dark ecosystems reaching down miles _ even into solid
rock _ whose total mass exceeds that of all surface life. Jannasch
himself was wary of that generalization, even though it was rooted
partly in his own painstaking work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an experimentalist,'' he once said. ``We do not yet have
enough solid observations to say this is so.''
</P>
<P>
   Jannasch roamed the earth. A participant or chief scientist on
more than 35 oceanographic cruises, he sailed the Atlantic, the
Pacific, the Mediterranean and the Black Sea to do experiments and
gather microbial samples. He also traveled to Lake Kivu in eastern
Zaire in 1970, to high lakes in the central Tibetan plateau in 1988
and to Tasmania in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``Science is an adventure, not a career,'' he once said.
</P>
<P>
   Jannasch and his colleagues did the world's first experiments at
sea to understand the conditions under which microbes can decompose
materials on the deep seabed. The work was prompted by an
accidental discovery. The submersible Alvin, a three-person vessel
run by Woods Hole, sank in 1968 with no crewmen aboard. When it was
recovered in 1969, the bag lunches found inside _ three apples and
three bologna sandwiches _ were waterlogged but otherwise in
perfect condition.
</P>
<P>
   Intrigued, Jannasch found that bacterial metabolisms slowed by
as much as 100 times amid icy temperature and crushing pressure.
The implications were obvious, Jannasch and a colleague later
wrote, ``The deep sea is not a suitable environment for dumping
solid organic wastes.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, his findings helped propel a worldwide drive to ban
the oceanic dumping of sewage.
</P>
<P>
   Jannasch's research also helped explain the eerie preservation
of many deep shipwrecks that began to come to light in the 1980s
and 1990s, the most famous being the Titanic, found more than two
miles down in pitch darkness.
</P>
<P>
   The great opportunity of his career came in 1977 with the
discovery of the hot volcanic springs on the deep seabed. These
emitted water rich in microbes and minerals, erected tall stone
chimneys and fed exotic creatures in numbers far greater than
anywhere else in the deep, making them a scientific sensation.
</P>
<P>
   Jannasch was among the leading scientists who deciphered the
workings of these bizarre creatures. In particular, he documented
how tiny, sulfur-eating microbes thrived in the extraordinarily hot
waters and powered the dark ecosystems as a whole, acting much as
plants do on land to provide energy to a wide variety of animals.
He showed that the microbes did their magic by feeding on hot
chemicals rather than sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   His name ``soon became synonymous with deep sea microbiology,''
a recent Woods Hole statement said.
</P>
<P>
   On numerous expeditions and dives, Jannasch pioneered new
methods to gather up the heat-loving microbes, known as
hyperthermophiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we go to sea, we isolate new ones,'' he said in
1993. ``We get surprises all the time. The biology and biophysics
of these organisms is completely different, which is very
exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists now believe that these organisms are the direct
descendants of the first forms of life on earth.
</P>
<P>
   Jannasch was honored in 1996 when one of these exotic microbes
was named after him. Today, Methanococcus jannaschii is one of the
few microbes that have been decoded to reveal the complete set of
genetic instructions, an important step in understanding its
evolutionary past.
</P>
<P>
   Though rigorous in interpreting evidence, Jannasch could also
shape bold hypotheses. In a 1985 article in the journal Science, he
said, long before the idea became fashionable scientifically, that
the dark ecosystems of the deep sea hinted at the ``possible
occurrence of similar life forms in other planetary settings''
where water was present but not light.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is
working to test that theory as it prepares to probe beneath Martian
soil and the ice on the Jovian moon Europa, which may harbor the
solar system's deepest ocean, wrapped in primordial darkness.
</P>
<P>
   Holger Windekilde Jannasch was born in Holzminden, Germany, on
May 23, 1927. He was drafted into the German military at the age of
15 and served until he was taken prisoner by the British near the
end of World War II. Afterward, he pursued his childhood dream of
becoming a forest ranger and then fell in love with the sea while
serving at a bird sanctuary on the German coast.
</P>
<P>
   Though working most of his career in the United States, he kept
his German citizenship, and in 1995 he was elected a foreign
associate of the National Academy of Sciences, a rare honor.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Friederun Goldschmidt Jannasch; a
son, Hans, of Monterey, Calif.; a brother, Niels, of Halifax, Nova
Scotia, and two grandsons.

   SCI-MULLIS-DNA (Undated) _ Kary Mullis won the Nobel Prize for
his inventions known as the polymerase chain reaction or PCR, used
for amplifying chosen sections of DNA. It has quickly become an
essential tool for biologists, DNA forensics labs, and almost
anyone else who needs to study the genetic material. But science
has been just one of the keen interests in Mullis's life, competing
with psychedelic drugs and women. Nowadays he is pursuing his
writing and venting his contempt for corrupt science in his highly
unorthodox ways. By Nicholas Wade.

   SCI-NURSE-STUDY (Undated) _ More than 20 years ago, a doctor
curious about the effects of long-term oral contraceptive use sent
questionnaires to 370,000 registered nurses. The answers he and
colleagues have since received have turned into the largest and
longest study ever of a group of women. This massive scientific
effort has only begun to pay dividends. With many of the original
participants now entering their 60s and 70s, the study promises to
bequeath an even greater wealth of knowledge, much of it otherwise
unattainable, about how a lifetime of choices in food, drink,
exercise and medications can translate into protection from or
increased risk of deadly and debilitating diseases. By Carol Kaesuk
Yoon.

   SCI-NASA-SMALL (Undated) _ NASA has been shifting focus away
from costly, large satellites and space probes, touting a number of
successes with smaller, less expensive craft that exemplify its new
``faster, better, cheaper'' philosophy of doing business. From its
highly successful Pathfinder mission, which left a small robot
rover crawling about Mars, to new probes heading for asteroids and
comets, and small satellites measuring tropical rainfall or
atmospheric gases on Earth, the space agency says it has ample
evidence the streamlined approach is working. By Warren E. Leary.

   SCI-GENOME-CHALLENGE (Undated) _ In response to the free-market
challenge of Bruce Venter, government scientists on the Human
Genome Project say they will finish mapping the human blueprint in
2003, two years earlier than planned. That would still be two years
behind Venter's target date of 2001, but the government scientists
say that by that time they will have, more accurately than their
rival, sequenced the gene-rich portions of the human genome. By

   SCI-WEDDING-BUTTERFLIES (Undated) _ Basking in their first
moment of nuptial bliss, brides and grooms around the country are
exiting churches, showered not with rice or confetti, but
surrounded instead by the fluttering gossamer wings of hundreds of
butterflies. The releases are the latest fashion at weddings, and
are now even taking flight at memorial services, grand openings,
divorces and prison releases. But while some view the release of
butterflies as an uplifting celebration of natural beauty, many
others _ including conservationists, scientists and amateur
butterfly enthusiasts _ see it as a misguided practice that poses
serious risks to the wild butterfly population and compromises
scientists' ability to study phenomena like the annual migration of
the monarch butterfly. By Carol Kaesuk Yoon. (1800 words)

forces producing the clouds that they actually punched through the

physicians familiar with complementary as well as mainstream
medicine. In the Southwest, the movement is especially strong. By

   A lot has happened since DONNA RICE was photographed on Sen.
GARY HART's lap on the yacht Monkey Business.
</P>
<P>
   He dropped out of the 1988 presidential race. She modeled No
Excuses jeans.
</P>
<P>
   Now married and using the name DONNA RICE HUGHES, she is the
vice president for marketing and public relations of an
organization called Enough Is Enough. It is a nonprofit group whose
goal is making the Internet safe for children, a cause she took up
after her 14-year-old sister disappeared in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In her new book, ``Kids Online: Protecting Your Children in
Cyberspace,'' Mrs. Hughes writes that her sister vanished after
meeting with a man she had met in an Internet chat room; he, too,
disappeared. Mrs. Hughes writes that her sister was found and the
man was apprehended after the case was described on the Maury
Povich Show.
</P>
<P>
   So where was Mrs. Hughes on Friday, when the report from KENNETH
STARR was released? At her computer, reading the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to say, `Hey, if I didn't have to read it for my job, I
wouldn't read it,''' she said. ``The organization I work for has
been working for four years to make the Internet safe for children,
protecting them from pornography and sexual predators. This doesn't
fall in that category, but it does raise awareness about
information that would be inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   She had expected as much, she said. ``I believed, after I heard
the request by Ken Starr asking Congress to keep some of the more
graphic details of the report confidential, that it certainly had
material that would not be appropriate, even for the general
public,'' she said. ``I agreed with him, once I read it.''
</P>
<P>
   Does she see parallels between 1987 and the current scandal?
``The situation with me was entirely different from this
situation,'' she said without elaborating. A moment later she
steered the conversation back to her work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sometimes stop myself,'' she said. ``I'm back in the
limelight, and I never wanted to have anything to do with politics
or the media again.''
</P>
<P>
   Military Support
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the 1970s ZACHARY FISHER championed the USS
Intrepid, the aircraft carrier that became a floating museum from a
war in which he was not allowed to serve. He failed his Marine
Corps physical in 1942. The reason was a knee that had been hurt in
a construction-site accident when he was a teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher went back to constructing buildings, the cornerstone of
the Fisher brothers' fortune. Over the years Fisher, 86, has
lavished money on military and veterans projects, giving more than
$25 million to the Intrepid museum. He also set up a foundation
that sent $10,000 checks to the relatives of the 241 victims of the
bombing of a Marine barracks in Beirut, Lebanon, in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday PRESIDENT CLINTON presented Fisher with the Medal of
Freedom, the United States' highest award for a civilian. Secretary
of Defense WILLIAM COHEN, Mayor RUDOLPH GIULIANI and Police
Commissioner HOWARD SAFIR were also on hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president mentioned my caring about the military so much,
more than any civilian he knew,'' Fisher said. ``I told him I
appreciate the acknowledgment of me as a patriot.''
</P>
<P>
   There was not a word about the Starr report. ``This was a
graceful and a loving time,'' Fisher said. ``No mention of anything
like that.'' Of the president, he said, ``I love the guy.'' Then,
referring to HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON, who also attended the
ceremony, Fisher said: ``I like her very much. She's very caring.''
</P>
<P>
   All in the Family
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Kiss, kiss, darling. SIRIO MACCIONI, the owner of the
restaurant Le Cirque 2000, gave a 25th-anniversary party Monday
night and invited a few friends. Well, more than a few. The guest
list stretched to 1,000 names or so, and the two-story restaurant
on Madison Avenue was filled with air kisses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The family wanted to thank everyone,'' Maccioni said,
``because in New York, 25 years doesn't seem like the easiest
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   To celebrate his quarter-century, Maccioni, 64, hired clowns and
jugglers from the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &AMP; Bailey Circus. And he
said that his three sons, who already run Osteria del Circo on West
55th Street, would be doing some juggling of their own.
</P>
<P>
   His oldest son, MARIO MACCIONI, 33, has moved to Las Vegas to
oversee the new Le Cirque at the Bellagio Hotel, which is scheduled
to open next month. The others, MARCO MACCIONI, 30, and MAURO
MACCIONI, 26, will be involved in restaurants planned for Paris and
London.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted my three sons to do something respectable with their
lives,'' Sirio Maccioni said with a straight face, ``but they have
all come into the restaurant business.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, chairman of the Metropolitan
Museum of Art for 11 years, will retire from that post by early
next year, the museum has announced.
</P>
<P>
   Sulzberger, who is chairman emeritus of New York Times Co.,
reaches 73, the mandatory retirement age for a trustee, in 1999 and
is advancing his departure by several months to make the search for
his successor concurrent with the museum's search for a new
president, the Metropolitan said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Sulzberger announced the election of a noted art
collector, Karen Bassine Cohen, who has a special interest in
French 19th-century works, as an honorary trustee of the museum.

A RETIRED ROBINSON REMAINS THE CENTER OF AFFECTION
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Doug Williams sat quietly and listened as those speaking before
him praised his predecessor, Eddie Robinson, at Yankee Stadium on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   He listened as Dennis Walcott, the chief executive officer of
the New York Urban League, told how Robinson taught, by example. He
listened as Joe Taylor, Hampton University's highly successful
coach, said he and nearly everyone else involved in football at
historically black colleges stand ``on the shoulders of the
legendary Eddie Robinson.'' And he listened as both men, speaking
at a news conference for the 28th annual New York Urban League
Annual Football Classic, sprinkled their speeches with Robinson
quotes and anecdotes.
</P>
<P>
   When they were through, and Williams was finally given the
microphone, he started by saying perhaps the only thing that
someone replacing the winningest coach in college football history
can say: ``First of all, I apologize for not being Coach
Robinson.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in his first season as head coach at Grambling State
University, Williams finds himself in the uncomfortable position of
replacing a living legend, a man who is to black college football
what Babe Ruth was to baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever footsteps Coach Robinson had, we need to bronze them,
pick them up and put them on a pedestal because I don't think Doug
Williams or anybody else would enjoy stepping in those footsteps,''
said Williams, whose Tigers will face Hampton in this year's game
on Sept. 26 at Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson won 408 games in his 56 years at Grambling and sent
more than 200 players to the National Football League. One of them
was Williams, who played quarterback at Grambling from 1974-77 and
then went on to lead the Washington Redskins to victory in Super
Bowl XXII.
</P>
<P>
   But the transition from Robinson to Williams was not a
particularly smooth one. In a power struggle that was played out in
the national news media, Robinson, 79, resigned begrudgingly after
three straight losing seasons. And when talk of his being replaced
by Williams, who coached at Division II Morehouse College last
year, began before Robinson left, a wedge grew between the two
Grambling legends.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is still mutual respect between Williams and
Robinson, now working at Grambling as the special assistant to the
president for university relations, the two men are basically
nothing more than acquaintances these days and, Williams said,
haven't had a meaningful conversation in about two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still don't have a great rapport,'' Williams said. ``We
haven't gone to each other and said, `Let's mend this situation.'
But I still have the utmost respect for Eddie Robinson, for what
he's done for black college football and for the opportunity he
gave me to play at Grambling.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams' first step toward returning Grambling to prominence
was to do away with Robinson's historic wing-T offense and insert a
multiple pro set. So far, the Tigers are 1-1. While Williams
understands the difficulty of the task before him, he wouldn't want
to be in any other situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided that I wanted to be a coach 25 years ago in 1973,''
said Williams, the only black quarterback to start in the Super
Bowl. ``It just so happened that my plan got interrupted for about
12 to 13 years when I went to play a little football. But I
couldn't wait until it was over with so I could get into
coaching.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Pilar Rioja's programs of Spanish dance are solo
concerts. Yet she often created the illusion that she was not
dancing alone when she performed on Sunday night at Repertorio
Espanol, at the Gramercy Arts Theater. By abruptly opening large
fans in ``Cafe de Chinita,'' she appeared to be making
pronouncements to a host of unseen people.
</P>
<P>
   Her castanets took on lives of their own in two solos to
18th-century music. After striking elegant poses in ``Grave Assai e
Fandango,'' to Boccherini, she moved as if bewitched by the
castanets' varied tones. And the castanets seemed to giggle in
``Sonata,'' to Soler.
</P>
<P>
   Like her castanet playing, Ms. Rioja's footwork was notable for
its precision. She brought exaltation to her ``Alegrias,''
suggested that her feet were summoning up supernatural forces in
``El Vito'' and became a wild spirit in ``Jaleo: Bulerias y Rumba
Flamenca.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Que Pena Negra la Mia (How Black Are My Sorrows!)'' evoked
melancholy and defiance. And by blending traditional steps with
movements of her own in ``Tres Danzas,'' a suite of changing moods,
Ms. Rioja created what could be called a personal form of Spanish
modern dance.
</P>
<P>
   The program honored the 100th anniversary of the birth of the
Spanish writer Federico Garcia Lorca. One of his stories inspired
``Tener la Esperanza Muerta,'' which Ms. Rioja choreographed in
collaboration with Manolo Vargas. In this portrait of a woman who
feels herself doomed to be a spinster, fluid movements for Ms.
Rioja's upper body suggested the heroine's gentleness, while
restless stamping symbolized inner turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Rivela, an actor, recited quotations from Garcia
Lorca's theories of poetic inspiration. Robert Weber Federico, the
presentation's lighting and production designer, spoke on the
history of Spanish dance. All these remarks were fascinating. But
Ms. Rioja should avoid burdening programs with verbiage. Her
dancing speaks for itself.
</P>
<P>
   Her fine musicians included Martin Soderberg, pianist; Enrique
Iglesias and Bernardo De Jaen, singers; and Jose Luis Negrete,
Antonio Munoz and Francisco Roldan, guitarists. Ms. Rioja continues
through Oct. 4 at the Gramercy Arts Theater, 138 East 27th St.

CITY HAD EARLIER REMOVED GIRL WHO FOUND HER PARENTS DEAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The 10-year-old girl who found both her parents dead
in their Manhattan apartment on Saturday had been removed from the
home last year by child welfare workers and then returned after the
city investigated accusations that her parents had not been taking
proper care of her, family members and city officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The girl, Kelsea Michaels, was taken away from her parents in
November after the city's Administration for Children's Services
received an accusation of ``inadequate guardianship'' in the home,
said an agency worker familiar with the girl's case who spoke on
the condition of anonymity. The girl was returned to the home in
February.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday evening, Kelsea discovered her parents, Melanie and
Lloyd Michaels, both 35, dead in their bed at the Beaux-Arts
Apartments, a faded landmark building at 307 East 44th St. in
Turtle Bay. There were no signs of foul play, and the initial
autopsy results were inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors and police officials said that Ms. Michaels apparently
had a drug problem and that Michaels had been awaiting a kidney
transplant. No evidence of narcotics was found near their bodies
and no suicide notes were left, the police said. It could be
several weeks before pathologists learn the results of toxicology
tests that were done as part of the autopsies to try to determine
whether any drugs were in their systems at the time of their
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Without casting blame, some of the couple's relatives questioned
Monday why the girl was returned to what they described as a
troubled home. ``We're just asking a lot of whys right now,'' said
Ava Seavey, Ms. Michaels' sister. ``We're just asking why _ how
could this have happened? This child will never be the same.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   City officials said Monday night that they would not be able to
tell who made the decision to return Kelsea to the home _ and how
the decision was made _ until they were able to study the family
court transcript. Leonora Wiener, a spokeswoman for the
Administration for Children's Services, would only say that the
child was now being cared for by a relative and that she would
probably go on to live with another relative.
</P>
<P>
   A city official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said
that Kelsea was first returned to the family in February on a trial
basis, with heavy supervision from child welfare workers.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the official said, her return home was formally
approved. Under the agreement, the official said, child welfare
workers were to monitor the family for a year.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors said that Kelsea often appeared unkempt and hungry,
and that she was sometimes seen wandering the halls as late as 2
a.m., eating junk food.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the police said, she went out to play and when she
went home found that she could not wake up her parents. She went
back out to play, they said, and returned later, but still could
not wake them.

ART GALLERY FIRE IS RULED ARSON, BUT NO POLITICAL AGENDA IS SEEN

   NEWARK, N.J. _ The fire at a Jersey City art gallery before the
opening of a photography exhibition dealing with the effects of the
violence in Northern Ireland was arson, officials said Monday,
adding that they had not found any evidence of a political motive.
</P>
<P>
   Steven J. McGill, the assistant director of fire and emergency
services for Jersey City, said that despite suspicions expressed by
the gallery owner and the photographer, there had been no note or
telephone call claiming responsibility that would suggest a
political reason.
</P>
<P>
   FBI Agent Monica Patton, a spokeswoman for the agency's Newark
office, said that the FBI had met with local investigators after
being called by the owners with their suspicions. But she said that
so far, such suspicions were only speculative, and the FBI would
not enter the investigation at this time.
</P>
<P>
   Stephan Shedrowitz, an owner of the Cooper Gallery, and Michael
Schwartz, the photographer whose work is featured in the
exhibition, ``Faces of War: Children of Belfast,'' have said they
believe the subject matter antagonized some people. But they also
did not report receiving any calls or letters claiming
responsibility or citing politics.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have determined that the Cooper Gallery and its
next-door neighbor, Modern Electric Arts and Graphs, an arts supply
store, were both broken into. The supply store was entered by
forcing the lock on the front door, investigators said. The store
was ransacked and a copying machine was taken, McGill said.
</P>
<P>
   From there, the burglar or burglars forced the lock on the rear
door of the Cooper Gallery, McGill said.
</P>
<P>
   The fire was started in some papers piled in the middle of the
gallery. McGill said that although flammable substances, like
oil-based paints, were within easy reach, none were used. The fire
damaged some photographs and walls, but it was quickly
extinguished.

HENRY SPIRA, 71, ANIMAL RIGHTS CRUSADER 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Henry Spira, the architect of the U.S. animal rights
movement's first successful campaigns to limit the use of animals
in medical testing and a leading advocate of more humane treatment
of farm animals, died early Saturday in his Manhattan apartment
from esophageal cancer, according to Elinor Molbegott, his
executor. He was 71.
</P>
<P>
   Spira (pronounced SPEE-ra) brought half a lifetime of activism
in the labor and civil rights movements to the animal rights world
when he became involved at the age of 45. His interest in what he
once called ``the most defenseless of all the world's victims'' was
aroused when a friend left him with a cat around the time he first
read ``Animal Liberation,'' a 1973 essay by Peter Singer, an
Australian bioethicist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I began to wonder why we cuddle some animals and put a fork in
others,'' he often said.
</P>
<P>
   Spira first gained notice in 1976 by leading a campaign seeking
an end to the American Museum of Natural History's research on the
impact of castration and other forms of mutilation on the sexual
behavior of cats. When the research was halted in 1977, animal
rights activists hailed the campaign as the first in more than a
century of anti-vivisection efforts in the United States and Europe
actually to result in an end to any animal testing.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Spira organized a coalition that eventually
included 400 groups to pressure first Revlon and then the rest of
the cosmetics industry to phase out its use of the Draize test,
which involved blinding large numbers of rabbits to determine how
irritating new cosmetics might be for human beings.
</P>
<P>
   Spira soon took aim at a common animal test called LD/50, which
had long been used to establish ``safe'' levels for human exposure
to chemicals and drugs by determining what level of exposure
provided a lethal dose to 50 percent of the animals in the test
sample. Animal rights groups, supported by a growing number of
toxicologists, argued that the tests often provided misleading or
incomplete information and, even when helpful, used far more
animals than necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The animal testing campaigns played a major role in forcing
hospitals, universities, government laboratories and universities
to establish review boards to make sure that experiments used
alternatives to animals _ test-tube cultures, for example _ where
possible and to make sure that animals were not unnecessarily
abused when they were used. Spira also negotiated with the
cosmetics industry to provide initial financing to create the
Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing at Johns Hopkins
University in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1980s, Spira shifted his emphasis to the treatment of
farm animals. Spira was a committed vegetarian who believed that
meat-rich Western diets were medically unsound and that the global
environment was endangered by the growth of the meat industry in
developing nations, but he regularly infuriated militant animal
rights groups by advocating a gradualist approach, focusing on
working with meat producers to reduce animal suffering. He led a
successful campaign to end face branding of cattle and negotiated
with McDonald's and other fast-food companies to get them to more
closely supervise the practices of their suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Spira was born June 19, 1927, in Antwerp, Belgium, the son
of Maurice and Margit Spitzer Spira. The family emigrated to
Germany, England, Panama and, finally, the United States in the
years leading up to World War II. Henry left home at 16, plunged
into left-wing politics and joined the merchant marine. After
serving two years in the Army, he worked on the assembly line at
the General Motors factory in Linden, N.J., writing frequently for
militant newspapers. He also became involved in the civil rights
movement and in maritime union politics.
</P>
<P>
   Spira graduated from Brooklyn College in 1958, spent most of the
next few years back at sea and in 1966 began teaching English at a
public high school in Manhattan. He quit to devote himself full
time to animal rights in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Spira was coordinator of Animal Rights International, which,
despite its sweeping name, rarely consisted of more than Spira
himself and a part-time aide. He operated out of his West Side
apartment, which was filled with files and office equipment, a
climbing tree for the succession of cats he owned and tired
furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Spira was a careful assembler of facts, a cynical humorist, a
devoted practitioner of thank-you notes and above all disarming in
his dealings with both friends and adversaries. Though willing to
put on a coat and tie if necessary to meet with business
executives, he was never able to look comfortable in them. Perhaps
it was his insistence on wearing sneakers. He drew a salary of
$15,000 from ARI, plus a few thousand dollars annually in expenses,
and never wavered in his scorn for bureaucracies, including those
of some of his allies.
</P>
<P>
   But Spira was a master at building coalitions that melded the
talents and resources of far wealthier organizations, like the
Humane Society of the United States or Johns Hopkins, with
scientists, advertising professionals and others who could
contribute to his various campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Spira's penchant for bridge-building often extended to
establishing working relationships with opponents in an effort to
find common ground as a building block for progress. He contended
that the destructive raids by the underground Animal Liberation
Front on laboratories were counterproductive. And while he said
that the presence of more strident voices than his own was helpful
to the movement, he never hesitated to part ways with groups like
the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals by praising
companies like Procter &AMP; Gamble when he saw them making progress on
reducing their use of animal testing, even if he had been unable to
extract commitments to end all such work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the people in the movement, Henry understood best how
companies change,'' said Simon Billiness, an analyst at Franklin
Research and Development, an investment adviser in Boston that had
worked with Spira on the McDonald's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Spira is survived by his sister, Renee Bloch of Bellport, N.Y.

EDITORIAL: HOME RUNS BY THE BUSHEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Sept. 15:
</P>
<P>
   During the recent series between the Cards and the Cubs, Mark
McGwire suggested to Sammy Sosa how nice it would be if the two of
them could both beat Roger Maris' record, and maybe end the season
tied with the same number of home runs. That seemed unlikely at the
time, with Sosa stuck at 58 home runs and McGwire on a tear. But
beginning last Friday night, and continuing over the weekend, the
hero of San Pedro de Macoris, in the Dominican Republic, pumped
four home runs out of Chicago's Wrigley Field to draw even with
McGwire at 62.
</P>
<P>
   This McGwire-Sosa business is amazing, and fun. In the space of
one week, two players have broken Maris' 37-year-old record of 61
home runs, and the season has almost two more weeks to run. Nobody
knows how this is going to turn out, but given Sosa's history as a
streak hitter, it is entirely possible that he could win the home
run title and McGwire could wind up in the second paragraph of the
best sports story in years.
</P>
<P>
   What makes Sosa so interesting is that nobody thought he could
summon the discipline to challenge the record. Until last year he
was one of the most impatient hitters in the game, a happy-go-lucky
guy who usually swung at the first pitch, wherever it was, until
one day he got smart and decided to wait for pitches he could hit.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa is a hard-working player who has brought to baseball a
sense of joy that seems rare among today's professional athletes.
His season has been every bit as important to baseball as
McGwire's, drawing thousands of extra fans to the ball park and
keeping interest alive at a time of year when interest tends to
flag. We thought it was over, but what was once a home run chase is
now a home run race.
