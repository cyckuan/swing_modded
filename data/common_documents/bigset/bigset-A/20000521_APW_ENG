Nuclear Powers Agree To Disarm
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- As part of a new disarmament agenda agreed to by 187
countries, the five nuclear powers on the Security Council agreed Saturday to
eliminate their nuclear arsenals. The agreement by the signatories to the
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty was reached after all-night deliberations and
intense pressure on Iraq and the United States to settle a dispute over
Baghdad's nuclear compliance. Although the agreement gives no timetable, and
delegates said it would take many years to achieve a nuclear-free world, it
marked the first time the major nuclear powers had publicly affirmed their
obligation to disarm.

Mass Counterterrorism Test Begins
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The largest-ever field test of the nation's ability to
respond to a terrorist attack with chemical or biological weapons began
Saturday, involving Cabinet secretaries, governors and municipal leaders in two
cities. The counterterrorism exercise called ''TOPOFF'' involved a simulated
chemical attack on Portsmouth, N.H., followed by a simulated biological weapon
attack in Denver. The $3.5 million program, mandated by Congress was paid for by
the Department of Justice and the federal Office of Emergency Management. The
Portsmouth scenario involved an explosion at a mock charity event that led to a
number of ''fatalities'' and ''injuries.''

MDs Said Reluctant To Break Bad News
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Terminally ill cancer patients rarely get a straight
answer when they ask doctors how long they have to live, a new survey suggests.
Researchers found that doctors are likely to be overly optimistic about their
patients' outlooks or simply refuse to say. Only about one-third are willing to
give patients their best guess. The new research, presented Saturday at the
opening of the annual scientific meeting of the American Society for Clinical
Oncology, suggests that not only are doctors bad at making predictions, but they
are also uncomfortable passing the information to the people they treat, at
least when the message is discouraging.

NRA's Heston Lashes Out at Gore

   CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Charlton Heston told more than 5,000 National Rifle

as their president to complete a mission: ensuring Al Gore's defeat in November.
''George Washington hung around until the Revolutionary War was won,'' he said.
''Roosevelt hung around until the world war was won. Reagan hung around until
the Cold War was won. If you want, I'll hang around until we win this one,
too.'' Heston said the nation's gun owners are at grave risk of losing their
Second Amendment right to bear arms if Gore wins the presidency.

   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The St. Louis Cardinals hit three more homers, giving them
an NL-leading 88, to beat Pittsburgh 19-4 Saturday night in their
highest-scoring game since 1977. The Cardinals scored seven runs in the eighth
and five more in the ninth off Pirates utilityman Keith Osik, who yielded a
two-run homer to Thomas Howard an inning after hitting a two-run homer himself.

<HEADLINE> Timberwolves' Malik Sealy killed in accident  </HEADLINE>
By JASON WOLF
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Minnesota Timberwolves swingman Malik Sealy
was killed Saturday when his sport utility vehicle was hit head-on
by a pickup truck traveling the wrong way on a divided highway.
</P>
<P>
   Sealy, 30, died of head and chest injuries after the 4 a.m. CDT
crash on Highway 100 just north of a construction zone in suburban
St. Louis Park.
</P>
<P>
   He was on his way home after celebrating the 24th birthday of
teammate Kevin Garnett, who had admired Sealy as a youth.
</P>
<P>
   Timberwolves players and players' wives were at Sealy's home
comforting his wife, Lisa, and young son, Malik Remington, said
coach Flip Saunders and Kevin McHale, vice president of basketball
operations.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a sudden and devastating loss to our team,'' McHale
said. ''We're in shock. Malik was one of the most popular players
in our locker room, and one of the biggest reasons behind our
turnaround and success this past season on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   A moment of silence was observed at the opener of the Western
Conference finals between the Portland Trail Blazers and the Lakers
in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ''Malik Sealy was a stellar contributor to the NBA, his team and
his community,'' NBA commissioner David Stern said. ''This is a
tragic day for the NBA family and we extend our sympathy and
prayers to his family.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, team president Rob Moor called Sealy a
''unique individual.''
</P>
<P>
   ''His sense of humor is what I'll remember more than anything.
His off-the-cuff comments; he could take you by surprise and say
the most wonderful things at the perfect time. That's something
we'll certainly miss,'' Moor said.
</P>
<P>
   Added Saunders: ''Words can't express the loss that I feel
today. Malik was a wonderful person who touched everybody in a
special way.''
</P>
<P>
   Donnie Walsh, president of the Indiana Pacers, the team that
chose Sealy in the first round of the 1992 NBA draft, remembered
him as ''a tremendous performer and a true gentleman.''
</P>
<P>
   The pickup driver, Souksangouane Phengsene, 43, was traveling
north in the southbound lane, the patrol said. He was hospitalized
in satisfactory condition with head and chest injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Neither accident victim was wearing a seatbelt, police said. An
airbag deployed in the truck. Sealy's sport utility vehicle didn't
have an airbag.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities had not talked to Phengsene by Saturday night, so
the investigation was still in its early stages, said Capt. Al
Smith of the state patrol.
</P>
<P>
   Sealy, Garnett and at least one other player had a late dinner
at the Monte Carlo Bar &AMP; Cafe in downtown Minneapolis late Friday
night, said manager Tony Rimarcik. He said a group of about six or
seven people had gathered in a separate room, and left the
restaurant just before 1 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Sealy is the second NBA player killed in a traffic accident this
year. Charlotte Hornets guard Bobby Phills died after a crash on
Jan. 12, when he and teammate David Wesley were racing their
Porsches at more than 100 mph after a morning practice.
</P>
<P>
   Sealy was involved in a car accident on his way to practice
during his first season with the Timberwolves and needed 20
stitches to close a cut on his forehead.
</P>
<P>
   Sealy had just finished his eighth NBA season and his second
with the Timberwolves. He averaged 11.3 points in the regular
season and 12.5 in the playoffs as Minnesota was eliminated in four
games in the first round by Portland. He played in every regular
season and playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   His season was notable for the way he improved his shooting
percentage, making more than 50 percent of his shots over the first
half of the season -- a rarity for an NBA guard -- before finishing
at 47.6 percent. He had never shot better than 43.5 percent in his
first seven seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Sealy, who also played in the NBA for Indiana, the Los Angeles
Clippers and Detroit, grew up in New York and starred at St.
John's, where he was the school's second-leading career scorer
behind Chris Mullin when he left following his senior season in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will long remember Malik, not only for his outstanding
ability on the basketball court, but also for his gentleness and
strength of character in our classrooms and throughout our
campus,'' said the Rev. Donald J. Harrington, president of St.
John's.
</P>
<P>
   As a high school senior, Sealy led Tolentine to a No. 1 national
ranking and the New York state championship.
</P>
<P>
   Garnett once said Sealy had been one of his favorite players
while Sealy was playing at St. John's and Garnett was an
eighth-grader in Mauldin, S.C. He even wore Sealy's No. 21 that
year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wasn't the most confident guy at that time, and I was trying
to find someone who was another me. Not the best player, but
someone who played like me,'' Garnett said in January 1999. ''With
Malik, I just related to his body.''
</P>
<P>
   Sealy also was an actor and sold a line of ties and clothing
through Malik Sealy XXI Inc. While playing with the Clippers, he
appeared on such TV shows as ''The Sentinel'' and ''Diagnosis:
Murder,'' and in the film ''Eddie.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides his wife and son, he is survived by his parents, Sidney
and Ann Sealy.
</P>
<P>
   His father was a bodyguard for slain civil rights leader Malcolm
X. Sidney Sealy named Malik after one of Malcolm X's Muslim names.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Kuwait Minister Denies Charges  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUWAIT (AP) -- A man who was appointed Kuwait's puppet prime
minister by Iraq after it invaded the country in 1990 appealed his
death sentence for treason on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   A court sentenced Alaa Hussein on May 3, supporting a ruling
handed down in absentia two years after the 1991 Gulf War that
liberated the oil-rich state from a seven-month Iraqi occupation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am innocent,'' the 41-year-old former reserve army officer
told the appeals court in its first hearing of his appeal. ''If I
believed for a moment I was a traitor, I wouldn't have come back,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein fled Kuwait after U.S.-led forces drove out the Iraqis
and lived in Iraq, Turkey and Norway before he returned with his
four children in January. He said he had no idea why Iraq chose him
from among hundreds of Kuwaiti prisoners to head the interim
government.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein repeated Saturday what he said in the criminal court: He
accepted the post because he feared for his life and Iraqi
officials threatened they would have him killed if he tried to
return home after the war.
</P>
<P>
   The puppet ministers in Hussein's government, also Kuwaiti
prisoners, were permitted by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to
return home after the war and were acquitted of any wrongdoing by
Kuwait. Several of them testified that Hussein seemed to take his
job seriously and threatened to kill them if they didn't obey him.
None supported his claim that he was prevented from leaving Iraq
with them.
</P>
<P>
   Presiding Judge Ahmed al-Ajeel adjourned the court proceedings
until May 31.

Atlantis Docks With Space Station
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Space shuttle Atlantis slid up to the
international space station and docked early Sunday, ending a two-day chase and
kicking off a week of urgent repairs. The metallic cuddle occurred as the
spacecraft soared some 200 miles above Ukraine, each traveling at 17,500 mph.
The crew's first job will be to conduct a spacewalk Sunday night. During NASA's
last visit to the space station a year ago, astronauts failed to properly
install a crane on the outside. The crane is flapping back and forth, and needs
to be locked securely in place.

   WEST ISLIP, N.Y. (AP) -- From the gym of his former high school on Long
Island, relatively unknown Republican Rep. Rick Lazio catapulted himself
Saturday into the nation's most-talked about political campaign -- the Senate
race against Hillary Rodham Clinton. The official announcement, less than 24
hours after New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani dropped out of the Senate race,
launched the 42-year-old, four-term congressman into the national spotlight.
Lazio acknowledged facing an uphill battle against the first lady -- one poll
already showed her with a huge lead over Lazio. But he sounded an optimistic
note to supporters who sported T-shirts reading, ''Lazio -- Made in New York.''

   CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- At least 10 people were injured Saturday night after a
concrete walkway over a highway in front of Lowe's Motor Speedway collapsed as
fans left NASCAR's all-star race. About 30 feet of the 15-foot-high walkway that
spans the four-lane highway and connects the track to a parking lot collapsed at
about 11:15 p.m. after The Winston. The bridge snapped at the center and was
folded in half on U.S. 29. Authorities were not sure exactly how many people
were injured but said at least 10 were transported to hospitals. Two of them had
life-threatening injuries.

<HEADLINE> Haiti Holds Elections Amid Violence  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE FAUL
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- In a somber atmosphere weighted
with fear and uncertainty, the mettle of Haiti's much-abused people
will be tested at elections Sunday which will restore a democratic
government and desperately needed foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   A long drawn-out campaign marred by at least 15 politically
related slayings, arson attacks and growing intimidation ended with
rumors that violence will erupt at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going to risk it,'' said street merchant Jeannine
Charlier, 31, echoing the sentiments of many people who planned to
stay home.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was intimidated. ''I'm going to overcome my fear
and vote anyway,'' said 84-year-old farmer Jean Philippe who, like
most people interviewed, supports former President Jean-Bertrand
Aristide's Lavalas Family party.
</P>
<P>
   Haitians who have largely boycotted an electoral process fraught
with fraud and disorganization over recent years, have registered
to vote en masse -- some 4 million of the 8 million people in a
country where half the population is under 18 -- indicating a
burning desire for change.
</P>
<P>
   Some 29,490 candidates are contesting 7,625 posts including
Parliament's 83-seat Chamber of Deputies, 19 of 27 Senate seats,
133 three-member mayoral commissions and seats on local, rural and
urban councils.
</P>
<P>
   Voting at 11,238 polling places is supposed to start at 6 a.m.
and end at 6 p.m. Runoff elections are scheduled June 25 for
legislative contests where no candidate wins more than 50 percent
of votes.
</P>
<P>
   But there are sure to be hitches. Though $22.5 million was
budgeted for the election -- including $8 million from international
donors -- disorganization is expected.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, officials postponed voting by 200,000 people in
southern Grand Anse district, citing ''insurmountable logistical
difficulties,'' a source at the electoral council said.
</P>
<P>
   Voters may have trouble finding polling stations that have not
been well identified, names may be missing from voters' rolls and
some voting stations may not receive ballot papers in time. The
electoral council denied rumors Sunday that 1 million ballot papers
were stolen.
</P>
<P>
   Ballot papers are not numbered, the Organization of American
States has noted with concern, opening the way for counterfeit
votes and stuffing of ballot boxes.
</P>
<P>
   The organization also criticized the U.N.-trained police force
for not stopping pre-election violence, most committed by Aristide
militants though his party routinely denies involvement. The police
behavior does not bode well for Sunday, with just 3,500 officers to
secure the elections nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   In the northeast, the vice president of the departmental
electoral council said he was going underground after incessant
telephone death threats. ''I have to save my life, I'm going into
hiding,'' Ignace St. Fleur, also a member of the Space for Concorde
opposition coalition, told The Associated Press by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Also late Saturday, three bursts of automatic gunfire ripped out
in front of Aristide's center for homeless children in midtown
Port-au-Prince. Witnesses said they saw heavily armed men in the
area.
</P>
<P>
   ''An electoral farce is being prepared for tomorrow,''
complained one opposition leader, former Port-au-Prince Mayor Evans
Paul.
</P>
<P>
   ''Short of a miracle, I don't see how we can have credible
elections,'' opposition politician Evans Paul said after a grenade
exploded Thursday at the gate to the electoral council office,
injuring seven passers-by.
</P>
<P>
   The attack, he said, was intended ''to intimidate the
independent voter into staying at home, leaving the field wide open
for Aristide partisans.''
</P>
<P>
   Lavalas Family spokesmen routinely deny the party is behind the
violence.
</P>
<P>
   From afar, the United States and the United Nations -- which have
invested more than $1 billion in Haiti since the 1994 intervention
-- are keeping their fingers crossed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Despite all the difficulties observed, credible legislative,
municipal and local elections are still possible,'' the
Organization of American States said Friday.

<HEADLINE> 7 U.S. Servicemen Arrested in Japan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Seven U.S. servicemen stationed in Japan were
arrested over the weekend in three separate incidents, including
the alleged robbery of a clothing store in Okinawa, police said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested four Marines on suspicion they broke into a
clothing store on Japan's southernmost prefecture of Okinawa and
stole clothing worth $3,300 and nearly $800 in U.S. and Japanese
currency on Saturday, Japanese police said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects, Michael P. Winston and Hunter H. Holt, both 20,
and two unidentified minors, were arrested by U.S. military police
at Camp Hansen.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate incident on Okinawa, 24-year-old Senior Airman
James I. McIlvan of Kadena Air Base was arrested Saturday on
charges he hit a supermarket employee over the head with a bottle
and stole frozen food.
</P>
<P>
   The employee suffered head injuries requiring a week of
treatment, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
   In the southern Japanese city of Fukuoka, two U.S. sailors were
arrested Sunday on suspicion they stole a woman's purse from a
downtown bar earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   They were identified by police as Oliver David, 21, and Nelson
Patrick, 20. Both are stationed at a U.S. naval base in nearby
Sasebo, Nagasaki Prefecture (state).
</P>
<P>
   Japanese police had no further details on the three incidents.
U.S. military officials were not immediately available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Okinawans have long complained about crime and congestion linked
to the U.S. bases. About two-thirds of the 47,000 U.S. troops in
Japan are in Okinawa, located 1,000 miles southwest of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Fukuoka is 562 miles southwest of Tokyo.

<HEADLINE> Tamil Rebels Take Strategic Town  </HEADLINE>
By ASHOK SHARMA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Sri Lanka's Tamil Tiger rebels said
Sunday they have captured a strategic government-held town in the
northern peninsula amid an offensive to retake their former capital
of Jaffna.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting around Jaffna precedes the arrival of a Norwegian
peace delegation Monday in the Sri Lankan capital, Colombo, that
will seek ways to halt the battle between the rebels and 40,000
government troops defending Jaffna.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Foreign Minister Raymond Johansen will be in Colombo for
three days to broker peace, the Norwegian Embassy said.
</P>
<P>
   Norway, home of the Nobel Peace Prize, has frequently used
backdoor diplomacy to resolve some of the world's most difficult
conflicts, including secret talks between Israel and the
Palestinians that led to a 1993 peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   Sri Lanka's Tamil rebels are campaigning for an independent
homeland for the nation's 3.2 million minority Tamils, saying they
face discrimination from the majority Sinhalese, who account for 14
million of the country's 18.6 million people.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Sri Lankan army suffered another serious military debacle
in the war for the liberation of Jaffna peninsula as Chavakachcheri
town fell to the armed forces of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam,'' the rebels said in a statement issued from London.
</P>
<P>
   ''This strategically important town situated in the heart of the
Jaffna peninsula came under the control of the Tamil Tigers after
12 hours of ferocious fighting,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   If the rebel claim is true, they now are in control of the
entire eastern flank of the peninsula. Chavakachcheri, home to
10,000 people, is about 6 miles east of Jaffna.
</P>
<P>
   There was no independent confirmation of the rebel's claim, and
the government bars journalists from the area of fighting. The
government also has imposed censorship on war reporting.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels said the Sri Lankan army had ''suffered heavy
casualties,'' without citing figures. ''Dead bodies of soldiers are
scattered all over the town area,'' the rebel statement said. ''The
LTTE fighters have also recovered a huge quantity of arms and
ammunition.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sri Lankan army's top military commander in Jaffna rejected
a rebel offer that his forces surrender. Major General Janaka
Perera appeared on the state-run Rupavahini Television Saturday
night and said his troops were committed to defend Jaffna from
rebel takeover.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are here and we will continue to be here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But other military officials admit that with the rebels
threatening the area's only airport and harbor, it will very
difficult for the military to maintain supplies for its 40,000
troops.
</P>
<P>
   For four days, rebel artillery has targeted the Palali air base
and Kankesanturai sea port -- the only functional points from which
government troops can receive supplies. All land routes to the
mainland are already under the control of the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels on Sunday again began appealing to the soldiers every
half an hour to surrender ''to avoid the continuing bloodbath and
to bring an end to the escalating violence and war.'' The rebels
made the appeal through their Voice of Tigers radio.

<HEADLINE> 50 Injured After Walkway Collapses  </HEADLINE>
By JENNA FRYER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- At least 50 people were injured Saturday
night after a concrete walkway spanning a four-lane highway in
front of Lowe's Motor Speedway collapsed as fans left a NASCAR
race.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 feet of the 15-foot-high walkway fell onto U.S. 29 at
about 11:15 p.m.. Some 75 people were on the bridge, which connects
the track to a parking lot, when it snapped at the center.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve of the injured were airlifted to a hospital in Charlotte,
said Charlotte Fire Department Captain Rob Brifley. At least two
had life-threatening injuries. He said there were no fatalities at
the scene.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the injured were taken by ambulance to Concord and
Charlotte hospitals, Brifley said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't know the conditions of all the people injured,''
track president H.A. ''Humpy'' Wheeler said. ''There were some
injured in a minor way and we had some obviously injured in a major
way but we don't know the total extent of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said bodies were lying on the ground and people were
helping emergency workers attend to the injured.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just a lot of people went down and some of them were elderly
so you don't know how bad it is,'' said Ed Walker of Columbia,
S.C., who said he crossed over the bridge and heard it snap.
''People were hollering. The first reaction was to account for
everybody you were with.''
</P>
<P>
   The accident occurred at about the same time Dale Earnhardt Jr.
captured the victory in The Winston, which drew 180,000 spectators.
</P>
<P>
   Wheeler said the bridge was built around 1995 to better
facilitate the traffic flow at the speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ''All we can do right now is pray,'' Wheeler said.

   CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- At least 50 people were injured Saturday night after a
concrete walkway over a highway in front of Lowe's Motor Speedway collapsed as
fans left NASCAR's all-star race. About 30 feet of the 15-foot-high walkway that
spans the four-lane highway and connects the track to a parking lot fell to the

Rep. Lazio Announces Senate Run
</SUBHEAD>

   WEST ISLIP, N.Y. (AP) -- From the gym of his former high school on Long
Island, relatively unknown Republican Rep. Rick Lazio catapulted himself
Saturday into the nation's most-talked about political campaign -- the Senate
race against Hillary Rodham Clinton. The official announcement, less than 24
hours after New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani dropped out of the Senate race,
launched the 42-year-old, four-term congressman into the national spotlight.
Lazio acknowledged facing an uphill battle against the first lady -- one poll
already showed her with a huge lead over Lazio. But he sounded an optimistic
note to supporters who sported T-shirts reading, ''Lazio -- Made in New York.''

Nuclear Countries Agree To Disarm
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The five nuclear powers on the Security Council agreed
Saturday to eliminate their nuclear arsenals, as part of a new disarmament
agenda approved by 187 countries. The agreement by the signatories to the
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty was reached after all-night deliberations and
intense pressure on Iraq and the United States to settle a dispute over
Baghdad's compliance with U.N. sanctions. Although the agreement gives no
timetable, and delegates said it would take many years to achieve a nuclear-free
world, it marked the first time the major nuclear powers had publicly affirmed
their obligation to disarm.

Mass Counterterrorism Test Begins
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The largest-ever field test of the nation's ability to
respond to a terrorist attack with chemical or biological weapons began
Saturday, involving Cabinet secretaries, governors and municipal leaders in two
cities. The counterterrorism exercise called ''TOPOFF'' involved a simulated
chemical attack on Portsmouth, N.H., followed by a simulated biological weapon
attack in Denver. The $3.5 million program, mandated by Congress was paid for by
the Department of Justice and the federal Office of Emergency Management. The
Portsmouth scenario involved an explosion at a mock charity event that led to a
number of ''fatalities'' and ''injuries.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush raised three times more money than Al Gore
last month, but the vice president made up the difference with taxpayer funds
and continued to have more money in the bank than his Republican opponent. Bush
reported raising $3.8 million last month, bringing his record-setting total to
more than $84 million, while Gore took in $1.1 million and received $2.5 million
in federal funds, according to campaign finance reports released Saturday. The
vice president has raised $36 million, which does not include federal money.
Gore, however, is limited to spending $40.5 million on his campaign, plus legal
and accounting costs, because he is accepting federal funds.

the Braves, who have won seven of their last eight and have scored 56 runs

<HEADLINE> Fiji Rebels Threaten Executions  </HEADLINE>
By ROHAN SULLIVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Rebels holding Fiji's elected prime minister
and other government members hostage threatened Sunday to execute
them unless their demands are met, the head of state said.
</P>
<P>
   President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara said rebel leader George
Speight sought a meeting with him Sunday to discuss the uprising at
the center of Fiji's government crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Mara said he told Speight that he refused to attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had a request today from Mr. Speight for him to come and see
me,'' Mara said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will not have any dialogue with those who are imprisoning
the parliamentarians and bear arms in the parliament complex unless
they are freed.''
</P>
<P>
   I learned from him afterwards in a roundabout way that what he
was going to tell me was that if I don't follow what he says, he
will start executing hostages one by one.''
</P>
<P>
   Mara said Speight was demanding the president step down and
allow his group to run the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''That I will not be able to oblige,'' Mara said defiantly.
</P>
<P>
   Spreight launched the coup Friday in a bid to topple the
government of ethnic Indian Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry and
install in its place a government of indigenous Fijians led by him.
</P>
<P>
   For months, ethnic tensions have been building between
indigenous Fijians and the descendants of Indian migrants, who
dominate commerce in this Pacific Ocean country 2,250 miles
northeast of Sydney, Australia. Indians make up about 44 percent of
Fiji's population of 813,000 while indigenous Fijians account for
51 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Later Sunday, shots were fired outside parliament where the
hostages were being held.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said Speight invited journalists into parliament but
police loyal to Mara and Chaudhry's elected government tried to
stop the reporters entering.
</P>
<P>
   Speight supporters then fired warning shots into the air before
escorting a group of journalists into parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, two influential ethnic Fijian groups pledged their
support Sunday for Speight.
</P>
<P>
   Ratu Tevita Bolobolo, leader of the Taukei movement of ethnic
Fijians, read out a statement also signed by the main opposition
party, known as SVT.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not and we will never accept the reinstatement of the
Chaudhry government,'' Bolobolo said. ''We hereby state that we
fully support the abolition of the 1997 constitution and warn
(Fijian President) Ratu Mara that any intervention by force will
lead to all out civil war.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We the Taukei are ready to make the ultimate sacrifice so as
to return this country to the Taukei.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement was the first major sign of support for Speight.
</P>
<P>
   Spreight launched the coup Friday in a bid to topple the
government of ethnic Indian Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry and
install in its place a government of indigenous Fijians led by him.

</P>
<P>
   ''We the Taukei are ready to make the ultimate sacrifice so as
to return this country to the Taukei.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement was the first major sign of support for Speight.
</P>
<P>
   The statement was sent to Ratu Mara along with demands for
changes to the constitution so only an indigenous Fijian can hold
the offices of prime minister and president and for a reversion of
all freehold land to native ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Combined, the Taukei movement and SVP party command strong
support among ethnic Fijians. Taukei means ''owner of the land.''
</P>
<P>
   But one ethnic Fijian member of the elected government claimed
indigenous people actually supported the Indian prime minister and
would not accept Speight's rule.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will not compromise with these illegal people,'' Labor
Minister Ratu Tevita Momoedonu told Australian television's Nine
Network.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are treating these people as a bunch of thugs and we will
not compromise with them in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Sunday, the rebels released some hostages, but not
Chaudhry, who collapsed overnight apparently from stress. A Red
Cross doctor who later visited Chaudhry said he was healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Chaudhry had reportedly collapsed while in meetings with
Speight.
</P>
<P>
   In the early hours of Sunday, Speight released about 30
hostages, including nine members of Chaudhry's Cabinet and some 20
parliamentary staff.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear exactly how many hostages remained inside. At
least 38 lawmakers were originally taken, along with an unknown
number of parliamentary staff.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian lawmakers were released only after signing
resignation letters.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmaker John Ali said each was led into a room by two hooded
gunmen and told to sign the resignation letter. They were told if
they didn't they would be shot by rebels in the event of armed
intervention to end the standoff.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were given a life or death ultimatum. We chose life,'' Ali
said of the lawmakers who signed.
</P>
<P>
   The coup attempt had appeared headed for failure Saturday as
military, police and influential Fijian leaders lined up behind
Chaudhry's government and the president.
</P>
<P>
   Speight, barefoot and dressed in a traditional sulu skirt, told
reporters late Saturday that his followers were determined to
succeed and ''willing to risk our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Mara said he would use ''all the authority and
resources at my command'' to end the standoff.
</P>
<P>
   Former Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka -- himself the leader of
two coups in 1987 -- is acting as chief negotiator between the
rebels and Mara.
</P>
<P>
   Rabuka, who accused Speight of treason, has urged the group to
surrender.
</P>
<P>
   Fiji's capital, Suva, was quiet Sunday, as it has been since
rioters rampaged downtown on Friday following the raid on
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   But unrest was reported in other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Police said there was looting in the western town of Raki
overnight, and issued a public warning that lawbreakers would be
treated harshly.
</P>
<P>
   A state of emergency and dawn to dusk curfew have been imposed
for two weeks.

	   JOLO, Philippines (AP) -- Negotiators were in Manila on Sunday to consult
with President Joseph Estrada before finally beginning talks on freeing a group
of Western and Asian hostages kidnapped by Muslim guerrillas 29 days ago. Once
the president agrees, negotiations could begin as soon as Monday on the island
of Jolo, in the southern Philippines, where the 21 hostages were taken after
they were snatched from a Malaysian diving resort. Formal talks have been
delayed by skirmishes between the rebels and troops, frequent changes in the
government negotiating team, and disputes over security arrangements for

<HEADLINE> British PM Says Baby Doing Fine  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- A tired-looking Prime Minister Tony Blair greeted
churchgoers after mass at Westminster Cathedral on Sunday and told
them his wife and new baby Leo were ''absolutely fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Cherie Blair, 45, gave birth to the couple's fourth child in the
early hours of Saturday morning, afterward returning to the prime
minister's Downing Street home.
</P>
<P>
   ''No, it definitely wasn't a quiet night,'' Blair told
parishioners after the service, which he attended with his elder
children Euan, 16, Nicholas, 15, and Kathryn, 12.
</P>
<P>
   Blair posed for pictures and told congregation members baby Leo
was ''absolutely fine,'' and that Cherie Blair was ''great.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm feeling a little tired,'' Blair added.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released through Downing Street, Cherie Blair
said she too was tired ''but full of joy.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It is so long since we had our other three children that I had
forgotten quite what an ordeal those last few hours of labor can
be,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Cherie Blair, who spent the afternoon indoors with her family,
said she was touched by the flowers and presents received from
friends, colleagues and well-wishers.
</P>
<P>
   Congratulations have poured in from around the world since she
delivered their 6-pound, 12-ounce son at 12:25 am Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Danish Prime Minister Poal Nyrup Rasmussen was the latest
dignitary to send flowers to Downing Street. Earlier, Queen
Elizabeth II offered her congratulations as did Hillary Clinton,
who telephoned Cherie Blair in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Blair, 46, is the first serving British prime minister to father
a child since Lord John Russell's fourth son, George Gilbert
William Russell, was born in 1848.
</P>
<P>
   Despite heavy public hints from his wife, Blair has said he will
not be taking parental leave. But he does plan initially to scale
back his official workload.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister, who has described his new son as ''a
gorgeous little boy,'' said it was the first time he had been
present throughout the birth of any of his children.

<HEADLINE> Business, Labor Lobby on China  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the days before a key China trade vote, the
AFL-CIO assembled a ''cell phone drill team'' in front of Rep.
Edward Markey's Massachusetts office. Intel Corp. used a more
conventional lobbying technique, flooding Capitol Hill with 5,000
letters from employees.
</P>
<P>
   Special interests are spending millions to sway undecided
lawmakers before this week's House vote on permanent trade
relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   ''It depends on how creative we can get,'' said Peggy Taylor, a
lobbyist for the AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   The labor federation's member unions also pitched a tent in
front of Democratic Rep. Bud Cramer's Alabama office and delivered
checks emblazoned ''no blank check for China'' to the office Rep.
Karen Thurman, D-Fla. She wound up endorsing the bill while Markey
said he would vote no.
</P>
<P>
   The millions of special interest money -- $10 million by the
Business Roundtable alone -- have gone for airfare, postage,
lobbyists' salaries, and even a U.S. Chamber of Commerce-published
glossy brochure with small-business owners touting the benefits of
China trade.
</P>
<P>
   Business owners, union members, farmers, religious leaders and
countless other advocates -- even a busload of Tibetan activists --
have visited lawmakers in Washington and their home districts. The
chamber has 20 full-time lobbyists just working on China this
month.
</P>
<P>
   So many people have gone through Rep. James Walsh's office, for
example, that the New York Republican has decided not to meet with
any more advocates, an aide said. For Walsh, the lobbying is as
intense as any issue he has faced since being elected in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Other lawmakers are getting a steady stream of visits, phone
calls and letters.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been intense and passionate on both sides,'' acknowledged
freshman Rep. Anthony Weiner, D-N.Y., who was visited by 40 Tibetan
activists opposing China trade but has since decided to endorse the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Business leaders argue that trade with China will help bring
American political ideals, such as freedom, to that country. Others
insist that granting permanent normal trade relations to China --
rather than going through a yearly renewal -- will make it easier
for the country to crack down on dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   ''Next year, they can arrest more bishops, torture evangelical
pastors, rearrest all the dissidents and we can't do anything about
it,'' said Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va.
</P>
<P>
   A series of AFL-CIO ads that aired last month echoed those
concerns about human rights.

   ''We know that Chinese middle class really has a much broader
view of the world and are looking to their political leadership for
steady progress toward a more democratic society,'' Boswell said.

   The agriculture industry and high-tech companies also are
playing large roles in the lobbying effort. In one 48-hour period,
Intel employees sent 5,000 computer-generated letters to lawmakers,
urging them to support China trade.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the biggest opportunity we have in the future of going
from 0 to 60,'' said Michael Maibach, the company's vice president
for government affairs, noting that China is the third-largest
market for computer chips, personal computers, and cellular
telephones.

<HEADLINE> UN Officials Question Congo Report  </HEADLINE>
By HRVOJE HRANJSKI
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) -- Congolese rebels killed up to 31 civilians
in an eastern village in retaliation for an attack by
pro-government militia, a U.N. aid official said Sunday,
questioning the 300 death toll reported by an Italian missionary
news agency.
</P>
<P>
   The MISNA news agency, quoting unidentified sources, reported
Saturday that up to 300 civilians were killed May 14 -- many hacked
to death -- when the Rwandan-backed rebels of the Congolese Rally
for Democracy attacked Katogota, 35 miles south of Lake Kivu port
of Bukavu.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody can confirm the figure of 300 at this time. We can
confirm that an incident took place in which between seven and 31
people were killed in a process of exchange of fire between the two
forces,'' said Charles Petrie, U.N. humanitarian aid coordinator
for eastern Congo.
</P>
<P>
   He cited reports from international and Congolese aid workers in
Bukavu in contact with travelers and officials. He said the village
in question had a population of only 50.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel spokesman Kin-Kiey Mulumba insisted Saturday that there
were no civilian casualties when the rebels attacked the
pro-government militia in Katogota, where a rebel platoon commander
had been killed in an earlier ambush.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels, most of them ethnic Congolese Tutsis opposed to
President Laurent Kabila, are unpopular in eastern Congo, where the
war-weary population generally regard them as accomplices of their
foreign backers, Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   Mulumba invited the United Nations to join the rebels' own
inquiry into the incident. Petrie said a U.N. human rights worker
was on his way to Bukavu to investigate.

<HEADLINE> Old, New Antidepressants About Same  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN POET
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Family doctors should consider both old and
new anti-depressant drugs as equally effective in treating
depression, according to new guidelines issued by the American
College of Physicians.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines, written because general practitioners are often
responsible for treating depression, also state that St. John's
wort, an herbal supplement, may be effective for short term relief
from mild depression but telling patients to take it should be
carefully weighed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our view is that the major difference is in the side effect
profiles,'' said Dr. Herbert Waxman, the college's senior vice
president for education. ''If they're all equally efficacious and
patient compliance is similar, then the best choice is based on
side effects.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers found that older prescription antidepressants, such
as Elavil and Vivactil, are just as effective in treating
depression as newer drugs, such as Prozac and Paxil. Patients also
follow the prescriptions' directions at similar rates, Waxman said.
</P>
<P>
   The study concluded that in 150 clinical trials involving more
than 16,000 participants, no clinically or statistically
significant differences were found between older and newer drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Whether they took older or newer drugs, about half the patients
experienced at least a 50 percent improvement in depressive
symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   In creating the guidelines, which were published in the May 2
issue of ACP's journal, the Annals of Internal Medicine, the ACP
relied on work done by researchers at the University of Texas
Health Science Center at San Antonio. The research examined all
known studies of antidepressants and compared the studies' results.
</P>
<P>
   The study notes that, compared to newer drugs, the rates of
blurred vision, constipation, dizziness, dry mouth and tremors were
significantly higher in patients using the older drugs. Newer
classes of antidepressants showed higher rates of diarrhea,
headache, insomnia and nausea.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers also found that the consensus of studies on St.
John's wort is that the herbal remedy can be effective in treating
mild depression. The guidelines note, however, that there are
virtually no reliable studies comparing its effectiveness to that
of prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's wort, the common name for hypericum perforatum, is
widely used in Germany as a treatment for depression and anxiety.
Over the past decade, its acceptance in the United States has grown
significantly.
</P>
<P>
   The ACP also cautions that, as an herbal remedy, it is not
regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. The guidelines also
caution that St. John's wort supplements can have serious side
effects, may interfere with other drugs and may contain additional
herbal substances.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the FDA issued a public health advisory that St.
John's wort could reduce the effectiveness of drugs used to treat
heart disease, depression, seizures and certain cancers, as well as
birth-control pills.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a number of concerns about St. John's wort,'' Waxman
said. ''It's important for us to summarize evidence for physicians
because patients will come to physicians with some information in
hand.''
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines urge physicians to discuss herbal remedies and
over-the-counter medications with their patients.
</P>
<P>
   ACP membership includes over 90,000 physicians in general
internal medicine and related specialties.
</P>
<P>
   ''Physicians sometimes are reluctant to bring up things about
what someone is taking that aren't prescription drugs,'' Waxman
said. ''We hope this leads to better communication between the
physician and the patient.''

<HEADLINE> Release of PCBs Higher Than Thought  </HEADLINE>
By TAMMY WEBBER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- More than 20 years after the manufacture of PCBs
was banned, the cancer-causing toxins are still entering Lake
Michigan from sources on land, according to a federal study that
challenges longheld beliefs about the chemical.
</P>
<P>
   Air tests indicate that the Chicago and Gary, Ind., areas are
major sources of PCBs going into the lake, said Glenn Warren of the
Environmental Protection Agency's Great Lakes National Program
Office in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The findings came as a surprise to scientists who had long
believed the lake's PCB load was decreasing, and the study suggests
the same thing is happening in industrial areas throughout the
world.
</P>
<P>
   PCBs -- polychlorinated biphenyls -- have been linked to cancer
and birth defects. The chemical was widely used as a coolant in
electrical transformers during the 1960s and '70s to control dust
on roads, as a wood preservative and in paint.
</P>
<P>
   PCB pollution of lakes and rivers is of particular concern
because contaminated sediment exposes fish to the toxin and speeds
its movement up the food chain. Because PCBs don't break down
easily, the chemical builds up in fatty tissue, with each exposure
putting a person at greater risk.
</P>
<P>
   That has prompted the government to warn people, especially
pregnant women, against eating too much Great Lakes fish.
</P>
<P>
   It was widely believed that most PCBs in the environment had
been there for years and were recirculating by evaporating and
re-entering the lake from the atmosphere -- not necessarily coming
from new sources.
</P>
<P>
   ''Conventional wisdom was ... that Lake Michigan overall was
losing PCBs to the atmosphere,'' Warren said. ''But because of the
urban input, Lake Michigan is still taking in PCBs.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers suspect the toxin is coming from old electrical
transformers, dumps that were not capped properly, sludge beds and
disposal sites for PCB-laced sediment dredged from rivers and
shipping canals, as well as a host of smaller sites, said Tom
Holsen, an environmental engineering professor at Clarkson
University in New York, who is leading the PCB study in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   PCBs evaporate from those sources and are deposited in the lake
from the atmosphere, Holsen said. He said more extensive analyses
of air data must be completed before researchers identify sources
of new emissions. A report is expected by the end of the year, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the extent of the problem is probably not yet known because
higher-than-expected levels of PCBs are probably being released by
industrial areas throughout the world, Holsen said.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, tests also have found high levels of the toxin in
the atmosphere near Baltimore and Detroit, and in England, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Technology to allow routine testing of industrial areas became
available only recently, he said. That means scientists and
policymakers will have to revisit the PCB issue on an international
scale, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''These pollutants don't respect state or national boundaries;
they go everywhere,'' he said. ''If you just clean up the Great
Lakes, it won't solve the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The high levels of PCBs in the air near Gary and Chicago were
found during testing for a different study of the source and
movement of PCBs and three other toxins in Lake Michigan. That
finding prompted the EPA to fund a separate study to pinpoint the
toxin's sources.
</P>
<P>
   Holsen said levels in the air around Chicago and Gary were far
higher than from nonurban areas -- 10 times higher in Chicago than
in Kankakee, about 50 miles to the south, for example.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was clear that urban industrial areas were the source,''
Holsen said.
</P>
<P>
   The new information could help government agencies decide what
steps to clean up PCBs should get top priority, said Warren and
Cameron Davis, executive director of the Lake Michigan Federation,
a citizens environment group.
</P>
<P>
   Many government officials and advocacy groups support dredging
contaminated sediment from lakes and rivers. Industry has resisted
that as too expensive and has favored covering polluted sediment
with clean fill such as clay to limit exposure, Warren said.
</P>
<P>
   The land-based sources, from which PCBs evaporate or are washed
into waterways, present a new concern, but cleanup of all sources
of the toxin is important to reduce fish contamination, Warren and
Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is my belief we will have to go after all sources if we
want contamination levels low enough so (fish are) consumable by
everyone,'' Warren said.

<HEADLINE> Steroid Use Linked to Addiction  </HEADLINE>
By IRA DREYFUSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The trouble with addiction started as he tried
to get off steroids, Tony recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I came off them, I never got my energy back,'' the
bodybuilder said. ''For me, it took a few months to feel I had a
backbone.''
</P>
<P>
   So the fellow bodybuilder who had supplied him with illegal
steroids was now illegally offering him other drugs, including
Nubain and Percocet, both prescription painkillers, said Tony, a
Boston-area man who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   He had bulked up on steroids, but felt he could not lose enough
fat to win bodybuilding competitions. The other drugs were supposed
to help him readjust to life without steroids, Tony said.
</P>
<P>
   What he didn't realize, he said, is that Nubain and Percocet
could also lead to addiction. The drugs have similarities to
morphine, though Nubain is considered to have less addictive
potential.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not using them now, but I do crave them,'' Tony said. He
is getting treatment from Dr. Harrison G. Pope, chief of the
Biological Psychiatry Laboratory at Harvard-affiliated McLean
Hospital in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Nubain is not supposed to be nearly as addictive as morphine,
but his previous research indicates bodybuilders are getting
hooked, Pope said.
</P>
<P>
   And a letter in The New England Journal of Medicine indicates
that steroids may lead some bodybuilders into harder drugs.
''Steroids may serve as 'gateway' drugs to opiod dependence,''
wrote Pope and Drew Arvary, a substance abuse counselor at Sunrise
House, an in-patient dependence treatment facility in Lafayette,
N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Pope and Arvary looked at 227 men admitted for dependence on
heroin or similar drugs in 1999. They found 9.3 percent had a
history of steroid use. In contrast, among 197 similar admissions
in 1990, only .5 percent reported steroid use.
</P>
<P>
   The men indicated they were introduced to the harder drugs
through the bodybuilding community, the letter said. Eighty-one
percent of the 1999 patients bought both drugs from the same
supplier, it said.
</P>
<P>
   And the men said they used the drugs to deal with
steroid-related problems such as irritability while on steroids or
depression after they gave up steroids, the journal letter said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's almost become the same now -- the drug culture is the gym
culture,'' Arvary said. Steroids themselves are not physically
addicting but, when users go off the drugs, the shrinkage of muscle
can be hard to handle, Arvary said. ''They don't feel pumped; they
don't feel their muscles are full,'' he said. ''The only way they
can go out to function is some kind of narcotic -- mainly heroin, in
this case.''
</P>
<P>
   The patients who went from steroids to heroin were hard to keep
off drugs later, the letter said. ''In the 1 to 11 months since
their discharge from Sunrise House, 17 have relapsed into opiod
use, and 2 have committed suicide,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   Former steroid and opiod users are even harder to treat than
opiod users alone, Arvary said. The ex-bodybuilders refuse to class
themselves with frail addicts who they picture as ''sleeping in the
streets,'' he said. ''It's almost dealing with a perfectionistic
type of behavior where they feel they are better than them.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, addiction groups tend not to work with these
patients, who need one-on-one counseling, Arvary said.
</P>
<P>
   The letter acknowledged several limitations. For one, the
findings cannot prove that steroid use in itself led to use of the
harder drugs. However, although the drugs are not similar, other
studies have indicated the two drugs might effect the brain in
similar ways, Pope said. Steroid users get ''a withdrawal effect''
when given drugs used to help heroin or morphine users with
withdrawal, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The letter gives rise to interesting speculation, but should
serve only as an indication that the issue deserves further study,
said Charles Yesalis, a Penn State researcher who was not connected
with the Pope-Arvary project.
</P>
<P>
   He had reported earlier that steroid users had a higher
likelihood of using other drugs. But as for a cause-effect
relationship, ''We are not even within five miles of articulating
that,'' Yesalis said.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Studied for HIV Vaccine  </HEADLINE>
By KIA SHANT'E BREAUX
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLACKSBURG, Va. (AP) -- A vaccine against the HIV virus may lie
in a plant blamed for millions of deaths each year: tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at CropTech Corporation, a biotechnology firm, are
working to genetically alter the leaf to clone a protein found in
two strains of HIV.
</P>
<P>
   When the protein, gp120, is given in a vaccine, researchers say,
it could prompt the body to develop a resistance to the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists around the country are experimenting with using
plants to fight HIV and other illnesses. The University of
Maryland, for example, is researching ways to use potatoes in an
HIV vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I don't know of anyone else using tobacco in this way,''
said Carol Tackett, a professor of medicine at Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   The American Cancer Society welcomes new tobacco research.
</P>
<P>
   ''If tobacco can be used to cure or prevent diseases instead of
cause them, that would be fantastic,'' said Dr. Michael Thun, head
of Epidemologic Research for the American Cancer Society in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Carole Cramer, a plant physiologist at Virginia Tech and
co-founder of Blacksburg-based CropTech, said tobacco is an ideal
plant for this type of research because it yields a million seeds
per plant, grows quickly and is easy to harvest.
</P>
<P>
   The CropTech research is a form of transgenic science, which
involves putting a gene from one species inside the cells of
another.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at CropTech began transferring human genes to
tobacco genes in 1993. They've also used tobacco plants to test
proteins used to battle cancer, prevent blood clotting and treat
genetic disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Proteins have to be made in living systems, and tobacco has
proven to be safer than animals, which can harbor viruses that can
infect humans.
</P>
<P>
   By inserting a human gene into individual tobacco cells, whole
tobacco plants can be generated where every cell is capable of
producing protein coded for the gene.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a way of using tobacco as a factory,'' Cramer said.
''It's a perfect way to cure human illnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Cramer and CropTech see transgenic science as a way to revive a
flagging tobacco industry. Commercialization of transgenic tobacco
could require thousands of acres of tobacco each year. That would
be good news for growers hit hard by the backlash from lawsuits
against the tobacco industry and by quota cuts -- the amount of
tobacco the government allows them to produce.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pharmaceutical companies' demand for tobacco could outweigh
that of tobacco companies,'' said Brandon Price, CropTech's chief
executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   To gear up for that possibility, CropTech has entered into a
partnership with the Virginia Farm Bureau Federation through its
newly created, farmer-owned tobacco production business called
ToBio LLC.
</P>
<P>
   Some farmers in Virginia are participating in field tests of
transgenic tobacco plants.
</P>
<P>
   Thun said it would be a good thing for tobacco growers to
cultivate and sell their crop for pharmaceutical uses.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I don't know that it would necessarily end the financial
incentives for producing cigarettes from tobacco because that is
such a lucrative business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   CropTech receives funding from the National Institutes of Health
and also hopes to receive some funds from the $4 billion Virginia
expects to receive over the next 25 years as its share of the
national tobacco settlement.
</P>
<P>
   While the initial research looks promising, clinical testing of
the HIV vaccine is years away, said David Radin, Crop Tech's
president. And any vaccine would not help those already stricken
with the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Wright, a tobacco grower in Glade Spring and
vice-president of ToBio, said pharmaceutical uses of tobacco will
improve its reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ''This type of research is indicative of the fact that tobacco
isn't all that bad,'' Wright said. ''Isn't it ironic that we could
take something we've been accusing of hurting the health of
Americans and get something good out of it?''

<HEADLINE> Clean Mexico Elections Expected  </HEADLINE>
By JULIE WATSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- In 1993, Olga Hernandez's grandparents
supposedly voted in the state elections of San Luis Potosi,
checking off the boxes for the ruling party candidates. Only they
had been dead about 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, such outright fraud has been commonplace in
Mexico's elections. The Institutional Revolutionary Party has held
the presidency since 1929 -- sometimes using dubious or outright
illegal tactics to maintain power.
</P>
<P>
   As the July 2 presidential election approaches, Hernandez and
others who work for election watchdog groups are convinced that
outright fraud like the votes of her dead grandparents is no longer
feasible.
</P>
<P>
   But they worry about more subtle methods of influencing voters,
such as tying government welfare programs to the PRI, as the ruling
party is widely known.
</P>
<P>
   ''The days of robbing ballot boxes and filling the registry with
phantom voters are gone,'' Hernandez said. ''It's more complex now,
but these tactics could have as strong an impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Jaime Cardenas, a member of the governing council of the
independent Federal Elections Institute, shares those worries. With
the opposition posing perhaps the strongest threat ever to the PRI
-- an opposition leader is running neck-and-neck with the ruling
party candidate -- Cardenas says he expects to see dirty tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are only about halfway toward having transparency and
fairness in Mexico,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Election monitors agree that electoral reforms should prevent a
repeat of 1988, when Mexico was rocked by allegations that the PRI
stole the presidential elections from challenger Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas by manipulating the computerized vote count.
</P>
<P>
   But the ruling party tries to influence voters in ways that
would cause outrage in many countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''The historical government practice of providing goods or state
services in exchange for votes may seriously imperil the
elections,'' warns a report from the Washington Office on Latin
America, an independent research and democracy advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   Election officials are investigating nearly a dozen governors
and high-ranking state officials after accusations that they used
their power -- and taxpayer money -- to support PRI candidates,
Cardenas said.
</P>
<P>
   Among them is Chiapas Gov. Roberto Albores, who admitted to
holding a conversation about manipulating local news coverage to
favor PRI candidate Francisco Labastida as the winner of the
country's first presidential debate. Most national newspapers gave
the victory to Vicente Fox of the center-right National Action
Party, who is running even with Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, television footage showed opposition party
supporters and police pummeling one another over free construction
material designated for backers of the PRI and stored in a
municipal warehouse in a village outside Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   Media barons linked to the ruling party tried to block
anti-fraud public service announcements from the Federal Elections
Institute. Some 1,840 scheduled spots were missed before government
officials were pressured to intervene a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, an elections court fined the ruling party $125,000
because its Mexico City mayoral candidate, Jesus Silva Herzog,
handed out government-issued milk for the poor with his photo and
party emblem in February.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study found a third of the people who voted in a March
state election received gifts like scholarships and groceries via
the ruling party, and 80 percent of the recipients voted for the
PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Because of such incidents, Hernandez's group, the Citizens'
Movement for Democracy, is sending hundreds of observers to small
communities it believes are at risk for election fraud. The group
plans to document any questionable tactics and announce its
findings throughout the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez said she herself had found a shady incident in the
southern state of Oaxaca. In one area, she said, extremely poor
women who receive aid from the federal welfare program Progresa
recently received letters pointing out the money comes from the PRI
government.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over campaign tactics has come despite major changes
to make Mexico's elections more fair.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Elections Institute, which until 1996 was controlled
by the government but now is independent, has spent more than $900
million in cleaning up the electoral system.
</P>
<P>
   Officials revamped voter rolls in which a third of voters listed
did not correspond to reality, either because the names were of
people who did not exist or because it excluded opposition
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The institute also issued 60 million new voter ID cards with
photographs and seven layers of fraud-proof paper, and it produced
ballot boxes with openings big enough to fit only one ballot at a
time.
</P>
<P>
   More than 450,000 Mexican citizens, chosen randomly, will man
the nearly 113,000 polling places along with representatives of the
various political parties.
</P>
<P>
   The institute also installed a computerized system that will
post vote returns on the Internet as they come in on election day.
And it set up a system for polling officials to quickly report
irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   However, mechanisms for the institute to ensure the parties
don't exceed the $100 million limit for the presidential campaign
are insufficient, and it does not have enough legal authority to
deal with questionable campaign tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas said real change will require a social transformation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't legislate everything,'' he said. ''There has to be a
change in the political culture, which maybe will change with the
advances toward more democracy in Mexico. But that's a long
process.''

<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) -- A former Syrian prime minister shot
himself to death Sunday, hospital officials said, months after
resigning amid corruption charges.
</P>
<P>
   Mahmoud el-Zoubi, 62, shot himself in the head at his home in
Dumer outside Damascus, said the officials. He died on the way to a
hospital in Damascus, the officials said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   El-Zoubi was prime minister from Nov. 1, 1987, until March 7,
when he resigned along with his Cabinet amid charges of
mismanagement and corruption.
</P>
<P>
   He was sacked from the ruling Baath Party on May 10 after
President Hafez Assad decided to have him investigated for
corruption, and for harming the national economy during his time in
office.
</P>
<P>
   El-Zoubi's dismissal came at a time when Assad's son Bashar is
leading a campaign against corruption in Syria as his father
presses ahead with promised social and economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the government froze all his assets, pending a trial.
</P>
<P>
   Media is under tight state control in Syria, and it is highly
unusual for corruption charges involving top officials to be
publicized.
</P>
<P>
   Until he became prime minister, el-Zoubi was parliament speaker
from November 1981.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Kherbit Gazaleh village, 75 miles south of Damascus
near the Jordanian border, he was considered close to Assad until
his downfall. He was replaced as prime minister by Mohammed Mustafa
Miro, who was given the task of reviving and modernizing Syria's
economy.
</P>
<P>
   El-Zoubi is survived by two sons and a daughter. The sons also
are accused of corruption. Both work outside the government.

<HEADLINE> British Officer's Laptop Stolen  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- A laptop belonging to a senior naval officer has
been stolen in the third such incident since March, the Defense
Department confirmed Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   A laptop containing training information for MI6, the spy agency
responsible for foreign intelligence, was mislaid by an
intelligence officer in early March and recovered by police two
weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   The same month, a second laptop with classified material on
Northern Ireland was snatched from a MI5 security service officer
at London's Paddington Station when the officer put it down to buy
a train ticket. It has not been found.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest incident, a naval officer lost his computer and
his personal luggage after boarding a train at Paddington station
in early May, a spokesman for the ministry of defense confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   The computer, worth about $3,000, did not contain classified
information, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   But a report in The Sunday Times said the computer held
specifications for the next generation of fighter aircraft and
details of how they can be controlled from the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper, quoting unnamed sources, said a thief trailed the
military officer into the station before snatching the computer.
The thief sold the computer to a dealer, who in turn tried to sell
the contents for $23,000 to a newspaper, The Times said.
</P>
<P>
   The third laptop has not been recovered, the ministry said.

<HEADLINE> Driver fatigue to be issue in I-95 crash trial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   tre filed
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The question of how much rest truck drivers
must get is expected to feature prominently in a civil suit set to
begin Monday against a New Jersey trucking company whose gasoline
tanker exploded two years ago on Interstate 95, killing two people
and shutting down the busy road through the Memorial Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The question before Delaware County jurors will be whether
driver Keith Thomas of Philadelphia fell asleep before his rig
swerved across five lanes and struck a pickup truck, burning
himself and another motorist to death in the ensuing fireball, The
Philadelphia Inquirer reported in Sunday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the state of Pennsylvania and two accident victims
will argue that he did. But lawyers for the company, Samuel
Coraluzzo Co. of Vineland, claim the crash was caused when another
motorist cut Thomas off, sending his truck out of control.
</P>
<P>
   The trial comes as federal safety regulators are weighing new
rules to restrict how many hours truckers can drive without
resting. They want drivers to spend 12 hours off the job for every
12 hours they drive.
</P>
<P>
   About 5,000 people die each year in crashes involving trucks.
The federal government estimates that number can be cut in half
over the next 10 years, in part through the tougher new rules it is
proposing.
</P>
<P>
   ''This just goes to show the problems out there,'' said Daphne
Izer, the founder of Parents Against Tired Truckers, a Maine-based
group. ''Drivers are being pushed beyond the brink because of
corporate greed. The federal government assesses civil penalties,
and it is business as usual.''
</P>
<P>
   It cost Pennsylvania $3 million to repair the damage to the
roadway that was caused by the May 23, 1998 crash that closed the
crucial artery for 33 hours during one of the busiest travel
weekends of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The state is seeking to be reimbursed for that cost, and also
wants punitive damages to deter other trucking companies from
pushing their drivers to work long hours.
</P>
<P>
   Coraluzzo acknowledges its drivers exceeded the amount of hours
they were permitted to work in 94 percent of the cases examined by
federal investigators, and also admitted it failed to monitor the
length of time its drivers spent behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   The company paid an $11,000 civil fine after the crash. It
earned $9.5 million in revenues last year.
</P>
<P>
   Coraluzzo plans to call several witnesses who are expected to
support its contention that a still-unidentified motorist caused
the truck to swerve, even though police have discounted that theory
as a cause of the crash.

<HEADLINE> Passion Play Recast for Millennium  </HEADLINE>
By COLLEEN BARRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   OBERAMMERGAU, Germany (AP) -- When enraged Temple leaders shouted
''Crucify him! Crucify him!'' during a climactic scene at the
premiere Sunday of the world's most famous Passion play, dissenters
defended Jesus for the first time: ''Set him free!''
</P>
<P>
   The revision is among a series of thoughtfully scripted changes
introduced for the millennial production of the Oberammergau
Passion play, acted roughly every decade since 1634. Many of the
story's most ardent critics now declare this version a milestone in
decades-long efforts expunge negative images of Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can say positively that it is a turning point,'' said Irving
Levine, an interfaith expert for the American Jewish Committee,
which has been working with the Anti-Defamation League since the
1960s to remove Jewish stereotypes from the Oberammergau play.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus' Jewishness is emphasized for the first time in this play
about the last five days of his life. He is called ''rabbi'' and
gives a Hebrew blessing at the Last Supper, depicted as a Passover
seder held around a menorah.
</P>
<P>
   Most importantly, the blood oath that assigned Jews collective
guilt for Jesus' death was removed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been working on it for 23 years. They have made huge
progress,'' said Leonard Swidler, a professor of Catholic theology
at Temple University who has worked with the ADL to recommend
changes. ''Academics can always argue about anything, but I see no
substantive difficulties at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The question of how Jews are depicted at Oberammergau, the
oldest continually acted Passion play in Europe, has been an issue
since the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s reversed nearly 2,000
years of church teachings about the collective responsibility of
the Jews for Jesus' death.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oberammergau is the battleground for these issues,'' said
James Shapiro, a director of the theater program at Columbia
University in New York who has written a new history of
Oberammergau.
</P>
<P>
   ''One reason is there's some leverage that can be brought on the
village after Vatican II. And two, it's Germany. There's both some
increased sensitivity and enormous sense of responsibility for
death with Jewish questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Acted against an idyllic Alpine backdrop, the Oberammergau
Passion play so perfectly served Adolf Hitler's ends that he
praised it as a tool ''that convincingly portrayed the menace of
Jewry'' after seeing a 300th anniversary staging in 1934.
</P>
<P>
   The most virulent stereotype perpetuated in the Passion story,
predating Oberammergau, is the notion of Jewish collective guilt
for Jesus' death -- often seen as a primary source of anti-Semitic
thought through the centuries. In 15th-century Frankfurt, city
officials protected the Jewish ghetto during performances. Rome's
Jewish quarter was regularly attacked following reenactments in the
16th century.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Jewish groups that hope the modernized version will
influence Passion plays elsewhere and the nearly half a million
people who will see the play between now and Oct. 8 -- 60 percent of
them Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Amid overwhelmingly positive reaction among critics at the
premiere, there were skeptics. The Anti-Defamation League's Leon
Klenicki voiced reservations about the depiction of the Temple
leadership as the Jewish community's primary voice, united with the
Romans against Jesus in a manner that he said creates a sense of
''Jewish power.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not against Passion plays. It is part of Christian
spirituality. What we are against are the use and uses of the
Passion play for anti-Semitism,'' Klenicki said. ''There is this
past that requires a reckoning of the soul.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning the changes in Oberammergau has required a reckoning
with a centuries-old tradition that many here are loath to change.
The play, acted roughly every 10 years to honor a pledge in thanks
for sparing the village more deaths from the plague, is deeply
ingrained in local life.
</P>
<P>
   Actors must either be born here, or have lived in Oberammergau
for 20 years. Some 2,000 actors are on the stage for every
production -- nearly half of the village's 5,300 residents. Many
first appear in the chorus as children.
</P>
<P>
   Generational change helped secure the recast, after
conservatives lost control of the script in a 1996 referendum. The
new, younger directors reworked images to show support for Jesus
even among nonbelievers and emphasize the absolute authority of
Pilate, the Roman administrator.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than merely deleting objectionable material from the
150-year-old text by Joseph Daisenberger, a Catholic priest, the
directors recast much of the text to move blame away from Jews and
more firmly onto the Roman occupiers. They looked to sources
outside the traditional gospel, including rabbinical texts and even
literature, for inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, the directors also suggest dissension within the
Jewish leadership. For example, high priests no longer wear horned
hats, but are clothed in different colored robes and caps of
varying sizes to suggest a hierarchy and expunge suggestions that
Jewish society uniformly opposed Jesus' message.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reformers and young people have won,'' Shapiro said.
''There has been a fundamental break with tradition. Some kind of
age is over; some kind of moment is over in the village.''

<HEADLINE> Philippine Troops Rescue 2 Hostages  </HEADLINE>
By JIM GOMEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOLO, Philippines (AP) -- Philippine soldiers rescued two child
hostages Sunday in a clash with Muslim rebels who had held the
children and seven others since March.
</P>
<P>
   One soldier and several rebels were injured in the one-hour
battle on the southern Philippine island of Basilan, the military
said. The remaining seven hostages -- five students and two female
teachers -- were still believed to be held by the rebels, said
Ernesto de Guzman, the Philippine military's Southern Command chief
of staff.
</P>
<P>
   The two grade-school children were among a group of about 50
people seized by the Abu Sayyaf rebels from two schools on March
20. Six have been killed and most of the rest either released or
rescued in the intervening weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Also Sunday, negotiators were in Manila to consult President
Joseph Estrada before finally beginning talks on freedom for a
separate group of hostages kidnapped by the Abu Sayyaf 29 days ago.
</P>
<P>
   With the president's approval, negotiations could begin as soon
as Monday on the southern island of Jolo, where the 21 hostages --
three Germans, two French, two Finns, two South Africans, a
Lebanese, nine Malaysians and two Filipinos -- were taken after they
were snatched from a Malaysian diving resort. Formal talks have
been delayed by skirmishes between the rebels and troops, frequent
changes in the government negotiating team and security
arrangements for negotiations on the volatile island.
</P>
<P>
   At the meeting, chief negotiator Robert Aventajado expects the
rebels to submit a document outlining their demands. He also wants
a response to the government's request that the rebels free an ill
German hostage as a show of good will.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf, the smaller and more radical of the two
guerrilla groups fighting for an independent Islamic state in the
southern Philippines, brought world attention to a rebellion that
has simmered for decades when they kidnapped the group of tourists
and employees from the Malaysian island of Sipadan and brought them
to the jungle on Jolo, about an hour away. Their preliminary
demands have ranged from money to the creation of an Islamic state.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200,000 people have been displaced in recent months by
the worst wave of violence in the southern Philippines in years,
triggered by clashes between troops and the two rebel groups.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting has been limited to the impoverished south, home of
the mostly Christian country's Muslim minority, but several bomb
attacks have hit the capital, Manila, since the rebels threatened
to target large cities.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, a bomb exploded in Manila's largest shopping mall,
killing one person and injuring 11 others. The larger rebel group,
the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, denied any involvement. Four
days earlier, an explosion at another shopping mall injured 13.
</P>
<P>
   In the south on Saturday, rebels bombed a restaurant frequented
by Christians in North Cotabato province, seriously wounding 10
people, military officials said. Also Saturday, a Philippine navy
ship was hit by mortar fire as it was patrolling a river near the
main MILF camp, officials said.

<HEADLINE> Minnesota firm tries to shoulder into Buffalo wing market, upstate  </HEADLINE>
By SHARON LINSTEDT
The Buffalo News
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- If there's any city on the planet that
knows its chicken wings, it's Buffalo, the birthplace of the
culinary classic.
</P>
<P>
   A reputation like that might cause most out-of-town chicken wing
sellers to keep their distance, letting the local cooks rule the
roost. But that's not the case with Minnesota-based BW-3.
</P>
<P>
   The Minneapolis restaurant company, which calls itself ''The
Home of the Real Wing,'' will open its first local Buffalo Wild
Wings Grill &AMP; Bar in Clarence next month, with at least three more
locations to follow by year's end. Sites in Rochester, Syracuse,
Albany and Binghamton are also on Buffalo Wild Wings' menu for the
next year or so.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know we've got to be good to be in Buffalo,'' said BW-3
President and Chief Executive Officer Sally Smith. ''We have
nothing but the greatest respect for the chicken wing and believe
we do a great job with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite its Minnesota address, there is a Buffalo connection to
the 117-unit restaurant chain. Buffalo Wild Wings was hatched in
1981 by former Buffalo resident Jim Disbrow, who found himself in
Kent, Ohio, with a craving for the spicy poultry part.
</P>
<P>
   Disbrow, who had lived in Buffalo from 1974 to 1980, decided it
was more convenient to whip up his own wings recipe than to drive
all the way to Buffalo to get his fix, and a restaurant concept
ensued. Disbrow and business partner Scott Lowery, also a former
Buffalo resident, slowly expanded from a single eatery on the Ohio
State University campus to a flock of wing joints throughout the
Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   ''We owe everything to Buffalo and your original wings. You were
our inspiration,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurants originally bore the Buffalo Wild Wings and Weck
nameplate, which regular diners shortened to BW-3. While the
privately held corporation still uses the BW-3 name, the third
''w,'' as well as the beef on weck menu item it signified, has
disappeared from both the menu and the restaurant name.
</P>
<P>
   Word of BW-3's arrival in Buffalo had the manager of Frank and
Teressa's Anchor Bar, the place where wings were invented back in
1961, scratching his head.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why would anybody from Buffalo want to eat wings from these
people?'' Ivano Toscani asked. ''We need another restaurant in
Buffalo like a hole in the head, and a wing restaurant is just
ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Toscani, who ships his Anchor Bar wings to devotees across the
United States, said it ''just seems wrong'' for a Midwestern chain
to call its fare Buffalo wings.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't understand this, and I don't think Buffalo people will
go for it, either. They know the real thing, and it doesn't come
from Minnesota,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Don Spasiano, chairman of Erie Community College's food service
and restaurant department, isn't so quick to count out the
newcomers. Spasiano, who serves on the board of the New York State
Restaurant Association, noted the local acceptance of the Pizza Hut
chain.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have so many fantastic local pizza places in the Buffalo
area, but Pizza Hut does just fine,'' Spasiano said.
</P>
<P>
   Like its local counterparts, Buffalo Wild Wings will have to
demonstrate that it offers a quality, good-tasting product, backed
with customer service, to be successful, according to the
restaurant veteran.
</P>
<P>
   ''At first you might have people saying, ''Oh, my God, give me a
break -- a chain trying to sell wings to Buffalo.' But if the food
is good, the price is right, and it's a fun place to eat, they'll
do fine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Based on consumer reactions in other cities where Buffalo Wild
Wings operates, the wings are pretty tasty. The chain has captured
''best wings'' honors in such locales as Cleveland, Dayton,
Cincinnati, Louisville, Chicago and Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   But as the skeptical Toscani noted: ''Those places aren't
Buffalo. The standard is higher here.''
</P>
<P>
   BW-3, which is using Buffalo as its entry point to New York
State, is also steering clear of neighborhood locations in favor of
high-traffic spots near other chain eateries.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're in an expansion mode. We're being controlled, yet
aggressive,'' Smith said of her company's plan to grow from 117
company-owned and franchise units to as many as 140 locations in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Long-term, BW-3 hopes to have 300 locations by the end of 2004.
The company's 1999 revenues totaled $150 million, with
company-owned units contributing $34.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo Wild Wings serves up its 12 varieties of wings, burgers,
chicken sandwiches, salads and Buffa-litos (burritos dressed up
with wing sauce) in an atmosphere the company describes as ''fast
casual.'' Food orders are placed at a front counter, then delivered
to the table to keep things moving.
</P>
<P>
   And while it bills itself as ''family-friendly,'' the 30 or so
television sets that line its walls, tuned in to sporting events,
combined with a selection of some 50 beers, tend to draw a
sports-oriented crowd.

<HEADLINE> Cruise M:1-2 Love Discusses Role  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Thandie Newton was a little skeptical when Tom
Cruise and director John Woo said their sequel to ''Mission
Impossible'' would have a love story.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said 'Yeah, yeah, yeah. The girl's going to be screaming
while the men are showing off their muscles.' But I was happy to be
of service,'' Newton says in the new issue of Time magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Newton portrays an international jewel thief and Cruise's love
interest in M:I-2.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes, it's fun. It's understandable!'' she said, taking a
gentle swipe at the tough-to-follow plot twists of the original
M:I.
</P>
<P>
   Newton, 27, made her movie debut in the 1990 Australian film
''Flirting,'' which starred Cruise's real-life co-star, Nicole
Kidman.

<HEADLINE> The secretive list is alive and well, but the privileged are in a quandary. </HEADLINE>
By DEBORAH HASTINGS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- It is America's written declaration of the haves
and have-nots. Good luck trying to get one of the haves to admit
that.
</P>
<P>
   The privileged on the Social Register would have the great
unwashed believe the hallowed volume is nothing more than a
glorified phone book. ''A group of pals, really,'' says one
blue-blooded entrant.
</P>
<P>
   Right. And the Carlyle is a Travelodge.
</P>
<P>
   The Register trumpets a certain station in life. Not just of
money, but old money. Not just of ancestry, but rare ancestry.
Twice a year it enumerates an American aristocracy attained by
birth, marriage, or in exceptional cases, nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Its 30,000 listed families are mostly white. Their surnames
include Astor, Auchincloss, Cabot, Kennedy and Roosevelt. For 114
years, the Register has said who's important. And by omission,
who's not. And it remains, at the dawn of the new millennium, a
coveted listing of the select few.
</P>
<P>
   But in today's society, obsessed with appearing egalitarian
while making millions, the upper crust feels a tad guilty. And a
little nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ''Look at the massive fortunes being made by dot-com companies.
Look at the way the stock market has been going; true wealth has
just skyrocketed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Social Register is going to have to accommodate those
people or become obsolete,'' said Stephen Higley, author of
''Privilege, Power and Place: The Geography of the American Upper
Class,'' and a professor of geography at Alabama's University of
Montevallo.
</P>
<P>
   But being a bluebood is never truly out of date.
</P>
<P>
   The Register began in 1886 as the home visiting list of New York
society (as in snowy bosoms, chaste lips and Edith Wharton's ''The
Age of Innocence''). It originally contained 5,000 names, mostly
descendants of English and Dutch settlers.
</P>
<P>
   Caroline Kennedy is on today's list. So are George Plimpton,
Mrs. John R. Whitman (New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman), Mrs.
Peter Greenough (Beverly Sills) and Brooke Astor.
</P>
<P>
   The summer edition is just out, containing such essential
information as who owns a yacht and where it's docked during ''the
season.'' If you're on the list, you can buy the winter and summer
volumes of names and addresses for $96. If you're not, the price is
$105.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, a slick, somewhat supercilious magazine has
accompanied the Register, free of charge. It also symbolizes the
crossroads where the well heeled now stand.
</P>
<P>
   Younger gentry like the Social Register Observer and its
sometimes self-congratulatory tone. They adhere, it appears, to the
adage there's no such thing as bad publicity.
</P>
<P>
   But the magazine -- containing articles with such indelicate
titles as ''Mississippi Blooming,'' and lines such as ''Talent,
like disease, can afflict the high-born as well as the low'' --
embarrasses older socialites.
</P>
<P>
   Not just because of its content.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine accepts advertisements, which is considered crass
by the older haut monde. It also calls attention to the ways of the
upper crust, which is considered even more so.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving the inaugural edition, a horrified Stillman
Loomis of New Canaan, Conn., played nobility's ultimate trump card
and asked to be removed from the list itself. His family has been
on it since the 1900s.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just don't need the Observer waving flags and suggesting I
buy things from Tiffany's,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers include a New York company called Beastly Beds --
''Elegant antique reproductions in styles to suit you and your
pet's discerning taste.''
</P>
<P>
   Disgust with the magazine and with modernizing high society (the
Register does NOT have a Web site), is keenly felt by doyennes
who'd rather wear white after Labor Day than appear stuck up.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is written from a certain snobbish appeal, shall we say,''
said Constance V.R. White of Boston, who was so incensed by the
Observer's debut she sent a haughty letter to the publisher.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is vanity on your part to include it with the Register,''
she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine gamely published her complaint, under the rubric of
''brickbats.'' Like many of her class, Mrs. White is reluctant to
be interviewed. Asked how long her family had been listed on the
Register, she sniffed, ''Good Lord, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   The list is nothing if not incomprehensible. How one gets on it,
how one gets bumped, and who decides are questions not answered.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Nixon's daughter, Tricia Cox, is on it, but sister Julie
Eisenhower is not. Dr. and Mrs. William T. Close are listed, but
not actress-daughter Glenn. Ethel Kennedy is there, but not Teddy.
Ever-hopeful presidential candidate Steve Forbes is on it. Donald
Trump is not.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for being dropped range from the trivial to the
tawdry. Some people just don't want to be on it. Failing to submit
a change-of-address notice is cause for dismissal. So is failing to
observe the penal code. ''The Sidney Biddle Barrows thing, that
kind of big scandal would be cause to be removed from the list,''
said Thomas Jones, Register spokesman and publisher of the
Observer.
</P>
<P>
   Barrows, ''The Mayflower Madam,'' was the blue blood busted in
1985 for supplying prostitutes to the upper crust.
</P>
<P>
   Jones was proposed, then accepted to the list by vote of an
advisory committee. Membership would have been his birthright, but
his father's family asked to be removed from the Register. Jones
would not say when or why.
</P>
<P>
   He is a staunch defender of organizing the well bred. ''Most
people have a network of friends. This is just a more defined
network.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones knows that network is often scorned. ''People say 'Well,
you don't have black members,' or, 'You don't have Asian members.'
And that has just never been true.''
</P>
<P>
   How many from either ethnicity are on the Register?
</P>
<P>
   ''We have no way of knowing who is of color and who is not. We
don't ask for photographs,'' Jones replied.
</P>
<P>
   Cabaret singer Bobby Short knows of two blacks besides himself
who made it to the Social Register: opera star Jessye Norman, who
declined to be interviewed, and the late U.S. Supreme Court Justice
Thurgood Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was not something I went out and sought,'' Short said of
his inclusion in 1999. For years, his staff had used the Register
as a mailing list for his performances at the Carlyle Hotel, the
Upper East Side home-away-from-home of the fabulously rich.
</P>
<P>
   Short has long been friends with the upper crust, most notably
with Gloria Vanderbilt. But he says he can't remember who proposed
his membership.
</P>
<P>
   He says the list is actually egalitarian.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's an expression of democracy at work. I don't come
from a high society background. I'm not even a college graduate.''
</P>
<P>
   But isn't it snooty?
</P>
<P>
   ''That's human nature. That's part of the crowning glory of
being alive -- being part of the elite.'' Having said that, he
laughs heartily.
</P>
<P>
   It is the magazine, and not the Register, which provides insight
into the mindset of people with weighty names ending in Roman
numerals.
</P>
<P>
   Leighton H. Coleman III of Stony Brook, N.Y., wrote a 1995
article about discovering a trunk containing the diary of a distant
female relative bound for New York, in first class, on the new,
''unsinkable'' Titanic.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was all too appalling to grasp and at times seemed as if we
were living through some horrible dream,'' wrote Coleman's ancestor
as she bobbed, warmly wrapped, in a rowboat pulling away from the
sinking Titanic.
</P>
<P>
   The worst maritime disaster in history presented the Social
Register with a dilemma. The elite were judged by their choice of
ship and travel destination, both being duly published by the
Register.
</P>
<P>
   ''To say that listed families crossed on the Titanic gave them
their social due, but it wasn't true,'' reads an accompanying
article in the Observer. ''To say they arrived on the plodding
Carpathia (the steamer that rescued hundreds) was true, but
socially misleading.''
</P>
<P>
   The Register solved its crisis with a hyphen. The surviving
socialites arrived on the ''Titan-Carp'' while more than 1,500
others, many of them passengers from steerage, arrived at the
bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.

<HEADLINE> Sherpa Guide Sets Everest Record  </HEADLINE>
By BINAJ GURUBACHARYA
<TEXT>
<P>
   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) -- A Sherpa guide reached the summit of
Mount Everest in less than 16 hours on Sunday, shattering the
record for the fastest climb of the world's highest peak.
</P>
<P>
   Babu Chhiri, 34, made the climb through icy winds and rarified
air to the 29,035-foot summit Sunday morning -- a year after he set
a duration record by camping for 21 hours on the peak. His brother
Dawa had scaled the mountain earlier and waited at the summit to
welcome him, said Chhiri's business partner, who contacted the
climbers by radio.
</P>
<P>
   Chhiri, a veteran climber, reached the peak in 15 hours and 56
minutes to easily break the previous record of 20 hours and 24
minutes, set two years ago by Kaji Sherpa.
</P>
<P>
   The Sherpas, who live at the foot of the Himalayas, are known as
''Tigers of the Snows.'' Renowned for their mountaineering skills
and stamina, many work as expert guides and porters for Nepalese
tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Since the first recorded conquest of Everest in 1953 by Sir
Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay, more than 800 people have
conquered the tallest peak. Some 180 people have died on its
slopes.
</P>
<P>
   Chhiri climbed from the base camp at 17,500 feet, said the
Nepalese tourism ministry. The climb from the base camp to the
summit normally takes two to four days with breaks in between
camps, depending on the weather.
</P>
<P>
   Icy winds cut through the air as Chhiri hurried up the hard snow
to meet his elder brother. Like most Nepalese Sherpas, Chhiri
climbs without using bottled oxygen even though air pressure is
low, making breathing strenuous.
</P>
<P>
   Chhiri was scheduled to begin his journey at 4 p.m. Saturday but
he had to delay his bid by an hour, according to his business
partner, Babu, who uses only one name.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it had not been for the snow he could have done it in even
less time,'' Babu said.
</P>
<P>
   Chhiri already had climbed Everest nine times. Before leaving
for the mountain this time, Chhiri had told The Associated Press
that he wanted to scale the peak in 16 hours or less.
</P>
<P>
   During a practice run last year, he climbed from the base camp
to an intermediate camp at South Col in nine hours. ''This leaves
me with seven hours to make my final but the most difficult part of
the journey,'' he said then.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Chhiri stayed for 21 hours at the summit. Most
climbers retreat within a few minutes of scaling the peak, with its
high winds, freezing temperatures, unpredictable and rapid weather
changes and brain-starving lack of oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Sunday, two Canadians -- Byron Smith, 40, a car salesman
from Alberta, and Michael Down, 43, a mountain guide from British
Columbia -- also scaled Everest, officials said.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Approve EU Trade Accord  </HEADLINE>
By CLARE NULLIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- Swiss voters approved a sweeping free trade
package with the European Union by a two-thirds majority Sunday,
easing out of their self-imposed isolation in the heart of the
continent.
</P>
<P>
   Government, industry and trade union representatives all hailed
the outcome as vital to the continued prosperity of the wealthy
Alpine nation with a population of just 7 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our country has made an important step into the 21st
century,'' said Foreign Minister Joseph Deiss. ''We are delighted
with this courageous and forward-looking decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a long, tough road,'' Deiss, visibly relieved at the
outcome, told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Final results showed a higher than expected 67.2 percent favored
the accords, which cover seven areas including labor, land and air
transport and agriculture. Turnout was 48 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The government said it didn't interpret the result as a sign one
way or the other on EU membership.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Swiss leaders would like to join the EU at some
stage, they have been afraid to take the plunge ever since the
electorate rejected proposals to join a loose economic free trade
pact called the European Economic Area in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Many older Swiss still want to guard the nation's strict
political independence and sovereignty -- a reason that the country
has so far refused to join the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Given that Switzerland buys 80 percent of its imports from the
EU and sends 63 percent of its exports to the 15-nation bloc, the
government had to negotiate the complex bilateral accords to
replace the EEA treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Nationalist and fringe environmental groups, who collected
enough signatures to force the referendum, argued the accords would
lead to a flood of cheaper labor and an avalanche of heavy trucks
through the Alps.
</P>
<P>
   But their emotive campaign didn't sway voters, who enjoy a
booming economy but have some fears that Switzerland will be pushed
into the wilderness as the EU continues to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, Switzerland's most influential populist
politician, Christoph Blocher, reluctantly accepted the accords and
didn't join in the no-campaign. Even German-speaking rural areas,
which traditionally opposed European integration, voted yes.
</P>
<P>
   The package is meant to begin in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   It states that Swiss should be able to work freely in the EU by
2003, while Swiss restrictions on EU labor will be phased out by
2013 -- a deliberately long period to allay Swiss fears of being
swamped.
</P>
<P>
   Switzerland's main trade union body said the government must now
implement promised safeguards to ensure that foreign workers don't
undercut Swiss minimum salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Trade barriers will be lowered on food products like cheese,
fruit and vegetables, and in the areas of research, technical
standards and public procurement.
</P>
<P>
   In a trade-off, Switzerland will have to end its ban on 40-ton
trucks by 2005 but Swiss airlines will get the same access to EU
airports and passengers as EU airlines. That exchange satisfied
Swissair, which now must negotiate with individual EU countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''Swissair will be able to benefit from the same liberties and
opportunities as its EU competitors,'' said SAirGroup President
Eric Honegger.

<HEADLINE> Albright Acknowledges Criticism  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright urged
George Washington University graduates to ''be doers, not
dabblers'' even as she acknowledged their criticism of her
appearance Sunday and the Clinton administration's policy toward
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know that there are some who are unhappy I was chosen and I
can understand why,'' she told the 3,500 graduates. ''If I were a
graduate, I would have asked for Denzel Washington or Tom Cruise.
But I'm pleased you didn't, because I love academic surroundings.''
</P>
<P>
   At an entrance to the outdoor ceremony near the White House,
students and anti-war protesters distributed literature denouncing
U.N. sanctions against Iraq. Critics say sanctions have led to the
deaths of millions of Iraqis due to inadequate supplies of food and
medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling her own attraction to foreign policy, Albright told
the graduates to ''choose to live your lives, instead of simply
drift through them; to be doers, not dabblers; to act with courage
and compassion'' despite what will be a ''path obstructed'' and a
''course steep and uphill.''
</P>
<P>
   ''But no matter how high the odds against you may sometimes
seem, and no matter how tough the opposition may be, I hope you
will have the courage to go for it, never back down, don't give
in,'' said Albright, who also received an honorary doctorate of
laws degree.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because there is no greater satisfaction in life than using
your gifts to help others and to contribute to your community and
country,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Mideast Fighting Concerns Albright  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said
Sunday the United States is keeping a close eye on renewed Mideast
violence that prompted Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak to cancel
a planned Washington visit this week.
</P>
<P>
   ''We obviously are concerned and have been following it very
closely,'' Albright said on ABC's ''This Week.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak was scheduled to met with President Clinton at the White
House on Tuesday as part of the United States' effort to smooth
peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
   After a week of violence in Palestinian-controlled lands and
heavy fighting in south Lebanon, Barak announced Saturday he will
skip the trip. Israel also called home its envoys to unofficial
peace talks in Sweden and barred travel by its citizens and foreign
tourists to Palestinian-controlled territory.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that violence certainly hurts the overall environment,
but I think we are making progress,'' toward Israeli-Palestinian
peace, Albright said. ''There's work going on -- there's still gaps,
but there is work going on.''

<HEADLINE> Blast Hits Second Manila Mall  </HEADLINE>
By OLIVER TEVES
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- A bomb exploded in Manila's largest
shopping mall Sunday, killing one person and injuring 11 others in
the second attack on a shopping center in the capital in four days,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb was placed in a corner of a women's toilet at a movie
theater at the SM MegaMall, police chief Edgar Aglipay said. The
blast toppled a concrete toilet divider wall, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion came just four days after a powerful blast at the
Glorietta Mall injured 13 people.
</P>
<P>
   Muslim separatists have threatened to launch attacks against
Philippine cities in retaliation for a military offensive in the
southern Philippines. But the largest rebel group, the Moro Islamic
Liberation Front, denied involvement in Sunday's blast.
</P>
<P>
   Aglipay described the bomb as an improvised homemade device that
was different from Wednesday's bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Ann Bea, who works in a nearby shop, said she saw smoke
billowing out of the theater, which others said was playing the
movie ''Armageddon.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard people shouting and screaming for their friends,'' she
said. ''I was crying in panic.''
</P>
<P>
   Security has been tightened at shopping malls throughout the
northern Philippine city since Wednesday's bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ''The terrorists are trying to bring down the will of the
government to go against kidnappers and cowardly terrorists,'' said
Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado.
</P>
<P>
   The explosions come after a series of deadly bombings that have
hit the southern Philippines since February, when 40 people were
killed in a blast on a ferry in Ozamis City. Last month, several
blasts followed a military offensive against Muslim rebel
positions.
</P>
<P>
   No group has claimed responsibility for those bombings, but the
military blamed the rebels, including the smaller but more radical
Abu Sayyaf group.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf is holding 21 mostly foreign hostages on Jolo
island and another group of about seven children and two teachers
in Basilan province.

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leone To Hold Rebel Chief  </HEADLINE>
By CLARENCE ROY-MACAULAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Pro-government forces were
advancing toward a rebel-held town that would position them to make
a push against a key rebel stronghold, officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-government forces, including members of the army, former
junta soldiers and militiamen composed of traditional hunters known
as the Kamajors, were fighting their way toward Lunsar, 50 miles
northeast of Sierra Leone's capital Freetown, said two top military
officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   They declined to give further details, and their account could
not be independently confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   From Lunsar, the military would be well-placed to launch an
attack on the central city of Makeni, an important rebel
stronghold.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past 10 days, government forces have been slowly
pushing the rebels back from the Freetown area and out of a number
of other important towns.
</P>
<P>
   The counterattack followed a rebel offensive that brought them
to within 40 miles of Freetown, part of a resurgence in Sierra
Leone's civil conflict that has also seen the rebels seize hundreds
of U.N. peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have not launched any major attacks in recent days,
and it was not clear who has been leading them since rebel chief
Foday Sankoh was seized on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah is seeking to push ahead with a
peace accord signed last year. However, the rebels remain
well-armed at their jungle bases, and are still holding 334 U.N.
peacekeepers. The rebels have demanded Sankoh's release and have
given no indication that they are willing to disarm.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas have not linked Sankoh's release to the freedom
of the U.N. captives. However, they seized 500 U.N. peacekeepers at
the beginning of the month, and had been freeing them in groups, a
process that halted after Sankoh was taken into custody.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Sankoh might be released in a bid to end Sierra Leone's
renewed conflict, Information Minister Julius Spencer said
Saturday, ''it's out of the question. It's not possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. contingent now numbers 10,400, the largest U.N.
peacekeeping deployment in the world, and has been authorized to
grow to 13,000.
</P>
<P>
   In another development, a British aid worker, Alan Smith, 55,
has been missing since May 9, Britain's Foreign Office said. Smith
disappeared near the town of Songo, 25 miles east of the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, U.S. envoy Jesse Jackson denounced the ''terror
tactics'' of the rebels and called on them to release the
peacekeepers immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ''The RUF must disarm voluntarily, and immediately, or be made
to disarm involuntarily,'' Jackson said Saturday at a news
conference in neighboring Liberia.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, acting as President Clinton's special envoy, is touring
West Africa in a bid to calm tensions in Sierra Leone and win the
freedom of the peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said Saturday that he had not yet decided whether he
would go to Sierra Leone. He was traveling to Mali and Guinea over
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh, widely reviled for his role in the country's brutal
civil war, was captured as he walked toward his Freetown home --
which he had fled May 8 when his fighters fired on a crowd of
demonstrators, killing 19.
</P>
<P>
   The government has said it is investigating the shooting, and
has not yet decided what to do with the rebel chief.

<HEADLINE> US Eritrea Evacuation Under Way  </HEADLINE>
By CRAIG NELSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) -- With trucks loaded with Eritrea's
soldiers roaring past, Barbara Heywood stood alongside the road in
the inky blackness before dawn Sunday and said her last goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't worry. We'll be all right,'' said her friend, an
Eritrean air force mechanic headed into battle with Ethiopian
troops in a war between two of the world's most impoverished
nations.
</P>
<P>
   Heywood, of Manchester, England, left the Eritrean capital of
Asmara later Sunday -- one of the scores of foreign teachers, aid
workers and development experts who joined the U.S. evacuation of
part of its embassy staff here. Left behind were not only friends,
but a country reeling from poverty, drought, and now, a future made
uncertain by renewed conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's sad to know that when we come back, some of our students
will be dead,'' the 50-year-old English instructor said, tears
spilling down her checks, before boarding a chartered DC-10 to
Frankfurt, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The United States ordered the partial evacuation in the face of
Ethiopia's now nine-day-old offensive, launched to try to force an
end to its two-year border war with its smaller neighbor. The 206
evacuees included 14 embassy workers and dependents.
</P>
<P>
   Their departure follows a week during which Ethiopian forces
seized the key western town of Barentu in a lightning advance and
claimed to have taken control of territory just 60 miles from
Asmara. The fighting has uprooted an estimated 550,000 Eritreans,
chasing 20,000 into Sudan, the U.N. refugee agency said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia reported a lull in the fighting Sunday after days of
bombarding military sites to the south and west of Asmara.
Eritrea's government has had little to say on an offensive that the
armed forces are desperately trying to stop.
</P>
<P>
   There were no indications that Ethiopian forces intended to
advance into the capital itself. Ethiopia said last week its goal
was to 'dismantle' the Eritrean army, secure territory around the
two countries' disputed border and withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   Those statements hardly assuaged Eritreans in the capital, who
saw the U.S. evacuation on Sunday as another sign of its
abandonment by Western governments, an encouraging sign to
Ethiopia, and a harbinger of worse things to come.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ethiopia will bomb Asmara now,'' said Yakob, a 26-year-old
army officer who spoke on condition that only his first name be
used. ''The United States should think about the consequences to us
before its does such things.''
</P>
<P>
   The pace of the Ethiopian offensive has stunned Eritreans,
emptying classrooms, gutting development projects and draining the
work force, the departing teachers and aid workers said Sunday.
Schools have closed as young men and women alike have gone to the
fronts, even lying about their age with the complicity of their
teachers so they can carry out what they regard solemnly as their
patriotic duty, said Tristan Julnes, a 30-year-old woodworking
instructor from Vancouver, British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   In a war that has already cost the lives of tens of thousands of
soldiers and civilians on both sides, the result is catastrophic,
Julnes said. ''Ethiopia is not only dismantling an army. They're
destroying a generation of young people that are the future of the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Julnes and Heywood, taught in Eritrea for $9 a day under the
auspices of the Volunteer Service Overseas, a Canadian- and
European-based aid organization. All but one of the group's 14
teachers in Eritrea left Sunday. Fifty-year-old Alex Hamilton of
Oban, Scotland stayed behind. The decision cost him his job.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't want to leave people who have been abandoned by
everybody else,'' Hamilton explained, his voice choking.
</P>
<P>
   For Sarah Peyten, the choice to leave was anguishing in a
different way.
</P>
<P>
   The 28-year-old English teacher from Cornwall, England, said her
husband, an Eritrean science teacher, was going to the front and
urged her to wait out the war in England. They spent their morning
together hoping it wouldn't be the last.
</P>
<P>
   ''We prayed that he'd come out alive,'' Peyten said. ''It's a
nasty war.''

<HEADLINE> Pro-Israeli Fighters Defect  </HEADLINE>
By ZEINA KARAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Forty-six Israeli-backed militiamen
defected to the Lebanese Sunday, leaving three crucial outposts
unprotected in southern Lebanon that would allow guerrillas to
reach the Israeli border, militia officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The defections came as Iranian-backed Muslim Hezbollah
guerrillas relentlessly attacked Israeli forces, who are pulling
out of south Lebanon to end a 22-year military presence. One
Israeli soldier was wounded in the attacks by Hezbollah, which has
fought the Israeli occupation for years.
</P>
<P>
   The defections by members of the South Lebanon Army militia are
the first on such a large scale. They took place from outposts near
the villages of Qantara, Taibeh and Deir Sirian, which had earlier
been vacated by retreating SLA fighters, SLA officials said.
</P>
<P>
   They said the SLA men descended from their outposts and joined
hundreds of Lebanese families who had returned to their deserted
homes in the three villages, almost 20 years after they left during
the Israeli invasion. People also returned to inspect their empty
homes in three more villages.
</P>
<P>
   The SLA has vowed to continue controlling the occupied zone
after the Israelis leave Lebanon, but observers doubt the militia
alone would be a match for the guerrillas whose relentless attacks
helped force Israel out. A number of SLA militiamen have defected
in recent days following calls by the Hezbollah for them to do so.
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, Israeli military officials said that when a mass
of people tried to approach their homes in Taibeh, SLA fighters
abandoned their station, leaving behind a tank and two armored
personnel carriers. The officials said the post was taken over by
Hezbollah members, but that could not be independently confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Taibeh is only 2 miles from the Israeli border. Israel's Channel
Two television showed an Israeli helicopter firing on the outpost
and reported that a tank returned fire.
</P>
<P>
   Some SLA militiamen remained in Markaba, less than a quarter
mile from Taibeh. If the SLA abandons Markaba, the guerrillas will
not only be at Israel's doorstep but will also succeed in bisecting
the occupied zone. The road linking the eastern and western sectors
of the occupied zone runs through Markaba.
</P>
<P>
   A statement from Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss' office
welcomed the ''return of the villages to the nation's fold.'' It
made no reference to the defections.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's fighting, Hezbollah fired at least 20 Katyusha
rockets, two of which hit an SLA outpost in Ahmadieh. The Hezbollah
also claimed it attacked a string of SLA positions, Lebanese
security officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Hezbollah said in a statement that its fighters fired
mortars at the Israeli Ramieh outpost near the border. A statement
issued by the Israeli military in Jerusalem said one soldier was
wounded. The army ''views with severity the terrorist fire into
Israel,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   Israel and SLA retaliated with artillery and air raids.
</P>
<P>
   Israel invaded Lebanon in 1978 and created a security zone in
the occupied area in 1985 to protect northern Israeli towns from
guerrilla attacks. It is now withdrawing as part of an election
pledge by Prime Minister Ehud Barak. Israel has said the withdrawal
will be completed by July 7.
</P>
<P>
   The Hezbollah said it also attacked an Israeli position at Jabal
el-Rouss on the northwestern edge of the disputed Chebaa territory.
Israeli state radio said the attack was the first in years.
</P>
<P>
   Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, the chief of Hezbollah, said at a Beirut
rally that the attack was related to Lebanon's demand that Israel
withdraw from the Chebaa farmland at the foot of Mount Hermon as
part of its ongoing pullout. Israel has said Chebaa will not be
included in the withdrawal because the area was captured from Syria
during the 1967 Mideast War.

<HEADLINE> Minister pulls three children from burning house  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- A minister pulled three children from a
burning home Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Rochester firefighters say the Rev. Marcus Sheppard saved the
lives of Quisa Murray, 6, James Russell, 4, and Imani Russell, 2.
They weren't injured. The minister had found the found the children
alone just after 2 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ''My first concern was getting those kids out,'' said Sheppard,
a minister at Gospel Angel Spiritual Church. Fire investigators
said that the children started the fire while playing with matches.
</P>
<P>
   Two floors of the house were damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Two firefighters were treated for minor burns.
</P>
<P>
   Sheppard, who spotted the fire from next door, said he entered
the house through the side door and saw Quisa and James standing in
the smoke near the first-floor kitchen. The 2-year-old was headed
toward the stairs to the second floor, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I grabbed the two kids and got them outside, and then I caught
Imani at the foot of the stairs,'' Sheppard said. ''I had to pray
when I got her outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Dan McBride, a spokesman for the city fire department, said
that the children were probably too frightened to flee. The smoke
at the top of the stairs might have been fatal for the 2-year-old,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Marcus was in the right place at the right time and did the
right thing,'' McBride said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said that the children's mother, Vivian Murray, had left
them in the care of her brother, Charles Murray, who had left them
alone while he went to the store.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Murray, 25, was charged with endangering the welfare of
minors.

<HEADLINE> Novelist Barbara Cartland Dies  </HEADLINE>
By AUDREY WOODS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Dame Barbara Cartland, self-styled queen of
romantic fiction and considered the world's best-selling author,
died in her sleep at her estate near Hatfield on Sunday after a
short illness, her family said. She was 98.
</P>
<P>
   Cartland's novels, about feminine virtue and manly ideals, were
dictated to a relay of secretaries as she reclined on a sofa,
dressed usually in a glamorous Cartland-pink frock. Living on her
400-acre estate 15 miles north of London, she worked to a strict
schedule, producing 6,000 to 7,000 words in an afternoon, and could
finish a book in seven afternoons.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewers generally ignored her work and she did not pretend to
be a great writer. But she was immensely popular.
</P>
<P>
   Against the increasing pressures of the sexual revolution,
Cartland carried the banner of old-fashioned romance with
unswerving dedication.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of her 723 books exceeded one billion worldwide in 36
languages. The Guinness Book of Records lists her as the world's
top-selling author.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of her virginal heroines and commanding heroes
seemed to grow as society grappled with infidelity, divorce,
abortion, drugs and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ''Personally I want to be loved, adored, worshipped, cosseted
and protected. Judging by the Romantic boom, this is what women all
over the world want, too,'' she said in 1977, pointing out that she
was a best seller in Europe, North America, Turkey, Singapore,
India, the Philippines and Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
   ''The permissive society has been an awful, crashing flop,'' she
once said. ''There's no reason for all that pornography, which is
quite disgusting.''
</P>
<P>
   But she insisted she was no prude, and was fond of France
''because it is the only country where you can make love in the
afternoon without someone hammering on the door.''
</P>
<P>
   Her crusade in the name of virginity brought her ridicule as
well as admiration, but even her critics acknowledged her as a
force to be reckoned with.
</P>
<P>
   It was never clear whether she was strictly serious about her
rather rococo image because, as she herself said, ''Nobody sends up
Barbara Cartland better than I do myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Her remarks to the press, however slight, were
attention-getters.
</P>
<P>
   ''I always use boot polish on my eyelashes, because I am a very
emotional person and it doesn't run when I cry,'' she once told
Martyn Harris of the Sunday Telegraph.
</P>
<P>
   Born July 9, 1901, she lost her father early, a casualty of
World War I. Her mother moved the family to London and opened a
dress shop in Kensington to support them.
</P>
<P>
   Young Barbara was heavily influenced by the leading romantic
novelists of the time: Elinor Glyn and Ethel M. Dell. She also
learned that ''the things that nice girls couldn't do seemed
endless.''
</P>
<P>
   As a young woman she began making money by contributing items to
a newspaper gossip column at 5 shillings a paragraph. By the time
she was 22 she was writing articles about the social life of the
bright young things of London, their parties and short skirts.
</P>
<P>
   She said publishing magnate Lord Beaverbrook tried but failed to
acquire her as a mistress, but befriended her and helped her
career, introducing her to famous people.
</P>
<P>
   Her first novel, ''Jigsaw,'' appeared in 1925.
</P>
<P>
   In 1927 Cartland married Alexander McQorquodale, a wealthy Scot.
Their daughter Raine was born in 1928. They divorced in 1933.
</P>
<P>
   She continued writing novels and working for newspapers and in
1936 married Hugh McQorquodale, a cousin of her ex-husband. They
had two sons, Ian and Glen.
</P>
<P>
   Raine was married in 1948 to Gerald Legge, who later became
Viscount Lewisham. They divorced and Raine married the 8th Earl
Spencer, whose daughter was Princess Diana.
</P>
<P>
   Hugh McQorquodale died in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   At about the age of 50 Cartland began to develop her inimitable
style. She was always glamorously and femininely dressed, wore
jewels, white fox furs and rode in a white Rolls Royce.
</P>
<P>
   She said her trademark color pink ''helps our brain ... helps
you to be clever.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1991 she was made a Dame of the British Empire. She said she
was sure the honor was not for her contributions to literature but
for her efforts of behalf of charities and the gypsies.
</P>
<P>
   Asked where her ideas for so many books came from, she told The
Associated Press: ''Prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I say a prayer. I really do. I say, 'Please God, get me a
plot.' It's absolutely extraordinary: then a plot comes.''
</P>
<P>
   She had no interest in retiring.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think old people are so much better when they have something
to do. ... People retire at 65, which is wicked, go home to their
boring wives and die at once. The whole thing is you must keep
going.''
</P>
<P>
   Her family said there would be a small family funeral service
and a memorial service. No dates were given.

<HEADLINE> Plane from A.C. crashes with 19 people aboard  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER NEWTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILKES-BARRE, Pa. (AP) -- A charter plane carrying 19 people on a
flight from Atlantic City, N.J., crashed Sunday as it approached
the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport, apparently killing
all 19 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
   ''It appeared that both engines failed,'' said FAA spokeswoman
Tammy Jones.
</P>
<P>
   There were no signs of survivors, said Joe Thomas, manager of
the Luzerne County 911 system. Wreckage was spotted in the heavily
wooded area, about 9 miles south of the airport in northeastern
Pennsylvania and 90 miles north of Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ''Investigators found a ball of fire at the scene,'' Jones said.
''The weather was bad, it was windy and there was some
precipitation. The visibility was poor.''
</P>
<P>
   The twin-engine turbo prop was attempting to land at the airport
when it apparently developed engine trouble, said Wy Gowell,
assistant director at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency crews began searching along the planned flight path of
the plane as soon as they were notified shortly after 11:30 a.m.
that it would not reach the airport, said Luzerne County 911
spokesman Ron Rome. Wreckage was spotted in a wooded area in Bear
Creek Township about 12:45 p.m., he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The plane crashed about two miles into the woods,'' said Al
Bardar, director for emergency management for Luzerne County.
''Apparently there isn't much left in one piece. It doesn't look
like anyone survived.''
</P>
<P>
   The coroner's office was sent to the scene along with fire
rescuers, state police, emergency medical workers and other county
authorities, Rome said. The National Transportation Safety Board
also had been notified, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The BA-31 Jetstream disappeared off radar during a second
instrument approach about 11:40 a.m., Jones said. In general, an
instrument approach is performed if the visibility is poor or if
there are low clouds.
</P>
<P>
   Megan Maguire was outside gardening at her home near the airport
on the northern rim of the Pocono Mountains shortly before noon
Sunday when she heard a plane apparently having problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard the engines die, then I heard them start up again, and
then they just died. I heard it rev up twice, so it died twice,''
said Maguire, who often hears planes pass overhead as they prepare
to land at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Hartt, spokesman for the South Jersey Transportation
Authority, which operates the Atlantic City Airport, said the
Executive Airlines plane departed the city about 10:30 a.m. and was
scheduled to land in Wilkes-Barre an hour later.
</P>
<P>
   Hartt said the airline typically runs casino charters but did
not know who was aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's crash appeared to be the worst in Pennsylvania since
1994, when a USAir 737 crashed near Pittsburgh, killing all 132
people aboard.

<HEADLINE> Serbs Demand Free Media Amid Arrests  </HEADLINE>
By MISHA SAVIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A few thousand Belgraders gathered
Sunday to protest the government's clampdown on nongovernment
media, while police arrested more opposition activists throughout
the country.
</P>
<P>
   At least three activists of the pro-democracy student group
Otpor, or Resistance, were detained, in addition to dozens arrested
in previous days.
</P>
<P>
   In Smederevo, 20 miles southeast of Belgrade, activist Marko
Markovic was charged with ''violating public law and order'' after
police arrested him for walking in the street wearing a T-shirt
with the group's emblem, a clenched fist, the independent Beta news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, about 3,000 opposition supporters gathered to
listen to journalists from the banned Studio B television, whose
reporters, after being kicked out of their premises by police on
Wednesday, have begun reading their news from an open-air,
make-shift studio in downtown Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The latest crackdown against government opponents follows the
recent assassination of a close aide to President Slobodan
Milosevic. The government accused Otpor and a top opposition party
of being behind the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Otpor and the opposition Serbian Renewal Movement have denied
the charges, but the regime ignored their pleas, closing down the
opposition-controlled, Belgrade-based Studio B television as well
as the popular B2-92 radio station.
</P>
<P>
   The move triggered protests in Belgrade, which quickly erupted
into violence, leaving more than 150 people injured and landing a
few dozen in jail.
</P>
<P>
   A top official from Milosevic's ruling Socialists, Uros
Suvakovic, reiterated on Sunday the regime's pledge to ''fight
against terrorism'' and opposition parties accused of working in
the interests of NATO and other perceived Milosevic foes in the
West.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must not be soft,'' Suvakovic declared.
</P>
<P>
   The Socialists and their neo-communist allies, the United Left,
which is led by Milosevic's wife Mirjana Markovic, have said they
will introduce legislation in the coming days aimed at giving the
regime even broader authority in suppressing opponents.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition, which maintains contacts with west European
countries and the United States, is now trying to secure some
support from Moscow, which has traditionally been inclined to back
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia on Sunday demanded that the European Union lift
sanctions against it, expressing particular anger at the EU's
selective approach to punish the Serb republic while sparing
pro-western Montenegro, both of which are part of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The official Tanjug news agency on Sunday carried a message the
Yugoslav Foreign Ministry sent to Brussels, protesting the ban on
trade, financial and most other links between EU member countries
and Yugoslavia, imposed for Milosevic's belligerent policies.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is continuing pressure aimed to destabilize Yugoslavia,''
which has ''also inflicted great losses to Yugoslavia's
neighbors,'' the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Parties Kick Off Campaigns  </HEADLINE>
By RAVI NESSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLEN VIEW, Zimbabwe (AP) -- On the first official weekend of the
campaign for parliamentary elections, the ruling party and the
opposition held rallies across Zimbabwe, attacking each other to
loud cheers from their supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 1,000 people gathered Sunday in the Harare suburb of Glen
View as Morgan Tsvangirai, leader of the opposition Movement for
Democratic Change, said the ruling ZANU-PF party was out of touch
with ordinary Zimbabweans and was responsible for the economic
crisis the country is suffering.
</P>
<P>
   ''ZANU-PF cannot walk around and say look at our record, because
it is a record of failure,'' he said in a speech that switched
between English and the Shona language.
</P>
<P>
   Tsvangirai accused President Robert Mugabe of creating a climate
of instability that was destroying any chance of attracting outside
investment. When Tsvangirai asked those without jobs to raise their
hands, the majority of the crowd responded.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is creating economic chaos in the country,'' Tsvangirai
said.
</P>
<P>
   At an earlier rally on a farm in Mashumba, 30 miles east of
Harare, ZANU-PF officials said the election was about the unequal
distribution of land in a country where 4,000 white farmers own
one-third of all the productive farmland.
</P>
<P>
   ''The question here is not about the election. The question is
about the land problem,'' said Sabina Mugabe, Mugabe's sister.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 white farmers were among the 400 people at the ruling
party rally. White farmers, who as a group have been considered MDC
supporters, have in the past two weeks begun attending ruling party
rallies.
</P>
<P>
   After the MDC and other government opponents helped defeat a
constitutional referendum in February that would have entrenched
Mugabe's power, armed gangs of ruling party militants have occupied
about 1,200 white farms. They have demanded the farms be seized and
redistributed to landless blacks.
</P>
<P>
   A wave of political violence across the country that accompanied
the invasions has left 23 people dead, mostly MDC supporters. In
recent weeks, the militants have been forcing farm workers and
others in rural areas to attend their rallies.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Mugabe set the parliamentary elections for June 24
and 25. They will likely be his strongest electoral challenge since
he led the country to independence from Britain in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Sabina Mugabe, the local member of Parliament, told the farmers
at her rally that they were not the enemies of Zimbabwe, but they
must pledge their support for the president.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have a right to be Zimbabweans, but you must take off the
shells of being a white supremacist, the shells of being a colonial
master, the shells of being a superior group and come back to being
Zimbabweans,'' she said. As she spoke, the crowd chanted: ''Forward
with Mugabe, down with Tsvangirai.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposition officials have accused President Mugabe of using the
land issue to distract voters from the dismal economy and of
inciting attacks on the opposition to intimidate his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   The MDC accused ruling party thugs of beating some opposition
supporters in Harare's Mabvuku suburb.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 local MDC organizers were arrested overnight in advance
of the Glen View rally, party spokesman Nomore Sibanda said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They seem to have been picked up just for organizing the
rally,'' said Nomore Sibanda.
</P>
<P>
   Late Sunday they were still being held at an undisclosed
location and charges against them had not been revealed by police.

<HEADLINE> Former Syrian PM Commits Suicide  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) -- A former Syrian prime minister shot
himself to death Sunday, the Interior Ministry said, months after
he was forced out of office amid charges of corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Mahmoud el-Zoubi, 62, shot himself in the head at his home in
Dumer outside Damascus, said a statement from the Interior Ministry
carried by the official Syrian Arab News Agency.
</P>
<P>
   It said el-Zoubi committed suicide after learning that the
Damascus police chief had come to his house to serve a judicial
notice to appear before an investigating judge to answer
allegations of corruption and other violations ''that caused great
harm to the national economy.''
</P>
<P>
   El-Zoubi died on the way to the Al-Muwasah government hospital
in Damascus, said hospital officials.
</P>
<P>
   None of his family accompanied him to the hospital, they said.
</P>
<P>
   El-Zoubi was prime minister from Nov. 1, 1987, until March 7,
when he resigned along with his Cabinet amid charges of
mismanagement and corruption.
</P>
<P>
   He was sacked from the ruling Baath Party on May 10 after
President Hafez Assad decided to have him investigated for
corruption, and for harming the national economy during his time in
office.
</P>
<P>
   El-Zoubi's dismissal came at a time when Assad's son Bashar is
leading a campaign against corruption in Syria as his father
presses ahead with promised social and economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Media is under tight control in Syria, and it is highly unusual
for corruption charges involving top officials to be publicized.
</P>
<P>
   Until he became prime minister, el-Zoubi was parliament speaker
from November 1981.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Kherbit Gazaleh village, 75 miles south of Damascus
near the Jordanian border, he was considered close to Assad until
his downfall. He was replaced as prime minister by Mohammed Mustafa
Miro, who was given the task of reviving and modernizing Syria's
economy.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, former Transport Minister Mufeed Abdul Karim was
taken into custody pending investigation into charges of
''corruption and dishonesty,'' SANA said. It did not elaborate.
Karim was a member of El-Zoubi's Cabinet from 1992.
</P>
<P>
   El-Zoubi is survived by two sons and a daughter. The sons, both
who work outside of government, have also been accused of
corruption.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Opposition Leads in Mexico  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN RICE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- New evidence of a surge by opposition
candidate Vicente Fox emerged Sunday when a major poll showed him
leading in the race for Mexico's presidency, which has been held by
the Institutional Revolutionary Party for 71 years.
</P>
<P>
   Discounting undecided voters, Fox was favored by 43 percent of
those polled and Francisco Labastida of the governing party by 35
percent, according to the poll. Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the leftist
Democratic Revolution Party was favored by 15 percent, and other
candidates trailed farther behind.
</P>
<P>
   The poll was conducted by Alducin y Asociados and sponsored by
several newspapers, including El Universal of Mexico City and
Frontera of Tijuana. The margin of error was 2.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Since April's Alducin poll, Fox gained 3.8 percentage points and
Labastida fell by 7.2, Frontera reported. Fox apparently surged in
part because of his showing in an April 25 debate with other
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The new poll said 23.5 percent of voters remained undecided.
They were excluded from the results.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second major recent poll to show Labastida trailing
Fox, a former governor, rancher and Coca Cola executive who
represents the conservative National Action Party in the July 2
election. On May 11, a Zogby International poll sponsored by the
Reuters news agency showed Fox leading Labastida 46 to 41 percent,
with a margin of error of 3.2 points.
</P>
<P>
   A survey published Thursday by the Mexico city newspaper Reforma
showed Labastida with a 2 percentage point lead, which was within
the margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere Sunday, officials from the three main parties
announced they were canceling plans for a second debate scheduled
for Tuesday because they could not agree on the format.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida, meanwhile, spoke before the national council of
broadcasters and urged them to support his campaign. He said he
wants to ''consolidate the electoral triumph that will let the
party and the country on July 2 have the assurance that the
citizens will go to bed knowing who won,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Russia Cop Dies in Chechnya Blast  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- A policeman was killed and four were
wounded Sunday when a bomb went off in a temporary police station
in Chechnya, the military command said.
</P>
<P>
   According to spokesman Gennady Alyokhin, the bomb exploded near
one of the precinct offices in the town of Urus-Martan.
</P>
<P>
   Russian commandos clashed with rebels in the Argun gorge in
southern Chechnya, and eight insurgents were killed, Alyokhin said,
according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. No Russian casualties were
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Alyokhin said the clash took place Saturday afternoon and that
the search and reconnaissance mission in the Argun gorge was
continuing Sunday. He said a large cache of weapons was found at
the clash site.
</P>
<P>
   He said an intensification of the rebels' guerrilla campaign on
orders from rebel Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov did not
materialize over the weekend as expected.
</P>
<P>
   ''On the contrary, it is the federal forces displaying
stepped-up activities,'' Alyokhin said.
</P>
<P>
   The military has been saying for more than a week that Maskhadov
had ordered rebels to go on the offensive starting Friday, but many
militants operate outside Maskhadov's control and a new offensive
was not launched.
</P>
<P>
   Alyokhin said Russian forces had arrested Chechen field
commander Ruslan Alikhodzhayev in the village of Shali. The troops
also detained three bodyguards of the Movladi Udugov, a Chechen
rebels' chief ideologist, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops entered Chechnya in September after
Chechnya-based Islamic militants seized several villages in
Dagestan and a wave of attacks on apartment buildings that killed
300 people. Moscow also said the campaign was necessary to stop
terrorism like hostage-taking and cross-border attacks.

<HEADLINE> Clinton crit lazio for ''hurling insults''  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton Sunday criticized her
new Senate rival, U.S. Rep. Rick Lazio, for ''going on the attack''
at her campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was a little disappointed yesterday that my latest opponent
has already started hurling insults instead of offering what we can
do to improve the lives of New Yorkers,'' the first lady, without
mentioning Lazio by name, told about 100 members of the New York
State Machinists Union.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's comments came one day after Lazio formally declared he
was entering the Senate race to replace New York City mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, who dropped out Friday citing health reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, a lifelong resident of Long Island, attacked Clinton's
non-native status in his official announcement and said, ''she is
no more a new Democrat than she is a New Yorker.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton shot back Sunday, saying: ''I'm sorry that my opponent
couldn't even get through his announcement speech without going on
the attack.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Every candidate has to make a decision about what kind of
campaign he or she will run -- will it be a campaign of ideas and
issues or a campaign of insults,'' Clinton added. ''Beyond all the
bluster and the attacks I really hope that we can keep this
campaign focussed on the genuine and meaningful difference between
us and between our parties.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady picked up the endorsement of the 30,000-member
machinists union at its annual conference in Albany and shed her
black blazer in favor of a union jacket presented to her.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I'm in the Senate my door will be open, I will be
available, I will work with you,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Later Sunday, Clinton appeared at a $75 to $500-a-person
fund-raiser in Troy for the Rennselaer County Democratic Party,
where she joked about the turn of events in the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I started some months ago to start this campaign ... I
didn't know what to expect, and boy, was I right,'' she said,
drawing laughs from about 150 supporters. ''I don't think anybody
could have predicted the twist and turns.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also told fellow Democrats, ''This will be a tough
election, where we have to work very hard for every single vote.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to discussing the economy, health care and
education, Clinton, who first moved to a house in Westchester
County in January, emphasized at both events that she had visited
all 62 counties in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been everywhere you can imagine,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She gave autographs and took pictures with supporters at the
events but declined to speak with reporters, saying only, ''I'm
going to keep talking about issues just like I have for the last
year.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked to comment on Lazio's record, she briefly answered:
''There will be plenty of time two talk about differences between
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Lazio appeared on five major Sunday TV news shows.
The four-term congressman was also scheduled to fly with his family
across upstate New York Sunday afternoon, making stops at Buffalo,
Binghamton, Rochester and Syracuse.

<HEADLINE> Neither Side Claims China Bill Win  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Neither side claimed Sunday to have the votes
to pass a China trade bill in the House vote this week, although
one of President Clinton's most improbable allies said supporters
have the momentum to win.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really been tough to get the votes in on this. But we're
doing real well,'' said House Republican Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas.
''We're moving towards that magic number of 218 votes'' to pass the
trade bill, DeLay said on ''Fox News Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and other supporters of
the trade deal were more circumspect.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we're working very hard, and I don't want to say that
we do,'' have the votes to pass it, Albright said on ABC's ''This
Week.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill, the last major trade fight of Clinton's tenure, has
made for strange bedfellows. Most Republicans support the deal,
while many in the president's own party oppose it along with labor,
environmental and human rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   The House vote is expected at midweek. Senate passage is nearly
assured.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay, usually one of Clinton's most reliable critics, predicted
eventual victory and credited Clinton personally.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president's been working very hard,'' DeLay said. ''The
Democrats are not coming along like we thought they would.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal would open Chinese markets to more U.S. goods and end
the annual congressional review of China's trading status. It also
speeds the way for China to enter the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and other free-trade advocates say the deal will be good
for American business and can help lead China toward political and
human rights improvements.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a big deal to me, beyond the obvious economic benefits
which make it easier for some members than others to vote for,
because of the economic makeup of their districts,'' Clinton said
Sunday during a strategy session for Democrats at the Hyde Park,
N.Y., home of Franklin D. Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   ''The biggest issue is, what can we do to promote human rights;
what can we do to promote the rule of law; what can we do to
minimize the chances that there will be another war in Asia in our
lifetime, or in our children's lifetime?'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had scheduled an Oval Office address on the subject for
Sunday night, but abruptly canceled the speech Friday after several
Democrats told him it would be counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents say the trade agreement threatens U.S. jobs and strips
the United States of leverage to improve human rights in China and
goad the Chinese to keep their international promises.
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO's secretary-treasurer, Richard Trumka, did not offer
a tally of the bill's opponents, who include the top House
Democrat, Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo. Trumka did hint that labor
may offer little political help to Democrats who support the trade
deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a very, very serious issue with our membership, and I
don't think anybody can tell you right now (what) is the political
fallout from it,'' Trumka said on CBS' ''Face the Nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on CBS, the Clinton administration's point man on the China
vote predicted a few days of heavy lobbying on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have the 218 to pass it, and the opposition do not
have 218 at this point, in my opinion, to stop it,'' Commerce
Secretary William Daley said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Phillies 4, Rockies 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Brian Hunter hit a grand slam and Robert
Person struck out 10 Sunday as the Philadelphia Phillies ended a
rough homestand with a 4-3 victory over the Colorado Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies finished 2-7 while at Veterans Stadium and now
begin a nine-game road trip to Houston, Los Angeles and San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Person (4-2) was overpowering from the start as he struck out
five of the first nine batters. In seven innings, he matched his
season-high for strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Person, who has won three of his last four starts, allowed one
run and five hits. Wayne Gomes pitched the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Bubba Carpenter hit a two-run homer with one out in the ninth
off Jeff Brantley. The Rockies loaded the bases on walks before
Brantley retired Mike Lansing on a fly ball for his second save.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia broke up a scoreless game in the fourth on Hunter's
grand slam off Masato Yoshii (1-5).
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Abreu drew a one-out walk and Mike Lieberthal singled. One
out later, Rob Ducey coaxed a walk and Hunter followed with his
third career slam.
</P>
<P>
   It was Hunter's second homer of the season and first since the
former Braves player beat the Phillies with a pinch-hit homer in
the 12th inning on April 18.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshii pitched four innings and lost his fourth straight
decision. He gave up four runs and four hits.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado scored in the sixth on three straight two-out hits.
Jeff Cirillo doubled and Jeffrey Hammonds had an RBI single.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The game was delayed 27 minutes at the start because of
rain. ... Phillies third baseman Scott Rolen sat out his second
straight game due to a sore back. He missed the final five weeks of
last season with a back injury. ... Third base umpire Andy Fletcher
didn't work the game due to back spasms. ... Hunter hit his first
slam since July 10, 1994. ... The Rockies failed to steal a base
for the first time in nine games. Tom Goodwin, the club's stolen
base leader with 13, was thrown out by Lieberthal attempting to
steal second in the third inning on a pitch-out. ... Yoshii hasn't
won since April 17 at Arizona.

<HEADLINE> Trustee: Knight's Apology Saved Him  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Indiana University basketball coach Bob Knight
probably would
have been fired had he not convinced the school's president that he
really wanted to learn to control his temper.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ''He was real close to not being there,'' trustee Ray Richard
said Saturday on CNN/Sports Illustrated's ''Page One'' television
program. ''When I went into the final meeting at which we were
going to make a decision, I was going to vote to fire him, and I
think the majority of the trustees agreed with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, a seven-week investigation into Knight's outbursts of
temper ended last Monday with the coach being sanctioned.
</P>
<P>
   This followed an unexpected, last-minute apology from the
Knight. When IU president Myles Brand -- who instituted a
zero-tolerance policy -- decided that Knight was contrite, the
coach's job was saved.
</P>
<P>
   Knight was suspended for three games, fined $30,000, ordered to
apologize to a secretary he verbally abused and given a strict set
of ground rules for future conduct.
</P>
<P>
   IU English professor Murray Sperber said he was concerned about
that, and said Brand revealed a double standard by admitting the
coach had not been reprimanded in 29 years even though several
instances of inappropriate behavior were investigated.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I fear is that this (zero-tolerance policy) will turn
into a horrible circus far overshadowing the academic aspects of
this university,'' Sperber said.
</P>
<P>
   An e-mail survey conducted during the program asked viewers how
long they believe Knight will continue coaching under the
zero-tolerance policy. Fifty percent of the respondents said Knight
won't survive to the end of the season.

<HEADLINE> 2 Sentenced in Doping Cases  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Two former East German officials received
suspended 10-month jail sentences for their role in doping athletes
to turn them into Olympic medal winners, a justice official said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Former East German sports minister Guenter Erbach and the
communist party's top sports official, Rudolf Hellmann, were
convicted several months ago by a Berlin court and did not
challenge their sentences, Berlin justice spokesman Martin Steltner
said on Deutschlandfunk radio.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors had charged the men, both in their 70s, with 137
counts of complicity to cause bodily harm in cases where former
East German female swimmers were administered steroids without
their knowledge as girls.
</P>
<P>
   Erbach was East Germany's state secretary for sports from 1974
until the collapse of communism in 1989. Hellmann was the communist
party's key sports official beginning in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of trials of former East German sports
functionaries, the former chief doctor of the swim team, Lothar
Kipke, has received the harshest sentence -- 15 months suspended. He
was convicted in January on 58 counts of causing bodily harm.

<HEADLINE> 'Free Willy' Whale May Set Sail  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALEM, Ore. (AP) -- Love could be in the air -- or water -- for
Keiko the killer whale.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few weeks, the world's most famous captive whale could
fall in love and swim off into the sunset.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the ''Free Willy'' star lives in a netted section of
a bay on an island just off the coast of Iceland.
</P>
<P>
   But officials told the Statesman Journal newspaper in Salem they
worry that construction of a pier near the enclosure, with the
sounds of blasting and pile driving, could create shock waves and
low-frequency vibrations that could harm the 10,000-pound whale.
The plan is to guide Keiko out of his enclosed bay and into the
ocean during the noisiest work, then return him to his pen.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there's no guarantee that Keiko -- who spent 2{ years
at an Oregon aquarium before being shipped to Iceland -- will return
after he is led out of the bay. He's been taught to follow the
trainer's boat when instructed to do so, but once he's in the open
ocean, no one knows what will happen.
</P>
<P>
   Head trainer Jeff Foster said groups of 25 to 30 killer whales
have been hanging around outside the bay following schools of tasty
herring.
</P>
<P>
   ''When Keiko gets exposed to another whale, he'll be very
interested and very excited,'' Foster predicted. ''Right now, he's
like a teen-age boy. You know, spring is in the air, and he's been
pretty frisky.''

   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The man blamed in the crash that killed Malik
Sealy of the Minnesota Timberwolves was convicted of drunk driving
in Iowa in 1997, court records show.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities believe Souksangouane Phengsene, 43, was driving the

morning when his truck collided head-on with Sealy's sport utility
vehicle. Sealy, 30, was dead at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Phengsene, who recently moved to Minnesota from Des Moines,
Iowa, was in satisfactory condition at Hennepin County Medical
Center with head and chest injuries, a hospital spokeswoman said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear Sunday if alcohol was a factor in the crash.
Cathy Clark, a spokeswoman for the State Patrol, said on Saturday
that a paramedic on the scene told troopers he smelled alcohol on
Phengsene.
</P>
<P>
   Blood samples were taken from both drivers and will be tested to
determine if alcohol was in either driver's system.
</P>
<P>
   Clark said the investigation will likely take several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Des Moines Register reported Sunday that Phengsene was
charged with drunken driving in Des Moines in June 1997. Court
records show that Phengsene pleaded guilty or was found guilty of
the charge about two months later. It was not immediately known
what penalty might have been imposed. He was also arrested at the
time for failing to wear a seat belt and running a stop sign.
</P>
<P>
   Sealy was returning home from a night out celebrating teammate
Kevin Garnett's 24th birthday. The crash caved in the driver's side
of Sealy's Range Rover, and he died of multiple head and chest
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   While dealing with Sealy's death, members of the Timberwolves
organization prepared to attend a memorial service in Golden Valley
on Monday for Bill Musselman, the franchise's first coach. He died
May 5 in Rochester at age 59, a month after being diagnosed with
bone marrow cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Sealy, Garnett and at least one other player had dinner at the
Monte Carlo Bar &AMP; Cafe in downtown Minneapolis late Friday night.
Manager Tony Rimarcik said a group of six or seven people had
gathered in a separate room and left the restaurant just before 1
a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Two women who were working at the nearby Deja Vu nightclub
Friday night and early Saturday morning told the Star Tribune that
Sealy, Garnett and two or three other men had been at the club,
which does not serve alcohol. One of the women said the men left
around 3:30 a.m. The newspaper did not name the women.
</P>
<P>
   A thigh-high median separates the northbound and southbound
lanes of Highway 100 in St. Louis Park, a suburb just west of
Minneapolis. State Patrol Cmdr. Al Smith said that means Phengsene
entered the highway going in the wrong direction. Authorities
weren't sure how long he was going in the wrong direction.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Sealy nor Phengsene was wearing a seat belt when they
crashed about 4 a.m. While an airbag deployed in Phengsene's truck,
Sealy's vehicle didn't have an airbag.

<HEADLINE> Blazers Focus on Wallace, Sabonis  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- If the Portland Trail Blazers hope to win
Game 2 of the Western Conference finals Monday night, Arvydas
Sabonis needs to show up and Rasheed Wallace can't blow up.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal outscored Sabonis 41-0 and outrebounded him
11-1 in the Los Angeles Lakers' 109-94 victory in Game 1 Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard for a 7-foot-3, 282-pound Lithuanian to disappear, but
Sabonis was virtually invisible in his 33 minutes on the court --
0-for-4 from the field, zero points, one rebound.
</P>
<P>
   Is Shaq the toughest player Sabonis has ever faced? Sabonis
acted Sunday as if it was the most ridiculous question he'd ever
heard.
</P>
<P>
   ''What do you think?'' he said in English, one of the four
languages he speaks. ''Of course. It's difficult, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabonis said it was coach Mike Dunleavy's decision to limit his
involvement in the offense Saturday after the game plan changed
when the Blazers fell behind by 24 points in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything happened in the second quarter,'' Sabonis said.
''It changed how we decided to play.''
</P>
<P>
   At least Sabonis talked on Sunday. As often happens, Wallace
wouldn't speak to reporters, except to say, ''Excuse me
gentlemen,'' after tying his shoes and getting up to walk on the
court.
</P>
<P>
   When someone asked if he was going to talk, Wallace just stared
at the questioner. A similar stare led to Wallace's ejection in the
third quarter of Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   Referee Ron Garretson already had hit Wallace with a technical
in the first half. As he explained to the Blazers' Steve Smith, in
a conversation replayed for the NBA television audience because the
referee was wearing a microphone, Garretson said he had warned
Wallace twice not to stare at him and that he would not be
intimidated.
</P>
<P>
   When the stare came after Wallace drew his fourth foul,
Garretson threw him out.
</P>
<P>
   It was further evidence that Wallace is haunted by his
reputation. He was the runaway leader in technical fouls with 38 in
the regular season. He has six in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was Ronnie's opinion that by Rasheed staring at him that he
was trying to intimidate him,'' Dunleavy said. ''I didn't know
referees got intimidated.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace's reputation seems to make him more closely watched by
the referees than other players are.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's human nature, maybe,'' Dunleavy said, ''and maybe that's
the way it works. Shaq's probably not going to get thrown out of
the game for staring, and he's much more intimidating than Rasheed
Wallace, in my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the officials think, it's up to Wallace, the one player
who gives the Lakers serious matchup problems, to adjust in order
to stay in the game, Dunleavy said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bottom line is we're not going to win the series if he's
not on the floor,'' Dunleavy said.
</P>
<P>
   Dunleavy was unrepentant about the ''Hack-a-Shaq'' tactic his
team used to the extreme in an attempt to catch the Lakers in the
final 5{ minutes. O'Neal went to the foul line 25 times in the
fourth quarter, shattering the playoff record of 14. He made 12 of
them, and was 12-for-24 in the final 5{ minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a good strategy. It worked well for us. It was the
right thing to do,'' Dunleavy said. ''When you have a guy under 50
percent from the free throw line, it has a positive effect. We
didn't take advantage at the other end by scoring the way we needed
to score.''
</P>
<P>
   Lakers coach Phil Jackson said the strategy is nothing new. He
said when he was a player, it was a common tactic against Wilt
Chamberlain, even in the days when players shot three free throws
with a chance to make two.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson expressed confidence that O'Neal will handle the
situation if it continues to occur.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal seemed more upset that the Blazers weren't allowing
Sabonis to play him one-on-one.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's kind of sad that their 7-footer doesn't want to take the
challenge of playing me one-on-one,'' O'Neal said. ''It's a
shame.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Blazers persist in collapsing two or three defenders on
him, O'Neal will continue to pass the ball outside for open jumpers
by his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   A 3-point barrage from the likes of Robert Horry, Glen Rice,
Rick Fox and Brian Shaw buried Portland in the second quarter of
Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were doubling and tripling me very fast,'' O'Neal said.
''Hopefully, we can get the same execution and same play from my
teammates. If we do that, we're going to be hard to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the hacks, O'Neal said he takes them as a complement
because opponents know that he can't be stopped in the low post in
those late-game situations.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a homage to my game,'' he said, obviously enjoying the
word. ''That's what you can call me -- the big homage.''

<HEADLINE> Lazio begins Senate campaign on talk shows and hurried upstate tour </HEADLINE>
By CAROLYN THOMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHEEKTOWAGA, N.Y. (AP) -- Five Rick Lazio supporters held up blue
cardboard letters Sunday while awaiting the newly announced U.S.
Senate candidate's first campaign visit upstate.
</P>
<P>
   ''See, they're spelling his name, honey,'' Mary Beth Cerrone
pointed out to her 9-year-old-son, Dominic. ''L-A-Z-I-O.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a lesson Lazio must now teach the rest of the state as the
largely unknown Republican picks up where New York City Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani left off in the GOP's pursuit of Daniel Patrick
Moynihan's Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   Wasting no time after announcing his candidacy in his high
school gym Saturday, Lazio scheduled hurried visits to Buffalo,
Rochester, Syracuse and Binghamton after making the rounds on the
Sunday morning television talk show circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ''New Yorkers will not have to worry about who Rick Lazio is and
what his ambition is,'' Lazio told supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've never needed an exploratory committee to find western New
York or figure out where I want to live,'' he said in one of
several swipes at Hillary Rodham Clinton's non-New York roots,
already a favored topic in his campaign against the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   The four-term Congressman used 15- to 30-minute stops in the
upstate cities to tell a condensed version of his life story,
introduce his wife, Patricia, and two young daughters, and credit
his military parents for instilling ''bedrock values'' of family,
work and responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those are the values of New York and those are the values I'm
going to bring to the U.S. Senate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of the hopes and dreams that you have for your children
and grandchildren,'' he said, ''I have for mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, 42, said he will stand on his ''mainstream record that
fits the thinking of the vast majority of the people of our state''
and described himself as a fiscal conservative, committed
environmentalist and small-government conservative who supports a
woman's right to choose but not a procedure opponents call
''partial-birth abortions.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a family supporter, here with my family, who dreams of a
culture that helps parents trying to raise their children and
rejects the corrupting pollution of thoughtless violence on
television and the movies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On gun control, Lazio, who broke with his party to support the
Brady Bill, said he supports ''reasonable measures to support the
rights of sportsmen while aggressively protecting our children from
the illegal use of handguns.''
</P>
<P>
   He promised to be a frequent visitor upstate, addressing a
concern of voters who complained they did not see enough of
Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to be here so often I'm going to be sweating Buffalo
wings,'' he told 150 Buffalo-area supporters who greeted him with
chants of ''New York Lazio'' and hastily made campaign signs.
</P>
<P>
   After Lazio made a similar promise in Rochester, Steve Minarik,
chairman of the Monroe County Republican party, said he expects
Lazio to do better upstate than Giuliani would have.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Rick Lazio has a better understanding of what it's
going to take to represent upstate New York,'' Minarik said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm more excited. I like underdogs. He's a nice guy ... I like
guys who care,'' Minarik said.
</P>
<P>
   At a third stop at Syracuse's Hancock International Airport,
Lazio was met by supporters for both him and his opponent, all
jockeying for position with their campaign signs. One person would
hold up a Hillary sign and a Lazio sign would go up in front of it.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio emphasized being a native New Yorker and his record during
his talk. He appeared with his wife and two children.
</P>
<P>
   He said he expected liberal groups from outside New York to join
Hillary Clinton against him and to that he said, ''Bring them on.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that he presented voters with a clear choice compared to
Mrs. Clinton, whom he identified as a ''big-spending liberal,'' who
is presently trying to ''repackage'' herself. ''Hillary Clinton is
no more a new Democrat than a New Yorker.''
</P>
<P>
   A Hillary Clinton supporter said the group showed up to show
their support.
</P>
<P>
   Mary McCandless, from Syracuse, said, ''Just because someone is
not from New York doesn't mean they can't do the job. Think about
it, how many people living in New York were actually born here?
What are we doing, discriminating against anyone who wasn't born
here?''

<HEADLINE> Israel Recalls Peace Talk Envoys  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE COPANS
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel called home its envoys to unofficial
peace talks in Sweden and barred travel by its citizens and foreign
tourists to Palestinian-controlled territory hours after an Israeli
toddler was critically hurt in an overnight firebomb attack in the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, though, a weeklong spasm of street violence in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip ebbed Sunday, even after the death of
a Palestinian youth who was seriously wounded in the violence -- the
fifth to have died so far. Apparently responding to Israeli
demands, Palestinian police were keeping a tight lid on the unrest.
</P>
<P>
   The 2-year-old Israeli girl was severely burned when the car in
which she was traveling was firebombed by unknown assailants early
Sunday in the West Bank town of Jericho. Her mother and aunt, also
in the car, suffered less serious burns, hospital officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian youth, Saad El-Hawarin, 15, had been shot in the
head by Israeli troops using rubber-coated steel pellets against
demonstrators in clashes in the West Bank city of Ramallah last
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the firebombing, Israel issued an unusual order
banning its citizens and foreign tourists from traveling in
Palestinian-controlled areas, which include most West Bank cities.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's office also said it had told
Israeli envoys to peace talks in Sweden to return home earlier than
scheduled for consultations, though Sunday's round of talks went
ahead as planned.
</P>
<P>
   Barak spokesman Gadi Baltiansky said the injured toddler
prompted Barak to recall his envoys, who were to have remained in
Stockholm for another day or two.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anyone who thinks it is quiet today in the (Palestinian)
territories is welcome to visit the 2-year-old girl in the
hospital,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the decision to recall
the negotiators from Sweden ''will only complicate the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Sunday
the United States is keeping a close eye on the renewed violence:
''We obviously are concerned and have been following it very
closely,'' she said on ABC's ''This Week.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak has been under pressure from hard-liners both inside and
outside his coalition to respond harshly to the violence in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip. But his announcement Sunday, which cited
''the situation in the territories,'' stopped short of suspending
peace talks, which have also been taking place on an official track
in Israel and the Palestinian areas.
</P>
<P>
   Only minor skirmishing took place at what had been seen as a
potential flashpoint: a funeral in the West Bank town of Ramallah
for Issa Abed, 28, who died Saturday after being shot by Israeli
troops a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
   About 70 marchers scuffled afterward with Palestinian police,
throwing rocks that the police picked up and threw back. They
dispersed after about an hour, after unsuccessfully trying to break
through human chains formed by the Palestinian police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian police took a much tougher line than they had in
previous days, declaring parts of Ramallah a closed military area
and keeping a close watch on the mourners.
</P>
<P>
   In the past week hundreds of Palestinians in the West Bank and
Gaza were hurt and four killed in clashes set off by protests over
the plight of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel and
commemorations of ''the catastrophe,'' as Palestinians call their
dispersal in the wake of Israel's founding.
</P>
<P>
   Interim peace accords call for prisoner releases, but Israel
says it has already fulfilled its obligations to free prisoners
under those accords.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli order restricting travel in lands under complete
Palestinian security control came after the army reported dozens of
firebombs tossed at Israeli vehicles in the past two days.
</P>
<P>
   The week of violence in the Palestinian lands, coupled with
heavy fighting in south Lebanon, prompted Barak on Saturday to
cancel a planned visit to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. National Security Adviser Sandy Berger, who met Friday with
Barak and late Saturday with Arafat, urged the two sides to press
ahead with peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the months ahead we have a historic opportunity that we
must not allow to slip away,'' Berger said in a Tel Aviv speech.
</P>
<P>
   Israel and the Palestinians are working on a final peace treaty
to settle long-standing issues like the nature of a Palestinian
state, the future of Jerusalem and the fate of Palestinian
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians want to set up a state with traditionally Arab
east Jerusalem as the capital. They insist that refugees who fled
Israel when it was created in 1948 have the right to return.

<HEADLINE> Report: NIH Ignored Warnings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The National Institutes of Health ignored
warnings for years about the risk that a human growth hormone
extracted from cadavers could cause a brain disease that killed
dozens of people, the Los Angeles Times reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   A scientist who produced the human growth hormone, under
contract to the NIH, thought a Swedish method used to filter the
hormone was unnecessary despite ''warning bells'' of potential
contamination risks, the newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 people in the United States and 34 in Britain who
received the growth hormone from cadavers have died. Around the
world, more than 125 people have died. A synthetic form of the
hormone is used now.
</P>
<P>
   The NIH has insisted for the last 15 years that the deaths were
unforeseeable. ''It was an experimental treatment, and people
signed informed consents,'' NIH spokeswoman Jane Demouy said.
</P>
<P>
   But British court documents show the NIH lab that investigated
deaths from the hormone in 1985 had been warned of the danger of
contamination seven years earlier, the Times reported.
</P>
<P>
   More than 8,000 children were given human growth hormone, or
hGH, from cadavers as an experimental treatment for dwarfism
between 1963 and 1985. The NIH provided the drug free to American
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   It ended the program after three recipients died from
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a rare and incurable disorder related to
''mad cow disease'' that eats away the brain. It apparently was
transmitted through hGH extracted from the donated pituitary glands
of infected people.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, the NIH formed an agency to collect and provide
pituitary glands from cadavers to three universities for processing
into growth hormone.
</P>
<P>
   The late Alfred E. Wilhelmi produced the drug at Emory
University in Atlanta. His extraction method created a product that
caused some immune responses in children and was far from pure.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Parlow, a biochemist who was at Emory at the time, told
the Times there were ''warning bells.'' Ten to 15 percent of the
children treated developed antibodies, which means ''there is
something wrong with the product,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Swedish researchers had developed a method of filtering the
hormone that made it 95 percent pure, but it made extraction
costlier and more labor-intensive.
</P>
<P>
   Wilhelmi decided not to use the filter. ''Wilhelmi's philosophy
was that the material was human protein, and human protein cannot
harm human beings,'' Parlow said.
</P>
<P>
   The filtering method eventually was adopted by Parlow and
British researchers in 1977.

<HEADLINE> Voter Apathy Kills Italy Referendum  </HEADLINE>
By CANDICE HUGHES
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- Yet another referendum on changing Italy's electoral
system failed Sunday because of skimpy voter turnout, dashing the
hopes of reformers and fueling opposition calls for the government
to resign.
</P>
<P>
   A referendum in Italy must attract more than 50 percent of the
voters to be valid; Sunday's ballot fell far short of the mark,
drawing just under a third of the registered voters, according to
exit polls.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative opposition leader Silvio Berlusconi had urged his
supporters to stay home and said the center-left government should
quit if the referendum failed.
</P>
<P>
   Berlusconi proclaimed his ''great satisfaction'' Sunday night at
the results and said they showed that the government no longer had
the majority it needed to govern.
</P>
<P>
   ''The left has failed the test,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's low turnout stunned referendum proponents, who thought
victory was near. Last year, a similar proposition on changing the
electoral system was endorsed by more than 91 percent of the
voters. Turnout, however, was 49.6 percent, just short of the mark.
</P>
<P>
   ''Distrust of politics and fear of change have won,'' the
committee promoting the referendum said as the bad news rolled in
shortly after the polls closed at 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents hoped the referendum would force Parliament to do
away with the proportional election system that many blame for
Italy's chronic political instability.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, 25 percent of the seats in the lower house of
Parliament are assigned by proportional representation, which gives
tiny parties enough clout to bring down a government and stall
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Premier Giuliano Amato, who last month took the helm of Italy's
58th government since World War II, had vowed to make election
reform his top priority.
</P>
<P>
   But the crushing failure of Sunday's referendum could undermine
support for electoral reform and make it harder for Amato to fend
off Berlusconi's calls for his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Amato is not obliged to heed the call, and the referendum was
sponsored by the Radical Party, which is not part of Amato's
government. But many in Amato's coalition backed the electoral
reform proposition.
</P>
<P>
   Berlusconi's supporters immediately declared the failure of the
referendum a victory for the media mogul and ex-premier, whose
center-right bloc did well enough in recent regional elections to
force Amato's predecessor, Massimo D'Alema, to resign.
</P>
<P>
   ''Amato should excuse himself and go away,'' said Enrico La
Loggia, a high-ranking official in Berlusconi's Forza Italia
coalition.
</P>
<P>
   An exit poll by the Abacus agency said 82 percent of the people
who bothered to vote Sunday, voted to ditch the old electoral
system. An end to public funding of political parties also found
favor with most voters, exit polls said.

<HEADLINE> Woman Dies After Dutch Blast  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENSCHEDE, Netherlands (AP) -- A 79-year-old woman died Sunday
from injuries sustained when a Dutch fireworks warehouse exploded
over a week ago, flattening a working-class neighborhood in the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, identified as M. Slot-Langeveld, lived just a street
away from the depot where 100 tons of fireworks caught fire last
Sunday, spokesman Paul Boers of Enschede said.
</P>
<P>
   Recovery teams have identified the remains of 16 bodies found
under the rubble of Enschede North, 85 miles east of Amsterdam.
Five people are still missing -- three woman and two men -- and the
official death toll remained 20.
</P>
<P>
   The owners of entertainment company S.E. Fireworks were
questioned by investigators over the weekend after they surrendered
to local police in response to an international warrant for their
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Ruud Bakker and Wilhelm Pater are suspected of knowingly
breaking regulations and could be sentenced to six-years in prison,
an official said. They have not been charged with murder.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 1,000 people were injured on May 13 when a number of
fires on the downtown S.E. Fireworks site went up in a series of
powerful explosions, destroying 500 houses.
</P>
<P>
   Four firefighters, a photojournalist and two young children were
killed.

<HEADLINE> Webb's Extra Swing Costs Her Lead  </HEADLINE>
By RUSTY MILLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEAVERCREEK, Ohio (AP) -- Karrie Webb gave away two strokes, then
later stole them back.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the Firstar LPGA Classic by a stroke midway through
Sunday's final round, Webb failed to get out of a bunker at the
489-yard, par-5 8th hole with her third shot. Disgusted, she took a
whack at the sand.
</P>
<P>
   Rule 13-4 prohibits a player from touching the ground in a
hazard while the ball is in play and provides for a two-stroke
penalty. Webb left the hole with a triple-bogey 8 and plummeted
from first place to a tie for fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most people probably heard it was out of anger. It was
partially out of anger but, moreso, I just forgot the ball was
still in the bunker and I was practicing,'' Webb said. ''I told my
caddie, 'If I had thought about getting a two-shot penalty, I would
have taken a bigger cut at it.'''
</P>
<P>
   That loomed large on the final hole.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing Annika Sorenstam and Christie Kerr by two shots, Webb
holed a 9-iron shot from 131 yards for an eagle. She jumped into
the air, arms raised high, while the large gallery sitting on the
grassy amphitheater around the 18th green went wild.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pity it wasn't on TV this week,'' Webb said.
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam was walking between the 17th green and 18th tee when
she heard the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think you could hear it in Orlando,'' Sorenstam said. ''It
was so loud I said to my caddie, 'It can't be a birdie. It must be
an eagle.' Then I saw Karrie pick up the ball and I said, 'Oh, this
is not happening.'''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd roared again when Webb's red 18-under par score was
put up on the scoreboard near the final green -- putting her in what
was thought to be a potential three-way playoff with Sorenstam and
Kerr.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that got the crowd going,'' Webb said. ''I think they
were looking forward to a playoff.''
</P>
<P>
   But seconds after Webb tossed her ball into the gallery,
Sorenstam had the last laugh. Seconds before Webb's eagle, she had
rolled in a 15-foot birdie putt on the 17th hole.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd groaned when Sorenstam's score was posted.
</P>
<P>
   ''When they posted Annika at 19 under, they sighed a little
bit,'' Webb said. ''I think they got into it and wanted to see some
more golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam then parred the closing hole to finish at 19 under,
one shot better than Webb and Kerr.

<HEADLINE> Mickleson Win Colonial Golf  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN HAWKINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Phil Mickleson overcame a six-stroke
deficit with a closing 7-under-par 63 Sunday to win the Colonial
and join Tiger Woods as a three-time winner on the PGA Tour this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson had eight birdies, including a 20-footer on the 18th
hole, to end with a 12-under 268 total, two strokes ahead of
Stewart Cink and Davis Love III.
</P>
<P>
   Love, who along with Mickleson lost in a playoff to Jesper
Parnevik at last week's Byron Nelson Classic, finished in second
place for the eighth time since his last victory at the 1998 MCI
Classic, 48 tournaments ago.
</P>
<P>
   The title-clinching birdie for Mickelson, who won for the 16th
time in his career, came just before Cink's drive at the 15th hole
dropped into thick rough after hitting a tree.
</P>
<P>
   Cink's approach at the 430-yard hole stopped just short of a
greenside bunker, then he made a nice pitch within about 6 feet
only for him to slide the par-saving putt past the hole. That
dropped him even with Mickleson and out of sole possession of the
lead for the first time during the final round.
</P>
<P>
   The lead was gone when Cink three-putted the 17th. His 40-foot
putt slid past the hole, and then he missed the 4-footer coming
back and ended with a bogey 5 that put him 11 under.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson, who turns 30 in June, collected a $594,000 check, the
largest of his nine-year career. He has won $2.3 million this
season, surpassing the $2 million mark for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Cink, who turned 27 on Sunday, ended with a bogey at 18 for a
loss of three strokes over the last four holes. Cink, who won the
MCI Classic last month, was trying to join Mickleson, Woods,
Parnevik and Hal Sutton as multiple winners this season.
</P>
<P>
   The final bogey was his fifth over the last 14 holes, after just
three over the first 58 of the tournament. Cink was 10 under with
just one bogey for the 31 holes he played Saturday, including the
completion of his rain-delayed second round and the third round,
that gave him a three-stroke lead over Love going into the final
round.
</P>
<P>
   Mickleson, who shot a 70 Saturday, went into the final round six
strokes behind Cink. The left-hander first made noise with birdies
at Nos. 3 and 4, the beginning of Colonial's horrible horseshoe.
</P>
<P>
   The horseshoe, its nickname gained because of the layout and
difficulty, includes the two longest par-4s at Colonial Country
Club, the 476-yard 3rd and the 470-yard 5th, and the 246-yard par-3
4th hole.
</P>
<P>
   Cink was the only player to manage birdies during the week at
all three of those holes. Like Mickelson, he birdied the first two
Sunday but then he shanked a 2-foot putt after a nice chip and
bogeyed the 5th.
</P>
<P>
   Love fell out serious contention after a bogey at 9, when he
drove into the trees way right of the fairway and hit his second
shot through the green. Even though he saved par after missing the
fairway at the 10th to remain nine under, he was four strokes
behind after Cink's 10-foot birdie putt there.
</P>
<P>
Divots: Mickleson, who joined the tour in 1992, became the 10th
player to surpass $11 million in career earnings. ... Jim Furyk
shot a final-round 67 to finish tied for eighth at Colonial, where
he made his 34th consecutive cut, second on the PGA Tour only to
the 48 in a row by Woods. ... Carl Paulson played the back nine in
6-under 29, one shot over the Colonial record set by Keith
Clearwater during his course-record 61 in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Charter plane crashes with 19 people aboard  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER NEWTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILKES-BARRE, Pa. (AP) -- A twin-engine charter plane carrying 19
people from Atlantic City, N.J., crashed in a ball of fire after
apparent engine failure Sunday as it attempted to land in bad
weather. There was no sign of survivors, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Fiery wreckage was spotted in a heavily wooded area about 9
miles south of the WiIkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport in
northeastern Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared that both of the turbo prop's engines had failed,
said Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Tammy Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ''Investigators found a ball of fire at the scene,'' Jones said.
''The weather was bad, it was windy and there was some
precipitation. The visibility was poor.''
</P>
<P>
   Wy Gowell, assistant director at the airport, said the plane
apparently developed engine trouble during its second landing
attempt.
</P>
<P>
   There were no signs of survivors, said Joe Thomas, manager of
the Luzerne County 911 system. The plane carried 17 passengers and
two crew members, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   The plane crashed about two miles into the woods. ''Apparently
there isn't much left in one piece,'' said Al Bardar, director for
emergency management for Luzerne County. ''It doesn't look like
anyone survived.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Hartt, spokesman for the South Jersey Transportation
Authority, which operates the Atlantic City Airport, said the plane
was operated by Executive Airlines. He said it left the city about
10:30 a.m. and was scheduled to land in Wilkes-Barre an hour later.
</P>
<P>
   Executive Airlines officials declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Hartt said the airline typically runs casino charters, but he
did not know who was aboard.
</P>
<P>
   A limousine driver said he was hired to take a party from
Caesars Atlantic City Hotel Casino to Atlantic City Airport for a
charter flight to Scranton early this morning, only to have the
flight scratched due to bad weather. He wasn't sure if it was the
same group whose plane crashed Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Feldgus, 65, a driver for Atlantic Limousine, was one of
four limousines hired to bring a group of to a 1:15 a.m. flight to
Scranton.
</P>
<P>
   ''They came out to get in the cars and the junket representative
came out and said the flight was canceled due to the weather.''
said Feldgus. ''That's really a shame. I hope it wasn't the same
people. I can't believe that.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Our thoughts and our prayers are with the loved ones of the
people who were on this aircraft,'' Hartt said.
</P>
<P>
   He said 450,000 passengers a year fly on casino-related charters
in and out of the airport, adding this is the worst incident
involving a plane that took off from the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Hartt said the plane was supposed to fly from its base at
Republic Airport in Farmingdale, N.Y. to Atlantic City Airport
early Sunday morning, but was grounded due to bad weather.
</P>
<P>
   ''The visibility was borderline in Farmingdale,'' he said.
''What ended up happening was the aircraft left later, and landed
here around 10 a.m. To the extent that there was a weather issue,
it was in Farmingdale.''
</P>
<P>
   Visibility in Atlantic City early Sunday was good, Hartt said.
</P>
<P>
   He did not know where the passengers were from, and the airline
had not released a list as of 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Executive Airlines typically flies a single flight per day out
of Atlantic City Airport, Hartt said.
</P>
<P>
   The 1988 BA-31 Jetstream disappeared from radar about 11:40 a.m.
during a second instrument approach, typically performed if the
visibility is poor or if there is a low cloud deck.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency crews began searching along the planned flight path of
the plane as soon as they were notified shortly after 11:30 a.m.
that it would not reach the airport, said Luzerne County 911
spokesman Ron Rome. The wreckage was spotted about an hour later.
</P>
<P>
   Megan Maguire was outside gardening at her home near the airport
on the northern rim of the Pocono Mountains shortly before noon
when she heard a plane apparently having problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard the engines die, then I heard them start up again, and
then they just died. I heard it rev up twice, so it died twice,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkes-Barre is 150 miles northwest of Atlantic City, N.J.

<HEADLINE> Super Joe Leads Mets  </HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Joe McEwing seemed to be in the middle of
everything Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a throwback,'' Mike Piazza said. ''For what he lacks in
pure size and ability, he makes up for in hustle. He's a fun player
to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   McEwing was 3-for-4 against Randy Johnson on Sunday in the New
York Mets' 7-6 win, getting two doubles, a home run, a walk and a
key steal against the Arizona Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Last year with St. Louis, McEwing played all over the field and
earned the nickname ''Super Joe.'' He hit .275 with nine home runs
and 44 RBIs, setting a Cardinals' rookie record with a 25-game
hitting streak.
</P>
<P>
   New York acquired him from St. Louis on March 18 for reliever
Jesse Orosco.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a very humble person. I'm not going to to sit here and
brag about myself,'' McEwing said. ''But I'm also a very confident
person, and I think I can do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   He's generously listed at 5-foot-11 and 170 pounds, small for a
baseball player these days. But he seems to have a lot of heart.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a good, little ballplayer,'' said Johnson, who sounded
complimentary, not disdainful.
</P>
<P>
   McEwing, 27, failed to win a job in spring training and started
the season at Norfolk, hitting .286 with 10 doubles, five homers,
18 RBIs and five steals.
</P>
<P>
   ''You go down to Triple-A, you do the best you can and you try
to get back here as fast as you can,'' McEwing said.
</P>
<P>
   New York brought him up on May 13, when the Mets decided to
release Rickey Henderson, He had been just 2-for-12 against
Johnson, but Sunday's performance raised McEwing's season average
in the majors from .190 to .280 (7-for-25).
</P>
<P>
   He walked off Byung-Hyun Kim (2-2) leading off the ninth, stole
second and scored the winning run on Derek Bell's single.
</P>
<P>
   ''Joe led the charge, there's no doubt about it,'' said Mets
manager Bobby Valentine, who called McEwing's at-bat in the fifth
inning, when he doubled on Johnson's 12th pitch, one of the team's
best this season.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he wasn't with them for the first month of the
season, it didn't take McEwing long to win over his new teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ''You get guys like that at the top of the order, they kind of
set the tone,'' Robin Ventura said. ''He doesn't give away many
at-bats. That's just one of the things he brings -- toughness.''

<HEADLINE> Silver critics say they will air grievances on Monday  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and the man
who helped give stature to an overthrow attempt of Silver last
week, Queens Democratic leader Thomas Manton, said Sunday they are
patching up their troubles.
</P>
<P>
   In a terse statement released by their offices, Manton and
Silver spoke of a ''new partnership'' the men have formed in the
interests of helping Democrats in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''This new era of goodwill begins with support for Sheldon
Silver as speaker of the New York state Assembly,'' the two
politicians said.
</P>
<P>
   Almost exactly four days earlier, Manton had appeared at an
Albany news conference and promoted ex-majority leader Michael
Bragman as Silver's replacement. ''I believe he's lost the
confidence of his members,'' Manton said at the time of Silver.
</P>
<P>
   But Silver and Manton had breakfast Sunday at Ratners, a
landmark Manhattan restaurant, and cleared the air about
longstanding difficulties between the two men, aides said. That
included what Silver saw as Manton's interest as long as four years
ago in ousting Silver as speaker.
</P>
<P>
   The latest setback for Bragman seemed to assure that what last
week he had hoped would be a plebiscite among Democrats on Silver's
performance as speaker -- with dissatisfied Democrats turning to the
ex-majority leader as the new speaker -- would be little more than a
gripe session with the remaining Democrats willing to stand with
Bragman speaking out about Silver's allegedly dictatorial and
distant leadership style.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Bragman said it was unclear whether a resolution he
filed for Monday would even be heard. It calls for a rules change
in the Assembly to allow an immediate vote on a new speaker, but
Bragman suggested the Silver forces might be able to block it from
ever reaching the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the very least, I intend to make a very comprehensive
statement tomorrow, spelling out why this happened, what has
happened and where I intend to go at this point,'' Bragman said.
''If anybody thinks I intend to go away, that's something they
should not think about.''
</P>
<P>
   One possible scenario early in the leadership struggle had
Bragman making overtures to the 51 Republicans in the Assembly to
try to elect a bipartisan majority leader. But Bragman seemed to
abandon that possibility by last Wednesday in favor of a bid to win
a purely Democratic majority.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker held a buffet and strategy session Sunday night at
the Capitol for the 50 or so legislators he believes stood by him
throughout the Bragman challenge. He planned another gathering on
Monday of those other members, now back in his corner, whose
loyalties were considered suspect during the Bragman-Silver fight.
</P>
<P>
   A speaker needs at least 50 votes to control the 98-member
Democratic delegation in the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman said he once had 53 ''rock-solid'' Democrats behind him
in his quest to become speaker and a dozen others or so who
probably would have been with him had Silver been toppled.
</P>
<P>
   But that support eroded. Bragman blamed arm-twisting by Silver,
including threats to primary or redistrict recalcitrant members out
of the Legislature, as well as unseemly lobbying tactics by Silver
surrogates such as prominent lobbyists and labor union officials.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman said his support had dropped to 37 by Saturday night,
and then into the ''several'' category on Sunday when Manton and
Silver announced they had reached an accommodation. That
effectively meant Bragman could not count on any of the 15
Democratic Assembly members from Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Another setback occurred when McCall -- whom Bragman called his
''partner'' when launching his coup attempt -- did not produce the
kind of active lobbying among Assembly members that Bragman might
have expected. Bragman said McCall called over the weekend to say
it was not in McCall's interests to take sides in the divisive
speakership fight.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman said he still supports McCall for governor in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman, from suburban Syracuse, was stripped of his majority
leader's title, his $34,500-a-year stipend and the vast resources
that go with the majority leader's office.
</P>
<P>
   But he insisted Sunday night he knew the potential hazards of
his actions and was comfortable with his new lot in the
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the first time in many years I feel absolutely free, free
to say anything that is necessary to bring reform to this house,''
Bragman said.

<HEADLINE> Chavez Denies Rumors of a Coup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- President Hugo Chavez denied that army
officers were plotting to overthrow him, saying in an interview
published Sunday that the military is behind his efforts to reform
Venezuelan politics.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am sure that Venezuelan soldiers are incorporated in the
Venezuelan revolutionary process. They have assimilated it,''
Chavez told the El Nacional newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Gen. Fernando Ochoa Antich, who was the defense minister
during the 1992 coup attempt, recently told The Associated Press
that he knows of elements in the army that are plotting to
overthrow the president.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez dismissed the retired generals' statements as politically
motivated and unrepresentative of the majority of military officers
and soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a small group of retired officers that are always
emitting documents and promulgating false and destabilizing
rumors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation of a coup comes as Chavez is engaged in a bitter
election battle against former military officer Francisco Arias
Cardenas, who helped him stage a failed coup in 1992 but now
accuses him of abandoning the original goals of their rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a group of retired generals, called the Institutional
Military Front, warned of mounting military discontent with
Chavez's efforts to involve soldiers in civilian life, putting them
to work on social programs for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   If re-elected, Chavez also vowed to focus his attention on
Venezuela's depressed economy and soaring crime rate, saying he had
no plans to reshuffle his economic Cabinet after the May 28
balloting.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show the leftist president, who is popular among
Venezuela's poor majority, enjoying an advantage of up to 20 points
over Arias Cardenas, who has the support of the middle and upper
classes.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he took office only last year, Chavez is up for
re-election because of a new constitution he pushed through that
requires public offices to be ''re-legitimized.''

<HEADLINE> Hunger Strike Ends in Kosovo  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A group of Serbs and
Gypsies detained in northern Kosovo ended a hunger strike Sunday
after a top U.N. official pledged they would stand trial before
international judges.
</P>
<P>
   The 41 prisoners, who are mostly Serbs but include five Gypsies
-- or Roma -- began refusing food April 12 to protest being held
indefinitely with little or no prospect of court action. The men
have been detained for months on a wide variety of charges, ranging
from petty theft to war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have reached an agreement that the detainees in Kosovska
Mitrovica be tried by foreign judges,'' said Bernard Kouchner, the
top U.N. official in Kosovo.

<P>
   The prisoners' strike has touched off daily protests in Kosovska
Mitrovica, a tense, ethnically divided city and one of the few in
Kosovo where a significant Serb population remains.
</P>
<P>
   The top Serb leader in the town, Oliver Ivanovic, confirmed the
Serbs had ended their hunger strike.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear where Kouchner would find judges to
try the men. So far, only a single international judge has taken up
his post in Kosovo in the 11 months since the U.N. took over
administration of the province.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials took up civil administration tasks in Kosovo
after NATO completed a 78-day bombing campaign to force Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to end his crackdown on ethnic
Albanians. They have struggled, however, to establish a viable
judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   Some suspects must wait for months before court action. Others
are routinely released within days after being arrested even on
charges of serious criminal offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and families of the detainees also said they would end
their hunger strike, begun in solidarity with the detainees.

<HEADLINE> Flyers Look To Close Out Devils  </HEADLINE>
By ROB MAADDI
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia Flyers picked the right
time to overcome New Jersey's recent dominance.
</P>
<P>
   After beating the Devils just twice in 16 games, the Flyers have
won three straight against New Jersey and are on the verge of
making their second trip to the Stanley Cup finals in four years.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia can finish the best-of-seven Eastern Conference
finals with a victory in Game 5 Monday at the First Union Center.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we showed everybody and I think we showed ourselves
that we can play with that hockey club,'' Flyers forward Keith
Primeau said Sunday. ''We went in there and played that patient
style.''
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers beat New Jersey 3-1 Saturday to take a 3-1 series
lead. It was their second straight victory at the Continental
Airlines Arena after going 4-22-2 there over the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   Since the NHL expanded in 1967, no team has rallied from a 3-1
deficit after the second round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're running out of tomorrows,'' New Jersey coach Larry
Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe we're in a situation now where there is no other way for
us to play except desperate,'' Devils forward Bobby Holik said.
''Maybe this will bring out the best in us.''
</P>
<P>
   The playoffs have brought out the best in the most unlikely
Flyers. Craig Berube got his first point of the postseason and just
his third playoff goal in 86 postseason games to break a 1-1 tie
late in the third period of Game 4 as the Flyers took control of
the series.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you see Craig Berube score a big goal for us like that,
there's even another level you can get to, because everyone is so
excited for him,'' Flyers coach Craig Ramsay said. ''The reward is
for all the hard work he's brought to the team.
</P>
<P>
   ''However, our players immediately said the right things in the
dressing room, on the bus and to each other. It's wonderful but
it's just another win. It's just one game.''
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia might get some help for Game 5. Center Daymond
Langkow, out the last two games with a concussion, skated Sunday
and his status will be a game-time decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''He feels real good. He skated, had a good workout today,''
Ramsay said. ''He feels very comfortable. We'll decide tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers, who rallied from a 2-0 deficit against Pittsburgh in
their last series, realize the series isn't over yet.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we have too many veterans to know it's not time to
celebrate,'' rookie goalie Brian Boucher said. ''We still have a
job to do here. Game 5 is going to be hard for us. We need to come
out and play desperate. We're in a great position but by no means
is it over.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to continue to play a patient game. You have to go out
there and play period by period, shift by shift. This is a game we
have to have. As we've seen in this series, one game, one play can
give momentum to a team. That's what we don't want them to have.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Devils blamed Saturday's loss on sloppy play in
the third period just as they blamed their loss in Game 2 on a
five-minute segment in which the Flyers scored three goals.
</P>
<P>
   ''We tried to get fancy,'' forward Randy McKay said. ''For two
periods we kept it simple, and then we tried a little more finesse
and only got two or three shots on net.
</P>
<P>
   ''We put ourselves in this position, no doubt. We had them on
the ropes in Game 2, were playing great, and then we faltered. We
faltered, and we've been faltering ever since. We've got to snap
out of this. This series isn't over. I still think we're the better
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Should New Jersey prolong the series, it could pave the way for
the return of Flyers star center Eric Lindros. The former
Philadelphia captain resumed skating last week. He is scheduled to
undergo further tests and be examined again on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   If cleared by his doctor, neurologist James Kelly of Chicago,
Lindros could participate in team practices Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros hasn't played since March 12 because of a concussion. He
sustained another concussion during a practice drill earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
   His captaincy was permanently transferred to defenseman Eric
Desjardins in his absence.

<HEADLINE> Plane With 19 Aboard Crashes in PA  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER NEWTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILKES-BARRE, Pa. (AP) -- A twin-engine charter plane carrying 19
people from Atlantic City, N.J., crashed in a ball of fire after
engine failure Sunday as it attempted to land in poor weather.
There was no sign of survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Fiery wreckage was spotted in some woods about 9 miles south of
the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport in northeastern
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared that both of the turbo prop's engines failed, said
Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Tammy Jones.
</P>
<P>
   The plane missed its first landing approach and crashed on its
second attempt, said George Black of the National Transportation
Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is some indication on the air traffic control tapes that
they were encountering engine problems during the first approach
and those continued into the second attempt,'' Black said at a news
conference in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators were awaiting a transcript from air traffic
controllers who were talking with the crew before the plane
crashed. The plane's cockpit voice recorder was recovered from the
crash site, Black said.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, a 1988 BA-31 Jetstream that carried 17 passengers and
two crew members, crashed about two miles into the woods in light
rain and fog. ''Apparently there isn't much left in one piece,''
said Al Bardar, director for emergency management for Luzerne
County. ''It doesn't look like anyone survived.''
</P>
<P>
   About 50 relatives and friends of the victims gathered at the
airport to wait for news.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was tough to look at the manifest and see the names,''
said airport Superintendent Jim Brunozzi, who said his niece's
mother-in-law and father-in-law were on the plane. ''We were a
close family. It's sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony J. Giannone, airport ground superintendent, had to
console a friend whose wife was on the plane. ''He's got two small
kids, and he had to leave here to tell them,'' Giannone said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a small, close community, and that's what I think makes
it so hard,'' said Lackawanna County Commissioner Randy Castellani,
who arrived soon after the crash.
</P>
<P>
   The plane left Atlantic City at about 10:30 a.m. and was
scheduled to land in Wilkes-Barre an hour later, said Peter Hartt,
spokesman for the South Jersey Transportation Authority, which
operates the Atlantic City Airport.
</P>
<P>
   He said the plane was operated by Executive Airlines, which
typically runs casino charters, but he did not know who was aboard.
Executive Airlines officials declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The plane disappeared from radar about 11:40 a.m. during a
second instrument approach, typically performed if the visibility
is poor or if there is a low cloud deck.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency crews began searching along the planned flight path of
the plane as soon as they were notified shortly after 11:30 a.m.
that it would not reach the airport, said Luzerne County 911
spokesman Ron Rome. Wreckage was spotted in a wooded area in Bear
Creek Township about 12:45 p.m., he said.
</P>
<P>
   Megan Maguire was outside gardening at her home near the airport
on the northern rim of the Pocono Mountains shortly before noon
when she heard a plane apparently having problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard the engines die, then I heard them start up again, and
then they just died. I heard it rev up twice, so it died twice,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Black said the BA-31 Jetstream does not have a history of
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a lot of them in operation,'' he said. ''It's a very
common short haul (plane).''
</P>
<P>
   There were three crashes of similar model airplanes in the
1990s, the last coming in December 1994 at the Raleigh-Durham
International Airport in North Carolino, killing 15 of 20 people
aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's crash appeared to be the worst in Pennsylvania since
1994, when a USAir 737 crashed near Pittsburgh, killing all 132
people aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkes-Barre is 150 miles northwest of Atlantic City, N.J.

<HEADLINE> Japan Umpire Assault Probed  </HEADLINE>
By YURI KAGEYAMA
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese umpires, long the target of physical and
verbal abuse from players and managers, may finally hope for a
little more respect. Police said Sunday they were investigating the
latest ballpark scuffle that left an ump with fractured ribs.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Mike DiMuro, an American umpire who was working
for the Central League here, quit in disgust after a batter pushed
him in the chest over a called strike.
</P>
<P>
   ''I saw so much of it going on over there. There's a long
history of violence against umpires, and until they're ready to
make a strong stand, it's going to continue,'' DiMuro said after
working Sunday's game in Montreal between the Expos and Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't matter if you're an American umpire, a Japanese
umpire or a Korean umpire, you're going to have problems over there
with violence against you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The same team and manager involved in that melee -- the Chunichi
Dragons and Senichi Hoshino -- are at the center of the latest
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   During a May 6 game at the Nagoya Dome against the Yokohama
BayStars, home-plate umpire Atsushi Kittaka called a third strike
on Dragons infielder Kazuyoshi Tatsunami.
</P>
<P>
   Tatsunami contested the call, and a screaming Hoshino and a
horde of his players rushed from the Dragons' dugout, surrounding
and wrestling the umpire. Japanese media reports said Kittaka's
uniform was left with spike marks.
</P>
<P>
   Although Japanese baseball fans are used to seeing their umpires
get pushed around, the latest brawl brought calls for change
because of the seriousness of Kittaka's injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Tatsunami, Hoshino and outfielder Takayuki Onishi were ejected
from the game. The Central League fined Hoshino $4,600, and
Tatsunami and Onishi $1,800 each.
</P>
<P>
   Tatsunami and Hoshino were suspended for three games, and
Onishi, suspected of the fiercest violence, for seven games.
</P>
<P>
   There had been speculation that the umpires' union would file a
police complaint, but it decided -- in usual humble fashion -- not
to. The complaint that finally came was from two fans, the Aichi
state police said.
</P>
<P>
   Onishi and Tatsunami have issued apologies. Hoshino also
apologized at a news conference, although he added sarcastically,
''I actually have a lot I want to say.''
</P>
<P>
   When DiMuro, now a major league umpire, quit Japan three years
ago, he left behind a plea for the safety of his Japanese
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was my understanding that the umpires did go to the
league,'' DiMuro said Sunday. ''They said, 'We had an agreement in
'97 between the Pacific League and the Central League that we were
going to crack down on the violence,' so it was my understanding
that the umpires did go to the league and request some action.''
</P>
<P>
   ''That just goes to how serious it is,'' he said. ''That's
really saying that there's a serious, serious problem. If you're
going to have to involve police in an on-field situation, that
means it's violent and it transcends the realm of just the game of
baseball.''

<HEADLINE> Korean Students Stage Anti-US Rally  </HEADLINE>
By KYONG-HWA SEOK
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Hundreds of leftist students rallied
in Seoul Sunday, demanding an end to the American military presence
in South Korea and denouncing its bombing exercises.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's kick out American troops from our land and achieve
national sovereignty!'' some 500 student chanted, pumping clenched
fists into the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Brief pulling and pushing matches occurred when riot police
tried to push back to pedestrian roads the protesters who had
spilled onto an eight-lane boulevard in central Seoul while trying
to march to the U.S. Embassy a few hundred yards away.
</P>
<P>
   There have been no reports of injuries or arrests.
</P>
<P>
   The students demanded that the United States withdraw its 37,000
troops stationed in South Korea and denounced its bombing exercises
that have been temporarily halted.
</P>
<P>
   On May 8, a U.S. Air Force fighter jet dropped six bombs on the
Koon-Ni Range near the west coast village of Mae Hyang, 50 miles
south of Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   Villagers said six people were slightly injured after the impact
cracked walls and broke hundreds of windows. They have demanded
compensation and the relocation of the range.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. and South Korean militaries were jointly investigating
the case while the U.S. Air Force temporarily halted firing on the
range until the investigation is completed.
</P>
<P>
   Leftists seized on the case to mount anti-U.S. protests. More
than 100 students were detained early this month for trying to
march on to the U.S. Embassy and 22 of them were arrested,
including three who jumped over the embassy wall.
</P>
<P>
   The Korean peninsula was divided into the communist North Korea
and pro-Western South Korea at the end of World War II in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   They fought the 1950-53 Korean War, during which the United
States fought on the southern side. The conflict ended without a
peace treaty and their border remains the world's most heavily
fortified, with almost 2 million troops deployed on both sides.

<HEADLINE> Former Webster's Editor Dies at 79  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHAKER HEIGHTS, Ohio (AP) -- David B. Guralnik, former editor in
chief of Webster's New World Dictionary and an internationally
known lexicographer, has died. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
   Guralnik, who died Friday at his suburban Cleveland home, spoke
six languages and served as Webster's editor-in-chief for more than
35 years. He was considered an expert on slang and was the first to
include ''ain't'' in the dictionary in 1951 -- something that was
unheard of at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ''Language isn't created by votes or people coming together and
saying, 'Hey, I like this word,''' Guralnik told The Associated
Press in a 1995 interview. ''Language has a life of its own.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Guralnik said all words were his favorites, he believed
''OK'' best expressed the creativity of English-speaking Americans.
Its first known use was in the 19th century, as an abbreviation for
the deliberately misspelled ''oll korrect'' or ''all correct.'' Now
the phrase is used worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Guralnik was born in Cleveland and earned bachelors and masters
degrees from Western Reserve University. In 1948 he was named
editor in chief of Webster's New World Dictionaries.
</P>
<P>
   Steadfastly refusing to move to New York City, Guralnik remained
in Cleveland for most of his career. He was a leader in the city's
Jewish community, serving as president of the Jewish Community
Center.

<HEADLINE> Sorenstam Win Firstar LPGA Classic  </HEADLINE>
By RUSTY MILLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEAVERCREEK, Ohio (AP) -- The gallery didn't know. Karrie Webb
and Christie Kerr didn't either.
</P>
<P>
   Annika Sorenstam was one of the few people aware that her
15-foot birdie putt on the 17th hole gave her a one-stroke lead --
and would eventually give her the victory -- in Sunday's final round
of the Firstar LPGA Classic. And even she was worried.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think you could hear it in Orlando,'' Sorenstam said of the
ground-shaking roar after Webb holed a 131-yard 9-iron shot for
eagle on the final hole. The massive crowd sitting on the grassy
amphitheater surrounding the final green thought Webb's dramatic
shot had pulled her into a tie with Sorenstam and Kerr at 18 under.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pity it wasn't on TV this week,'' Webb said.
</P>
<P>
   The gallery was expecting a playoff because Sorenstam's birdie
on the 17th had yet to be posted on the giant scoreboard next to
the final green. When a big, red 19 was put up for Sorenstam on the
17th hole, the crowd groaned.
</P>
<P>
   ''When they posted Annika at 19 under, they sighed a little
bit,'' said Webb, who had earlier seemingly thrown away the lead
with a two-stroke penalty. ''I think they got into it and wanted to
see more golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, all they saw was Sorenstam doing what she does best:
Hitting a drive into the fairway, an iron onto the green, then
deftly putting for the par that gave her the $97,500 first-place
check.
</P>
<P>
   ''Annika being Annika, I didn't expect her to bogey it,'' Webb
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam birdied three of the last four holes in a closing
6-under-par 66 that left her at 19-under 197 -- tying the lowest
score in tour history for a 54-hole tournament. The Swedish star
didn't have a bogey throughout, hitting 50 of 54 greens in
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Kerr and Webb ended up a shot back.
</P>
<P>
   Webb's late heroics made up for a gaffe earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the tournament by a stroke on No. 8, the Australian was
penalized two strokes for swinging at and striking the sand after
her first bunker shot trickled back into the trap.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most people probably heard it was out of anger,'' said Webb,
denied a shot at her fifth win of the year. ''It was partially out
of anger but, moreso, I just forgot the ball was still in the
bunker and I was practicing. I told my caddie, 'If I had thought
about getting a two-shot penalty, I would have taken a bigger cut
at it.'''
</P>
<P>
   It was Sorenstam's second victory of the season. Webb has
already won four times and came into the tournament with almost a
2-to-1 edge over her closest pursuer on the money list.
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam's score matched the LPGA records set by Pat Bradley in
the 1991 Rail Charity Golf Classic. With rounds of 66, 65 and the
closing 66, Sorenstam broke the tournament record by two strokes.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the best I've played in a really long time -- probably
since I won in Ohio last year at New Albany,'' Sorenstam said after
her 20th career victory. ''I played great. I hit a lot of fairways
and hit it close on a lot of greens.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerr closed with a career-best 64, but was stunned by what Webb
did on the last hole and Sorenstam did down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought if I shot 64 I would've blown everybody away,'' Kerr
said.
</P>
<P>
   Webb shot a 65 despite the triple-bogey 8 at No. 8. She won't
easily forget the first time she has ever holed a shot on a
finishing hole.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looked pretty good all the way. It was drawing right to the
pin,'' she said. ''I knew it had to go in for me to have a chance
at the tournament. It was just one of those things.''
</P>
<P>
   Canada's E.J. Eathorne shot a 64 and was alone in fourth at 199,
followed by first-round leader Mi Hyun Kim of South Korea at
16-under 200 after a 68. Wendy Ward shot the lowest score of the
final round, a 63 that left her at 201.
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam is second to Webb in wins, money and scoring average
but isn't conceding anything. The two will likely tangle many more
times this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's only May, although Karrie's got a good head start,''
Sorenstam said. ''But the summer's coming and we've got three
majors and some big purses. I'm ready and my game's ready.''

   Leading the tournament by a stroke on No. 8, the Australian was
penalized two strokes for swinging at and striking the sand after
her first bunker shot trickled back into the trap.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most people probably heard it was out of anger,'' said Webb,
denied a shot at her fifth win of the year. ''It was partially out
of anger but, moreso, I just forgot the ball was still in the
bunker and I was practicing. I told my caddie, 'If I had thought
about getting a two-shot penalty, I would have taken a bigger cut
at it.'''
</P>
<P>
   It was Sorenstam's second victory of the season. Webb has
already won four times and came into the tournament with almost a
2-to-1 edge over her closest pursuer on the money list.
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam's score matched the LPGA records set by Pat Bradley in
the 1991 Rail Charity Golf Classic. With rounds of 66, 65 and the
closing 66, Sorenstam broke the tournament record by two strokes.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the best I've played in a really long time -- probably
since I won in Ohio last year at New Albany,'' Sorenstam said after
her 20th career victory. ''I played great. I hit a lot of fairways
and hit it close on a lot of greens.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerr closed with a career-best 64, but was stunned by what Webb
did on the last hole and Sorenstam did down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought if I shot 64 I would've blown everybody away,'' Kerr
said.
</P>
<P>
   Webb shot a 65 despite the triple-bogey 8 at No. 8. She won't
easily forget the first time she has ever holed a shot on a
finishing hole.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looked pretty good all the way. It was drawing right to the
pin,'' she said. ''I knew it had to go in for me to have a chance
at the tournament. It was just one of those things.''
</P>
<P>
   Canada's E.J. Eathorne shot a 64 and was alone in fourth at 199,
followed by first-round leader Mi Hyun Kim of South Korea at
16-under 200 after a 68. Wendy Ward shot the lowest score of the
final round, a 63 that left her at 201.
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam is second to Webb in wins, money and scoring average
but isn't conceding anything. The two will likely tangle many more
times this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's only May, although Karrie's got a good head start,''
Sorenstam said. ''But the summer's coming and we've got three
majors and some big purses. I'm ready and my game's ready.''

<HEADLINE> LAPD Chief: Abuses Are Exaggerated  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In his first public statement since federal
authorities threatened him with a lawsuit two weeks ago, Police
Chief Bernard C. Parks said he doesn't need the federal government
to help him reform the police department.
</P>
<P>
   Internal efforts to curb officer misconduct are in place and
simply need time to succeed, Parks told the Daily News of Los
Angeles in an interview published Sunday. He denied patterns of
abuse and said problems on the police force have been overstated.
</P>
<P>
   He criticized the Department of Justice for threatening to
intervene with a federal lawsuit unless leaders negotiate new ways
to fix the police force.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department action followed a four-year investigation
that found the Los Angeles Police Department is plagued by rogue
officers and poor supervision.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a variety of ways (officers) have gotten in trouble,
but many of them are isolated, where officers made poor
decisions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Parks also said the misconduct allegations against several
officers in the Rampart division corruption scandal do not reflect
the overall behavior of the department's nearly 9,300 officers. The
scandal centers on a group of anti-gang officers who allegedly
beat, framed and sometimes shot suspects.
</P>
<P>
   The Rampart scandal has prompted criminal charges against three
officers and led to about 30 being relieved of duty.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not saying that no one could go into our files and find
a use of force, an officer-involved shooting or a personnel matter
with which they would disagree,'' Parks said. ''But when you look
at the totality ... we don't see the actions or activities
citywide, or in the concentration (of Rampart).''

<HEADLINE> Royals 10, Angels 6  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Joe Randa, David McCarty and Carlos
Beltran homered Sunday and the Kansas City Royals blew a five-run
lead before coming back to beat the Anaheim Angels 10-6.
</P>
<P>
   Garret Anderson hit a grand slam for the Angels. It was the
record sixth slam of the day in the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals, who started a 12-game road trip with a major
league-worst 2-11 mark away from Kauffman Stadium, finished 6-6 on
their longest road trip of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Santiago (4-1) pitched four perfect innings of relief after
starter Chris Fussell failed to hold a 5-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City had 14 hits, at least one by every player in the
starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   After Anaheim tied it at 5 on Anderson's slam and Troy Glaus'
solo homer in the third, Jeff Reboulet hit an RBI single in the
fourth and scored on Mike Sweeney's double to make it 7-5.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn's RBI single in the bottom of the inning made it 7-6,
before McCarty's two-run homer off Kent Bottenfield (3-3) gave
Kansas City a three-run lead in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   It took the Angels only two swings in the third inning to erase
Kansas City's early 5-0 lead. With the bases loaded on two walks
and Vaughn's single, Anderson hit his 10th homer of the season.
Glaus followed two pitches later with his 14th.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals had taken the 5-0 lead on Mark Quinn's run-scoring
single in the first, Beltran's solo homer in the second and a
three-run blow in the third by Joe Randa, his seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Fussell, who didn't allow his first hit until Vaughn's single
with two outs in the third, gave up five runs, four hits and four
walks in three innings.
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield allowed 10 hits and nine runs in 4 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Anderson and Glaus combined for the Angels' sixth set of
back-to-back homers this season. ... Anderson's grand slam came
close to the second anniversary of his last one, on May 25, 1998,
also against the Royals. ... Reboulet's fourth-inning single for
his first RBI of the season came on his 29th at-bat.

Plane With 19 Aboard Crashes in Pa.
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WILKES-BARRE, Pa. (AP) -- A twin-engine charter plane carrying 19 people from
Atlantic City, N.J., crashed in a ball of fire after engine failure today as it
attempted to land in poor weather. There was no sign of survivors. Fiery
wreckage was spotted in some woods about 9 miles south of the
Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport in northeastern Pennsylvania. It
appeared that both of the turbo prop's engines failed, said Federal Aviation
Administration spokeswoman Tammy Jones. The plane missed its first landing
approach and crashed on its second attempt, said George Black of the National
Transportation Safety Board. The plane's cockpit voice recorder was recovered
from the crash site, Black said.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The National Institutes of Health ignored warnings for

cause a brain disease that killed dozens of people, the Los Angeles Times
reported today. A scientist who produced the human growth hormone, under
contract to the NIH, thought a Swedish method used to filter the hormone was
unnecessary despite ''warning bells'' of potential contamination risks, the
newspaper reported. More than 20 people in the United States and 34 in Britain
who received the growth hormone from cadavers have died. Around the world, more
than 125 people have died. A synthetic form of the hormone is used now.

   MIAMI (AP) -- The New York Knicks knocked the Miami Heat out of the playoffs
for the third straight season, 83-82 today to advance to the Eastern Conference
finals against Indiana. The Knicks got the winning points from Patrick Ewing and
the benefit of an official's call with 2.1 seconds left. So upset were the Heat
with the way the ending went down -- they felt an official had awarded the
Knicks a timeout when no one had asked for one - that Jamal Mashburn chased the
referees as they ran off the court while Miami's coaches yelled that they had
been robbed.

<HEADLINE> 90 Injured After Walkway Collapses  </HEADLINE>
By JENNA FRYER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- The Winston stock car race was winding down
and fans were streaming across a pedestrian bridge to the parking
lot when two loud cracks could be heard above the murmur of the
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   With the second crack, an 80-foot section of the 320-foot
concrete-and-steel walkway snapped in half and fell onto the
highway outside Lowe's Motor Speedway on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 107 people received medical treatment, said track
spokesman Jerry Gappens. Fifty-three remained hospitalized Sunday,
five in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was an amazing sight; everyone disappeared,'' said Mike
Aquino, 41, of Atlanta, who was treated for minor injuries. ''There
was a mass of people, and then they were all gone. For a split
second, I was thinking I was going to die, and then I realized I
was going to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Piercing screams filled the humid night air as adults and
children slid and tumbled to the highway 17 feet below in a jumble
of broken concrete, coolers, sneakers and grills.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard it crack the first time, and the second time it went
down,'' said Greg Southern. ''It was just awful.''
</P>
<P>
   ''All of a sudden, the bottom fell out from everybody,'' said
Roger Dunham, who had just started across the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Steel bands in the concrete-and-steel bridge failed, said Don
Idol, an assistant engineer with the state Department of
Transportation. Exposed in the rubble, the steel showed signs of
corrosion, probably caused by moisture, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The collapsed bridge section, still connected to the intact
bridge parts, was slumped in a V-shape in the middle of the closed
highway. Crews planned to remove the debris before Monday morning's
rush hour.
</P>
<P>
   ''It could be a material problem, or it could be a construction
problem, maybe structural fatigue,'' said Don Goins, the state
Department of Transportation's chief engineer for field operations.
''We just have to look at that, and we don't know the answer yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The $1 million walkway was built in 1995 for pedestrian traffic
only. It was inspected when it first opened, but inspections
weren't required since then because it is owned by the speedway.
State-owned bridges must be inspected every two years.
</P>
<P>
   The walkway, and another one 500 yards away, carried thousands
of fans over four-lane U.S. 29 to parking lots across the way.
</P>
<P>
   Races at Lowe's Motor Speedway routinely draw six-figure crowds.
Track officials estimate that 180,000 people attended Saturday
night's NASCAR all-star race; other events there have drawn more
than 200,000 spectators.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 53 people still hospitalized Sunday was Dunham, who
worked at the track Saturday night. He counted himself lucky, even
though he spent Sunday being given painkillers for a back injury.
He recalled his concern for a little girl who was walking in front
of him when the walkway fell.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first thing I thought of was that little 3-year-old girl
who was underneath the whole pile,'' Dunham said. ''I wanted to
help people who were hurt a lot worse than I was, but I couldn't do
much. All I could do was hold this guy's head who was bleeding.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunham said he never found the girl, but learned Sunday she
wasn't seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
   Tragedy has struck the speedway before, including last May, when
three spectators were killed by a tire that was sent spinning into
the stands after a crash. A lawsuit filed by the victims' families
was settled this month for an undisclosed amount.
</P>
<P>
   The next race scheduled at the speedway is next Sunday's
Coca-Cola 600. Qualifying races start Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Athletics 13, Twins 4  </HEADLINE>
By DENNIS GEORGATOS
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Tim Hudson pitched seven scoreless
innings and Jason Giambi hit his fifth career grand slam during an
eight-run second Sunday as the Oakland Athletics broke out of an
offensive drought with an 13-4 victory over the Minnesota Twins.
</P>
<P>
   The A's stopped their season-high five-game losing streak and
prevented Minnesota's first four-game sweep in Oakland since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson (5-2) allowed four hits while striking six and walking
four. He won his fourth straight decision.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Christenson had an inside-the-park homer in the eighth for
Oakland and Eric Chavez hit a solo shot. Ben Grieve had four hits
and Ramon Hernandez had three.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland had been struggling offensively, managing a season-low
three hits in three of their previous four games. The A's were
batting just .131 in that span and had failed to score in 14
straight innings.
</P>
<P>
   It all changed in the second, when the A's sent 12 batters to
the plate and matched their season-high for runs in an inning,
highlighted by Giambi's towering drive to center that bounced off
the cement facade just below the second-deck suites.
</P>
<P>
   The homer was the AL-leading 17th for Giambi, one behind St.
Louis' Mark McGwire for the major league lead.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Bergman (2-3) failed to get out of the second, allowing
eight runs on six hits in 1 1-3 innings. He hasn't won since April
25 and two of his three losses in that span have been to the A's,
who have gotten to him for 13 earned runs in 4 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   In the second, Grieve singled and Matt Stairs, after third
baseman Corey Koskie lost his foul popup in the sun, singled
sharply to center. Bergman walked Jeremy Giambi to load the bases
and Miguel Tejada followed with a two-run single.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez walked to reload the bases and Hernandez and Terrence
Long each singled to drive in a run, putting Oakland up 4-0.
Bergman fanned Randy Velarde for the first out of the inning but
Giambi then worked the count to 3-1 before connecting for the slam
and chasing Bergman.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota didn't score until the eighth, when Cristian Guzman
homered off reliever Doug Jones as part of a four-run burst.
</P>
<P>
   Christenson's homer came on a line drive that rolled into the
right-field corner past Brian Buchanan. The rookie couldn't get the
ball back to the infield before Christenson rounded the bases.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Giambi's slam was the fifth by the A's this season, tying
St. Louis for most in the majors. It was also the second of the
year by Giambi, who also hit a slam April 9 against the Chicago
White Sox. ... Minnesota's Denny Hocking was scratched from the
lineup prior to the game because of a strained left hip flexor. He
had tormented the A's, going 9-for-13 with four RBIs in three
previous games. ... Christenson's inside-the-park homer was the
first in Oakland since Terry Steinbach did it Sept. 26, 1996.

<HEADLINE> Down 3-1, Devils Still Confident  </HEADLINE>
By TOM CANAVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Down 3-1 to the Philadelphia Flyers
and facing another frustrating end to the playoffs, the New Jersey
Devils had an air of confidence and seemed to say all the right
things Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Flyers and rookie goaltender Brian Boucher can be
beaten.
</P>
<P>
   No, losing three straight in the best-of-seven Eastern
Conference finals hasn't shaken the Devils.
</P>
<P>
   Who cares that no team has ever come back from a 3-1 deficit in
a conference final to make it to the Stanley Cup finals!
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not over yet,'' Devils captain Scott Stevens said just
before the team boarded a bus for a trip down the New Jersey
Turnpike for Game 5 at Philadelphia on Monday night. ''I believe we
can do it. We've played some of our best hockey on the road in the
playoffs and we will have to play our best game in Philly.''
</P>
<P>
   Not counting the two teams that came back from 3-0 deficits, 13
teams have rallied from 3-1 down to win an NHL playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   However, no team has done it in a conference final. The greatest
comeback of all time came in 1942 when the Toronto Maple Leafs
rallied from a 3-0 deficit in the Stanley Cup finals to beat
Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens knows what it takes to come back. He was a member of the
St. Louis Blues when they rallied from a 3-1 deficit to beat
Detroit in the division semifinals in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to look at it as one game at a time, starting
tomorrow,'' Stevens said. ''It's an awesome feat but what better
time to do it than in the conference final.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Devils are to have any chance of coming back, they will
have to follow coach Larry Robinson's game plan more than they did
on Saturday night in dropping a 3-1 decision.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey did a good job playing a 1-1 tie for two periods, and
then it fell apart in the third, getting outshot 9-4 and giving up
goals to Craig Berube and Simon Gagne in the final seven minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson screamed at his players on the bench in the period and
then walked into the locker room and started throwing things after
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's beyond me, that if you consider yourself a winner, how
you can go out and not give everything,'' Robinson said Sunday in
looking back. ''You can't leave anything on the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Goalie Martin Brodeur said he wasn't surprised by Robinson's
outburst.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Larry hadn't reacted like that, you would have wondered
whether he cared,'' Brodeur said.
</P>
<P>
   Except for a couple of players, Robinson said almost everyone on
the team can play better and give more.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all want to play for the Stanley Cup,'' said Patrik Elias,
the Devils leading goal scorer in the regular season with 35 goals.
''Maybe some guys here just don't understand how hard you have to
play every minute of every shift to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Center Bobby Holik, who had the Devils only goal on Saturday,
isn't surprised New Jersey is facing elimination. He said the
Flyers have been the better team the past three games.
</P>
<P>
   But he warned not to count the Devils out. People did that late
in the season after New Jersey went through a slump and fired
Robbie Ftorek, elevating Robinson to the top spot.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no desperation,'' Holik said. ''I think the best way
to describe it is determination. I don't think we have to do
anything differently, we just have to play 60 minutes the way we
are capable of playing. We just have to be more focused and
disciplined.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no choice, we have to go out and leave it all on the
ice,'' added defenseman Scott Niedermayer, one of nine holdovers
from the Devils 1995 Stanley Cup championship team. ''....We can't
get this close and let it slip away like this.''

<HEADLINE> Nets Win NBA Draft Lottery  </HEADLINE>
By TOM CANAVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SECAUCUS, N.J. (AP) -- The New Jersey Nets, a team looking for a
coach, a president and director of basketball operations after
another dreadful season, finally won a big one, getting the No. 1
pick in the NBA draft lottery on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's so unbelievable, that it's hard for me to stand here and
tell you how I feel,'' said principal owner Lewis Katz, who pumped
the air with his fist after the Nets won. ''My insides are shaking
right now. This is it. This is the beginning of something good for
the Nets. I really believe that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nets (31-51) only had a 4.4 percent chance of jumping from
the No. 7 spot in the lottery to the top spot in the draft, but
luck was on their side when the numbers 6-8-9-14 were drawn in the
ping-pong ball lottery.
</P>
<P>
   ''This should also make it easier for us to fill some slots in
the administration for us, because this could make the difference,
having the top pick,'' Katz said.
</P>
<P>
   The lottery was filled with upsets as the Vancouver Grizzlies
also made a move up, jumping from No. 4 to the second pick. On the
other hand, the Los Angeles Clippers and Chicago Bulls, the two
worst teams in the lottery, slipped to the third and fourth picks
in the draft, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers (15-67) had a 25 percent chance of getting the No.
1 pick and the Bulls (17-65) had a 20 percent chance of winning the
lottery.
</P>
<P>
   ''This pick could basically really move the team up a
substantial notch,'' new Grizzlies owner Michael Heisley said.
''There's so many options. We may be able to make a trade for the
pick, we may be able to trade for two other picks further down.
This really opens up a lot of opportunities for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nets' jump from the seventh spot to No. 1 overall is the
second biggest since the league switched to the weighted ping-pong
ball system in 1990. Orlando jumped from 11th to first in 1993, the
year it took Chris Webber and then traded him to Golden State for
Penny Hardaway and three first-round picks, the last of which gave
the Magic the rights to the Warriors' choice this year.
</P>
<P>
   That turned out to be No. 5 overall. Orlando also will have the
10th (from Denver) and 13th.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta will pick sixth and will be followed by Chicago -- using
a pick it got from Washington, Cleveland, Houston, Orlando, Boston,
Dallas and Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago, which won last year's lottery, did have a little luck
as Washington did not get one of the top three picks. That means
the Bulls get the Wizards' choice. That will give Chicago the
fourth and seventh picks.
</P>
<P>
   Since joining the NBA in 1976, the Nets have been one of the
league's perennial doormats, losing 50 games at least 12 times.
They have made the playoffs 11 times but only advanced beyond the
first round once.
</P>
<P>
   ''I sure hope this is a giant step,'' said general manager John
Nash, who reportedly will be fired once a new director of
basketball operations is found. ''It's one small step for the NBA,
one giant step for the New Jersey Nets.''
</P>
<P>
   This will be the second time the Nets will have the No. 1 pick.
They had it in 1990 and took Derrick Coleman.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey has two of the most talented young players in the
league in point guard Stephon Marbury and forward Keith Van Horn,
but they lacked a dominant player in the middle as Jayson Williams
was sidelined all season with a knee injury and broken leg
sustained in April 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati forward Kenyon Martin is considered the best player
in the upcoming draft, but he broke his leg late in the season and
that makes him somewhat of a question mark.
</P>
<P>
   Nash isn't concerned, saying the Nets doctors will evaluate him.
</P>
<P>
   Almost three dozen underclassmen have entered the draft, headed
by Iowa State forward Marcus Fizer (22.8 points, 7.7 rebounds) and
Texas center Chris Mihm (17.7 points, 10.5 rebounds, 2.7 blocks).
</P>
<P>
   Other underclassmen include Joel Przybilla of Minnesota, Jerome
Moiso of UCLA, Stromile Swift of LSU, JaRon Rush of UCLA, DerMarr
Johnson of Cincinnati and point guards Erick Barkley of St. John's
and Khalid El-Amin of Connecticut.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Addresses Democrats Meeting  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   HYDE PARK, N.Y. (AP) -- President Clinton, addressing a
Democratic strategy conference, urged a new generation of party
leaders Sunday to take up the torch for the party's ''New
Democrat'' centrist philosophy and pick up where he will soon leave
off.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've done everything that I could to turn the ship around. Now
you've got to make sure it keeps sailing in the right direction,''
Clinton told participants at the Democratic Leadership Council's
two-day policy making retreat.
</P>
<P>
   The gathering at the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library
included more than a dozen members of Congress, three governors and
scores of state and local Democratic officials. They're to draft a
strategy charter at the conclusion of the conference Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The aim is ''to shape the New Democrat movement and map out the
strategy and substantive course of our movement in the first decade
of the 21st century,'' said Al From, president of the DLC.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago Clinton was instrumental in another such gathering
by the group of moderate Democrats in New Orleans. As governor of
Arkansas, Clinton helped organize the Democratic Leadership
Council, a group whose aim was to pursue its goals along ''a third
way''-- as Clinton characterized it -- and not along traditional
liberal or conservative lines.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the participants at this week's DLC retreat, in a
tent adjacent to the Roosevelt library and the former Roosevelt
home, Clinton said the site of the conference itself has special
significance.
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt ''came to Hyde Park to see the long-range perspective.
... That's what you are being asked to do. To think of where we
are, where we ought to be, to see the long-range challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton gave another plug for passage of permanent normalized
trade status for China, saying it was not just a matter of trade,
but also of national security. Noting that America has fought three
wars in Asia, he said that by getting China more involved in
international trade ''we have a chance to build a different
future.''
</P>
<P>
   But the thrust of Clinton's remarks were aimed at the future of
the Democratic Party as he approaches the end of his eight years in
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ticked off a litany of priorities for the next
generation of party leaders from keeping the economy strong to
dealing with global climate change and making sure there are enough
police ''to make American the safest big nation on earth.''
</P>
<P>
   He urge the conference participants ''to put forth a declaration
here which will guide our party and should guide our nation for the
next ten years.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Because of the work done in New Orleans and the fact that the
American people gave us a chance two years later to test it, we
have proven that ideas matter and that for the decade of the '90s
those ideas were the right ones,'' said Clinton.

<HEADLINE> Report: Alaska Air Part Was Worn  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- The aircraft part suspected of causing January's
deadly Alaska Airlines crash was discovered to be worn down in a
1997 inspection but fell one-thousandth of an inch short of
requiring regular tests, The Seattle Times reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   If it were not for that microscopic margin, Alaska would have
been required to closely monitor the jackscrew assembly on the
MD-83, the Times reported.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska Airlines mechanics had recommended replacing the worn
jackscrew assembly, which is the focus of the crash investigation
by the National Transportation Safety Board. But the mechanics were
then told to re-evaluate the part, and that produced the
measurement indicating it was barely within safety limits, the
Times said.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 test has become the focus of a criminal investigation
of the airline's maintenance practices by the FBI and the
Department of Transportation. They are trying to determine whether
the test result was legitimate or was manipulated by company
workers to get the plane back into service without further
inspections, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 261 was en route to San Francisco and Seattle from Puerto
Vallarta, Mexico, when it crashed Jan. 31 into the Pacific Ocean
just off Los Angeles, killing all 88 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots had reported problems with the plane's horizontal
stabilizer, a flap on the tail that is tilted by the jackscrew
assembly to determine the pitch of the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Mechanics had tested the jackscrew assembly seven times within a
few days in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The first test -- during a major check at the company's Oakland,
Calif., maintenance facility -- found the part to be close to its
maximum wear limit, with .040 inches of deterioration on the
threads. Had that measurement been any higher, the airline would
have been required by its own FAA-approved rules to replace the
part.
</P>
<P>
   Following that test, mechanics recommended replacing the part,
the Times said, citing federal officials and an Alaska employee who
have seen the maintenance records. But a written order to replace
the part was scratched out and replaced with a directive to
re-evaluate the finding.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent tests apparently showed less wear on the part -- a
finding of .033 inches of deterioration. At .034 inches of wear --
just .001 inch more -- the part is to be rechecked after every 1,000
flight hours, according to an Alaska maintenance manual, the Times
said. That would have meant the part would have been inspected
repeatedly in the 28 months between the tests and the crash.
</P>
<P>
   But at .033 inches of wear, the jackscrew was not due for
inspection until June 2000. The plane did undergo a major
maintenance check in January 1999, but the jackscrew assembly,
which is inspected only in alternate major checks, was not part of
that.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska officials have said the part was well within standards.
</P>
<P>
   ''We stand by what we said before,'' Alaska spokesman Jack Evans
said Sunday. He said company lawyers have advised employees not to
comment because of the criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA had no comment Sunday because the accident remains under
investigation, spokesman Eliot Brenner said.

<HEADLINE> Mickelson Wins Colonial Golf  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN HAWKINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- When Phil Mickelson made the turn
Sunday in the Colonial, he thought he was too far behind to win. He
wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson began the final round six shots behind the leader, and
had lost another shot after hitting into a greenside bunker and
taking a bogey 5 on No. 9.
</P>
<P>
   ''I got off to a good start and was thinking a lot about
winning,'' Mickelson said. ''When I made the turn, I tried not to
think about winning. I tried to hit some good golf shots because I
was too far behind to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he birdied three straight holes to start the back nine.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson made five of his eight birdies on the back nine,
capping his closing 7-under-par 63 with a birdie putt of more than
20 feet on 18. He ended with a 12-under 268 total, two strokes
ahead of Stewart Cink and Davis Love III.
</P>
<P>
   While Mickelson was making his late charge to tie Tiger Woods as
the PGA Tour's only three-time winners this year, Cink and Love
were falling apart five groups behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I ended up making a few birdies. When I birdied 10, 11 and 12,
I looked up at the board and saw I was only two back. That's when I
knew I had a chance to win,'' said Mickelson, who also won the
Buick Invitational and BellSouth Classic this year.
</P>
<P>
   The 18th-hole birdie for Mickelson, who won for the 16th time in
his career, came just before Cink's drive at the 15th hole dropped
into thick rough after hitting a tree.
</P>
<P>
   Cink's approach at the 430-yard hole stopped just short of a
greenside bunker, then he made a nice pitch within about 6 feet
only for him to slide the par-saving putt past the hole. That
dropped him even with Mickelson and out of sole possession of the
lead for the first time during the final round.
</P>
<P>
   The lead was gone when Cink three-putted the 17th. His 40-foot
putt slid past the hole, and then he missed the 4-footer coming
back and ended with a bogey 5 that put him 11 under.
</P>
<P>
   ''A couple of putts he normally makes just didn't go in for him
and that was to my benefit,'' Mickelson said. ''Certainly, that's
not the way I look at the way the tournament went. I look at it as
I shot 63 to have a chance and it was enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson, who turns 30 in June, collected a $594,000 check, the
largest of his nine-year career. He has won $2.3 million this
season, surpassing the $2 million mark for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Love, who along with Mickelson lost in a playoff to Jesper
Parnevik at last week's Byron Nelson Classic, finished in second
place for the eighth time since his last victory at the 1998 MCI
Classic, 48 tournaments ago.
</P>
<P>
   Cink, who turned 27 on Sunday, ended with a bogey at 18 for a
loss of three strokes over the last four holes. Cink, who won the
MCI Classic last month, was trying to join Mickelson, Woods,
Parnevik and Hal Sutton as multiple winners this season.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was on fire early and then got a little shaky, then played
great, then played badly,'' Cink said. ''There are a lot of things
I wish I could do over. I just lost it. You can't open the door on
guys like these.''
</P>
<P>
   The final bogey was his fifth over the last 14 holes, after just
three over the first 58 of the tournament. Cink was 10 under with
just one bogey for the 31 holes he played Saturday, including the
completion of his rain-delayed second round and the third round,
that gave him a three-stroke lead over Love going into the final
round.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson, who shot a 70 Saturday, went into the final round six
strokes behind Cink. The left-hander first made noise with birdies
at Nos. 3 and 4, the beginning of Colonial's horrible horseshoe.
</P>
<P>
   The horseshoe, its nickname gained because of the layout and
difficulty, includes the two longest par-4s at Colonial Country
Club, the 476-yard 3rd and the 470-yard 5th, and the 246-yard par-3
4th hole.
</P>
<P>
   Cink was the only player to manage birdies during the week at
all three of those holes. Like Mickelson, he birdied the first two
Sunday but then he shanked a 2-foot putt after a nice chip and
bogeyed the 5th.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was going along pretty good until then,'' Cink said.
</P>
<P>
   Love fell out serious contention after a bogey at 9, when he
drove into the trees way right of the fairway and hit his second
shot through the green. Even though he saved par after missing the
fairway at the 10th to remain nine under, he was four strokes
behind after Cink's 10-foot birdie putt there.
</P>
<P>
   ''I let it get away from me in the middle of the round today,''
said Love, who had four sub-70 rounds. ''I'm getting tired of
playing good golf but not playing great for four days. It's
frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
Divots: Mickelson, who joined the tour in 1992, became the 10th
player to surpass $11 million in career earnings. ... Jim Furyk
shot a final-round 67 to finish tied for eighth at Colonial, where
he made his 34th consecutive cut, second on the PGA Tour only to
the 48 in a row by Woods. ... Carl Paulson played the back nine in
6-under 29, one shot over the Colonial record set by Keith
Clearwater during his course-record 61 in 1993.

<HEADLINE> N.M. Firefighters Form Bonds  </HEADLINE>
By P. SOLOMON BANDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   ESPANOLA, N.M. (AP) -- Despite working 12-hour shifts for days
and missing their families, firefighters attacking the huge Los
Alamos blaze said they never lost their resolve.
</P>
<P>
   ''We missed Mother's Day,'' said Cliff Pekoc, who shared his
cell phone with fellow crew members that day. Pekoc also brought
along a portable TV, which allowed the group to keep up with the
news.
</P>
<P>
   Pekoc was part of the firefighting force -- 1,290 strong at its
peak -- that slept in tents, worked 12-hour shifts beginning at 6
a.m. and 6 p.m. and showered in a trailer. Their enemy: New
Mexico's largest wildfire, which left over 400 families homeless in
Los Alamos and forced the evacuation of 25,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, the fire was four-fifths contained, and the worst
injury among the crews was a broken ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Engine crew boss Mark Teesay said he looked forward to going
home and spending time with his three daughters, ages 14, 8 and 18
months.
</P>
<P>
   Teesay recalled his first look at the fire on May 7, three days
after it began as a controlled burn at Bandelier National Monument.
</P>
<P>
   ''We saw a little wisp of smoke coming out of the canyon and we
thought, 'That can't be the fire, that must be another one,''' he
said. ''We thought we'd be home in three to five days.''
</P>
<P>
   There are two types of crews. Hot shots are highly trained
federal firefighters hired from about mid-May to October. When not
traveling from fire to fire, they spend time at their home base
doing projects such as trail building or brush clearing. They work
near or next to the fire or in rough terrain.
</P>
<P>
   The other crews, called Type II hand crews, are composed of
people who are not full-time firefighters and get $9 to $10 an
hour, plus 25 percent extra as hazard pay when a fire is deemed
uncontrollable. They work farther away from the fire.
</P>
<P>
   The Toros from Las Vegas, N.M., is such a crew. Composed of
landscapers and construction workers, it is led by Patrick Apodaca.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're here to save our forests,'' Apodaca said as his
20-member crew worked on the side of a steep wall in Santa Clara
Canyon on Thursday, their 11th day. Apodaca has been fighting fires
for 23 years.
</P>
<P>
   Each firefighter carried a yellow backpack -- yellow is easier to
see in the woods during a fire -- stocked with lunch, five quarts of
water, sweatshirts and extra socks. Some carried first aid kits,
while Apodaca carried extra silverware and ribbon to mark snags --
fire-weakened trees that are ready to fall.
</P>
<P>
   The firefighters are only allowed to work for 14 days at a time,
so members of the crew were eagerly awaiting Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Although more than 200 homes were lost in the west and northwest
parts of town, ''Thank You'' signs were posted on lawns spared by
fire, painted on windshields and on businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since the National Park Service started this fire and we're
part of the federal government, I figured they would be throwing
rocks at us,'' said Pete Coleman, a hot shot crew member from
Carson City, Nev. ''But they've been very nice to us. They've
offered to buy us beers and they've given us free massages.''

<HEADLINE> Stars 4, Avalanche 1  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MOSSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Being outshot 39-15 in a must-win game on the road
isn't the usual formula for success. But thanks to Ed Belfour, the
Dallas Stars regained home-ice advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour was brilliant in goal, recording 38 saves, to lead the
Stars to a 4-1 victory over the Colorado Avalanche on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Hull had two goals and an assist as the Stars squared the
best-of-seven Western Conference finals at 2-2. Game 5 is Tuesday
night at Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Modano added three assists for Dallas, which scored four
times on its first 11 shots.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're sitting here at 2-2 with three games left, two at
home,'' Dallas coach Ken Hitchcock said. ''Our team feels pretty
good about itself right now.
</P>
<P>
   ''We got the win in this building that we badly needed. Colorado
plays perfect in this building. We play really well in our
building, too. The game changes dramatically when it goes into our
building now.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock, who switched his lines in an effort to inject life
into a squad that was shut out twice in the first three games of
the series, said Hull's second goal was critical.
</P>
<P>
   ''They scored their goal after an unfortunate turnover (to make
it 2-1), and we were on our heels,'' Hitchcock said. ''That goal by
Hull was huge for us.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hitchcock reserved most of his praise for Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   ''Eddie was terrific,'' Hitchcock said. ''He's been terrific the
whole series. He's played four great hockey games.''
</P>
<P>
   Belfour said he ''felt real strong the whole game and I was
seeing the puck real well. All I had to do was make the first save.
Guys took care of the rebounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Belfour, who had 38 saves in two straight games, admitted,
''They were definitely two strong games for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the shot imbalance, Belfour said, ''I don't pay
attention to the board. I try and stay focused on making the next
save.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars focused on not being careless and not how many pucks
they sent towards Patrick Roy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We weren't concerned about the number of shots,'' Hull said.
''We concentrated on not making mistakes first, and then making the
most of the shots when we got them.''
</P>
<P>
   Roy stopped 11 shots for Colorado, which lost for the first time
at home in the playoffs after seven wins.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dallas played well with the lead, and whenever we had a good
scoring chance, Belfour was there,'' Colorado coach Bob Hartley
said. ''We had great pressure and we put tons of pucks at the nets.
But it's not the number of shots, it's the number of goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Nieuwendyk and Hull scored first-period goals as Dallas,
despite being outshot 10-4, took a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk, stationed to the right of the goal, took a pass from
Jamie Langenbrunner from behind the net and beat Roy on a power
play at 7:12.
</P>
<P>
   It was Nieuwendyk's fifth goal of the playoffs but his first
point in this series.
</P>
<P>
   Hull scored his sixth goal of the playoffs at 17:30. Modano
intercepted Dave Andreychuk's pass and fed Hull in the slot.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado missed a prime scoring chance later in the period.
Belfour stopped Milan Hejduk's shot and Peter Forsberg batted the
rebound toward the goal, but Joe Sakic hit the post from just left
of the crease.
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche turned up the pressure in the second period,
outshooting the Stars 21-4 in the period, but Dallas emerged with
its two-goal advantage intact.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Reid made it 2-1, beating Belfour from the left circle
after a turnover by Modano at 1:43.
</P>
<P>
   But the Stars countered six minutes later. Modano slapped the
puck along the right boards to Hull, who scored from the right
circle at 7:52.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour kicked away Forsberg's rebound shot from point-blank
range, and the Stars also withstood a 5-on-3 disadvantage for 1:04.
</P>
<P>
   After Richard Matvichuk's rebound goal at 4:39 of the third
period, the game deteriorated into a series of fights and
skirmishes. Fighting majors were assessed to Dallas' Derian Hatcher
and Colorado's Adam Deadmarsh.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas' Scott Thornton earned a game misconduct, and automatic
ejection, with two minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado defenseman Adam Foote, who missed Game 3 with an eye
injury, returned to the lineup, as did Dallas forward Brenden
Morrow, who broke his right ankle just eight days earlier in Game
1.
</P>
<P>
   Morrow was thought to be out for the remainder of the playoffs
after he was injured in Game 1 of the series.
</P>
<P>
   Play was delayed for eight minutes early in the third period to
replace a panel of glass that shattered on Ray Bourque's clearing
pass.
</P>
<P>
   The teams also met in the conference finals last year, and
Dallas won the series 4-3 en route to winning the Stars' first
Stanley Cup title.

<HEADLINE> Plane Crash Turns Pa. Town Chaotic  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER NEWTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILKES-BARRE, Pa. (AP) -- A trail of emergency vehicles and
four-wheel drive trucks climbed winding roads through the
mist-shrouded Pocono Mountains to reach the site of a commuter
plane crash Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The twin-engine commuter plane with 19 on board went down nearly
two miles into the dense forest known for its smoky weather
conditions and treasured by hunters for its remoteness.
</P>
<P>
   State police arrived first on the scene and found the plane
shattered and engulfed in flames. Officials said there was no sign
of survivors.
</P>
<P>
   For some officials, the series of events were all too familiar.
Three people died when their small commuter jet crash into the
Poconos in December. A six-seat Cessna 310 crashed in the Old Forge
area in January, killing a pilot and a passenger.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Gueiss, a spokesman for the Salvation Army, said he worked
at the last two plane crashes as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know if it's just bad luck or what, but this is
getting to be a regular ordeal for us,'' Gueiss said as he unloaded
boxes of sandwiches from a truck. ''Only God has the answers to
this kind of thing.

   The dozen or so large emergency vehicles parked in a single file
along a snaking road that goes off the main highway and into the

   About five miles away from the crash site, officials set up a

residents of this serene mountain town gathered to look for
information about the crash.

   Striding through the mud along the roadway that investigators
used to reach the scene, coroners in orange suits stacked

as well be the first time.''

<HEADLINE> 54 More S. Leone Hostages Released  </HEADLINE>
By TIM SULLIVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Sierra Leonean rebels released
another 54 U.N. personnel Sunday after holding them hostage for
nearly three weeks, a U.N. official said.
</P>
<P>
   The freed peacekeepers were handed over to Liberian custody in
the border town of Foya and flown by helicopter to Liberia's
capital of Monrovia on Sunday, said U.N. spokesman David Wimhurst.
They were brought to Freetown by plane a few hours later.
</P>
<P>
   The group, which included three people who were injured,
comprised 42 Zambians, 10 Kenyans, one Malaysian and one Norwegian,
Wimhurst said.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the group looked thin and weak as they walked off the
plane. The three injured, all of them Kenyan, were taken away in an
ambulance. Officials did not say how they were hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Wimhurst said a number of those released were also suffering
from malaria.
</P>
<P>
   A U.N. peacekeeping official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said they had been ''reasonably treated,'' though there
was little food or medicine in the dense Sierra Leonean bush where
they'd been held.
</P>
<P>
   They were to be taken to a transit camp where they would be
given medical attention and allowed to talk to their families, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   One former captive, 57-year-old Naval Cmdr. Knut Gjellestacj, a
Norwegian military observer, said he was happy to be free.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thank everybody in Norway for all their good thoughts,''
said Gjellestacj, who was captured on May 1 when he went to try to
secure the release of some his U.N. colleagues who had been seized
in the central town of Makeni.
</P>
<P>
   With Sunday's releases, the rebel Revolutionary United Front has
freed 204 of some 500 U.N. peacekeepers it seized in early May.
Less than 300 are still believed held. The reason behind Sunday's
release was not immediately clear.
</P>
<P>
   The release comes as pro-government forces advanced Sunday
toward a rebel-held town that would position them to make a push
against a key rebel stronghold, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-government forces, including members of the army, former
junta soldiers and militiamen composed of traditional hunters known
as the Kamajors, were fighting their way toward Lunsar, 50 miles
northeast of Sierra Leone's capital Freetown, said two top military
officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   They declined to give further details, and their account could
not be independently confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   From Lunsar, the military would be well-placed to launch an
attack on the central city of Makeni, an important rebel
stronghold.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past 10 days, government forces have been slowly
pushing the rebels back from the Freetown area and out of a number
of other important towns.
</P>
<P>
   The counterattack followed a rebel offensive that brought them
to within 40 miles of Freetown, part of a resurgence in Sierra
Leone's civil conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have not launched any major attacks in recent days,
and it was not clear who has been leading them since rebel chief
Foday Sankoh was seized on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah is seeking to push ahead with a
peace accord signed last year. However, the rebels remain
well-armed in their jungle bases. The rebels have demanded Sankoh's
release and have given no indication that they are willing to
disarm.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas have not linked Sankoh's release to the freedom
of the U.N. captives. Asked if Sankoh might be released in a bid to
end Sierra Leone's renewed conflict, Information Minister Julius
Spencer said Saturday, ''it's out of the question. It's not
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. contingent now numbers 10,400, the largest U.N.
peacekeeping deployment in the world, and has been authorized to
grow to 13,000.
</P>
<P>
   In another development, a British aid worker, Alan Smith, 55,
has been missing since May 9, Britain's Foreign Office said. Smith
disappeared near the town of Songo, 25 miles east of the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, U.S. envoy Jesse Jackson denounced the ''terror
tactics'' of the rebels and called on them to release the
peacekeepers immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ''The RUF must disarm voluntarily, and immediately, or be made
to disarm involuntarily,'' Jackson said Saturday at a news
conference in neighboring Liberia.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, acting as President Clinton's special envoy, is touring
West Africa in a bid to calm tensions in Sierra Leone and win the
freedom of the peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said Saturday that he had not yet decided whether he
would go to Sierra Leone. He was traveling to Mali and Guinea over
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh, widely reviled for his role in the country's brutal
civil war, was captured as he walked toward his Freetown home --
which he had fled May 8 when his fighters fired on a crowd of
demonstrators, killing 19.
</P>
<P>
   The government has said it is investigating the shooting, and
has not yet decided what to do with the rebel chief.

Plane With 19 Aboard Crashes in Pa.
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WILKES-BARRE, Pa. (AP) -- A commuter plane carrying 19 people from a gambling
trip to Atlantic City, N.J., crashed in a ball of fire after engine problems
today as it attempted to land in poor weather. There was no sign of survivors.
Fiery wreckage was spotted in some woods about 9 miles south of the
Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport in northeastern Pennsylvania. It
appeared that both of the chartered turbo prop's engines failed, said Federal
Aviation Administration spokeswoman Tammy Jones. The plane missed its first
landing approach and crashed on its second attempt.

Haiti Votes in Legislative Elections
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- Braving threats of violence, Haitians lined up
by the thousands Sunday for a vote to restore democracy and in the process free
a half-billion dollars in desperately needed foreign aid. The Haitians' strong
determination to vote were frustrated by hours-long delays. The elections would
restore a working legislature after President Rene Preval disbanded Parliament
in 1999 and appointed a new premier by decree. Hundreds of people were waiting
to vote in the legislative and local elections at 5 p.m., when stations were
scheduled to close. But by law those in line at that hour will be allowed to
cast ballots.

ability to defend them,'' said Maria Heil, an NRA member for eight years and
Pennsylvania coordinator of the Second Amendment Sisters. Heil spoke at a
seminar held by the NRA's Women on Target, which helps women join and organize
shooting and hunting clubs. The NRA is concerned about the growing divide
between men and women over gun control.

contract to the NIH, thought a Swedish method used to filter the hormone was
unnecessary despite ''warning bells'' of potential contamination risks, the

<HEADLINE> Jordan Early Selection Hopes Dashed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Michael Jordan went into Sunday's NBA draft
lottery hoping to have a coach in place and that a minor miracle
would give the Washington Wizards one of the top three picks in
first round. He didn't get either.
</P>
<P>
   His hopes for an early selection in next month's draft were
dashed when Washington's pick came up in the seventh slot, sending
the pick to the Chicago Bulls under a prior contingency deal and
leaving the Wizards without a first-round selection for the fourth
time in five years.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess we've still got some bad luck in the house
somewhere,'' Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   Washington originally surrendered its 2000 first-round pick to
Golden State in a 1994 trade when it sent Tom Gugliotta and three
first-round picks to the Warriors for forward Chris Webber. Golden
State subsequently traded the pick to Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the original trade with Golden State, however,
the Wizards would have retained their 2000 pick if it had been one
of the first three in the lottery and instead would have
surrendered their first-round pick in the 2001 draft.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would have been great to have that wild card to add to some
of the creativity you can do in the offseason,'' Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   The Wizards have not had a pick in the top three since 1968 when
the Bullets selected Wes Unseld No. 2 overall.
</P>
<P>
   Washington was granted 64 number combinations, which gave the
Wizards a 6.4 percent chance of getting the first pick overall, a
7.21 percent chance of getting the second pick and an 8.26 percent
chance of getting the third.
</P>
<P>
   The Wizards wound up with only the No. 35 pick, in the second
round.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan now must turn his attention to finding a coach to help
rebuild a team that finished with the league's sixth worst record
at 29-53. Jordan had hoped that the Wizards would have a coach in
place by Sunday's lottery.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wish it could have been today. I don't think you just want
to meet a deadline and put in a bad choice for this organization,''
Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   It has been reported that St. John's coach Mike Jarvis is
Jordan's choice to take over the team, but Jordan would not set a
new timetable to name a coach or even say whether Jarvis would
become the coach.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a lot of other candidates just as qualified,''
Jordan said of Jarvis. ''He's one of the guys who's interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Jordan refused to name any of the other candidates.
When asked whether he was talking to other candidates Jordan
replied with a very emphatic, ''Yes. I certainly am.''

<HEADLINE> Arizona Senator John McCain challenges Colgate grads to enter public life </HEADLINE>
By JOHN KEKIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMILTON, N.Y. (AP) -- Saying that government is unable to meet
the major challenges of the day, John McCain urged the graduating
class at Colgate University on Sunday to enter public life to
''reform the practices of politics and the institutions of
government that threaten the quality of our freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Be patriots,'' the Arizona senator told the nearly 670
graduates. ''As you leave the familiar confines of this college and
begin building careers and acquiring the qualities and material of
independent, adult lives, please remember that you are and always
have been part of something larger than your individual interests.
You are Americans, and I appeal to you to be patriots. Our
patriotism is a common responsibility. We are responsible to each
other for our freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said it was important for the Class of 2000 to consider
public service. And he said he was worried that some had been
affected by rampant public cynicism.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe it is a very healthy thing for Americans to be
skeptical about the purpose and practices of public officials and
refrain from expecting too much from government,'' McCain said to
an audience of just over 2,000, who were not deterred by
temperatures in the mid-50s or the light drizzle that fell on the
outdoor ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ''But healthy skepticism has become widespread cynicism
bordering on alienation, and that worries me greatly,'' he said.
''When the people come to believe that politics has become so
polarizing, and government has become so dysfunctional that it no
longer serves our basic constitutional ends, civil consensus will
eventually deteriorate to the point that our culture might fragment
beyond recognition.''
</P>
<P>
   And McCain shouldered some of the responsibility for what has
gone wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fault for public cynicism and alienation does not lie with
the people,'' he said. ''It lies with those of us who are
privileged to hold public office. We are to blame for the sickness
in American political life. It is we who have squandered the public
trust.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who was held captive for five years during the Vietnam
war, was chosen to deliver the address at Colgate's 179th
commencement by a committee of students, faculty members and
trustees. Colgate president Charles Karelis said he hoped McCain's
presence would help the university ''underscore its message to
students that courage and leadership are all part of taking
responsibility and charting a productive course for one's life.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the not-so-serious side of McCain shone through. He
managed to make light of the day, poking fun at his own college
career at the U.S. Naval Academy.
</P>
<P>
   ''The invitation to give this commencement address is a great
honor for someone who graduated fifth from the bottom in the United
States Naval Academy Class of 1958,'' said McCain, who received an
honorary doctor of laws degree from Colgate. ''To stand here, in
full academic regalia, and address an audience of distinguished
academics and their learned students has reaffirmed my long-held
faith in America that anything is possible.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has been making visits to several universities as part of
a tour of campuses nationwide to counter political apathy among
young people. And Republicans said he might be back in New York
state again soon, to help U.S. Rep. Rick Lazio in his Senate
campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, a relatively unknown Long Island congressman, formally
declared he was entering the Senate race to replace New York City
mayor Rudolph Giuliani. He dropped out Friday, citing his impending
battle with prostate cancer.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Drownings Death Toll at 33  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Local fishermen and rescue workers
recovered 10 bodies from the Black Sea Sunday, bringing to at least
33 the number of people who drowned when two boats capsized during
a local sea festival.
</P>
<P>
   The victims from the town of Besikduzu, most of them women and
children, drowned when the boats overturned in rough waters
Saturday, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   A search continued for five people still missing.
</P>
<P>
   ''A huge wave came, and the other boat capsized. Then our boat
sank,'' survivor Hazret Dilli, 14, told the Anatolia news agency
that. ''I held on to the boat, and the fishermen rescued me a
little while later.''
</P>
<P>
   The two boats were severely overcrowded when they capsized, said
Sadettin Kalkan, local governor of Besikduzu. ''At the most, they
could handle eight to 10 people,'' he said, but estimated the two
boats carried more than 50.
</P>
<P>
   Police have detained two owners of the boats for questioning.
</P>
<P>
   Izzet Dilli witnessed the incident from the shore. ''I first
heard screams from the sea,'' he said. ''When I ran to the shore, I
saw people scattered all around and the boats going down.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen people were hospitalized in the nearby city of Trabzon.

<HEADLINE> Plane crashes with 19 people aboard  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER NEWTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILKES-BARRE, Pa. (AP) -- A charter plane carrying 19 people from
an overnight gambling trip to Atlantic City, N.J., crashed in a
ball of fire after experiencing engine problems Sunday as it
approached the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport,
apparently killing all aboard.
</P>
<P>
   ''It appeared that both engines failed,'' said FAA spokeswoman
Tammy Jones.
</P>
<P>
   There were no signs of survivors, said Joe Thomas, manager of
the Luzerne County 911 system. Wreckage was spotted in the heavily
wooded, mountainous area, about 9 miles south of the airport in
northeastern Pennsylvania and 90 miles north of Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   There were 17 passengers and two crewmembers aboard.
</P>
<P>
   ''Investigators found a ball of fire at the scene,'' Jones said.
''The weather was bad, it was windy and there was some
precipitation. The visibility was poor.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators were reviewing a transcript from air traffic
controllers who spoke with the crew before the twin-engine turbo
prop crashed.
</P>
<P>
   On a portion of the tape played on ABC News, one pilot can be
heard saying ''tell him we lost both engines.'' The other pilot
replies: ''We lost both engines, six echo Juliet.''
</P>
<P>
   The plane's cockpit voice recorder was recovered from the crash
site, said George Black of the National Transportation Safety
Board.
</P>
<P>
   ''It missed its first approach and was attempting a second
approach when the accident occurred,'' Black said before he left
Washington, D.C., for the accident site. ''There is some indication
on the air traffic control tapes that they were encountering engine
problems during the first approach and those continued into the
second attempt.''
</P>
<P>
   Emergency crews began searching along the planned flight path of
the plane as soon as they were notified shortly after 11:30 a.m.
that it would not reach the airport, said Luzerne County 911
spokesman Ron Rome. Wreckage was spotted in a wooded area in Bear
Creek Township about 12:45 p.m., he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The plane crashed about two miles into the woods,'' said Al
Bardar, director for emergency management for Luzerne County.
''Apparently there isn't much left in one piece. It doesn't look
like anyone survived.''
</P>
<P>
   Megan Maguire was outside gardening at her home near the airport
on the northern rim of the Pocono Mountains shortly before noon
Sunday when she heard a plane apparently having problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard the engines die, then I heard them start up again, and
then they just died. I heard it rev up twice, so it died twice,''
said Maguire, who often hears planes pass overhead as they prepare
to land at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   The coroner's office was sent to the scene along with fire
rescuers, state police, emergency medical workers and other county
authorities, Rome said.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 family members and friends gathered at the airport,
including parents and spouses, said airport officials, some of whom
recognized names among the victims.
</P>
<P>
   One man who refused to identify himself said his mother and
grandmother were on the plane and had gone with the others to
gamble in Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was supposed to be an overnight type of deal,'' he said as
he left the airport.
</P>
<P>
   The group was supposed to fly back to Scranton at 1:15 a.m.
Sunday, but bad weather fogged in the Executive Airlines plane at
Republic Airport in Farmingdale, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The plane didn't arrive in Atlantic City until 10 a.m.,
according to Peter Hartt, spokesman for the South Jersey
Transportation Authority, which operates the Atlantic City
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ''They came out to get in the cars, and the junket
representative came out and said the flight was canceled due to the
weather,'' said Bob Feldgus, 65, a limousine driver hired to take
the group from Caesars Atlantic City Hotel Casino to the airport,
about 12 miles west of the city.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the victims spent the night at the casino.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are deeply saddened by this tragic accident,'' said Wallace
Barr, executive vice president of Park Place Entertainment, which
owns Caesars. ''Our sincere condolences and sympathies are with the
families at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Airport Superintendent Jim Brunozzi said his niece's
mother-in-law and father-in-law were among the victims.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was tough to look at the manifest and see the names,''
Brunozzi said. ''We were a close family. It's sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony J. Giannone, airport ground superintendent, had to
console a friend whose wife was on the plane.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's got two small kids, and he had to leave here to tell
them,'' Giannone said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a small, close community, and that's what I think makes
it so hard,'' said Lackawanna County Commissioner Randy Castellani,
who arrived soon after the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Hartt said the Executive Airlines plane departed the city about
10:30 a.m. and was scheduled to land in Wilkes-Barre an hour later.
</P>
<P>
   Hartt said the airline typically runs casino charters. Executive
Airlines officials declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The BA-31 Jetstream disappeared off radar during a second
instrument approach about 11:40 a.m., Jones said. In general, an
instrument approach is performed if the visibility is poor or if
there are low clouds.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't have a history of being an airplane with problems
to my knowledge,'' Black said. ''There are a lot of them in
operation. It's a very common short haul (plane).''
</P>
<P>
   There were three crashes of similar model airplanes in the
1990s, the last coming in December 1994 at the Raleigh-Durham
(N.C.) International Airport, killing 15 of 20 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's crash appeared to be the worst in Pennsylvania since
1994, when a USAir 737 crashed near Pittsburgh, killing all 132
people aboard.

<HEADLINE> Arizona Senator John McCain challenges Colgate grads to ''be patriots'' </HEADLINE>
By JOHN KEKIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMILTON, N.Y. (AP) -- Saying that government is unable to meet
the major challenges of the day, John McCain urged the graduating
class at Colgate University on Sunday to enter public life to
''reform the practices of politics and the institutions of
government that threaten the quality of our freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Be patriots,'' the Arizona senator told the nearly 670
graduates. ''As you leave the familiar confines of this college and
begin building careers and acquiring the qualities and material of
independent, adult lives, please remember that you are and always
have been part of something larger than your individual interests.
You are Americans, and I appeal to you to be patriots. Our
patriotism is a common responsibility. We are responsible to each
other for our freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said it was important for the Class of 2000 to consider
public service. And he said he was worried that some had been
affected by rampant public cynicism.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe it is a very healthy thing for Americans to be
skeptical about the purpose and practices of public officials and
refrain from expecting too much from government,'' McCain said to
an audience of just over 2,000, who were not deterred by
temperatures in the mid-50s and a light drizzle that fell on the
outdoor ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ''But healthy skepticism has become widespread cynicism
bordering on alienation, and that worries me greatly,'' he said.
''When the people come to believe that politics has become so
polarizing, and government has become so dysfunctional that it no
longer serves our basic constitutional ends, civil consensus will
eventually deteriorate to the point that our culture might fragment
beyond recognition.''
</P>
<P>
   And McCain shouldered some of the responsibility for what has
gone wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fault for public cynicism and alienation does not lie with
the people,'' he said. ''It lies with those of us who are
privileged to hold public office. We are to blame for the sickness
in American political life. It is we who have squandered the public
trust.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who was held captive for five years during the Vietnam
war, was chosen to deliver the address at Colgate's 179th
commencement by a committee of students, faculty members and
trustees. Colgate president Charles Karelis said he hoped McCain's
presence would help the university ''underscore its message to
students that courage and leadership are all part of taking
responsibility and charting a productive course for one's life.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the not-so-serious side of McCain shone through. He
managed to make light of the day, poking fun at his own college
career at the U.S. Naval Academy.
</P>
<P>
   ''The invitation to give this commencement address is a great
honor for someone who graduated fifth from the bottom in the United
States Naval Academy Class of 1958,'' said McCain, who received an
honorary doctor of laws degree from Colgate. ''To stand here, in
full academic regalia, and address an audience of distinguished
academics and their learned students has reaffirmed my long-held
faith in America that anything is possible.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has been making visits to several universities as part of
a tour of campuses nationwide to counter political apathy among
young people. And Republicans said he might be back in New York
state again soon, to help U.S. Rep. Rick Lazio in his Senate
campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, a relatively unknown Long Island congressman, formally
declared he was entering the Senate race to replace New York City
mayor Rudolph Giuliani. He dropped out Friday, citing his impending
battle with prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   At Hamilton College in Clinton County, retired United Nations
Undersecretary Sir Brian Urquhart spoke to graduates on
''Nationalism, Globalism and Common Sense.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I have to tell you that after 41 years in the United Nations
and six years in the British Army before that, common sense has
very little influence in war and surprisingly little in peace.''
Urquhart said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pride, vanity, greed, fear, ambition, prejudice and sometimes
hatred'' are more powerful motives, Urquhart said.
</P>
<P>
   ''For example, why on earth would two of the poorest countries
on earth, Ethiopia and Eritrea, both with catastrophic famines in
their own countries choose this moment to have a total war about a
few square miles of desert which no one ever heard of before?''

<HEADLINE> Colombia Talks Appear on Track  </HEADLINE>
By JARED KOTLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Peace talks appeared back on track
Sunday after a top government envoy said leftist rebels were
probably innocent of carrying out gruesome killings last week that
shook the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential peace envoy Camilo Gomez said he held a ''cordial''
meeting with leaders of the country's largest insurgency, the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez said negotiators would reschedule an international peace
conference suspended by President Andres Pastrana following the
deaths last Monday of a 53-year-old woman and a policeman who tried
unsuccessfully to defuse a bomb placed around her neck.
</P>
<P>
   ''On the subject of the necklace bomb I think it becomes ever
more clear that it wasn't the FARC, and that's important news,''
Gomez told reporters after the meeting outside the FARC-held town
of San Vicente del Caguan.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez did not give details on whom the government now believes
placed the sophisticated necklace bomb, or what evidence -- other
than rebel denials -- appeared to exonerate the FARC.
</P>
<P>
   The conference, focusing on programs to help peasants stop
growing illegal drug crops, ''will take place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez' comments capped a roller-coaster week in which mutual
recriminations seemed to place in serious limbo the talks to end
Colombia's 35-year conflict.
</P>
<P>
   A day after the deadly bombing, Pastrana announced he was
suspending a conference near San Vicente del Caguan in which the
FARC was to have hosted representatives from 21 nations.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels took umbrage, angrily professing their innocence and
warning that talks might collapse unless Pastrana changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   For the FARC, the conference is an opportunity to promote
European aid for peasants as an alternative to a planned U.S. aid
package that would primarily finance forced eradication of their
crops.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors, who were initially wary about the accusations
against the rebels, have yet to complete their investigation.

<HEADLINE> Internet Laws Subject of Concern  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL SHEPARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Following the Federal Trade Commission's
request to Congress for authority to tighten online consumer
privacy standards, House Republicans voiced concerns that election
year politics could be behind the request.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an election year and it seems they are trying to stir
things up a little bit,'' said Rep. Thomas Davis, R-Va. ''In an
election year, they like to throw issues into the mix.''
</P>
<P>
   He spoke in a weekend telephone interview from the Republican
Privacy Retreat, a gathering of party officials and leaders of the
nation's high-tech industry held in Leesburg, Va.
</P>
<P>
   An FTC speaking Sunday on condition of anonymity confirmed that
the commission on Friday voted to approve a plan to seek new laws
that would give it authority to toughen privacy safeguards. For
example, the FTC would be able to penalize companies that violate
privacy regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The official said FTC members planned to provide further details
to members of Congress on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But some Republicans suggested in a series of weekend interviews
that private companies are already doing a pretty good job.
</P>
<P>
   ''A vast number of sites disclose what their privacy policies
are and give consumers more control on what information is gathered
and how will be used,'' said Rep. W.J. ''Billy'' Tauzin, R-La.,
chairman of the Telecommunications, Trade and Consumer Protection
subcommittee of the House Commerce committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''Its good for companies to be secure and many are exploring new
self regulation systems,'' Tauzin said. ''More and more companies
are adopting policies of not doing business with companies that
don't have good privacy policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress has already enacted some laws to help ensure the
privacy for online consumers, most recently in the financial
services area, Tauzin said. ''Substantial and important privacy
protection was passed,'' Tauzin said.
</P>
<P>
   Tauzin added he has met with FTC Chairman Robert Pitofsky and
hasn't closed the door on looking at new legislation if needed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We asked him to examine the scope of his authority to police
bad players on the Internet,'' Tauzin said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said both the FTC and the Justice
Department have existing roles in privacy enforcement and they
should be examined closely ''before jumping into further
legislation.''

<HEADLINE> Explosion Rips Through LA Apartment  </HEADLINE>
By CADONNA M. PEYTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- An explosion possibly caused by a large
firework tore through an apartment building Sunday morning,
injuring a man and sending police on a search for explosives.
</P>
<P>
   A man believed responsible for the blast suffered injuries to
his hands and face, but was not hospitalized. Several hundred
people were evacuated from the building and the rest of the block.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters responded to a report of a fire and found that an
explosion had blown a hole in the third floor of the building,
which is near the Koreatown section of Los Angeles, police officer
Trevion Stokes said.
</P>
<P>
   Police detained but did not arrest the injured man, who
apparently had been trying to manipulate a device described as
possibly a large firework such as an M-80 or big ''cherry bomb,''
Stokes said. The exact nature of the explosive and the man's
intentions were unclear, Stokes said.
</P>
<P>
   Stokes said possessing such an explosive device is a crime.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities evacuated residents, some of whom were awakened by
the sounds of the blast and breaking glass, and began searching for
more explosives in one of the apartments and a car parked nearby.
Investigators continued to search several hours later, but said
they were confident there were no other explosives.
</P>
<P>
   ''A neighbor told them there were possible additional explosives
in the area,'' Stokes said.
</P>
<P>
   One resident, 15-year-old Luz Gutierrez, said she saw the
suspect walking, bloody and shirtless, through the hallway after
the blast. Gutierrez described him as nice man who had served in
the Vietnam War and kept a bullet collection.

<HEADLINE> China To Recover Looted Antiques  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- China plans to form a task force to try to
recover as many as 1 million valuable and sometimes looted Chinese
cultural relics collected by museums around the world, an official
newspaper said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   News of the planned bureau to recover relics follows recent
auctions in Hong Kong of 18th century Chinese antiques. The
auctions outraged many Chinese and Beijing demanded they be
stopped, claiming that British and French troops looted the
antiques from a Chinese palace during the second Opium War 140
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The antiques, three bronze sculptures of heads of an ox, monkey
and tiger and a hexagonal ceramic vase, were bought respectively by
a Chinese state-owned conglomerate and a company under the Chinese
government's relics bureau.
</P>
<P>
   The state-run Workers Daily gave no details about the specialist
department it said Beijing plans to establish to recover relics,
including those in non-governmental hands.
</P>
<P>
   But it said there are no less than 1 million fine-quality
Chinese cultural relics in more than 200 museums in 47 countries,
and that the bureau will be ''responsible for recovering these
relics.''
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper quoted Xie Chensheng, an adviser to China's relics
bureau, as saying the majority of relics left China before the 1949
Communist takeover. In large part, they were either stolen by
invading nations, stolen by foreigners or purchased by foreigners
at extremely low prices from Chinese warlords and smuggled abroad,
Xie reportedly said.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper said the biggest collection of Chinese painting is
in an American museum, the best collection of Chinese porcelain is
in France and that Japan has the largest collection of ancient
inscriptions written onto tortoise shells.

<HEADLINE> Veep Guest Stars in TV Cartoon  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- It wasn't the typical campaign-year cast: Vice
President Al Gore, a one-eyed murderous seductress and a giant
robot who sucked on cigarettes to ''calm the shakes'' and dismissed
rivals with the line, ''Bite my colossal metal ... .''
</P>
<P>
   A cartoon version of Gore guest-starred on Sunday night's season
finale of the Fox show, ''Futurama,'' a TV favorite of the
Democratic presidental candidate.
</P>
<P>
   While his cartoon castmates flaunted potty-mouths, Gore, who led
a band of ''action ranger nerds'' unsuccessful in saving the
universe, spoke nothing saucier than a ''darn.''
</P>
<P>
   As he and his fellow nerds settled down to while away eternity
in some alternate universe playing Dungeons and Dragons, Gore
boasted: ''I'm a 10th-level vice president!''
</P>
<P>
   Some scenes and characters conflicted starkly with the
anti-violence, anti-smoking and family-values themes of Gore's
campaign. But campaign spokesman Chris Lehane said viewers
shouldn't take the cartoon Gore too seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most people who've seen the program take it in the right
spirit -- that it's farcical -- and recognize it for what it is, an
entertainment cartoon,'' Lehane said.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's daughter, Kristin, 22, who lives in Los Angeles, was
recently hired as a comedy writer for the animated series. Producer
David Cohen read that ''Futurama'' was one of the vice president's
favorite shows and arranged for Gore to play himself in the season
finale.

<HEADLINE> Knicks 83, Heat 82  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Same setting, new ending, familiar result: The
Knicks are moving on and the Heat are going home.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Knicks did it again in Miami, ending the Heat's
season in a hostile arena for the third straight year in yet
another riveting win-or-else game -- this time with a finish that
left the home team crying foul.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the winning points from Patrick Ewing with 1:20 left and
the benefit of an official's call with 2.1 seconds left, the Knicks
knocked the Heat out of the playoffs 83-82 Sunday in Game 7 of
their second-round series to advance to the Eastern Conference
finals against Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   So upset were the Heat with the way the ending went down -- they
felt an official had awarded the Knicks a timeout when no one had
asked for one -- that Jamal Mashburn chased the referees as they ran
off the court while Miami's coaches yelled that they had been
robbed.
</P>
<P>
   Referee Bennett Salvatore said Sprewell had called a timeout,
although Sprewell admitted he hadn't. Chris Childs said it was he
who had called time out from several feet away, while Sprewell
thought it was Marcus Camby who called it.
</P>
<P>
   ''They had three officials in their pocket,'' Mashburn said.
</P>
<P>
   After running the rest of the time off the clock without
allowing the Heat to foul, the Knicks mobbed each other at midcourt
-- celebrating again on another May afternoon in Miami after a
draining, all-out battle with their fiercest rivals.
</P>
<P>
   This was vintage Knicks-Heat, another gripping chapter in a
rivalry so strong, with games so intense, that it almost seemed
predestined to go down to the final shot.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Hardaway hit a 3-pointer with 1:32 left to give Miami an
82-81 lead, and Ewing slipped behind Alonzo Mourning for a dunk
that made it 83-82 with 1:20 left.
</P>
<P>
   Mashburn missed a jumper in the lane but atoned for it by
stealing the ball from Childs with 34 seconds left. Hardaway then
missed a runner, and the rebound was batted around until a jump
ball was called. Mourning won the tap to give the Heat the ball
with 12.4 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   The Heat called a timeout and then got the ball to Mourning, but
he passed out of a double-team and the ball ended up in the hands
of Clarence Weatherspoon for a 12-footer that bounced off the back
rim.
</P>
<P>
   ''We weren't going to let Alonzo beat us,'' said Childs, who
singlehandedly kept the Knicks in the game during the fourth
quarter. ''With Weatherspoon, I don't think he's been in that
situation many times before.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell rebounded, and Salvatore stopped the clock with 2.1
seconds left after ruling that Sprewell had called a timeout. The
Heat argued that Sprewell never called for a timeout -- an argument
backed up by television replays and Sprewell's own admission.
</P>
<P>
   The referees huddled but did not change the call.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had Sprewell calling time out,'' Salvatore said, ''but I
wasn't sure where his foot was. I didn't believe he was out of
bounds, but I wanted to check with my partner (Dick Bavetta and Dan
Crawford were the other officials) to make sure he was not out of
bounds when my whistle blew. He confirmed that there was no
question the timeout came before he went out of bounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway was among the most vocal critics of the call -- on the
court and again after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ''I see why they call Dick Bavetta 'Knick' Bavetta,'' Hardaway
said.
</P>
<P>
   Childs took the final 2.1 seconds off the clock by catching
Charlie Ward's inbounds pass and hurling it high in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Just like that, it was over. A series that had included Heat
guard Anthony Carter's incredible shot from behind the backboard in
Game 3 and the Knicks' stunning comeback from an 18-point deficit
in Game 6 had ended with New York's third straight celebration on
the Heat's home floor.
</P>
<P>
   This one might have hurt the most for the Heat, especially with
the way they botched Game 6 and then frittered away a lead down the
stretch of Game 7.
</P>
<P>
   ''Losing all measures up to be the same -- it's bad all the
time,'' Mourning said. ''It can't get any worse. It's all misery.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell led the Knicks with 24 points, 20 coming in the first
half. Ewing added 20 points and 10 rebounds and Childs scored 15
points in his best game of the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Mourning led the Heat with 29 points but missed three foul shots
in the fourth quarter when Miami was trying to increase slim leads.
</P>
<P>
   The game was tied 65-65 after three quarters to set up a fitting
final 12 minutes: Two teams, already having proven themselves so
evenly matched throughout this series, slugging it out possession
by possession with their seasons on the line.
</P>
<P>
   Miami quickly went up by six by hitting their first three shots
of the quarter, and the only thing that kept the Knicks close over
the next five minutes was the hot hand of Childs, who scored New
York's first 10 points of the period, and the Heat's futility at
the line as they missed their first five foul shots.
</P>
<P>
   As each opportunity to gain ground passed unsuccessfully, the
Knicks still managed to stay within striking distance. Two foul
shots by Childs, a missed drive by Mashburn and a layup by Ewing
cut Miami's lead to 79-77 with 3:26 left, and Larry Johnson made
two from the line with 2:55 left to tie it 79-all after Miami
committed its third 24-second violation of the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell made two from the line with 2:21 left for an 81-79
lead, and Hardaway responded with a 3-pointer to make it 82-81 with
1:32 left.
</P>
<P>
   Those, however, would be the Heat's last points of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was a very unique matchup,'' Heat coach Pat Riley said.
''A lot of respect has been gained by both teams for one another,
but as I said the other day, one team just sort of ran out of
clock.''
</P>
<P>
   Mourning was a force in the early going and Hardaway started
hot, too, as the two combined for all of Miami's first 18 points --
Mourning scoring 12 and Hardaway six -- before Dan Majerle hit a
3-pointer and then fed Weatherspoon for an alley-oop dunk and a
23-14 lead.
</P>
<P>
   A 9-0 run by New York while Mourning was on the bench tied it at
29-29, and Sprewell had 12 points in the quarter before Mourning
even attempted his first shot -- a dunk with 3{ minutes left before
halftime -- that turned out to be his only shot of the quarter. The
Knicks closed the half with another 9-0 run for a 45-39 lead at the
break.
</P>
<P>
   Miami's first three baskets of the second half were 3-pointers
as the Heat quickly caught up, but Ewing scored 10 points in the
quarter and New York led for most of it before settling for a 65-65
tie entering the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the Knicks won the deciding Game 5 handily as the Heat
were without Mourning who was suspended for fighting with Johnson
at the end of Game 4. Last year, also in Game 5, it was Allan
Houston's shot with less than a second to play that bounced off the
rim and backboard before falling in.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been very, very special to be a part of this the last
four years. To be able to beat them three straight years on their
home court is a terrific accomplishment for our guys,'' Knicks
coach Jeff Van Gundy said.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Knicks are 3-4 in Game 7s during the Ewing era. This
was only the second Game 7 in Heat history. They beat New York in
Game 7 of the second round in 1997. ... The respect between the
teams was at such a high level that old enemies Johnson and
Mourning exchanged a fist slap prior to tipoff. ... Kurt Thomas and
Johnson of the Knicks drew technicals, Thomas for shoving Mourning
and Johnson for pushing away Crawford's hand. ... Miami's P.J.
Brown fouled out of his second straight game, finishing with nine
points and five rebounds. ... The conference finals begin Tuesday
night at Indianapolis. Game 2 is Thursday, the the series moves to
New York for Game 3 Saturday and Game 4 Monday.

Richard Family's Optimism Returns As Rocket's Condition Improves
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Maurice Richard Jr. was in good spirits Sunday
after his famous father, Maurice (Rocket) Richard, was awake and
well enough to eat breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   ''On Friday, he couldn't speak any more, he just slept all the
time,'' the Rocket's eldest son said. ''But starting on Saturday,
he was better. He opened his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ''And today (Sunday), he's OK. It's still not a great situation,
but there's hope.
</P>
<P>
   Front page stories in the morning papers said the family was on
a death watch as the semi-comatose Rocket waged a final battle
against a spreading cancer.
</P>
<P>
   But cautious optimism about the health of the 78-year-old
Montreal Canadiens legend had returned when Maurice Jr., 55, and
his brother Normand, 50, attended a nationally televised news
conference at Hotel Dieu hospital.

Laser Inventor Celebrates 40th Anniversary of Scientific
Breakthrough
</P>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- In less time than it takes to
blink an eye Ted Maiman changed the world.
</P>
<P>
   Forty years ago Maiman built the world's first laser -- a
''ridiculously simple'' contraption that forever burned his name
into scientific history.
</P>
<P>
   The laser pulse that lasted just one-thousandth of a second led
to medical marvels, weapons of war and even compact discs.
</P>
<P>
   But the discovery on May 16, 1960 didn't come easy.
</P>
<P>
   Maiman's bosses at Hughes Research Laboratories in Malibu,
Calif., had their doubts and wanted to cut funding but he built it
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Today Maiman, who moved to Vancouver with his wife Kathleen and
plans to seek permanent residency, has written a book that he hopes
to release in July.

Unknown Soldier Coming Home Amid Solemn Ceremony
</P>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- A soldier who lost both his life and his identity
on some ghastly First World War battlefield is coming home, to lie
forever as a symbol of Canada's war losses.
</P>
<P>
   A nameless body, one of thousands of unidentified Canadians from
two world wars, was exhumed from a cemetery near Vimy Ridge in
France on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   They placed him in a coffin fashioned from silver maple, draped
in the Maple Leaf flag that he never knew to await the Canadian
Forces transport jet that will fly him home on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   This Unknown Soldier will lie in state in the Hall of Honor of
the Parliament Buildings for three days, before being buried with
military honors and solemn ceremony at the foot of the National War
Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Soil from each of the provinces and territories will be mingled
with soil from France and scattered across the bottom of the
hand-hewn granite sarcophagus before the coffin is lowered, so that
whoever this man was, wherever he was from, he will forever rest on
his native soil and that of the land where he fought and died.

<HEADLINE> Haiti Votes in Legislative Elections  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE FAUL
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- Braving threats of violence,
Haitians lined up by the thousands Sunday for a vote to restore
democracy and in the process free a half-billion dollars in
desperately needed foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   The Haitians' strong determination to vote -- not seen since 1990
elections brought Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power in Haiti's first
democratic vote -- were frustrated by hours-long delays.
</P>
<P>
   The elections would restore a working legislature after
President Rene Preval disbanded Parliament in 1999 and appointed a
new premier by decree. The polls -- postponed at least four times --
would also free $500 million in desperately needed foreign aid that
is on hold until their country is legally governed.
</P>
<P>
   Electoral Council spokesman Roland Sainristil said turnout was
about 60 percent even though about 20 percent of stations were
unable to open. In the fraud-plagued 1997 elections, only an
estimated 5 percent of voters cast ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Electoral Council President Leon Manus said workers would count
ballots by candlelight Sunday because much of the country lacks
electricity. Vote tallies were not expected until Monday at the
earliest, and final results were not expected until late this week.
</P>
<P>
   International observers said Sunday night they were pleased with
the turnout, though they had no immediate comment on the fairness
of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, more than 100 disgruntled voters protested over delays
in the seaside shantytown of Cite Soleil, briefly closing some
polling booths. Another group, angry that some voting stations had
not opened by 4 p.m., set tires ablaze in a failed attempt to block
a road in suburban Delmas.
</P>
<P>
   Police restored order without incident.
</P>
<P>
   Electoral officials said Sunday that security concerns delayed
distribution of voters' rolls and ballot papers. But chief
opposition leader Gerard Pierre-Charles condemned the delays as
''sabotage.'' He also charged that opposition monitors were being
kept out of polling stations. ''This will lead to fraud,'' he
warned.
</P>
<P>
   Aristide, still by far the most popular politician in Haiti,
said: ''I have just voted for peace: peace of mind, peace in the
belly.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Galaxy Radio, a policeman was shot and killed just
west of the capital in Croix de Bouquet by supporters of a minor
party candidate who was arrested on charges of election fraud. The
candidate, Jean Villard, was subsequently released, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning was marred by at least 15 politically related
slayings since March 27, arson attacks on opposition offices and
rumors that violence would erupt at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were scared,'' said voter Micheline Blaise. ''But we
overcame our fears. We have to vote because we have to have change
in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking safety in numbers, the unemployed 50-year-old mother of
two came with a group of friends to join more than 100 voters lined
up along a stinking drain running with sewage in Cite Soleil, where
500,000 people live beside pigs and goats rooting in garbage.
</P>
<P>
   Most opposition parties accuse Aristide's governing Lavalas
Family party of violent intimidation and plotting fraud. Most
pre-election violence was committed by Lavalas supporters, though
the party denies involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, there was a small explosion at Aristide's
midtown center for homeless people, but no one was hurt. The
premier has blamed a grenade explosion at the gate of the Electoral
Council office on the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   All opposition parties boycotted elections on Gonave Island, in
Port-au-Prince Bay, charging that polling stations were staffed
solely by Aristide followers.
</P>
<P>
   Aristide was constitutionally barred from serving consecutive
terms and hand-picked his successor, Rene Preval. But few doubt
that Aristide, a former slum priest whose fiery rhetoric helped
inspire the overthrow of the 29-year Duvalier dictatorship in 1986,
will win presidential elections planned for November.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's election would test whether his popularity can carry
lesser-known candidates and produce a Parliament of Lavalas
loyalists.
</P>
<P>
   ''Aristide is going to give us jobs,'' said Wilbert Genty, an
unemployed 23-year-old. ''Aristide is our father. The people he
told us to vote for can only be good people.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 29,490 candidates are contesting 7,625 posts. Some 11,238
polling places were named, though some did not open, many were not
well identified, and people had trouble finding out where to cast
ballots. Runoff elections are scheduled June 25 for legislative
contests where no candidate wins more than 50 percent of votes.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, election officials postponed voting by 200,000
people in southern Grand Anse district, citing ''technical
difficulties.''
</P>
<P>
   An international coalition of nine observer groups said it
believed some 25 percent of the electorate has been
disenfranchised. It questioned the Electoral Council's claim that 4
million of Haiti's 8 million people had participated in a typically
chaotic registration process.

<HEADLINE> Heat Blame Officiating for Loss  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN WINE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- There were plenty of reasons for the Miami Heat's
latest meltdown against the New York Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Jamal Mashburn shot 3-for-15. The Heat missed their first five
free throws in the fourth quarter and finished 11-for-21 at the
line. Miami blew a six-point lead with less than five minutes to
go. And when the season hung in the balance in the final seconds,
reserve forward Clarence Weatherspoon took the last shot.
</P>
<P>
   So why did New York win the series? The Heat blamed the referees
-- for a controversial call at the end, a disparity in free throws
and even the disputed foul that helped the Knicks pull out Game 6.
</P>
<P>
   ''They had three officials in their pocket,'' Mashburn said.
''You can print that. I don't care if I get fined or not.''
</P>
<P>
   New York's 83-82 victory Sunday in Game 7 eliminated Miami from
the playoffs in a winner-take-all game for the third year in a row.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999 the Heat's season ended when Allan Houston's last-second
shot bounced the Knicks' way. This season ended with Mashburn
chasing after referees Dick Bavetta, Dan Crawford and Bennett
Salvatore and shouting insults as they left the court.
</P>
<P>
   ''They gave me the little smirk that they always do,'' Mashburn
said. ''They said something about a good game. Yeah, it's a great
game if you're watching and officiating and doing what you've got
to do.
</P>
<P>
   ''No blame to them. We had chances to win the thing. But they
were terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   The Heat were most upset about a ruling with 2.1 seconds left.
When Weatherspoon missed a 14-footer, the Knicks' Latrell Sprewell
grabbed the rebound, then stumbled out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   After discussing the play with his colleagues, Salvatore ruled
the Knicks had called a timeout when Sprewell had the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had Sprewell calling time out, but I wasn't sure where his
foot was,'' Salvatore said. ''I didn't believe he was out of
bounds, but I wanted to check with my partner to make sure he was
not out of bounds when my whistle blew. He confirmed that there was
no question that the timeout came before he went out of bounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Only one problem: Sprewell said he didn't call a timeout.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know who called time out,'' Sprewell said. ''I thought
they gave me the foul. (The Heat) were pushing me out of bounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Heat center Alonzo Mourning said Bennett initially signaled
possession to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ''Then he huddled up with his colleagues and changed his call,''
Mourning said. ''(Sprewell) didn't call time out. He stepped out of
bounds.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks took possession at midcourt and ran out the clock for
the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Miami was still stewing about a ticky-tack reach-in foul against
Dan Majerle with 17 seconds left in Game 6 that allowed Patrick
Ewing to make the winning free throws. And the Heat were unhappy
about being whistled for 24 fouls Sunday to 19 for New York. The
Knicks shot 10 more free throws, making 28 of 31.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have the disparity as much as we were attacking and going
to the basket,'' Heat coach Pat Riley said. ''It's hard to lose
that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Miami guard Tim Hardaway: ''I see why they call Dick
Bavetta 'Knick' Bavetta -- because he called seven straight calls
down on their end.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the Heat had several chances to take the lead after
Ewing scored the game's final points on a dunk with 1:20 left.
</P>
<P>
   Mashburn was short on a 12-footer with 1:01 to go, but he
stripped Chris Childs to get the ball back. Hardaway missed the rim
on an eight-footer, but the scramble for the rebound ended with a
jump ball, and the Heat kept possession with 12.4 seconds to go.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the final play of Miami's season. Mashburn caught a
pass at the top of the key and quickly tossed the ball to
Weatherspoon, a poor outside shooter.
</P>
<P>
   ''I expected Spoon to swing it back,'' Mashburn said. ''I knew
there was a lot of time left.''
</P>
<P>
   But Weatherspoon instead started to drive, pulled up and shot a
12-footer over Marcus Camby. The ball bounced off the bracket to
Sprewell.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had a good look,'' Weatherspoon said. ''What can I say?''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his teammates, Weatherspoon declined to comment on the
officiating.

   WILKES-BARRE, Pa. (AP) -- A trail of emergency vehicles and four-wheel drive
trucks climbed winding roads through the mist-shrouded Pocono Mountains to reach
the site of a commuter plane crash today. The twin-engine commuter plane with 19
on board went down nearly 2 miles into the dense forest known for its smoky
weather conditions and treasured by hunters for its remoteness. State police
arrived first on the scene and found the plane shattered and engulfed in flames.
Officials said there was no sign of survivors.

<HEADLINE> Chris Childs Carries Knicks to Win  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LONG
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- With their season on the line and their shots off
the mark, the New York Knicks stayed alive thanks to oft-maligned
Chris Childs.
</P>
<P>
   Childs, who splits time at the point guard position with Charlie
Ward, became an unlikely hero Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Childs scored 15 points, 10 in the fourth quarter, to help lead
the Knicks to an 83-82 victory, their third straight playoff series
win over the Miami Heat and into their second consecutive Eastern
Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   Childs played the entire fourth quarter and almost
singlehandedly kept the Knicks in the game. He scored 13 straight
points for New York, starting with a 3-pointer in the final minute
of the third quarter and the first 10 points in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   In the final quarter he hit three crucial baskets and made four
of five free throws.
</P>
<P>
   ''He just did everything for us,'' Knicks center Patrick Ewing
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was huge,'' forward Kurt Thomas added.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 71-65 with about 10 minutes to play, Childs stepped in
front a poor pass from Jamal Mashburn and turned it into a
three-point play on the other end. He added a driving layup, a
17-foot jump shot and three more free throws in the next five
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't carry the Knicks into the lead, but he didn't let the
game slip away, either. It easily could have.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're always looking for someone to step up, and today he did
that,'' Ward said.
</P>
<P>
   In four seasons with the Knicks, Childs has gone from a reserve
to a starter and back to a reserve. He's been criticized, chastised
and condemned in the toughest sports market in the country.
</P>
<P>
   He's endured it all -- often without a whimper. He never
complained about New York's two point guard system. He's never
bickered about coming off the bench. And he's never argued over
playing time.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's been through too much to lose his confidence,'' Ward
said. ''He played big for us. That's what we needed. Everyone's not
going to click on all cylinders every night. That's why we're a
team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks spent much of the game settling for 3-pointers. They
were 3-for-13 from beyond the arc through three quarters. Childs
ended that. He continued to penetrate into the lane, but stopped
kicking it out to an open jump shooter.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to attack the basket,'' Childs said. ''I wasn't
trying to create things for myself, I was just trying to get the
best shot that would keep us in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Mission accomplished. Childs, who guaranteed a victory before
Game 6 in New York, got exactly what he wanted. Again.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's incredible,'' Knicks guard Allan Houston said. ''Whatever
the difference ... there were a lot of factors. But today, Chris
Childs was a big factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Childs also had three rebounds, two assists and a steal. His
only blemish of the game came in the waning seconds when he had the
ball knocked out of his hands by Mashburn.
</P>
<P>
   Miami failed to convert the turnover into points, though, and
Childs redeemed himself by getting open with 2.1 seconds remaining.
He took the inbounds pass and threw it as high as he could into the
arena as the clock expired.
</P>
<P>
   It was his brief moment of celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ''We finally won two games in a row; now let's make it three,''
Childs said.

<HEADLINE> British Officer's Laptop Recovered  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- A British tabloid has recovered a stolen military
laptop believed to contain details of a fighter plane being
developed jointly by the United States and Britain, authorities
confirmed Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Mirror, which returned the computer to the Ministry of
Defense, reportedly recovered the laptop in a sting operation after
being contacted by an unidentified computer specialist who was
given the computer and asked to delete ''fighter plane stuff'' from
its memory. The computer expert saw that the information was
sensitive and contacted the tabloid.
</P>
<P>
   The Mirror said in its Monday edition that it secretly switched
the stolen computer for another and handed it over to authorities
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   A Ministry of Defense spokesman, who spoke on condition his name
not be used, confirmed that the computer had been returned and said
an investigation into its disappearance was ongoing.
</P>
<P>
   A laptop containing training information for MI6, the spy agency
responsible for foreign intelligence, was mislaid by an
intelligence officer in early March and recovered by police two
weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   The same month, a second laptop with classified material on
Northern Ireland was snatched from a MI5 security service officer
at London's Paddington Station when the officer put it down to buy
a train ticket. It has not been found.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest incident, a naval officer lost his computer and
his personal luggage after boarding a train at Paddington station
in early May, a spokesman for the ministry of defense confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   The computer, worth about $3,000, did not contain classified
information, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   But a report in The Sunday Times said the computer held
specifications for the next generation of fighter aircraft and
details of how they can be controlled from the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper, quoting unnamed sources, said a thief trailed the
military officer into the station before snatching the computer.
The thief sold the computer to a dealer, who in turn tried to sell
the contents for $23,000 to a newspaper, The Times said.

<HEADLINE> Notes From Sunday's Baseball Games  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated PressAMERICAN LEAGUE:
Yankees-Indians:
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK: Since opening the season 4-0, Orlando Hernandez is
winless since April 23 and has four losses and a no-decision in his
last five starts. The Yankees haven't helped the right-hander,
scoring just six runs in his last three outings. ''Our batters not
hitting is not my problem,'' El Duque said through an interpreter.
''My problem is to try and pitch well. I can't worry about what our
batters do. They tried hard, but they can't always do it.'' ... 2B
Chuck Knoblauch injured his left wrist tagging out Kenny Lofton on
a steal attempt in the first inning. ''It got a little puffy,''
said Yankees manager Joe Torre. ''Hopefully, he'll ice it and be
OK. He was unable to swing the bat at the end.'' Knoblauch missed
nine games earlier this season when he sprained the same wrist.
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND: Enrique Wilson's dash home for an inside-the-park
homer on Sunday was similar to the run he scored in Game 2 of the
1998 ALCS against the Yankees. In the 12th inning of that game,
Wilson came all the way around from first while Yankees second
baseman Chuck Knoblauch argued for interference at first. ''I'm
glad I was the DH today,'' Wilson said. ''I was out of gas.'' ...
Third-base coach Jim Riggleman said he didn't account for
Knoblauch's throwing problems when he waved Wilson around for the
third inside-the-parker in Jacobs Field history. Wilson, though,
said Knoblauch's arm was a factor. ''I don't think if it was
anybody else they would have sent me,'' Wilson said. ''He's got arm
problems.'' ... Paul Rigdon is the first Indians pitcher to throw
seven shutout innings in his major league debut since Rod Nichols
did it against Minnesota on July 30, 1988, vs. Minnesota.
White Sox-Blue Jays:
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: Cal Eldred is 4-2 with a 2.49 ERA in his last six
starts. ... The White Sox have won seven straight at SkyDome. ...
Chicago is 4-1 on their road trip.
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO: The Blue Jays are 1-5 on their current homestand. ...
The Blue Jays have lost a season-high four straight games. ...
Thirteen of Carlos Delgado's 14 home runs have come at SkyDome. ...
The Blue Jays had their first one-hitter since Sept. 27, 1998, when
Roy Halladay lost his no-hit bid on Bobby Higginson's two out homer
in the ninth.
Tigers-Red Sox:
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT: Reliever Matt Anderson has not allowed a run since
April 21 at Chicago. In that time, he has worked 9 2-3 innings and
allowed six hits. ... Sunday starter Hideo Nomo leads the American
League with eight wild pitches.
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON: The Red Sox are 2-10 this season when they trail through
six innings. ... OF Trot Nixon has 12 multi-hit games in 2000. He
had 20 last season.
Orioles-Rangers:
</P>
<P>
   BALTIMORE: Entering Sunday night's game against the Rangers, the
Orioles had allowed 30 homers in 17 games in May. Baltimore has
allowed at least one homer in 15 of the 17 games this month. ...
Heading into Sunday night, Orioles starters were 1-9 with a 6.12
ERA in May. Baltimore starters were 8-5 with a 5.06 ERA in April.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS: LHP Kenny Rogers, bothered by a sore left shoulder and a
swollen eye, successfully completed a throwing session before
Sunday night's game and is scheduled to start Wednesday night at
Oakland. Rogers missed two starts because of the sore shoulder. ...
Rangers left fielder Rusty Greer is expected to remain on the
disabled list until his wife, Lauri, gives birth to twins. Lauri
Greer is due to give birth soon and Greer would be given time off
to be with her during the delivery, so the Rangers will delay
activating him. Greer has been on the 15-day disabled list since
April 15 due to ankle and hamstring injuries.
Royals-Angels:
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY: RF Jermaine Dye, the AL's player of the month for
April, was kept out of the lineup after bruising his right kneecap
making a catch in Saturday night's game. But the swelling had
decreased in Dye's knee, and he was available to pinch-hit Sunday
against Anaheim. ... Carlos Febles took batting practice for the
first time since leaving Wednesday's game in Oakland with a sore
left wrist. Febles, fourth in the league with 11 steals, may return
to the lineup Tuesday, when the Royals open a homestand against
Texas. ... Second baseman Jeff Reboulet took an odd batting line
into Sunday's game: He was hitting .423 in 26 at-bats, but with no
RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ANAHEIM: After totaling only 74 home runs at home all last
season, the Angels had hit 48 through 27 games going into Sunday's
game against the Royals. ... Manager Mike Scioscia gave catcher
Bengie Molina, 12-for-23 during a seven-game hitting streak, a rest
Sunday to give backup Matt Walbeck a start.
Twins-Athletics:
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA: Denny Hocking sat out Sunday's 13-4 loss to Oakland.
He was scratched from the lineup prior to the game and listed as
day to day because of a strained left hip flexor. Hocking had
tormented the A's, going 9-for-13 with four RBIs in three previous
games. Hocking said he hurt his hip Friday night sliding into a
base and aggravated the injury attempting to steal on Saturday. ''I
don't think it's anything major. Hopefully, I'll be able to go in a
couple of days.'' ... Twins pitcher Sean Bergman has been caught in
a downward spiral. He was the loser in Minnesota's 13-4 loss at
Oakland on Sunday. In his last three starts, he has given up 25
runs in 11 innings, posting a 20.45 ERA and raising his season ERA
to 9.93. ... During Oakland's prolonged eight-run second inning,
A's pitcher Tim Hudson left the dugout and began throwing warmup
pitches from the bullpen. That drew a protest from Minnesota
manager Tom Kelly. Crew chief Terry Craft, who was at third base
for the game, told Kelly there was no rule against it. ''We've had
so many changes in the rules since we've merged, my colleagues felt
that rule had been done away with. I told Tom, 'I'm not positive
about the rule but I'm going to allow it.''' Craft said a post-game
check of the rules showed Hudson between-inning warmup was legal in
the AL but not in the NL. Craft said he'll seek a clarification
from the commissioner's office.
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND: The A's 13-4 win Sunday over Minnesota gave Oakland a
5-6 record during their longest homestand of the year. The A's now
head to Tampa Bay, where they'll start a nine-game, 10-day road
trip. ... Ryan Christenson's eighth-inning inside-the-park homer
came in his first at-bat since May 12. He lined a drive into the
right field corner that shot past Minnesota rookie Brian Buchanan,
who had difficulty running it down. ''There were some cups and
stuff down there,'' Buchanan said. ''I reached down to try to get
it and I kind of slipped on this grate and fell. The ball hit the
wall and kicked away from me. It just kept rolling and he's pretty
fast.'' Said Christenson: ''It was pretty exciting sprinting around
the bases. It reminded me of my first home run.'' Christenson, a
backup outfielder for Oakland, took plenty of ribbing from
teammates for sprinting rather than trotting around the bases when
he hit his first big league homer April 28, 1998, at Tampa Bay.
Devil Rays-Mariners:
</P>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY: Gerald Williams has hit safely in 16 of his last 17
games. ... Ozzie Guillen played first base in the eighth inning of
Sunday's game, just the second appearance at first in his career.
... Steve Trachsel last 3 2-3 innings on Sunday, his shortest
outing since Oct. 3, 1999, against St. Louis when he was with the
Cubs and lasted just 3 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE: Edgar Martinez is hitting .361 (140-for-388) since the
1999 All-Star break. ... During Alex Rodriguez's 16-game hitting
streak, he is 26-of-63 (.413) with seven homers and 18 RBIs. ...
John Olerud, has reached base in eight consecutive at-bats. The
Mariners record is 11, set by Ken griffey Jr. on April 23-27, 1989.
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Reds-Cubs:
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI: Ken Griffey Jr. leads the majors with 41 walks in 44
games. He is on pace to break the Reds' club record of 132 set by
Joe Morgan in 1975. ... Pitcher Ron Villone on the way the Reds are
a big attraction for opposing teams and fans: ''The fans are
screaming and hollering as soon as we get to the park. Maybe it's
the Junior factor.'' ... The Reds had their streak of winning
series stopped at four as Chicago won two of three at Wrigley
Field. Cincinnati has still captured eight of their last 11 series.
... After a three-game series in Los Angeles, the Reds return to
Cinergy Field for a 13-day, 12-game homestand, their longest of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: Don Baylor will return to Coors Field as an opposing
manager for the first time this week when the Cubs play the
Rockies. ''Special? Slightly,'' Baylor said of his return. He was
there last year with Atlanta when he was the Braves' hitting coach.
''I have a lot of memories there,'' Baylor said. ''I have moved on
with my thoughts and hopefully I know how to pitch and defend in
that park.'' .... Henry Rodriguez, sidelined since fouling a ball
off his knee Tuesday, returned to the Cubs' lineup. He has been the
subject of trade rumors with Yankees scout Gene Michael in town for
the three-game series. ''Whatever happens, it happens,'' Rodriguez
said before going 0-for-3 Sunday. ... After the game, the Cubs
placed 3B Shane Andrews on the disabled list with a bad back
retroactive to May 15. They called up outfielder Raul Gonzalez from
Triple-A Iowa. Andrews had 10 homers and 27 RBIs but was hitting
just .212. Gonzalez was batting .266 with four homers in the
minors.
Astros-Expos:
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: Astros starter Jose Lima allowed two homers and
reliever Billy Wagner allowed another in Sunday's 8-3 loss to the
Expos. Houston has allowed 70 homers, including a major league-high
19 off Lima. ... Astros second baseman Craig Biggio returned to the
lineup despite a heavily bandaged right hand. Biggio, who went
0-for-4, left Saturday night's 8-7 loss after he was accidentally
spiked by Jose Vidro after he stole second in the first inning. ...
With two hits in 14 at-bats through the first three games of this
road trip and a doubleheader in Milwaukee looming on Monday, 1B
Jeff Bagwell was given the day off. Daryle Ward, who replaced
Bagwell at first base, hit a two-run homer off Montreal starter
Javier Vazquez in the fourth for his ninth home run.
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL: A crowd of 20,111 was on hand for the game as the
Expos finished 8-4 on their homestand. The Expos drew a total of
47,956 for the three-game weekend series. Montreal had not swept
Houston in a three-game series since Aug. 8-10, 1995, at the
Astrodome. ... Expos closer Ugueth Urbina, who had a bone chip
surgically removed from his right elbow last Wednesday, will have
his elbow examined by Dr. James Andrews on Monday. ... LHP Steve
Kline relieved after Javier Vazquez allowed Richard Hidalgo's
leadoff homer in the ninth. Kline got the last three outs to extend
his career-best scoreless streak to 15 innings. He hasn't allowed a
run since April 25, a span of 15 appearances. ... Four Expos have
34 RBIs or more. Vladimir Guerrero leads the team with 39, followed
by Lee Stevens (36), Rondell White (35), and Jose Vidro (34).
Rockies-Phillies:
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO: The Rockies will begin a nine-game home stand on
Tuesday against the Chicago Cubs. Pittsburgh and Houston will close
out the home stand. The team is 12-4 at Coors field, with a .750
winning percentage that is tops in the NL. ... Tuesday's starter
Rolando Arrojo has lost his last four decisions. ... Bubba
Carpenter made his first major league start on Sunday in left
field. The 31-year-old hit 22 homers at Triple-A Columbus last
season and slugged a pinch-hit homer on Tuesday against the New
York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: A top pitching prospect, Brad Baisley, the club's
No. 2 pick in the 1998 draft, made an appearance in Philadelphia to
have his right elbow checked by team Dr. Michael Ciccotti on
Sunday. Ciccotti said the checkup was just precautionary and there
was no injury. Baisley will go back to Class A Clearwater and rest
the elbow for several days. He is 3-3 with a 2.85 ERA in seven
games, including six starts. ... There has been speculation that
the Phillies will bring up top prospect Pat Burrell within the next
few days. Burrell, the club's No. 1 pick in the 1998 draft, will
likely play first base. ... The Phillies begin a nine-game road
trip on Tuesday at Houston. Randy Wolf will make the start. The
left-hander has already made history at Enron Field when he became
the park's first winning pitcher on April 7.
Dodgers-Marlins:
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: The Marlins announced Sunday that pitcher Ricky Bones
was activated from the 15-day disabled list. Bones got some work
Sunday and pitched two scoreless innings. He has now allowed just
one run in 22 1-3 innings. ....Alex Fernandez, who was placed on
the disabled list Friday night, will do nothing physically for two
weeks, and the feeling is that he won't return for a month. With
Fernandez on the DL and starter Brad Penny experiencing back
spasms, the Marlins announced Sunday that they will add Reid
Cornelius to the roster on Thursday to start that night against the
Cardinals. Cornelius will be recalled from Triple-A Calgary, where
he is 2-2 with a 4.57 ERA. Penny, initially scheduled to start
Thursday, was examined Sunday by a neurologist, but manager John
Boles said ''he is fine and it is strictly back spasms.'' Penny's
start will be pushed back to Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: Prior to Sunday's game, the Dodgers reinstated
Kevin Elster from the disabled list and optioned shortstop Alex
Cora to Triple-A Albuquerque. Cora hit .297 (11-for-37) in his nine
games with the Dodgers and returns to Albuquerque, where he was
leading the PCL with a .394 batting average. Said Elster:
''Physically I felt fine, but I was a little bit out of sorts.''...
Reliever Trever Miller, claimed on waivers from the Phillies
Friday, will join his new teammates Monday in Los Angeles.
Cardinals-Pirates:
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS: Mark McGwire's first-inning home run into the
third-level private boxes in left-center field was estimated at 444
feet. In his final at-bat Saturday, he hit a drive off the top of
the center field wall for a three-run double, barely missing a
grand slam. ... The Cardinals have won five of seven. ... 2B
Placido Polanco is batting .439 (18-for-41) in his 10 starts. He
was 3-for-5 with three RBIs Sunday as Fernando Vina took the day
off after fouling a ball off his right shin Saturday. ... McGwire
is averaging a homer once every 5.6 at-bats. ... McGwire has
homered the last three times he skipped batting practice. Manager
Tony La Russa said, ''It seems like he's fresher, but he also hits
them when he does take it.''
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: C Keith Osik, who pitched the ninth inning of the
19-4 loss to St. Louis on Saturday, has the Pirates' highest
batting average (.500) and highest ERA (45.00). ... Opposing
batters were hitting .429 against right-handed reliever Mike
Garcia, who was optioned to Triple-A Nashville after Sunday's game.
... The Pirates gave away three bicycles Sunday in recognition of C
Jason Kendall becoming the first Pirates player to hit for the
cycle in Three Rivers Stadium, which opened in 1970. ... Brian
Giles is batting .356 with eight homers and 29 RBIs since moving
into the cleanup spot. ... Kevin Young, who didn't start Sunday, is
6-for-35 (.171) since his average peaked at .275 on May 10. His
average now is .252. ... RHP Rich Loiselle, who hasn't pitched in
the majors since May 7, 1999, was activated off the 60-day disabled
list and will be used as a middle reliever. He had reconstructive
elbow surgery in July.
Diamondbacks-Mets:
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA: Steve Finley was 3-for-4 with an RBI single in the
first, a run-scoring groundout in the third and a home run in the
eighth. He raised his average to .327. ... Tony Womack extended his
hitting streak to a career-high 17 games with a third-inning
single. ... Arizona had its first losing road trip since last
season, going 3-6. The Diamondbacks start a 10-game homestand
Tuesday against Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: Robin Ventura's eighth-inning homer off Mike Morgan
was only the second in 71 at-bats for Mets pinch hitters this year.
... Before the three-game sweep, New York had lost six of seven to
Arizona in regular-season play. The Mets won 3-1 in the first round
of last year's NL playoffs. ... New York has 10 come-from-behind
wins and is 11-4 in one-run games. ... The Mets also hit four
homers April 30 against Colorado. ... Mike Hampton (tightness in
upper back) should be ready for his next scheduled start, and John
Franco and Pat Mahomes (sprained ankles) should be ready to pitch
within a few days). ... Before walking in the ninth inning, Joe
McEwing has been 0-for-4 in his career against Byung-Hyung Kim,
striking out in all four plate appearances
Padres-Braves:
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO: The Padres missed a chance to have their first
winning road trip of the year, finishing 3-3 after losing two of
three at Turner Field. San Diego, which won two games at Florida
last week, hasn't claimed back-to-back series victories all season.
However, the Padres have won three series on the road after
accomplishing that feat only five times all of last season. ... San
Diego hasn't won a series at Turner Field since sweeping a two-game
set on June 2-3, 1997. ... The Padres headed home to play 17 of
their next 23 games at Qualcomm Stadium. ... Carlos Hernandez's
pinch-hit homer Saturday night was his first long ball since Sept.
16, 1998. He sat out last season with a ruptured Achilles tendon
and had gone 101 at-bats since his last homer.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: Injured P John Smoltz made his debut as a broadcaster,
working three innings apiece with Pete Van Wieren, Joe Simpson and
Don Sutton on TBS. Smoltz, out for the season after elbow surgery
in spring training, filled in for Skip Caray, who attended the high
school graduation of his son Josh. ... Manager Bobby Cox celebrated
his 59th birthday with his 1,551st victory. He's 21 wins away from
passing Dick Williams for 15th place on the career list.
Giants-Brewers:
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO: In losing eight straight prior to Sunday, the
Giants scored 46 runs, an average of 5.8 per game.
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: Jeff D'Amico, who missed most of two seasons because
of shoulder injuries, has made quite an impression in his three
starts since being called up from Triple-A Indianapolis. He's 2-1
with a 0.43 ERA after pitching seven shutout innings in Saturday's
7-0 victory over the Giants. ''It's definitely exciting,'' said
D'Amico, who generally is considered the team's most laid back
player. ''I guess stress sees him and runs away,'' manager Davey
Lopes said. ''He's very reserved, to put it mildly, but he does get
excited. He may not express it, but I guarantee he's excited.'' ...
Geoff Jenkins, who broke the middle finger of his right hand on May
5, is anxious to play. He hopes to be in the lineup next weekend
when the Brewers start a their road trip in Arizona.

<HEADLINE> Plane With 19 Aboard Crashes in Pa.  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER NEWTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILKES-BARRE, Pa. (AP) -- A commuter plane carrying 19 people
home from a gambling trip to Atlantic City, N.J., crashed in a ball
of fire after experiencing engine problems while trying to land
Sunday. There was no sign of survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Fiery wreckage was spotted in some woods about 9 miles south of
the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport in northeastern
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared that both of the chartered turbo prop's engines
failed, said Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Tammy
Jones.
</P>
<P>
   The plane missed its first landing approach and crashed on its
second attempt, said George Black of the National Transportation
Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is some indication on the air traffic control tapes that
they were encountering engine problems during the first approach
and those continued into the second attempt,'' Black said at a news
conference in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators were reviewing a transcript from air traffic
controllers who spoke with the crew before the plane crashed.
</P>
<P>
   On a portion of the tape aired by ABC News, one pilot can be
heard saying ''tell him we lost both engines.'' The other pilot
replies: ''We lost both engines, six echo Juliet.'' The plane's
cockpit voice recorder was recovered from the crash site, Black
said.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, a 1988 BA-31 Jetstream that carried 17 passengers and
two crew members, crashed about two miles into the woods in light
rain and fog. ''Apparently there isn't much left in one piece,''
said Al Bardar, director for emergency management for Luzerne
County. ''It doesn't look like anyone survived.''
</P>
<P>
   About 50 relatives and friends of the victims gathered at the
airport to wait for news. Hours after the crash, authorities had
still not confirmed any deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Margy Milewski said she had three family members on the plane.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just can't believe this happened. When are we going to get
some definite answers?'' Milewski tearfully pleaded with
authorities. ''I don't want to wait at the airport anymore, and if
there aren't any survivors we should be told.''
</P>
<P>
   The victims had left at 5 p.m. Saturday on a flight chartered by
Caesars Atlantic City Hotel Casino, said Wy A. Gowell, the
airport's assistant director. They were to return at 1:15 a.m. but
fog kept the plane grounded in Farmingdale, N.Y., said Peter Hartt,
spokesman for the South Jersey Transportation Authority.
</P>
<P>
   With the flight delayed, the victims spent the night at the
casino. The plane left Atlantic City at about 10:30 a.m. Sunday and
was scheduled to land in Wilkes-Barre an hour later, Hartt said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the plane was operated by Executive Airlines of
Farmingdale, N.Y. Executive Airlines officials declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The plane disappeared from radar about 11:40 a.m. during a
second instrument approach, typically performed if the visibility
is poor or if there is a low cloud deck.
</P>
<P>
   Megan Maguire was outside gardening at her home near the airport
on the northern rim of the Pocono Mountains shortly before noon
when she heard a plane apparently having problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard the engines die, then I heard them start up again, and
then they just died. I heard it rev up twice, so it died twice,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Black, of the NTSB, said the BA-31 Jetstream does not have a
history of problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a lot of them in operation,'' he said. ''It's a very
common short haul (plane).''
</P>
<P>
   There were three crashes of similar model airplanes in the
1990s, the last coming in December 1994 at the Raleigh-Durham
International Airport in North Carolino, killing 15 of 20 people
aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's crash appeared to be the worst in Pennsylvania since
1994, when a USAir 737 crashed near Pittsburgh, killing all 132
people aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkes-Barre is 150 miles northwest of Atlantic City, N.J.

<HEADLINE> Triple Crown Winning Jockey Returns  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Steve Cauthen's mount didn't win the race,
but by taking to the track again in the High Hope Steeplechase, he
accomplished what he had set out to do.
</P>
<P>
   ''I did it for my girls, and I hope they liked it,'' Cauthen,
the last jockey to win the Triple Crown, said after finishing
eighth aboard Flyfisher in the Sportsman's Challenge at the
Kentucky Horse Park on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Cauthen hadn't ridden competitively in more than seven years --
which meant that his daughters, 7-year-old Katelyn and 4-year-old
Karlie, had never seen him race. Cauthen figured the two-mile
amateur turf race, which was to benefit Central Kentucky Riding for
the Handicapped and the Kentucky Horse Park Foundation, would be
their only chance.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think I'm really retired now,'' he said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   The Sportsman's Challenge was won by Hoh Steamer, ridden by Tony
Hedges. Hoh Steamer left everyone behind from the beginning,
winning by 20 lengths. Broad Jumper, with Fergus Galvin up, was
second, and Gary Marsh rode Frankies Oyster to a third-place
finish.
</P>
<P>
   Hedges said he had been nervous about racing against Cauthen.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was a little bit worried because I knew he was better than
me, but you've got to have the right horse, and he didn't have it
today,'' Hedges said.
</P>
<P>
   Cauthen was 18 when he became the youngest jockey to win the
Triple Crown, aboard Affirmed in 1978. Over the next 15 years, he
established himself as a champion rider. A two-time Eclipse Award
winner, he left the United States to ride in Europe in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   He retired in 1993 with just under 3,000 victories and was
inducted into horse racing's Hall of Fame the following year. Now
40, Cauthen remains the only jockey to win all three American
classics -- the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness and the Belmont Stakes
-- and all three English classics -- the Two Thousand Guineas, the
Epsom Derby and the St. Leger.
</P>
<P>
   Seven horses have completed the Derby-Preakness double since
Affirmed. They all came up short in the Belmont, including Silver
Charm in 1997, Real Quiet in 1998 and Charismatic in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Cauthen owns a horse-breeding operation in northern Kentucky,
and he's part owner of a filly sired by Affirmed that was born last
spring. He also does some promotional work for nearby Turfway Park.

</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WILKES-BARRE, Pa. (AP) -- There were no sign of survivors today as a commuter
plane carrying 19 people from a gambling trip to Atlantic City, N.J., crashed in
a ball of fire after engine problems. Fiery wreckage was spotted in some woods
about 9 miles south of the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport in
northeastern Pennsylvania. It appeared that both of the chartered turbo prop's
engines failed, said Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Tammy Jones.

   LONDON (AP) -- A British tabloid has recovered a stolen military laptop
believed to contain details of a fighter plane being developed jointly by the
United States and Britain, authorities confirmed Sunday. The Mirror, which
returned the computer to the Ministry of Defense, reportedly recovered the
laptop in a sting operation after being contacted by an unidentified computer
specialist who was given the computer and asked to delete ''fighter plane
stuff'' from its memory. The computer expert saw that the information was
sensitive and contacted the tabloid. The Mirror said in its Monday edition that
it secretly switched the stolen computer for another and handed it over to
authorities on Sunday.

   BEIJING (AP) -- China plans to form a task force to try to recover as many as
1 million valuable and sometimes looted Chinese cultural relics collected by
museums around the world, an official newspaper said Sunday. News of the planned
bureau to recover relics follows recent auctions in Hong Kong of 18th century
Chinese antiques. The auctions outraged many Chinese and Beijing demanded they
be stopped, claiming that British and French troops looted the antiques from a
Chinese palace during the second Opium War 140 years ago.

<HEADLINE> Finland's Suhonen To Coach Chicago  </HEADLINE>
By RICK GANO
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Finland's Alpo Suhonen will be hired as the
Chicago Blackhawks' coach, a move that will make him the NHL's
first European-born head coach.
</P>
<P>
   A source close to the team confirmed Sunday that the Blackhawks
had chosen Suhonen. The team has called a news conference for 11
a.m. CDT Monday.
</P>
<P>
   With the hiring, the Blackhawks will beat the Pittsburgh
Penguins in the race for the first European-born head coach. Czech
Ivan Hlinka is taking over the Penguins from Herb Brooks, but the
team has yet to make it official.
</P>
<P>
   Suhonen, 51, was an assistant in Toronto and has worked
previously with Blackhawks director of hockey operations Mike Smith
with the Maple Leafs and in Winnipeg. Suhonen is no stranger to
Chicago, having coached the International Hockey League's Chicago
Wolves in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Suhonen, who will replace the fired Lorne Molleken, is one of
the more interesting figures in hockey, mixing a love of the sport
with that of the arts and politics.
</P>
<P>
   He left hockey briefly to manage a Finnish national theater
company in 1991 and ran for one of Finland's 16 spots in the
European Parliament in 1999. He quit his job as a minor league
coach in 1997 because his girlfriend had a job opportunity in
Finland.
</P>
<P>
   Suhonen will be the Blackhawks' fifth coach since Darryl Sutter
resigned in 1995. Craig Hartsburg and Dirk Graham were fired before
the job went to Molleken. Last season, the Hawks demoted Molleken
from head to associate coach and brought back senior vice president
Bob Pulford to serve as head coach and general manager.
</P>
<P>
   The Blackhawks have failed to qualify for the playoffs three
straight years. Now they will count on a man with no head coaching
experience to get them back into the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago finished last season with a 33-39-10 record and 78
points, 11th out of 13 teams in the Western Conference.

<HEADLINE> Quigley Wins TD Waterhouse Golf  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG TUCKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Figuring he had no business beating one
of the best players in golf history, Dana Quigley did anyway.
</P>
<P>
   With the gallery of 25,000 cheering every step hometown heroes
Tom Watson and Jim Colbert took, the self-effacing Quigley rolled
in a 12-foot birdie putt on the 18th hole for a dramatic one-stroke
victory over Watson on Sunday in the TD Waterhouse Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Watson, the overwhelming crowd favorite, was waiting to tap in a
12-inch birdie putt for a final-round 63. But Quigley cooly holed
his 12-footer for a 6-under 66 and an 18-under 198 total on the
Tiffany Greens course.
</P>
<P>
   Colbert, another Kansas City native who attended Kansas State
was getting every cheer not going to Watson, shot a 71 to finish
third.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was a miracle,'' said Quigley, who hadn't won on the
Senior PGA Tour in almost two years.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tom Watson is probably one of the five greatest golfers in the
history of the sport. I didn't beat them because I'm better than
they are. I beat them because I'm blessed.''
</P>
<P>
   Colbert shot a course-record 61 in Friday's opening round and
held a two-stroke lead over Quigley and a six-stroke advantage over
Watson when the day began. But he double-bogeyed the par-4 13th
while Watson and Quigley, playing in the same threesome, both
birdied and went ahead of him.
</P>
<P>
   ''All my friends at home, my parents, my mother, my family, my
wife, my kids -- they all know I was outclassed out there,'' Quigley
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''And I know I was outclassed out there. But if you just believe
in yourself and keep grinding, good things can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The gallery behind the 18th green jumped to its feet and roared
when Watson put his 8-iron approach shot on the 420-yard 18th hole
a foot from the cup.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was just hoping it hadn't gone in,'' Quigley said. ''I knew
then that I was going to have to make my putt because I didn't want
to go back out on the golf course with Tom in a playoff.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson was playing his first tournament round in his hometown
since winning the 1971 Missouri Amateur.
</P>
<P>
   ''My hat's off to Dana Quigley,'' he said ''He hit a pure putt
at the last hole. It was an exciting week.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Watson was surprised at the intensity of the support he got
from the gallery.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now I know how Arnold Palmer feels every time he plays,''
Watson said.
</P>
<P>
   At every tee and green, people cheered, ''Go Tom, come on,
Tom,'' or ''Let's go Jim, come on, Kansas State.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Once I heard somebody yell, 'Come on, Dana,''' Colbert said.
''I pointed him out to Dana and he said, 'Yeah, that's the guy I
played with in the pro-am.'''
</P>
<P>
   Colbert, who had birdied the first eight holes of the back nine
on Friday, finished third at 15 under.
</P>
<P>
   Quigley leading Watson by two, hit his approach shot on the
par-4 17th into the bunker to the right of the green and wound up
with a bogey. But Watson missed a chance to pull even when his
8-foot birdie try slid past the hole.
</P>
<P>
   Quigley, playing in the 105th straight senior event in which he
was eligible, sank a long birdie putt on the par-5 16th hole to go
to 18 under for the tournament, two strokes ahead of Watson and
three in front of Colbert.
</P>
<P>
   Play was halted for almost 90 minutes when a rain shower moved
through the area.

<HEADLINE> Veteran Sherpa Sets Everest Record  </HEADLINE>
By BINAJ GURUBACHARYA
<TEXT>
<P>
   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) -- A Sherpa guide reached the summit of
Mount Everest in less than 16 hours on Sunday, shattering the
record for the fastest climb of the world's highest peak, the
Nepalese Tourism ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   Babu Chhiri, 34, made the climb through icy winds and rarified
air to the 29,035-foot summit Sunday morning -- a year after he set
a duration record by camping for 21 hours on the peak. His brother
Dawa had scaled the mountain earlier and waited at the summit to
welcome him, said Chhiri's business partner, who contacted the
climbers by radio.
</P>
<P>
   Chhiri, a veteran climber, reached the peak in 15 hours and 56
minutes to easily break the previous record of 20 hours and 24
minutes, set two years ago by Kaji Sherpa.
</P>
<P>
   The Sherpas, who live at the foot of the Himalayas, are known as
''Tigers of the Snows.'' Renowned for their mountaineering skills
and stamina, many work as expert guides and porters for Nepalese
tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Since the first recorded conquest of Everest in 1953 by Sir
Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay, more than 800 people have
conquered the tallest peak. Some 180 people have died on its
slopes.
</P>
<P>
   Chhiri climbed from the base camp at 17,500 feet, said the
Nepalese tourism ministry. The climb from the base camp to the
summit normally takes two to four days with breaks in between
camps, depending on the weather.
</P>
<P>
   Icy winds cut through the air as Chhiri hurried up the hard snow
to meet his elder brother. Like most Nepalese Sherpas, Chhiri
climbs without using bottled oxygen even though air pressure is
low, making breathing strenuous.
</P>
<P>
   Chhiri was scheduled to begin his journey at 4 p.m. Saturday but
he had to delay his bid by an hour, according to his business
partner, Babu, who uses only one name.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it had not been for the snow he could have done it in even
less time,'' Babu said.
</P>
<P>
   Chhiri already had climbed Everest nine times. Before leaving
for the mountain this time, Chhiri had told The Associated Press
that he wanted to scale the peak in 16 hours or less.
</P>
<P>
   During a practice run last year, he climbed from the base camp
to an intermediate camp at South Col in nine hours. ''This leaves
me with seven hours to make my final but the most difficult part of
the journey,'' he said then.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Chhiri stayed for 21 hours at the summit. Most
climbers retreat within a few minutes of scaling the peak, with its
high winds, freezing temperatures, unpredictable and rapid weather
changes and brain-starving lack of oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Sunday, two Canadians -- Byron Smith, 40, a car salesman
from Alberta, and Michael Down, 43, a mountain guide from British
Columbia -- also scaled Everest, officials said.

<HEADLINE> 19 Die in Pa. Plane Crash  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER NEWTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILKES-BARRE, Pa. (AP) -- A commuter plane carrying 19 people
home from a gambling trip to Atlantic City, N.J., crashed in a ball
of fire after experiencing engine problems while trying to land
Sunday. There were no survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Fiery wreckage was spotted in some woods about 9 miles south of
the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport in northeastern
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared that both of the chartered turbo prop's engines
failed, said Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Tammy
Jones.
</P>
<P>
   The plane missed its first landing approach and crashed on its
second attempt, said George Black of the National Transportation
Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is some indication on the air traffic control tapes that
they were encountering engine problems during the first approach
and those continued into the second attempt,'' Black said at a news
conference in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators were reviewing a transcript from air traffic
controllers who spoke with the crew before the plane crashed.
</P>
<P>
   On a portion of the tape aired by ABC News, one pilot can be
heard saying ''tell him we lost both engines.'' The other pilot
replies: ''We lost both engines, six echo Juliet.'' The plane's
cockpit voice recorder was recovered from the crash site, Black
said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 10 hours after the 11:48 a.m. crash, John Comey,
executive assistant director for the Pennsylvania Emergency
Management Agency, said everybody on board had been killed.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the family members that gathered at the airport have been
notified that no one survived the crash,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, a 1988 BA-31 Jetstream that carried 17 passengers and
two crew members, crashed about two miles into the woods in light
rain and fog. ''Apparently there isn't much left in one piece,''
said Al Bardar, director for emergency management for Luzerne
County.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 relatives and friends of the victims gathered at the
airport during the day to wait for news.
</P>
<P>
   Airport Superintendent Jim Brunozzi said his niece's
mother-in-law and father-in-law were among the victims. ''That was
tough to look at the manifest and see the names,'' Brunozzi said.
''We were a close family. It's sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony J. Giannone, airport ground superintendent, had to
console a friend whose wife was on the plane.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's got two small kids, and he had to leave here to tell
them,'' Giannone said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a small, close community, and that's what I think makes
it so hard,'' said Lackawanna County Commissioner Randy Castellani,
who arrived soon after the crash.
</P>
<P>
   The victims had left at 5 p.m. Saturday on a flight chartered by
Caesars Atlantic City Hotel Casino, said Wy A. Gowell, the
airport's assistant director. They were to return at 1:15 a.m. but
fog kept the plane grounded in Farmingdale, N.Y., said Peter Hartt,
spokesman for the South Jersey Transportation Authority.
</P>
<P>
   With the flight delayed, the victims spent the night at the
casino. The plane left Atlantic City at about 10:30 a.m. Sunday and
was scheduled to land in Wilkes-Barre an hour later, Hartt said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the plane was operated by Executive Airlines of
Farmingdale, N.Y. Executive Airlines officials declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The plane disappeared from radar about 11:40 a.m. during a
second instrument approach, typically performed if the visibility
is poor or if there is a low cloud deck.
</P>
<P>
   Megan Maguire was outside gardening at her home near the airport
on the northern rim of the Pocono Mountains shortly before noon
when she heard a plane apparently having problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard the engines die, then I heard them start up again, and
then they just died. I heard it rev up twice, so it died twice,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Black, of the NTSB, said the BA-31 Jetstream does not have a
history of problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a lot of them in operation,'' he said. ''It's a very
common short haul (plane).''
</P>
<P>
   There were three crashes of similar model airplanes in the
1990s, the last coming in December 1994 at the Raleigh-Durham
International Airport in North Carolino, killing 15 of 20 people
aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's crash appeared to be the worst in Pennsylvania since
1994, when a USAir 737 crashed near Pittsburgh, killing all 132
people aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkes-Barre is 150 miles northwest of Atlantic City, N.J.

<HEADLINE> Cops: Man Took Kid's Life Preserver  </HEADLINE>
By SHELIA HARDWELL-RD
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTHAVEN, Miss. (AP) -- One sunny and windy spring Sunday,
7-year-old Dallas Reinhardt Peeples went fishing with her
stepfather and her 4-year-old brother, Garrett. The family's
live-in friend, Troy Carlisle, tagged along.
</P>
<P>
   The children's mother, Kerri Peeples, dressed them, brushed
their blond hair and sent them off. ''I told them I loved them and
I'd see them when they got back,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Only one of the children returned.
</P>
<P>
   Police say both children fell out of the family boat into
Arkabutla Lake. Dallas' stepfather rescued Garrett, and Carlisle
swam out to Dallas. But instead of rescuing the girl, authorities
believe, the strong currents caused Carlisle to panic and tear the
girl's life preserver away from her to save himself.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas drowned. Her body was recovered three days later, on May
10.
</P>
<P>
   That same day, Carlisle, 28, was accused of murder under a
Mississippi law that stipulates that the charge is warranted when a
crime ''was done in the commission of an act eminently dangerous to
others and evincing a depraved heart.''
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, he could face life in prison. Carlisle was on
suicide watch in the county jail. The sheriff's department said he
had declined requests for media interviews.
</P>
<P>
   It could not be determined if an attorney had been appointed to
represent Carlisle. Attorney Darrin Vance said he only represented
Carlisle during his bond hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Cottam, DeSoto County's assistant chief deputy sheriff, was
among the roughly 300 law officers who assisted in the search for
Dallas. It was the child's stepfather, Kenneth, who finally found
her body.
</P>
<P>
   ''She still had her hair in a little ponytail and when I saw it
... it tore me up,'' Cottam said. ''I thought, 'How can somebody do
this to a child?'''
</P>
<P>
   Carlisle had worked for Peeples family at their automotive shop
before they closed it down a week before the drowning. He was
facing charges of cocaine possession but was free on bond at the
time of the fishing trip, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Kerri Peeples said she and her husband wanted to help their
friend. They offered him shelter in the two-bedroom apartment. ''We
even paid for his attorney,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said that her children often played with Carlisle, whom they
nicknamed ''Troy Boy,'' and that the five of them had spent time
together on the family boat last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Cottam would not elaborate on the case against Carlisle. But he
did say 4-year-old Garrett is a possible witness.
</P>
<P>
   ''He enlightened us quite a bit,'' Cottam said. ''We feel
strongly we have a good charge.''

<HEADLINE> Cubs 4, Reds 2  </HEADLINE>
By RICK GANO
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Kevin Tapani had a right to be tired and
disappointed. He had thrown 135 pitches, only to lose both his
shutout and complete game in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   What didn't get away from the Chicago Cubs right-hander Sunday
was a victory. And that's what mattered the most.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some days you throw 85 pitches and it feels like a couple of
hundred. Today I threw 135 and it felt like 50 or 60,'' Tapani said
after pitching the Cubs past the Cincinnati Reds 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   ''Getting the shutout isn't as big as finishing the game when
you have the lead,'' Tapani added. ''When the manager gives you the
opportunity to finish, you want to be out there at the end. I just
came up one out short.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs were up 4-0 headed into the ninth, building the lead
when Reds catcher Eddie Taubensee's throw on a sixth-inning double
steal ticked the bat of Cubs' hitter Ricky Gutierrez and sailed
wildly past third allowing two runs to score.
</P>
<P>
   With a four-run cushion, Tapani surrendered a two-run homer to
Aaron Boone. After getting the second out of the inning, he gave up
a single to Pokey Reese, prompting a visit from manager Don Baylor
as the booing began at Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   ''I asked him if he could get Barry Larkin and he said he could.
He's one out away and he wanted to finish it more than anybody,''
Baylor said after he left Tapani in for one more hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor, whose bullpen has been in tatters all season, was
cheered as he returned to the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   But when Larkin got an infield single, that was it. Baylor
returned to the mound and brought in Felix Heredia. The reliever
walked Ken Griffey Jr. to load the bases but got Dmitri Young on a
fielder's choice grounder to third to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   ''We still had the lead and to have Griffey face him after 135
pitches would not have been fair to Tapani. He pitched too well to
lose,'' Baylor said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I had had a pitch to hit it out, I would have hit it out,''
Griffey said of his final at-bat against Heredia. ''With two guys
on, I had a chance to put us ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Griffey nor Sammy Sosa homered in the three-game series,
their first-ever meeting at long ball-friendly Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   Tapani (2-5), who'd lost 14 of his previous last 15 decisions,
gave up 10 hits. He pitched out of a bases-loaded jam in the second
by striking out rookie pitcher Rob Bell.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tapani looked hittable but we had a number of ground ball
out,'' Reds manager Jack McKeon said.
</P>
<P>
   Tapani also got the Cubs' only hit through the first five
innings with a two-out single to center in the third. Bell (3-3)
retired 15 of the first 16 batters he faced.
</P>
<P>
   But Damon Buford doubled to start the sixth and Eric Young
walked one out later. When they took off on a double steal,
Taubensee's throw nicked Gutierrez's bat and went sailing past
third as both runners scored.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a breaking pitch, so I went down to try and get it,''
Taubensee explained. ''I threw the ball and heard it hit the bat
and it just went off.''
</P>
<P>
   Gutierrez then followed with a solo homer, his seventh, and the
Cubs had a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Buford hit a solo homer to lead off the eighth inning off Dennys
Reyes.
</P>
<P>
   Bell gave up just three hits in six innings.
Notes: Griffey leads the majors with 41 walks. He beat out an
infield single in the fifth, finishing 1-for-3. Sosa was 0-for-4.
... The announced crowd of 39,148 was the Cubs largest of the
season at Wrigley Field and 47 more than Saturday. The three-game
series drew 115,448. ... Reds 1B Sean Casey, who has a 10-game
hitting streak, was scratched from the lineup with flu-like
symptoms. He was replaced by Hal Morris, who made his third start
of the season. ... Bell limited the Cubs to three hits and three
runs over seven innings in his major league debut on April 8 but
did not get a decision. ... Chicago Bears WR Marcus Robinson threw
out the first pitch. ... After the game, the Cubs placed 3B Shane
Andrews on the disabled list with a bad back retroactive to May 15.
They called up outfielder Raul Gonzalez from Triple-A Iowa.

<HEADLINE> Pacers, Knicks To Meet Again  </HEADLINE>
By HANK LOWENKRON
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- In what has become almost an annual Spring
tradition, the Indiana Pacers and New York Knicks will meet in the
NBA playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   It will be the sixth series between the two Eastern Conference
teams in eight seasons. Last year, the eighth-seeded Knicks ousted
Indiana in six games in the conference finals -- something Indiana
is hoping won't become a tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ''They made it a bitter summer for us last year by the way they
ended our season,'' Jalen Rose said after Sunday's practice. He had
just learned New York defeated Miami 83-82 in Game 7 of their
semifinal series.
</P>
<P>
   Game 1 in the best-of-seven conference finals is Tuesday night
at Conseco Fieldhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be nice to put them out of their misery this year, but
you've got to go one game at a time,'' Rose said.
</P>
<P>
   The teams split their four meetings during the regular season
with each winning twice on their home court.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers have the home court advantage Tuesday after compiling
the best record in the conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''To the Pacers that's very important, because that's the
advantage we have,'' said Rose, who was Indiana's leading scorer
against New York with a 18.2 average for the four games.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Pacers had the home court advantage last year and
still dropped Games 1 and 5 in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to come out ready and try to establish our home court
in the first two games. They're going to be very important to
establish the tempo for this series,'' Rose said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers are in the conference finals for the fifth time in
seven years, but have never advanced to the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been here. We're not excited. We understand what it is
to be here, and it's just about getting over the hump,'' Rose said.
</P>
<P>
   The rivalry between the Knicks and Pacers has consistently found
Reggie Miller in the middle, either by making big shots or
struggling when his team needed him the most.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it is going to be a beautiful series,'' said Miller,
whose 25-point average in this year's playoffs fueled the Pacers
past Milwaukee and Philadelphia in the first two rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think in the back of everyone's mind, we all knew that New
York would win that ballgame (against Miami). We're excited about
the opportunity to play seven games, and go on to the finals.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller admitted his team wanted to meet New York again.
</P>
<P>
   ''Deep down, we wanted to see a rematch. It was a great
heavyweight fight,'' Miller said. ''We know that they're very
confident because they've been able to beat us. We feel the same
way. We're hungry. The good thing is we get to play right away.
Last year, a week off (after sweeping Philadelphia) kind of killed
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Indiana compiled a league-best 36-5 record at home during the
regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are a good road team,'' Miller said of the Knicks, adding
that he and his teammates will need to pick up their game from the
opening two rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''Milwaukee and Philadelphia were nice, but it is going to take
a lot more effort to beat them,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hate them, but I respect them. You've got to respect a team
like that,'' Miller said. ''They've got a lot of good players.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers spent much of Sunday afternoon watching the New
York-Miami game on television.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a great game, two teams going to war. We felt like an
NCAA team waiting to see where we were going to play,'' Pacers
guard Mark Jackson said. ''It was good to know we were there. ...
Two great teams that went to the wire, and now we look forward to
New York coming to town.''

<HEADLINE> Giants 16, Brewers 10  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Eight days of offensive frustration were shed
in one inning by the San Francisco Giants.
</P>
<P>
   J.T. Snow hit a grand slam to cap San Francisco's 11-run sixth
inning as the Giants emphatically snapped an eight-game losing
streak with a 16-10 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Terrell Lowery had a career-high five hits and Armando Rios
drove in four runs for the Giants, who finally won on the last day
of a nine-game road trip. Eight starters drove in a run as San
Francisco pounded out 20 hits in its biggest offensive day of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't seen an explosion like that in a long time,'' San
Francisco manager Dusty Baker said. ''We had some guys who had huge
days.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Giants headed home, they took comfort in the fact they
only relinquished two games in the standings to NL West leader
Arizona during their struggles. With 18 of their next 24 at home
and no games outside California until June 20, Baker thinks it's
time to make a run.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a great way to start a hopefully great homestand,''
Baker said. ''This is one of the biggest victories we've had since
I've been here. I mean, 1-8 isn't much better than 0-9, but we're
still in (the division race).''
</P>
<P>
   The 11 runs tied Milwaukee's franchise record for runs allowed
in an inning and were the most scored by San Francisco since July
15, 1997. The Giants, who had 30 baserunners in the game, broke out
just one day after they were shut out for the first time this
season.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's Russ Ortiz (3-5) gave up 10 earned runs and
eight hits over 6 2-3 innings. He is the first starting pitcher to
give up 10 earned runs in a victory since 1954, when Pittsburgh's
Bob Friend did it in an 18-10 victory over Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz also reached base three times in five at-bats and had an
RBI single in the sixth as the inning's ninth batter.
</P>
<P>
   ''By the time I came up, we already had a pretty sizable lead,''
Ortiz said. ''It allowed me to be relaxed and just swing.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco actually gave up a four-run lead in the fifth
before ripping Milwaukee relievers Hector Ramirez (0-1) and Valerio
De Los Santos in the sixth. The two pitchers combined to allow 11
earned runs, seven hits and four walks.
</P>
<P>
   Snow drove in five runs in the inning -- four on his sixth career
grand slam off De Los Santos -- and had one of five run-scoring
singles as 15 hitters went to the plate. Brewers manager Davey
Lopes brought in left-hander De Los Santos specifically to face
Snow before his RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm still new at hitting lefties, so it was nice to have
success,'' said Snow, who hit the first career homer in 1993. ''I
never thought I'd get up against him again with the bases loaded,
and I just got a good pitch to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowery, who was hitting .219 for Triple-A Fresno when he was
recalled earlier in the week, played left field in place of resting
Barry Bonds. He went 5-for-6 with three doubles, scoring three runs
while improving to 12-for-19 (.632) in six games since being
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his gaudy numbers, Lowery knows he's probably headed
back to Fresno when Ellis Burks returns from a quadriceps injury on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The big-league atmosphere helps me,'' Lowery said. ''Guys like
Barry and Jeff (Kent) have more pressure than me. Nobody's going to
pitch around me up here.''
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz retired his first nine batters but tired badly, throwing
two wild pitches and allowing three walks in the seventh before
coming out. He threw 132 pitches in the game as Baker tried to
force Ortiz to finish off the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy didn't work, as Marquis Grissom's three-run double
with two outs cut the Giants' lead to 16-10. Milwaukee, which had
its three-game winning streak snapped, scored 28 runs in winning
two of three from San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez relieved Brewers starter John Snyder, who gave up eight
hits, four walks and five runs over five innings in his Milwaukee
debut. Snyder was acquired from the White Sox in the offseason but
spent the season's first six weeks rehabilitating a ribcage muscle
pull.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't be giving up five runs every game, but it's good to
know they can come back like that,'' Snyder said. ''But I knew in
spring training this team had offensive firepower like it's shown
lately.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco led 4-0 after three innings and 5-1 in the fifth,
but Mark Loretta's three-run homer tied the game 5-5 entering the
sixth. Jose Hernandez hit a solo homer in the sixth, his second in
as many games.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Brewers reliever Horacio Estrada finally ended the sixth
inning by getting Rios to fly out. In the seventh, Estrada got his
first career hit. ... Bill Mueller, whose 15-game hitting streak
was snapped on Saturday, was the only Giants starter who didn't
drive in a run. ... Workers at under-construction Miller Park just
beyond the bleachers kept the crowd entertained while doing work on
the stadium's retractable roof. One worker twice slid on his rear
down a portion of the roof's highest arched beam, drawing oohs from
the crowd. ... Snow's last grand slam came on July 25, 1998,
against Cincinnati. In the sixth inning alone, Snow went 2-for-2
with five RBIs against De Los Santos. ... In allowing six hits and
eight earned runs in two-thirds of an inning, De Los Santos' ERA
went from 4.08 to 6.44.

By The Associated Press	   
Robert Burr:
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) --Robert Burr, who has played Shakespeare's most
memorable characters on the Broadway stage, died May 13. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   Burr had emphysema, his son, Robert Burr Jr., told The New York
Times for Sunday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   Burr, a veteran of World War II and the Korean War, made his
Broadway debut in 1951 as a chorus member in ''The Cradle Will
Rock.'' He acted in bit parts while working in a Harlem frozen food
factory, but he got his big break in June 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Burr was understudy to Richard Burton, the lead in a Broadway
production of ''Hamlet.'' Burton prided himself on never missing a
performance, but one morning he awoke with an abscess on his
tonsils and had to skip a matinee.
</P>
<P>
   Theatergoers rushed to exchange their tickets, but those who
stayed witnessed Burr make the role of Hamlet his own, the Times
said.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, later the same summer in a different production
of ''Hamlet,'' Burr again stepped in as understudy to assume the
leading role. Producer Joseph Papp decided to keep him for good,
and the role made Burr's career.
</P>
<P>
   Burr went on to appear in more Shakespeare plays and to dabble
in television and film, appearing in soap operas and opposite
Shirley MacLaine in 1972 in ''The Possession of Joel Delaney.''
Dame Barbara Cartland:
</P>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Dame Barbara Cartland, self-styled queen of
romantic fiction and considered the world's best-selling author,
died in her sleep at her estate near Hatfield on Sunday after a
short illness, her family said. She was 98.
</P>
<P>
   Cartland's novels, about feminine virtue and manly ideals, were
dictated to a relay of secretaries as she reclined on a sofa,
dressed usually in a glamorous Cartland-pink frock. Living on her
400-acre estate 15 miles north of London, she worked to a strict
schedule, producing 6,000 to 7,000 words in an afternoon, and could
finish a book in seven afternoons.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewers generally ignored her work and she did not pretend to
be a great writer. But she was immensely popular.
</P>
<P>
   Against the increasing pressures of the sexual revolution,
Cartland carried the banner of old-fashioned romance with
unswerving dedication.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of her 723 books exceeded 1 billion worldwide in 36
languages. The Guinness Book of Records lists her as the world's
top-selling author.
David B. Guralnik:
</P>
<P>
   SHAKER HEIGHTS, Ohio (AP) -- David B. Guralnik, former editor in
chief of Webster's New World Dictionary and an internationally
known lexicographer, died Friday at his suburban Cleveland home. He
was 79.
</P>
<P>
   Guralnik served as Webster's editor in chief for more than 35
years. He was considered an expert on slang and was the first to
include ''ain't'' in the dictionary in 1951 -- something that was
unheard of at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Although Guralnik said all words were his favorites, he believed
''OK'' best expressed the creativity of English-speaking Americans.
Its first known use was in the 19th century, as an abbreviation for
the deliberately misspelled ''oll korrect'' or ''all correct.'' Now
the phrase is used worldwide.
Roger A. Morse:
</P>
<P>
   ITHACA, N.Y. -- Roger Alfred Morse, who turned a childhood
interest in beekeeping into an encyclopedic knowledge that made him
one of the best-known apiculturists, died May 12 at his home. He
was 72.
</P>
<P>
   A prolific author, Morse straddled the worlds of professional
beekeepers and amateur ones, whose numbers in the United States are
put around 200,000. Much of his renown came from such popular books
as ''The Complete Guide to Beekeeping.''
</P>
<P>
   Morse's knowledge was also widely sought by commercial
beekeepers around the world. These beekeepers not only produce
honey but play a vital role in pollinating vast swaths of
cultivated land. In the United States alone, about $10 billion
worth of crops each year are pollinated entirely or partly by bees.
</P>
<P>
   An entomology professor at Cornell University for more than 40
years, Morse also taught the introductory beekeeping course there,
and, as recently as last fall, a laboratory course on practical
beekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1960s, an article described how he had figured out
a way to lure swarms of bees to follow him wherever he walked. The
trick was to carry filter paper saturated with the ground-up queen
bee mandible glands.

<HEADLINE> China Seeks To Recover Antiques  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- China plans to form a task force to try to
recover as many as 1 million valuable and sometimes looted Chinese
cultural relics collected by museums around the world, an official
newspaper said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   News of the planned bureau to recover relics follows recent
auctions in Hong Kong of 18th century Chinese antiques. The
auctions outraged many Chinese and Beijing demanded they be
stopped, claiming that British and French troops looted the
antiques from a Chinese palace during the second Opium War 140
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The antiques, three bronze sculptures of heads of an ox, monkey
and tiger and a hexagonal ceramic vase, were bought respectively by
a Chinese state-owned conglomerate and a company under the Chinese
government's relics bureau.
</P>
<P>
   The state-run Workers Daily gave no details about the specialist
department it said Beijing plans to establish to recover relics,
including those in non-governmental hands.
</P>
<P>
   But it said there are no less than 1 million fine-quality
Chinese cultural relics in more than 200 museums in 47 countries,
and that the bureau will be ''responsible for recovering these
relics.''
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper quoted Xie Chensheng, an adviser to China's relics
bureau, as saying the majority of relics left China before the 1949
Communist takeover. In large part, they were either stolen by
invading nations, stolen by foreigners or purchased by foreigners
at extremely low prices from Chinese warlords and smuggled abroad,
Xie reportedly said.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper said the biggest collection of Chinese painting is
in an American museum, the best collection of Chinese porcelain is
in France and that Japan has the largest collection of ancient
inscriptions written onto tortoise shells.

   WILKES-BARRE, Pa. (AP) -- There were no survivors today as a commuter plane
carrying 19 people home from a gambling trip to Atlantic City, N.J., crashed in
a ball of fire after experiencing engine problems while trying to land. Fiery

tonight to fix broken equipment on the outside of the international space
station, flying united with the shuttle Atlantis. It was the shuttle crew's
second 200-mile-high feat of the day. The first was the impeccable
shuttle-station linkup. Jeffrey Williams and James Voss floated out into the
cargo bay and immediately saw the towering space station. At the top of their
to-do list: securing a loose crane. The 5-foot construction crane was installed
on the space station by another pair of spacewalkers last spring. But it was
never locked properly into its socket, allowing it to swivel back and forth.

<HEADLINE> Armed robbery disrupts party at downtown restaurant  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A party of University at Albany graduates
was evacuated from a downtown restaurant Sunday as police searched
for an armed robber who allegedly got away with an estimated
$40,000 after holding a restaurant employee at gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Police say the robber, described as a black male, 5'4'' tall and
20 years old, approached the employee as she entered the third
floor business office of Jillian's, a restaurant and bar.
</P>
<P>
   The robber reportedly pointed a small caliber gun at the woman,
who complied with his demand to open the safe. Police say the
robber then tied the woman's hands behinds her back and taped her
upper body to a chair before escaping.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Public spats with former boyfriend brings review for judge  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- A turbulent relationship between a New
Jersey Superior Court judge and her former boyfriend has come under
scrutiny by a judicial watchdog committee with the power to
recommend penalties ranging from reprimand to removal.
</P>
<P>
   The review by the state Supreme Court's Advisory Committee on
Judicial Conduct of Superior Court Judge Rosemarie Ruggiero
Williams comes after at least two public disputes to which police
were summoned.
</P>
<P>
   State judges in the past have been disciplined for off-duty acts
such as drunken driving, smoking marijuana, having an affair with a
secretary and showing up at a political event.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts say this case could result in a new standard of
accountability for judge's personal lives. The committee has
publicly sanctioned 30 Superior and Municipal Court judges since
1974.
</P>
<P>
   The state Supreme Court in recent years has come down on lawyers
convicted of domestic abuse, routinely suspending them for up to
three months. But the committee so far hasn't publicly dealt with
judges involved in domestic violence, said Patrick Monahan, the
committee's counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ''Judges are held to a stricter standard,'' Michael Ambrosio,
who teaches legal ethics at Seton Hall Law School, told The
Star-Ledger of Newark for Sunday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   The review comes after a series of disputes Williams had with
Mercer County Sheriff's Deputy Alfred ''Wes'' Bridges Jr.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1999, witnesses said Williams, 48, tried to force her
way into Bridges' town house in Trenton. Officers were called to
calm the scene witnesses said had the makings of a typical domestic
dispute, with shouting, shoving and other commotion.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew she was totally out of control,'' said Marge
Caldwell-Wilson, Bridges' neighbor. ''I would never expect a judge
to act like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Caldwell-Wilson, a social worker and community activist who says
she tried to act as a mediator between the pair, also said she felt
sorry for Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was almost like she was hurt, emotionally hurt,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Charges were filed against Bridges, 27, but later were
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   About one year later, Williams confronted Bridges and his dinner
date at Joe's Mill Hill Saloon, near Bridge's home. The argument
began in the street and spilled into the restaurant, where Bridges
asked the owner to call police. No charges were filed. Shortly
before the confrontation, Bridges had walked into a West Trenton
restaurant where Williams and Joan Austin were eating dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think she and Wes upset each other,'' said Austin, a lawyer
in the Mercer County Public Defender's Office. ''It was an unusual
kind of a friendship, and it had its ups and downs, and there's
still apparently something very powerful between them.''
</P>
<P>
   The romance had been known in Trenton legal circles for years.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was appointed a Superior Court judge in 1993 by
then-Gov. Jim Florio. For the 12 years previous, she worked in the
state Attorney General's Office. She was separated from her second
husband and raising her two teen-age children alone when she began
dating Bridges.
</P>
<P>
   Bridges, the son of Ewing Township Mayor Al Bridges, was a star
athlete at Ewing High School in the late 1980s before he attended
Rutgers University on a football scholarship. He has been working
as a sheriff's officer since 1996 while attending law school part
time at Widener University in Pennsylvania.

<HEADLINE> Plane crashes, kills all 19 people aboard  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER NEWTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILKES-BARRE, Pa. (AP) -- A charter plane carrying 19 people from
a gambling trip to Atlantic City, N.J., crashed in a ball of fire
after experiencing engine problems Sunday as it approached the
Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport, killing all aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Burned and twisted wreckage was scattered across a small heavily
wooded area, about 9 miles south of the airport in northeastern
Pennsylvania and about 90 miles north of Philadelphia
</P>
<P>
   ''The weather was bad, it was windy and there was some
precipitation. The visibility was poor,'' Federal Aviation
Administration spokeswoman Tammy Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots told air traffic controllers before the twin-engine
turbo prop crashed that they were experiencing engine trouble.
</P>
<P>
   On a portion of the tape aired on ABC News, one pilot can be
heard saying, ''Tell him we lost both engines.'' The other pilot
replies: ''We lost both engines, six echo Juliet.''
</P>
<P>
   The plane's cockpit voice recorder was recovered from the crash
site, George Black of the National Transportation Safety Board
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It missed its first approach and was attempting a second
approach when the accident occurred,'' Black said before he left
Washington, D.C., for the accident site. ''There is some indication
on the air traffic control tapes that they were encountering engine
problems during the first approach and those continued into the
second attempt.''
</P>
<P>
   Emergency crews began searching along the planned flight path of
the plane as soon as they were notified shortly after 11:30 a.m.
that it would not reach the airport, said Luzerne County 911
spokesman Ron Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Megan Maguire was outside gardening at her home near the airport
on the northern rim of the Pocono Mountains shortly before noon
Sunday when she heard a plane apparently having problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard the engines die, then I heard them start up again, and
then they just died. I heard it rev up twice, so it died twice,''
said Maguire, who often hears planes pass overhead as they prepare
to land at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Wreckage was spotted in a wooded area in Bear Creek Township
about 12:45 p.m., Rome said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 10 hours after the 11:48 a.m. crash, John Comey,
executive assistant director for the Pennsylvania Emergency
Management Agency, said the 17 passengers and two pilots had been
killed.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the family members that gathered at the airport have been
notified that no one survived the crash,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bodies were removed from the crash site late Sunday night and
taken to a hangar at the Wilkes-Barre airport for families to
identify.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 family members and friends gathered at the airport,
including parents and spouses, said airport officials, some of whom
recognized names among the victims.
</P>
<P>
   Airport Superintendent Jim Brunozzi said his niece's
mother-in-law and father-in-law were among the victims.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was tough to look at the manifest and see the names,''
Brunozzi said. ''We were a close family. It's sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony J. Giannone, airport ground superintendent, had to
console a friend whose wife was on the plane.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's got two small kids, and he had to leave here to tell
them,'' Giannone said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a small, close community, and that's what I think makes
it so hard,'' said Lackawanna County Commissioner Randy Castellani,
who arrived soon after the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Wy A. Gowell, the airport's assistant director, said the group
had left at 5 p.m. Saturday on a flight chartered by Caesars
Atlantic City Hotel Casino. They were to return at 1:15 a.m. but
fog kept the plane grounded in Farmingdale, N.Y., said Peter Hartt,
spokesman for the South Jersey Transportation Authority.
</P>
<P>
   ''They came out to get in the cars, and the junket
representative came out and said the flight was canceled due to the
weather,'' said Bob Feldgus, 65, a limousine driver hired to take
the group from Caesars to the airport, about 12 miles west of the
city.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the victims spent the night at the casino.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are deeply saddened by this tragic accident,'' said Wallace
Barr, executive vice president of Park Place Entertainment, which
owns Caesars. ''Our sincere condolences and sympathies are with the
families at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartt, whose agency operates the Atlantic City Airport, said the
Executive Airlines plane departed the city about 10:30 a.m. and was
scheduled to land in Wilkes-Barre an hour later.
</P>
<P>
   Hartt said the airline typically runs casino charters. Executive
Airlines officials declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The BA-31 Jetstream disappeared off radar during a second
instrument approach about 11:40 a.m., Jones said. In general, an
instrument approach is performed if the visibility is poor or if
there are low clouds.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't have a history of being an airplane with problems
to my knowledge,'' Black said. ''There are a lot of them in
operation. It's a very common short haul (plane).''
</P>
<P>
   There were three crashes of similar model airplanes in the
1990s, the last coming in December 1994 at the Raleigh-Durham
(N.C.) International Airport, killing 15 of 20 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's crash was the worst in Pennsylvania since 1994, when a
USAir 737 crashed near Pittsburgh, killing all 132 people aboard.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Prime Minister Appointed  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- President Kim Dae-jung on Monday
appointed the head of a minority party as prime minister in a move
expected to significantly boost his political base.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Han-dong, the 65-year-old head of the United Liberal
Democrats, succeeded Park Tae-joon, who resigned last week over a
tax evasion scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's appointment is subject to approval by the 273-member
National Assembly, where the main opposition Grand National Party
has a plurality of 133 seats. The assembly is expected to approve
the appointment.
</P>
<P>
   Kim's ruling Millennium Democratic Party controls 115 seats in
the unicameral legislature. But Lee's appointment can be endorsed
with support from 17 United Democrats and several pro-government
independent members.
</P>
<P>
   Park resigned came after a court ruled last week that he had
concealed ownership of properties to avoid large tax payments years
ago. Though such concealment wasn't illegal at the time, Park's
action was considered unethical and he will be required to pay back
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's appointment signaled the renewal of a partnership between
Kim's party and the United Liberal Democrats. A coalition of the
two parties broke up before parliamentary elections in April, and
the Grand National Party won a plurality at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Kim's party and the United Liberal Democrats have not announced
the formal revival of their coalition, but Lee's appointment
indicated that the two have drawn closer.
</P>
<P>
   ''It means the beginning of political confrontation,'' the
national Yonhap News Agency quoted Kwon Chul-hyun, spokesman for
the Grand National Party, or GNP, as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's relations with the GNP are poor because he once headed the
GNP and is seen by his former allies as a defector. A six-term
legislator, Lee is a former judge and prosecutor and served as
interior minister in the early 1990s.

<HEADLINE> Herbalife Founder Hughes Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALIBU, Calif. (AP) -- Mark Reynolds Hughes, founder of the
Herbalife empire of weight loss and nutritional products, has died
at age 44, authorities said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes was found dead in his Malibu mansion, said Los Angeles
County sheriff's Sgt. Norine Plett. He died of apparent natural
causes but an autopsy will determine the cause of death, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles-based Herbalife, which Hughes founded in 1980, sells
weight management, personal care and nutritional products in 44
countries.
</P>
<P>
   According to the company's Web site, Hughes was inspired to
found the company by the death of his mother from an accidental
overdose of prescription diet pills when he was 18. In a message on
the site, Hughes wrote, ''I've dedicated my life to bringing the
finest weight loss, nutritional and personal care products to
everyone around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes took his company public after its founding, but announced
plans last fall to buy it back and make it private. In April, he
announced he was withdrawing his $510 million offer because of
difficulties in arranging financing.
</P>
<P>
   Herbalife's 1999 sales totaled $956.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes made headlines last year with plans to build a
45,000-square-foot home on 157 acres above affluent Benedict
Canyon. Had it been built, it would have been bigger than the White
House.

<HEADLINE> Rangers 6, Orioles 5  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Pinch-hitter Frank Catalanotto hit a
two-out RBI single in the eighth as the Texas Rangers beat
Baltimore 6-5 on Sunday night to extend their winning streak to a
season-high six games.
</P>
<P>
   Ruben Mateo drew a leadoff walk off Buddy Groom (2-2) and
advanced to second on Mike Lamb's sacrifice. Catalanotto, hitting
for Jason McDonald, singled to right off Mike Trombley to cap
Texas' comeback from a 5-0 deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Venafro (1-0) pitched 2-3 of an inning for the victory and
John Wetteland pitched the ninth for his 10th save.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore has lost 15 of its last 17.
</P>
<P>
   Orioles starter Scott Erickson took a shutout into the sixth
before Rafael Palmeiro's one-out solo homer made it 5-1. After
Mateo's two-out single, Lamb hit a two-run homer to make it 5-3.
</P>
<P>
   Texas knocked out Erickson in the seventh, loading the bases on
two walks and a single. Ivan Rodriguez had a sacrifice fly off
reliever Al Reyes, and Palmeiro tied it with an RBI groundout
against Buddy Groom.
</P>
<P>
   Erickson allowed five runs and six hits over six innings. He
struck out two and walked six in his fourth start since having
surgery to remove bone chips from his right elbow on March 3.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore scored three runs in the first off Darren Oliver.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Bordick opened the scoring with a one-out homer, his ninth.
After singles by Delino DeShields and Albert Belle, Jeff Conine had
an RBI single to right. Right fielder Jason McDonald overthrew
third base for an error, allowing Belle to score.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore made it 4-0 in the fourth on Cal Ripken's double. Will
Clark's fifth-inning single extended the Orioles' lead to 5-0 and
chased Oliver.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver allowed five runs and nine hits over 4 2-3 innings. He
struck out three and walked three.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Texas pinch hitters are 8-for-11 this season with seven
RBIs. ... All four of Erickson's starts this season have been on
the road. ... Ripken has 1,587 RBIs, two behind Nap Lajoie for 21st
place on the career list. ... Bordick's single-season high for
homers is 13. ... Texas' Mark Clark made his first relief
appearance since 1997 with the New York Mets. Clark had made 73
straight starts. ... McDonald had two assists, giving him six for
the season, the most among Texas outfielders.

<HEADLINE> Clinton criticizes Lazio for ''hurling insults''  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton lost no time in
criticizing her new rival in the race for U.S. Senate, saying she
was ''disappointed'' that U.S. Rep. Rick Lazio ''has already
started hurling insults.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sorry that my opponent couldn't even get through his
announcement speech without going on the attack,'' the first lady
told about 100 machinists at a union conference Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's comments came one day after Lazio formally declared he
was entering the Senate race to replace New York City mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, who dropped out Friday citing health reasons. Lazio, a
lifelong resident of Long Island, attacked Clinton in his official
announcement for not being a native New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was a little disappointed yesterday that my latest opponent
has already started hurling insults instead of offering what we can
do to improve the lives of New Yorkers,'' Clinton said. ''Beyond
all the bluster and the attacks I really hope that we can keep this
campaign focused on the genuine and meaningful difference between
us and between our parties.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady picked up the endorsement of the 30,000-member
New York State Machinists Union at its annual conference in Albany
and shed her black blazer in favor of a union jacket presented to
her.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will be a strong champion for the labor movement,'' she
said. ''I will be on your side with collective bargaining and the
right to organize and I'll work to make that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Later Sunday, Clinton appeared at a fund-raiser in Troy for the
Rensselaer County Democratic Party. At the $75 to $500-a-person
event, she joked about the turn of events in the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think anybody could have predicted the twist and turns
... It's highly unpredictable,'' she told about 150 supporters.
''This will be a tough election, where we have to work very hard
for every single vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who first moved to a house in Westchester County in
January, countered Lazio's claim that she was a carpetbagger and
emphasized at both events that she had visited all 62 counties in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been to everywhere you can imagine,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She gave autographs and took pictures with supporters at the
events but declined to speak with reporters. When asked to comment
on Lazio's record, she briefly answered: ''There will be plenty of
time to talk about differences between us.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Lazio appeared on five major Sunday TV news shows.
The four-term Republican congressman, who is little known outside
his district, also flew with his family across upstate New York
Sunday afternoon, making stops at Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse and
Binghamton.
