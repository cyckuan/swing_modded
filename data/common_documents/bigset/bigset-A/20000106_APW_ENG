<HEADLINE> Interest Groups Spent $697M Lobbying  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Health insurers, high-tech companies, banks and other
interest groups spent $697 million to lobby Congress and the federal agencies
during the first six months of 1999, a new report says.
</P>
<P>
	   That's $116 million per month spent to influence the federal government,
according to the report being released Thursday by FEC Info, an Internet
consulting firm that specializes in tracking political money.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is an incredible amount,'' said Tony Raymond, a founder of FEC Info.
``These are the moneymakers. They have two groups they work on: the legislators,
the people who write the laws, but they also work on their home offices, saying
'Our competitors are spending this much on lobbying; we need to catch up with
them.'''
</P>
<P>
	   The amount is similar to the $710 million spent on lobbying during the first
six months of 1998, according to figures compiled by researchers at the Center
for Responsive Politics, which also analyzed federal lobbying disclosure
reports. FEC Info is a subsidiary of the Internet public policy and health care
technology company Netivation.com.
</P>
<P>
	   This time around, the health care industry spent more on lobbying than
anyone else, spending $95.5 million as Congress debated whether to impose new
regulations on managed care health plans. Congress didn't pass the new rules.
</P>
<P>
	   In second place were communications and technology companies, which fought
over providing high-speed Internet access and sought approval for several
telecommunications company mergers. Those companies spent $94.6 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The financial services industry, which won approval of a long-sought bill to
drop Depression-era barriers against banks, insurance companies and investment
houses competing against each other, spent $89.8 million on lobbying.
</P>
<P>
	   The two biggest individual spenders were the American Medical Association,
which spent $8.8 million, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which spent $8.4
million lobbying on health insurance and other issues.
</P>
<P>
	   The food and tobacco giant Philip Morris spent $7.5 million, but the amount
of money the tobacco companies spent on lobbying declined since Congress did not
take up any anti-smoking legislation during the just-concluded session.
</P>
<P>
	   The Associated Press reported in September that five major cigarette
companies, including Philip Morris, spent $11 million from January through June.
That was a big drop from the first half of 1998, when the industry poured $37
million into an extraordinary effort to defeat legislation that would have
raised cigarette taxes by $1.10 per pack and would have given the federal
government new power to regulate nicotine.
</P>
<P>
	   The top lobbying firm was Cassidy &AMP; Associates, which was paid $10 million
during the first half of 1999. Former Reps. Fred Rooney of Pennsylvania and
Marty Russo of Illinois both work for the firm, whose clients have included
Boeing, Exxon, and a number of colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
	   Patton Boggs, which counts former Rep. Greg Laughlin of Texas in its ranks,
was second at $9.2 million. The firm has represented the Association of Trial
Lawyers, MCI Worldcom and US Airways.
</P>
<P>
	   Verner, Liipfert, Bernhard, McPherson and Hand, home to former Senate
majority leaders George Mitchell and Bob Dole and former Texas Gov. Ann
Richards, was paid $7.3 million.
</P>
<P>
	   During the first six months of 1998, the powerhouse firm received $7.1
million from the tobacco companies alone, but the industry paid just $80,000
during the same period this year.

<HEADLINE> Avalanche 4, Flames 0  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    DENVER (AP) -- Adam Deadmarsh scored three goals, Peter Forsberg had three
assists and rookie Marc Denis recorded his second career shutout, leading the
Colorado Avalanche past the Calgary Flames 4-0 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   It was Deadmarsh's first career hat trick in 380 NHL games.
</P>
<P>
	   The Avalanche, maintaining their slim lead over Edmonton and Calgary in the
Northwest Division, got 27 saves from Denis, who recorded his fifth victory of
the season and third over the Flames.
</P>
<P>
	   Denis' most spectacular stop came in the final period, when his sweeping
glove save robbed Jarome Iginla of an apparent open-net goal.
</P>
<P>
	   Calgary's Fred Brathwaite had 30 saves.
</P>
<P>
	   Joe Sakic added a goal and an assist for Colorado.
</P>
<P>
	   Each team had only a single good scoring chance in a defensive and scoreless
first period, which saw Calgary outshoot Colorado 11-7. Calgary's Andrei Nazarov
and Colorado's Chris Dingman were assessed five-minute fighting penalties early
in the period.
</P>
<P>
	   Deadmarsh broke the scoring drought at 4:27 of the second. Forsberg took a
shot from just inside the right circle and Deadmarsh, stationed in front of the
goal, deflected the puck with his knee past Brathwaite.
</P>
<P>
	   Then, just 14 seconds after former Colorado wing Rene Corbet went off for
high-sticking, Sandis Ozolinsh hit Deadmarsh in stride behind defenseman Bobby
Dollas at the blue line, and Deadmarsh scored from the left circle at 17:33.
</P>
<P>
	   Colorado outshot Calgary 16-6 in the period.
</P>
<P>
	   Sakic made it 3-0 at 3:08 of the third. Martin Skoula carried the puck
behind the net and sent a pass in the right circle to Forsberg, who then found
an open Sakic left of the goal.
</P>
<P>
	   Forsberg's steal started a sequence that led to Deadmarsh's third goal and
11th of the season, from the right circle, at 16:39.
</P>
<P>
	   Calgary got off only two shots on its three power-play opportunities.

<HEADLINE> Dodgers Sign Olson to 2-Year Deal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Los Angeles Dodgers, continuing to improve their
bullpen, signed right-handed reliever Gregg Olson to a $3.5 million, two-year
contract Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Olson, 33, had a career-best 9-4 record with 14 saves and a 3.71 ERA in 61
appearances for the Arizona Diamondbacks last year. He gets $1.25 million this
year and $1.75 million in 2001, and the Dodgers have a $2.25 million option for
2002 with a $500,000 buyout.
</P>
<P>
	   Olson began the season as Arizona's closer, and struggled in that role. He
was replaced in midseason when the Diamondbacks acquired Matt Mantei from the
Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
	   After that, Olson was used in a setup role and went 5-0 with a 2.61 ERA.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are excited about the acquisition of Gregg Olson, a talented setup man,"
Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone said. "He fits into our offseason plans and
provides the manager with the flexibility to solidify his bullpen. This is a
quality reliever who definitely shortens a game and brings added leadership to
our clubhouse."
</P>
<P>
	   Olson revived his career after joining Arizona as a non-roster invitee to
spring training in the club's inaugural season of 1998, earning 30 saves.
</P>
<P>
	   Olson started his career saving 160 games with the Baltimore Orioles from
1989-93, becoming the first closer in major league history to record 20 or more
saves in each of his first five seasons. He has a 40-37 record with a 3.43 ERA,
and his 217 saves ranks 23rd on the career list.
</P>
<P>
	   "Gregg is an experienced veteran who strengthens our bullpen," Dodgers
manager Davey Johnson said. "I am thrilled with the depth of experience we have
in relief."
</P>
<P>
	   The Dodgers, who had problems in middle relief and setup roles last season,
also acquired Terry Adams from the Chicago Cubs; Dan Naulty from the New York
Yankees and signed free agents Orel Hershiser and Mike Fetters in the offseason.

<P>
    EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) -- Tommy Salo made 32 saves Wednesday night to help
the Edmonton Oilers to a 1-1 tie with the San Jose Sharks.
</P>
<P>
	   The Oilers led 1-0 on a second-period goal by Bill Guerin before Alexander
Korolyuk tied it for San Jose early in the third.
</P>
<P>
	   Doug Weight extended his point-scoring streak to five games with a perfect
pass that set up Guerin's 11th goal. Guerin's quick release from the slot beat
goalie Steve Shields high on the glove side at 19:12 of the second. Weight has
three goals and six assists during the streak.
</P>
<P>
	   Korolyuk knocked in a rebound of a shot by Patrick Marleau at 5:37 of the
third. The puck was sitting in the crease as Korolyuk swept it in from the side
to beat Salo.
</P>
<P>
	   Edmonton is undefeated in its past seven home games (4-0-3).
</P>
<P>
	   The Sharks outshot the Oilers 23-9 over the final 45 minutes and 33-21
overall.
</P>
<P>
	   Rem Murray returned to the Edmonton lineup after missing 28 games with
sprained ligaments in his right knee. To make room for Murray on the roster,
Michel Picard was placed on waivers.

<HEADLINE> Kukoc Leads Bulls Past Wizards  </HEADLINE>
    By NANCY ARMOUR AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- If Toni Kukoc can do this when he's rusty, imagine what
he'll be like when he's back in shape.
</P>
<P>
	   On the floor for the first time in nearly two months, Kukoc scored a
team-high 18 points Wednesday night and gave the Chicago Bulls a desperately
needed spark as they beat the Washington Wizards 77-66, snapping an 11-game
losing streak.
</P>
<P>
	   "I could have shot a little better," said Kukoc, who was 7-of-26 from the
floor. "It wasn't a great showing of shooting, but I think I played a good game.
Nothing spectacular, but a good, overall basketball game."
</P>
<P>
	   Kukoc, the only player close to a standout left on Chicago's roster, was
taken off the injured list a few hours before the game after missing the last 24
with lingering back spasms. He hadn't played in a game since Nov. 9, and had
only resumed practice Dec. 29.
</P>
<P>
	   His back spasms began in early November. After resting for two weeks, he
tried to practice Nov. 22, and promptly reinjured himself. He was placed on the
injured list Dec. 8.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm tired right now, but I felt all right the first couple minutes of the
game," he said. "I ran out of gas. I haven't practiced in a long time and I
really have to work in the next week to get myself into basketball shape."
</P>
<P>
	   Getting Kukoc back was some of the best news -- maybe the only good news --
the Bulls have had in weeks. Already at a disadvantage with a roster of misfits,
Chicago (3-26) has had one player after another go down with injuries. At one
point last month, the Bulls could only dress nine players with six on the bench
in suits.
</P>
<P>
	   Not only does Kukoc give the Bulls a perimeter threat -- his second shot
Wednesday night was a 25-foot 3-pointer -- but he provides invaluable leadership
for a young team.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a definite plus having him back, especially for the rookies," said
rookie Elton Brand, who had 16 points and 16 rebounds. "We're still trying to
find our way."
</P>
<P>
	   Kukoc said it will take him another week or two to get back into full
playing shape. But that didn't stop him from playing most of the game. Though he
and coach Tim Floyd had only expected him to play 25 minutes, he played 39.
</P>
<P>
	   "He wanted to stay out there," Floyd said. "It's always a battle to get him
off the floor, but he was out there too long."
</P>
<P>
	   Kukoc's fatigue was evident at the end of the game, when he could barely run
up the floor and his shots fell short. But fatigue was the only problem, Kukoc
said. His back felt fine.
</P>
<P>
	   "When we have a chance to win games like this, it doesn't really matter," he
said. "You don't sense the fatigue right away. Now it's pretty bad and I'll need
a lot of rest before the next game.
</P>
<P>
	   "I hope I'm going to get the day off tomorrow."

<HEADLINE> Technology Shares Begin Bounce-Back  </HEADLINE>
    By BRUCE MEYERSON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The rapid cool-off of high-flying technology stocks in
recent days was overdue and probably not quite over as investors cash in on
phenomenal 1999 gains -- in the 2000 tax year.
</P>
<P>
	   The tech-heavy Nasdaq market reversed course Wednesday, halting a two-day
slide at 10 percent. Analysts stressed that the brief selloff was a small price
to pay for the 50 percent gain of the past two months or the 85 percent gain for
all of 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, rather than the fears of rising interest rates widely blamed for
the sudden downturn, the sheer size of 1999's gains may have been the driving
force behind the post New Year's drop, many analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   With such huge profits tucked away in stocks, many investors were waiting to
sell after Dec. 31 so they could delay paying taxes on those gains until April
2001.
</P>
<P>
	   "A lot of the selling in the technology stocks was really tax-related, and
most of it has flushed through the system," said Richard A. Dickson, a technical
analyst at Scott &AMP; Stringfellow Inc. in Richmond, Va.
</P>
<P>
	   But, he added, "Does this mean we're heading straight up? I doubt it. I
don't think we can bring this straight up until there's a further wash out in
technology."
</P>
<P>
	   After tumbling a record 229 points on Tuesday, the Nasdaq -- a bellwether
for the technology industry -- fell another 166 points in Wednesday's early
trading before rebounding to finish the day just 24.15 points lower, at
3,877.54.
</P>
<P>
	   While most experts agree that there's plenty of excess that can be wrung
from technology stocks, they also stand by the main premise behind 1999's stock
swell -- that even through most Internet companies continue to lose money, tech
and non-tech companies alike willl eventually prosper from the rapid spread of
the Internet into business and everyday life.
</P>
<P>
	   That's why the main question Wednesday wasn't why, but how long and how far
stocks might drop before resuming the powerful rally of the past five years.
</P>
<P>
	   Notably, the selloff didn't stop Goldman Sachs on Tuesday from issuing a
list of stocks the investment firm expects to rise at least 35 percent this
year.
</P>
<P>
	   More than a third of the 85 names on that list were Internet-related. Among
them were America Online, the leading Web service, and Cisco Systems, the
biggest manufacturer of Internet equipment. Both companies saw their share
prices more than double last year, exceeding virtually every benchmark for
measuring a company's value.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Internet is the most important business phenomenon in our lifetime,"
said Byron Wien, the U.S. investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
"I still believe that, but many stock prices were suggesting a profit reality
that was pretty hard to achieve."
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, even as evidence continued to mount Wednesday that the Federal
Reserve may need to slow the economy again with higher interest rates to prevent
inflation, tech-stock proponents were undeterred.
</P>
<P>
	   "Clearly, December was a fantasy that could not be prolonged in light of the
new year, but you can't just look at interest rates to determine whether stock
prices are going to go up or down," said Joe Battipaglia, chief investment
strategist at Gruntal &AMP; Co., forecasting that the profits of companies that
trade on the Nasdaq Stock Market will grow 35 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
	   "You get one, two, three market pullbacks a year, so why should this year be
any different? Until l find evidence that this bull market is over, I'll stay
fully invested."

<HEADLINE> 'Tokyo Joe' Sued for Alleged Fraud  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- A man who calls himself Tokyo Joe plans to contest
allegations by federal regulators that he defrauded investors on his Web site by
failing to tell them he was selling the same stocks he was advising them to buy.
</P>
<P>
	   The Securities and Exchange Commission said Wednesday that Tokyo Joe, whom
it described as a self-proclaimed expert in day trading, charged members of his
investment club up to $200 a month for stock picks and other advice.
</P>
<P>
	   Those membership fees amounted to more than $1.1 million from July 1998
through June 1999, the SEC said in its civil lawsuit filed in federal court in
Chicago. The agency also alleged that Tokyo Joe, 50, a New York City resident
whose real name is Yun Soo Oh Park, illegally touted a stock to investors
without disclosing he had received shares from the company and lied about his
trading performance record.
</P>
<P>
	   In its suit, the SEC is seeking injunctions against Park and his company,
Tokyo Joe's Societe Anonyme, as well as unspecified fines and restitution to
investors.
</P>
<P>
	   Park's attorney, Ira Lee Sorkin, a former top SEC official, said his client
will contest the suit.
</P>
<P>
	   "We intend to defend against the action," Sorkin said. "I would have hoped
that the SEC would have dealt with these issues ... (such as use of the Internet
and day trading) through regulation as opposed to litigation. There are some
very murky issues."
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC's suit was the latest in a string of enforcement actions in recent
years against alleged securities fraud using the Internet. Federal and state
securities regulators say this new form of fraud has been proliferating in
Internet junk mail, online newsletters, electronic "chat rooms" and Web sites.
</P>
<P>
	   Because the Internet is everywhere, unscrupulous stock promoters anywhere in
the world can cloak themselves in anonymity and lure investors across the
country, who have lost millions in such schemes, the regulators say.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Internet has witnessed the rapid growth of Web sites run by
self-proclaimed investment gurus," SEC Enforcement Director Richard Walker said
Wednesday. "Today's action makes clear that we will not tolerate fraudulent
conduct or undisclosed conflicts of interest by those peddling investment advice
on the Internet."
</P>
<P>
	   Park, who never registered with the SEC as an investment adviser, operated
his Societe Anonyme from his home in New York, the agency said in its suit.
</P>
<P>
	   It alleged that Park misled members of Societe Anonyme by failing to
disclose or lying to them about the fact that he already owned -- and was
selling -- the same stocks he was advising them to buy. Park profited by selling
the stocks into the buying flurry he had created by his recommendations, a
practice known as scalping, the SEC said.
</P>
<P>
	   On some occasions, Park advised members to hold a stock for several days or
longer or designated a target stock price while he actually sold the same stock,
sometimes below the target price, the SEC said.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, the regulators alleged, Park posted trading performance results
on his Web site that were "materially false and misleading," in an effort to
recruit new members and get current members to follow his investment
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   EDITOR'S NOTE: The SEC advises people to think twice before investing their
money in stocks or other investments they learn about through the Internet. The
agency has issued a brochure on Internet fraud on its Web site at

	   The company's net income of $1.37 billion was down 28 percent from the year
before and fell short of earnings targets the company had set to warrant bonuses
for top executives, the entertainment giant said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   In a letter to stockholders, chairman and chief executive officer Eisner
summarized Disney's disappointing year as a "short-term earnings hiccup." He
repeated recent assurances that the company was taking steps to improve
long-term prospects, including revitalizing its video division and other
cost-saving measures.
</P>
<P>
	   Eisner received a $5 million bonus in 1998 and $9.9 million the year before.
His 1999 salary was $750,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Vice chairman Roy E. Disney, who drew a salary of $537,692 in 1999, also
received no bonus after getting a total of $1.1 million in extra pay over the
previous two years.
</P>
<P>
	   Other executives going without bonuses last year include vice chairman
Sanford Litvack, who received about $2.6 million in bonuses the previous two
years, and John Cooke, executive vice president for corporate affairs, who got
bonuses totaling about $900,000 the previous two years.
</P>
<P>
	   "When the company has performed well, people are rewarded accordingly," said
Disney spokesman John Dreyer. "We had an off year, so the same thing applies
there."
</P>
<P>
	   The only top executive awarded a bonus was Louis Meisinger, executive
president and general counsel, who received a $350,000 bonus on top of his 1999
salary of $650,000. The bonus was awarded for extraordinary services to the
company, but Dreyer would not disclose details.
</P>
<P>
	   Bonus information was included in materials released in advance of Disney's
annual shareholder meeting Feb. 22 in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
	   Downturns in Disney's home-video and merchandising operations largely
accounted for last year's earnings decline and nominal 2 percent gain in revenue
to $23.4 billion.

<HEADLINE> New Flu Drugs Selling Briskly  </HEADLINE>
    By PHIL GALEWITZ AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- You're tired and achy. Your throat hurts and you can't get
out of bed. Yes, the flu season has arrived.
</P>
<P>
	   The good news is this year doctors have two new prescription drugs in their
arsenal.
</P>
<P>
	   So far the new medicines are selling briskly, spurred by the early onset of
the flu season across the United States as well as intense advertising
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
	   But there are doubts whether the drugs -- Relenza and Tamiflu -- can sustain
the momentum: That's because patients need to start taking the medications
within 48 hours after symptoms appear, and some doctors are not convinced the
relatively expensive medicines will dramatically shorten the suffering.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Glaxo Wellcome, maker of Relenza, and Roche Laboratories, maker of
Tamiflu, are betting they can change the way patients and the medical profession
approaches the ailment that affects up to 50 million people each year and causes
up to 40,000 deaths.
</P>
<P>
	   The drugmakers are targeting cities hit hard by the flu with advertising as
they pitch their medication to doctors. Glaxo has hired Wayne Knight, who played
the pesky mailman Newman on "Seinfeld," to personify the flu bug in its ads.
</P>
<P>
	   Relenza has the early lead. More than 51,000 Relenza prescriptions were
written in the week ending Dec. 24, more than four times the level in the first
week of December, according to IMS Health, a market research firm. Tamiflu,
though, is coming on strong. Tamiflu sold nearly 45,000 prescriptions the same
week, or nearly 10 times more than in the first week of December.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're seeing a nice solid start from both products," said Jeff Chafkin, an
analyst with PaineWebber. "They're not blockbusters, but the early trends look
good."
</P>
<P>
	   Lori Schieri, an administrator at the Hospital of the University of
Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, took Tamiflu just hours after she developed the
bad cough, headache and 101 degree fever associated with the flu. That was on
Friday, Dec. 17. By Saturday night her fever broke. And she was back to work on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was great to feel better so quickly," said Schieri, who recalled the
previous time she had the flu, she was in bed for a week.
</P>
<P>
	   Unlike Schieri, most people either try to get through the flu using
over-the-counter medicines that try to control symptoms. And those who decide to
see a doctor, often do so only after being sick for several days. That's a
problem as the new flu drugs are only useful in the first two days after
symptoms appear. The medicines work by blocking the advance of flu through the
body.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a quagmire because people often wait three days or more to come in,"
said Dr. Thomas Weida, a family doctor in Hershey, Pa.
</P>
<P>
	   Flu can typically last five to 10 days.
</P>
<P>
	   Health experts say neither of the flu drugs should replace flu vaccines --
the shots clearly offer people a better chance at staying flu-free all winter.
The new drugs will help those that neglect to get a shot or those that get sick
even with the vaccine.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a step forward, but not a giant step forward," said Dr. John
Bartlett, chief of infectious diseases at Johns Hopkins University School of
Medicine in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
	   He said because the drug needs to get to patients quickly, some doctors may
be forced to prescribe it over the telephone without seeing the patient.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirms this flu season
started earlier than usual, and has been spotted in all regions of the country.
So far, only Type A, the most common type of influenza, has appeared.
</P>
<P>
	   That's not so good news for the makers of the new flu drugs, which trumpet
their ability to treat both the A and B strains.
</P>
<P>
	   Type A can also be treated by older flu medicines such as the generic drug
amantadine. That anti-viral drug typically sells for $10, compared to the
$45-$65 for Relenza and Tamiflu. Not all insurers cover the new drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   Amantadine also helps reduce the length of the flu but has side effects the
can cause users to lose balance or think clearly. Tamiflu's pill has fewer of
those side effects, but can cause nausea. The main side effects from Relenza are
sinus problems and diarrhea. Because Relenza must be inhaled, it also is not
recommended for patients with asthma or other chronic lung diseases.
</P>
<P>
	   Tamiflu should have an advantage over Relenza simply because most people
prefer a pill over an inhaler, said Myron Holubiak, president of Roche
Laboratories. Both drugs are taken twice a day for five days.

<HEADLINE> Asia Traders Ignore U.S. Rebound  </HEADLINE>
    By DIRK BEVERIDGE AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HONG KONG (AP) -- Asia's two biggest stock markets, Tokyo and Hong Kong,
slid again in early trading today, as traders ignored a rebound on Wall Street
and dumped high-tech shares.
</P>
<P>
	   Smaller Asian exchanges were mixed in the wake of Wednesday's selloff that
hit some places so hard it brought back memories of the way prices had plunged
more than two years ago as the financial crisis spread through the region.
</P>
<P>
	   In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index lost almost 3 percent of its value
Thursday morning, adding to Wednesday's sharp 7.2 percent dive -- its worst
one-day drop since late October 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   After a little more than an hour of trading, the Hang Seng had fallen 457.98
points, or 2.9 percent, to 15,388.74 on Asia's second-biggest market.
</P>
<P>
	   Hong Kong investors had bet wrongly early in the morning that prices would
recover in line with the rebound Wednesday of the New York's Dow Jones
industrial average, which rose 1.1 percent after a 3.2 percent drop on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors pushed futures contracts higher before the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange opened -- only to see share prices fall fast from the start.
</P>
<P>
	   On Asia's top market, the Tokyo Stock Exchange, early losses were not so
steep, but investors were busy bailing out of high-tech companies that have
taken a beating globally.
</P>
<P>
	   A 5.6 percent drop in the U.S. Nasdaq Composite Index on Tuesday sparked the
selloffs, and although the Nasdaq held its losses Wednesday to just 0.6 percent,
traders figured many high-tech companies were still too expensive.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of the big decliners in early Tokyo trading were high-tech giants Sony
and Kyocera. Also hit were Hitachi, Toshiba, NEC, Fujitsu, Matsushita Electric
Industrial, Sharp and TDK.
</P>
<P>
	   "Unless Nasdaq and Internet shares stabilize, we'll see some more
corrections in Japan," said David Shirt, a stock salesman at investment house
Jardine Fleming in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   By the midday break, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues was
down 197.36 points, or 1.1 percent, at 18,345.19. The Nikkei lost 2.4 percent on
Wednesday, after falling as much as 4.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Hidenori Karaki, general manager at Tokyo-Mitsubishi Personal Securities,
said foreign investors were showing interest in some stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   "The market's fundamentals are not bad," Karaki said.
</P>
<P>
	   New Zealand prices closed Thursday with a loss of 1.3 percent, after New
York's better performance failed to improve sentiment.
</P>
<P>
	   Blue chips in Australia, Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia showed modest
rebounds early Thursday, while prices in Singapore and the Philippines were down
slightly.
</P>
<P>
	   Taiwanese stocks continued to buck the trend, with blue chips adding another
1.4 percent early Thursday -- on top of a 1.1 percent gain that made the Taipei
Stock Exchange the region's only winner on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa-Europe Trade Threatened  </HEADLINE>
   By DANIEL J. WAKIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- That icy thimble of spirits called grappa
goes down with a chill and a burn -- and now threatens to bring the roof down on
one of South Africa's great economic projects: a $17 billion free trade
agreement with Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   Italy says it will not ratify the agreement, which was to have gone into
effect on Saturday. The reason: South African distillers make their own version
of the spirit and have the audacity to call it grappa.
</P>
<P>
	   An Italian Foreign Ministry spokesman, speaking Wednesday in Rome, said
Italy would not ratify the deal without a commitment from South Africa that
grappa is a trademark that belongs exclusively to the Italian regions where it
is produced. However, the ministry said later it would be willing to accept a
gradual phasing out of the name by South African distillers.
</P>
<P>
	   Potentially at stake is a far-reaching free trade agreement that cut tariffs
on South Africa's import and export trade with Europe -- a key economic policy
that took four years of lobbying by then-President Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
	   For Italy, it is a question of national tradition. Or maybe spirit.
</P>
<P>
	   Italy produces 40 million bottles of grappa a year, compared to about 30,000
in South Africa. Grappa, the distillation of the sediment left after pressing
grapes to make wine, is entrenched in Italian culture. It is drunk as shots on
ski slopes, a digestive drink after dinner, a side car to an espresso in a
coffee bar, a morning jolt for blue collar workers.
</P>
<P>
	   The colorless liquor, usually about 40 percent alcohol, is often kept in the
freezer and is akin to schnapps.
</P>
<P>
	   In South Africa, grappa has grown more fashionable, although production only
began six years ago and consumption remains small. None of the homemade variety
is exported.
</P>
<P>
	   The Italians ``are jealous that our quality is so high,'' said George Dalla
Cia, who runs the grappa operation at the Meerlust Estate winery near Cape Town,
the largest of three South African grappa producers. Three generations of Dalla
Cia's family made grappa in Italy's Friuli region.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's quite silly, actually. Grappa is not a region at all, like champagne
or cognac. It's more a generic name. So where do you really draw the line? Will
they want to protect the name pizza and pasta afterwards?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The matter is anything but silly to Luigi Odello, national secretary of the
National Grappa Institute in Brescia, Italy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Grappa is only Italian, both by tradition and etymology,'' he said, saying
the word comes from ``krappa,'' used by the medieval Lombard people of northern
Italy. Traditionally, it has been produced from Italian vines, by Italians,
using traditional Italian methods.
</P>
<P>
	   And, he triumphantly concludes, the European Union gave Italy the exclusive
rights to the ``grappa'' name in 1989.
</P>
<P>
	   The grappa grapple is only the latest obstacle to hold up the agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of a separate ``wine and spirits'' pact, South Africa agreed to
phase out the use of ``sherry'' and ``port,'' under pressure from Spain and
Portugal. The Greeks have threatened over Ouzo and the Irish over Irish whiskey.
</P>
<P>
	   All 15 members of the European Union have to ratify the agreement for it to
take permanent effect. Italy's action appears to have flummoxed even the EU,
whose lawyers were studying the legal implications on Wednesday. It was unclear
whether Italy had the power to undermine the entire pact or just the separate
wine and spirits accord.
</P>
<P>
	   Nevertheless, South African grappa makers can read between the lines.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think we will eventually have to change the name, because of what it
could mean to South Africa -- the loss of millions of rands,'' Dalla Cia said.
``It's not very fair.''

<HEADLINE> Judge Defends Comments in Sex Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A judge who said in court ``it takes two to tango'' in
sentencing a man for having sex with an 11-year-old girl made a victim of the
child, a prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The judge blamed the little girl and not the defendant,'' said Doug
Gansler, the state's attorney for suburban Montgomery County, Md. ``He
victimized the victim.''
</P>
<P>
	   In July, the girl's mother found Vladimir Chacon-Bonilla in her daughter's
closet with his pants down. The pair met in an Internet chat room and the girl
told police the sex was consensual. Chacon-Bonilla claimed he thought she was
17, and later pleaded guilty to committing a second-degree sex offense.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, Montgomery County Circuit Court Judge Durke G. Thompson
sentenced Chacon-Bonilla to 18 months in prison. But in open court, Thompson
noted that the girl had invited Chacon-Bonilla into her bed and said ``it takes
two to tango.''
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement, the judge defended his decision.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The sentence exceeded the recommendation from the Department of Parole and
Probation,'' Thompson wrote. He also cited the fact that this was
Chacon-Bonilla's first offense.
</P>
<P>
	   His attorney, Rebecca Nitkin, insisted her client is ``absolutely not a
predator.''
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Gansler said that because Chacon is a citizen of El Salvador, he will
urge federal authorities to deport him.

	   DURHAM. N.H. (AP) -- Democratic presidential hopeful Bill Bradley accused Al
Gore Wednesday night of deliberately distorting his proposal to expand health
coverage, but the vice president shot back in the first debate of the election
year that his rival's plan would leave many New Hampshire residents "high and
dry." Prodded by debate moderator Peter Jennings to say whether Gore had ever
taken a quote or vote out of context, Bradley instantly replied, "Yes." The vice
president, Bradley said, "offended me" by claiming he would hurt
African-Americans and Latinos and by saying his health care plan would

failing to publish a schedule of troop withdrawals and army-base closures in

<HEADLINE> Blumenthal says Purple Heart Museum money was mismanaged  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - After spending nearly $620,000 of public and
private money, the organizers of the National Purple Heart Museum have nothing
to show but a $33,000 set of blueprints, according to a report by the state's
Attorney General.
<P>
	   Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said Joseph Donahue, the project's
former executive director, squandered donations and mismanaged cash that was
supposed to build the museum in Enfield.
</P>
<P>
	   Blumenthal said bookkeeping records for the National Purple Heart Museum
Committee Inc. were so incomplete that it is nearly impossible to track how and
when money was spent.
</P>
<P>
	   The committee, which was formed in 1986 to build a museum dedicated to
recipients of the Purple Heart service award, received two state grants. In
1992, they received $250,000 for planing and design costs, and $1 million in
1998. Half of the $1 million grant was supposed to be matched with private
donations.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1997, Persian Gulf War commander Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf took a post
on the museum's advisory board.
</P>
<P>
	   But after spending about $500,000 of the state money and another $120,000 of
private donations, the only thing the organization has to show is a $33,000
architectural design plan for the museum, Blumenthal said.
</P>
<P>
	   The organization has also failed to collect the $18.75 million of private
donations that it promised to raise in its 1997 state grant application,
Blumenthal said.
</P>
<P>
	   According to Blumenthal's investigation, Donahue took a $6,000 private
donation for the museum, kept $500 and funneled the rest to his wife's bank
account in Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   Blumenthal is referring the case to the chief state's attorney for possible
criminal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
	   Donahue left his post as executive director last year. A spokesperson for
the attorney general said Donahue has moved out of Connecticut, and Purple Heart
museum officials said he is working in the Washington, D.C. area. Attempts by
The Associated Press to reach Donahue through listings in that area were not
successful.
</P>
<P>
	   Blumenthal's report also criticizes the museum's board of directors for not
keeping closer tabs on Donahue.
</P>
<P>
	   "The board of directors repeatedly failed to address the financial condition
of (the museum project) or exercise proper oversight of its executive director,"
Blumenthal wrote in his report.
</P>
<P>
	   Chuck Alfano, the museum project's current executive director, said the
board has set up more oversight of his office.
</P>
<P>
	   Alfano said public funds have been withheld from the project while
Blumenthal has been investigating the mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think this will have a negative effect initially," Alfano said. "But I'm
confident this museum can be built."

<HEADLINE> Spending caps and public financing top senators' list for reform  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn (AP) - The state Senate's top Democrats want to put a cap
on campaign fund-raising and allow for public financing of some races through
taxpayer donations.
<P>
	   Senate President Pro Tempore Kevin Sullivan and Senate Majority Leader
George Jepsen say spending caps will eliminate an unfair fundraising advantage
enjoyed by incumbents and prevent candidates from building exorbitant campaign
war chests.
</P>
<P>
	   "We believe the caps we have proposed are fair, and we believe they are also
strict and reasonable," Sullivan, D-West Hartford, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Under their proposal, caps would begin in 2002 with gubernatorial candidates
allowed to raise $5 million. Candidates for other statewide offices could
collect $750,000. State senate races would be capped at $105,000 and candidates
in House races could raise $40,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Voluntary public financing would kick in for the 2002 gubernatorial
election, and would start in 2006 for all statewide offices. Money for campaigns
would come via a check-off on the state income tax form that would allow a $5
contribution taken out of any refund.
</P>
<P>
	   The public financing would be a dollar-for-dollar match to the candidate's
private fundraising. That means a gubernatorial candidate could raise $2.5
million from private sources and be eligible for $2.5 million in public
financing to stay within the cap.
</P>
<P>
	   During the last gubernatorial race, Gov. John G. Rowland raised $6.4
million. His opponent, Barbara Kennelly, raised $2.4 million.
</P>
<P>
	   In order to receive the public money, candidates would not be allowed to
exceed the spending caps. If a candidate's opponent broke the cap, he would
receive a match of just 50 cents on the dollar.
</P>
<P>
	   Sullivan and Jepsen said legislative candidates should not be eligible for
public financing, largely because it would be too expensive.
</P>
<P>
	   Campaign spending caps have been ruled unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme
Court, and Republican leaders blasted the proposal as an infringement on the
First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
	   "I find it shocking that they're suggesting the First Amendment be
rewritten," said Rep. Robert Ward, R-North Branford."I call upon them to come
back to their senses."
</P>
<P>
	   Sullivan and Jepsen say they're ready for a court battle to test the
legality of spending caps, and campaign finance reform advocates say it's time
to clamp down on the amount of money in politics.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a very strong step," said Karen Hobert Flynn, executive director of
Common Cause in Connecticut. "This has never been taken up by the Senate, so
this proposal is extraordinarily significant."
</P>
<P>
	   A bill that would have allowed for public financing of any candidate who
agreed to spending limits was debated in the House last year, but never made it
to a final vote.
</P>
<P>
	   But following former state Treasurer Paul Silvester's guilty plea to federal
corruption charges stemming from illegal fund-raising, lawmakers and state
agencies have been refocused on campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
	   The state Elections Enforcement Commission voted last month to restrict
contributions from political action committees and political party committees
who now can donate as much as they choose. Lobbyists and their PACs would be
able to donate less to candidates for the Legislature and statewide offices as
well as to party committees.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the plan by Jepsen and Sullivan, candidates would be prohibited from
raising money for themselves or others from anyone doing state business that the
candidate may control while in office.
</P>
<P>
	   Sullivan and Jepsen said they may be willing to change the provisions of
their plan and tinker with the spending caps.
</P>
<P>
	   "We don't view this as the final word on public financing," said Jepsen,
D-Stamford. "We view it as a positive step forward in helping to frame the
debate in the coming months."
</P>
<P>
	   Rowland has said he is open to all campaign finance reform ideas, but would
not comment directly on the proposal made by Jepsen and Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
	   Rowland spokesman Dean Pagani said the governor plans to meet with
legislative leaders within the next month to discuss campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
	   "His hope is that they could come to some agreement about a proposal that
could be put forth in the Legislature," Pagani said.

<HEADLINE> Ex-N.J. Police Chief Gets 4 Years  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) -- A former police chief has been sentenced to four years
in prison for leading a band of rogue officers in what prosecutors say was the
most corrupt department in New Jersey history.
</P>
<P>
	   Retired West New York Police Chief Alexander V. Oriente ``represented a
nightmare scenario in law enforcement,'' U.S. Attorney Robert J. Cleary said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors say Oriente and members of his 140-officer department took
hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes and kickbacks from 1989 to 1997 to
shield prostitutes, illicit liquor sales and illegal gambling operations in the
town of 50,000 just across the Hudson River from New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   Oriente, 67, said the corruption began almost as soon as he joined the
force. He retired in 1997 after a 40-year career in West New York.
</P>
<P>
	   He apologized in court, adding ``I know that the things I did in the police
department were not correct, but I have started a new life.''
</P>
<P>
	   Oriente struck a deal with federal prosecutors after a 69-count racketeering
indictment returned in January 1998 named him and nine current or former West
New York police officers.
</P>
<P>
	   Oriente pleaded guilty to a single count each of racketeering and conspiracy
to defraud the IRS by failing to report $80,000 in bribes on his income tax
returns.
</P>
<P>
	   He received a reduced sentence for testifying against four officers, the
only defendants to go to trial among more than 30 charged in the case. He also
must pay a $50,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the chief of police is corrupt who is going to police them?'' U.S.
District Judge Jerome Simandle asked during Oriente's sentencing. ``When the
chief goes bad, a great deal suffers. It was not a pretty sight.''

<HEADLINE> Miami Trooper Claims Cover Up  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- A state trooper investigating the deaths of two brothers in a
crash blamed on a drunken FBI agent said he was ordered to sign a report falsely
blaming the victims.
</P>
<P>
	   Highway Patrol Trooper Rene Guillen said he was told by supervisors what to
put in the report on the Nov. 23 accident on Interstate 95, The Miami Herald
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The family of brothers Maurice Williams, 23, and Craig Chambers, 19, said
the investigation was tailored to protect FBI agent David Farrall at the expense
of the brothers' reputation. The FBI and the patrol have rejected those
assertions.
</P>
<P>
	   It took more than a month for the patrol to identify Farrall as the driver
at fault. He was later placed on paid leave.
</P>
<P>
	   Farrall, 36, was going the wrong way and driving with a blood-alcohol level
more than double the state limit, the Highway Patrol said. He has not been
charged.
</P>
<P>
	   Highway Patrol rules prohibit Guillen, 23, from commenting directly on an
active accident investigation. He gave an account to his union representative,
who briefed the Herald.
</P>
<P>
	   Guillen said his senior officers assumed that because Farrall was an FBI
agent, he couldn't have been traveling the wrong way on I-95. With less than a
year's experience on the force, Guillen deferred to more seasoned investigators,
said his representative, Cpl. Ed Hotaling.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Judge OKs Adoption Annulment  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- A man whose adoptive parents bought him from a baby
broker for $200 has had his illegal adoption annulled. His birth certificate
will be amended with his biological mother's name.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am very elated,'' said Michael Chalek, who received the court order
Monday. ``The albatross on my head for the past 38 years is gone.''
</P>
<P>
	   Chalek, 47, a former Boca Raton resident now living in Estes Park, Colo.,
told Circuit Judge Maurice Giunta last month that he wanted his adoption
annulled because his adoptive parents, both of whom are dead, sexually and
physically abused him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I had a mother who fondled me until I was 11,'' Chalek said.
</P>
<P>
	   Chalek's attorney, Mallory Horne, presented evidence from a divorce record
that Chalek's adoptive mother had a violent temper and was promiscuous. The
details of the divorce had been withheld from adoption officials.
</P>
<P>
	   Chalek was born Jan. 25, 1952, in Jacksonville to Winnie Faye Higginbotham
Yarber, a barroom waitress who had separated from her husband and became
pregnant by another man. Eight days after the birth, records show the child went
home with Alex and Adela Chalek, who had sought help from baby broker Lenora
Fielding.
</P>
<P>
	   At 11, Chalek found out he had been adopted and became intent on finding out
about his birth family. In 1998, a judge granted Chalek access to his
confidential records -- something rarely done in Florida without a compelling
medical need.
</P>
<P>
	   Amid the 100 pages were notes from state caseworkers that showed Mrs.
Fielding coerced Mrs. Yarber into using a false name on adoption documents and
that Mrs. Yarber had asked a state worker if she could get her baby back.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Yarber, who has since remarried, was contacted by Chalek in December
1998 and supported his effort to get the adoption annulled. His birth father
died in the 1970s.

<HEADLINE> Former Mass. Gov. Now a New Yorker  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- William Weld began his first day as a New Yorker with a grand
claim: If he decided to run for the state's top job in 2006, he could well
become only the second American elected governor of two states.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'd be hard to stop,'' Weld said in a telephone interview Wednesday with
The Associated Press from his New York law office.
</P>
<P>
	   Should Weld succeed, he would join Sam Houston as the only two-state
governor in history. Houston was governor of Tennessee from 1827 to 1829 and
Texas from 1859 to 1861.
</P>
<P>
	   Weld's claim to political viability in a new state may not be far-fetched.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If anyone can do it, Bill Weld can do it,'' said Gov. Paul Cellucci,
Weld's running mate and lieutenant governor for six years. ``He certainly was
the person who led our state back from some pretty tough times -- he'll always
be remembered fondly.''
</P>
<P>
	   Before he had even carried his suitcase into his Upper East Side apartment,
Weld was chatting about his roots in Long Island's Smithtown and his vacation
homes in the Adirondacks.
</P>
<P>
	   The moderate Republican's not-so-subtle message: He's no carpetbagger,
unlike Hillary Rodham Clinton, who also moved to New York state on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton -- who became friends with Weld when they were both young
lawyers working on the Watergate hearings -- is running for Senate from her new
home in Chappaqua, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
	   Weld, 54, cannot run for governor until he satisfies New York's five-year
residency requirement for the post. And he said he wouldn't challenge his two
New York pals -- Gov. George Pataki or New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who
hired him as a federal prosecutor in 1981 -- if either one were to run for
governor in 2006.
</P>
<P>
	   Brainy, funny and unpredictable -- he once dived, fully clothed, into the
Charles River after signing an environmental bill -- Weld strongly appealed to
suburban voters.
</P>
<P>
	   He also attracted Irish and Italian voters, despite his patrician lineage
that includes his namesake, William Floyd, who signed the Declaration of
Independence from New York.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I may be a tightly wound Yankee, but that's not how I feel,'' Weld said.
``I feel much more ethnic. I think I was separated at birth from an
Irish-Italian mother.''
</P>
<P>
	   He narrowly won his long-shot campaign for governor in 1990 on a platform of
fighting crime, reforming welfare and cutting taxes. Over the next four years,
heavily Democratic Massachusetts came to like his brand of fiscal conservatism
and social liberalism and re-elected him by a landslide five years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   He has a notoriously short attention span, however, and soon got bored.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Governor is the longest I've ever had a job,'' Weld said.
</P>
<P>
	   He challenged incumbent John Kerry for the Senate in 1996 and lost. The next
year he resigned, and President Clinton nominated him as ambassador to Mexico.
But Sen. Jesse Helms thought Weld too liberal, and blocked the nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Since then, he has written two suspense novels, ``Mackerel by Moonlight''
and ``Big Ugly.''
</P>
<P>
	   These days, he said, he is fully engaged as managing partner at McDermott,
Will &AMP; Emery's New York office, where he has been busy buying and selling
companies. ``I'm enjoying that,'' he said. ``I've got a reasonably steep
learning curve.''
</P>
<P>
	   He will not sell his house in Cambridge, where his five children grew up.
His wife, Susan Roosevelt Weld, lectures at Harvard University and Boston
College.
</P>
<P>
	   If he does run in 2006, he will first have to win the hearts and minds of
New York Republicans and Conservative Party members.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Bill Weld would face the high prospect of a Republican primary,'' New York
consultant Jay Severin said. ``If he gets beyond that, `President Weld' is a
very plausible phrase.''

<HEADLINE> Bradley accuses Gore of deliberately distorting his health care  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   DURHAM. N.H. (AP) - Democratic presidential hopeful Bill Bradley accused
Al Gore Wednesday night of deliberately distorting his proposal to expand health
coverage, but the vice president shot back in the first debate of the election
year that his rival's plan would leave many New Hampshire residents "high and
dry."
<P>
	   Prodded by debate moderator Peter Jennings to say whether Gore had ever
taken a quote or vote out of context, Bradley instantly replied, "Yes."
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president, Bradley said, "offended me" by claiming he would hurt
African-Americans and Latinos and by saying his health care plan would
shortchange many Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   But Gore, standing a few feet away on a University of New Hampshire stage,
paraphrased Harry Truman's famous utterance: "I'm not giving him hell. I'm just
telling the truth and he thinks it's hell."
</P>
<P>
	   Gore held aloft a card that he said characterized Bradley's health plan and
contended the people of New Hampshire "would be left out, left high and dry" by
Bradley's plan.
</P>
<P>
	   "Let me tell you how the private sector works," retorted back Bradley, a
former New Jersey senator, adding that health insurance companies would quickly
try to fashion coverage to meet the new demand.
</P>
<P>
	   The exchange came one-third of the way through the 60-minute debate, the
first in a series of confrontations in which Democrats and Republicans will take
turns debating in the run-up to the first balloting of the presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore is the national front-runner by far, but Bradley has mounted a
surprisingly strong challenge for the Democratic nomination, and is even or
ahead in the polling in advance of the first primary set for Feb. 1 in New
Hampshire. That prompted the vice president to allude to his "underdog" status.
</P>
<P>
	   "Your underdog pitch brings tears to my eyes," Bradley said wryly.
</P>
<P>
	   Said Gore: "I hope my upset victory brings tears to your eyes on Feb. 1."
</P>
<P>
	   Predictably, the reaction of voters in the audience was mixed.
</P>
<P>
	   Laura Akeley, a University of New Hampshire art student, said she arrived a
Gore a supporter and was leaving a Gore supporter, although she conceded "I can
see now why a lot of people support Bill Bradley."
</P>
<P>
	   Doug Mayer, 35, a radio talk-show producer from Randolph, said he had been
undecided, but was walking out whole-heartedly behind Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   The two candidates agreed on the need for stricter gun control laws and on
letting gays serve in the military. But Gore went further, saying he would not
appoint anyone to the Joint Chiefs of Staff who disagreed with his position on
homosexuals in the Armed Forces.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley suggested he would not need to resort to any such litmus test. "When
you're president, you are commander-in-chief and you issue orders. And soldiers
are good soldiers. And they follow your orders. ... whatever the policy is."
</P>
<P>
	   The rivals came prepared for battle, clashing on local issues - including
development within the White Mountain National Forest in northern New Hampshire
- as well as national concerns.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, who likes to boast of a candidacy of big ideas, said Gore was "in a
Washington bunker." That's understandable, he said, given the Republican
Congress, the Democratic fund-raising scandals and impeachment. "But the reality
is, the Democratic party shouldn't be in the Washington bunker with you," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore responded, "I'm proud that I stayed and fought against the Gingrich
Congress."
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley launched a sharp attack on the Clinton-Gore administration's
handling of relations with Russia, saying the United States had not pushed hard
enough in the last eight years to reduce the stockpile of nuclear weapons and
had agreed to send international aid to Russia "knowing that corruption was
rampant."
</P>
<P>
	   Gore issued a defense, saying, "I think that in spite of the problems there
have been some successes, including a new leader committed to reform, a free
press and free elections."
</P>
<P>
	   The two men were given the chance to pose questions to one another, and Gore
used his turn to ask Bradley whether he believed he had made a mistake on any of
three votes he had cast: in favor of Ronald Reagan's budget cuts in 1981,
opposed to authorizing the ground war against Iraq in 1990 and against the
welfare reform law that President Clinton signed into law. Bradley defended each
vote.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said, "I think all three were mistakes." While serving in Congress,
Gore voted against the budget cuts and in favor of using force in Kuwait and as
vice president supported the welfare law.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said he was worried that Bradley had refused to own up to any mistakes,
and was worried about that quality in a president.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley broke in to cite what he said was an error he had made: his vote in
1987 against confirmation of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. "Now that
was a mistake," he said to laughter from the audience.
</P>
<P>
	   While Bradley said Gore was guilty of campaign distortions, Gore said he
wouldn't level that charge against his rival.
</P>
<P>
	   "I won't accuse him of that. If you want a no, I'll give you a no," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The opening question referred to Clinton and his sexual relationship with
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said that anytime a president or public official lies, he undermines
his authority. But he offered no criticism of Gore's behavior during the
yearlong impeachment struggle.
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president said he thought he had served "the national interest
well" during that period, making plain his disapproval of Clinton's actions, yet
defending him against what he said was an unwarranted Republican attempt to
remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
	   For his part, despite a candidacy that boasts of time spent out of public
life, Bradley said politics is a "noble profession. I don't think it's corrupt
or deceitful ... The only way you are going to achieve something is through
politics," he said.

<HEADLINE> Hypertension Studied by Country  </HEADLINE>
    By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   American and Northern European men with high blood pressure are three times
more likely to die of a heart attack than men with the same blood pressure from
Japan or the Mediterranean coast of Europe, researchers reported today in the
New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
	   Although genetics may explain some of the difference, diet also plays an
important part, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
	   "As compared with the diets in Northern Europe and the United States, the
Mediterranean diet at base line contained less meat and fewer dairy products,
but more olive oil, fish, fruits, vegetables and alcohol," they said.
</P>
<P>
	   Researchers from the Netherlands analyzed data on 12,031 middle-aged men in
six geographic areas and found that in every region, the risk of death from
coronary heart disease increased as blood pressure rose.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall, the risk of death rose 28 percent for each 10-point increase in
systolic blood pressure (the first number in the blood pressure reading) or each
5-point increase in diastolic blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
	   But the number of deaths varied widely from place to place.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, among men with a systolic blood pressure of 140, there were
about 70 deaths per 10,000 person-years in Northern Europe and the United
States, compared with 20 deaths in Japan and the Mediterranean. A person-year is
a measure of the number of years lived by the participants after the study
began.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Richard Pasternak, a spokesman for the American Heart Association and
director of preventive cardiology at Massachusetts General Hospital, said the
research provides further evidence that lifestyle, not genetics, should be the
main focus of efforts to prevent heart disease.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you eliminate the factors that we know about, which are largely
lifestyle issues -- smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, lack of
exercise and diabetes -- you can eliminate somewhere between 70 and 90 percent
of disease in our population," Pasternak said.
</P>
<P>
	   For a long time, doctors have defined high blood pressure as 140 over 90 and
higher. But the study adds to a growing body of evidence that people who fall
below that mark can still benefit significantly by cutting their blood pressure
further.
</P>
<P>
	   "This makes it clear the risk is pretty continuous," Pasternak said. "Taking
someone from 135 to 125 would lower their risk by 25 or 30 percent."
</P>
<P>
	   The study also suggests that doctors in Northern Europe, the United States
and other high-risk areas should treat high and moderately elevated blood
pressure more aggressively than doctors in Japan and the Mediterranean, said Dr.
Teri Manolio, who directs several large heart-disease studies for the National
Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.
</P>
<P>
	   The men were enrolled in the study between 1958 and 1964 and followed for 25
years. They were 40 to 59 years old when they joined the study.
</P>
<P>
	   After adjusting for age, smoking and cholesterol levels, the study found the
highest rates of death from coronary heart disease among Northern European and
American men. Serbian and inland southern European men had average death rates,
and Japanese and Mediterranean European men had the lowest.
</P>
<P>
	   The study was led by Peggy van den Hoogen of the National Institute of
Public Health and the Environment in Bilthoven, the Netherlands.

<HEADLINE> NBC Announces Agreement With NAACP  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Change the racial makeup behind the camera and what happens
on the television screen is likely to change, too.
</P>
<P>
	   That's the philosophy behind a deal struck Wednesday between NBC and the
NAACP, which has been pressuring the network ever since concluding that its fall
schedule was a "virtual whitewash," largely devoid of black actors.
</P>
<P>
	   NBC has agreed to systematically find more minorities to write, produce and
direct its television shows, and decide what goes on the air. It removes the
threat of a boycott against the network.
</P>
<P>
	   Similar agreements are near for CBS, ABC and Fox, said Kweisi Mfume,
president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. ABC
said it had already reached one.
</P>
<P>
	   "NBC has gotten the message," Mfume said. "It's not to say that the others
have not, but they have not acted as swiftly."
</P>
<P>
	   Although the NAACP was moved to address the issue based on what the networks
were showing on the air, the deal almost exclusively affects people behind the
cameras.
</P>
<P>
	   NBC has agreed to hire at least one new minority writer next fall for all of
its second-year shows, and is encouraging producers to hire minorities in
creative positions. The network will also boost support for various job training
and internship programs to get more minorities.
</P>
<P>
	   NBC has also promised to double its purchasing from minority-owned
businesses over the next 18 months, for an additional $10 million in spending.
Mfume and top NBC executives will run an all-day seminar next month for
producers and studio heads to come up with more ideas.
</P>
<P>
	   The network also pledged to discourage the practice of assigning minority
writers to programs largely with minority themes.
</P>
<P>
	   The NAACP had threatened a boycott of one or some networks during an
important ratings "sweeps" month. Mfume said if negotiations with other networks
don't bear fruit within the next 10 days, the NAACP may still resort to a

	   The toughest part of the often-tense negotiations with the NAACP came in
admitting the network needed to do more, said NBC President Bob Wright. NBC
thought it was doing well in this area, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our goal is to make it unequivocally clear that NBC is committed to
diversity," Wright said.

<P>
	   Mfume recalled how, as a youngster, it was so unusual to see black people on
television that he ran around his neighborhood to alert people when one was on.
When Bill Cosby was hired as a regular cast member of "I Spy" in the 1960s, it
was a groundbreaking moment.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the 1970s, television has regressed in its depiction of minorities --
and both TV executives and the NAACP must share the blame, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "People took their eyes off the issue and assumed the issue would take care
of itself," he said.

<HEADLINE> Ultrasound May Detect Fetus Anemia  </HEADLINE>
    By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Ultrasound can detect virtually all cases of life-threatening anemia in
fetuses, sparing many pregnant women the need for a riskier surgical test,
according to a study in today's New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
	   Serious anemia occurs in a small percentage of fetuses who inherit certain
types of red blood cells from their fathers. If the mother doesn't have the same
type, her immune system may form antibodies that attack the fetus's red blood
cells, causing serious complications and even death in the fetus.
</P>
<P>
	   The study found that ultrasound was 100 percent effective at detecting
moderate or severe fetal anemia.
</P>
<P>
	   Researchers used ultrasound to measure the speed of blood moving through the
middle cerebral artery in 112 fetuses at risk for anemia.
</P>
<P>
	   The lower the level of red blood cells and the life-giving oxygen they
carry, the faster the fetus's heart pumps, trying to get oxygen to the brain.
The study found that fetuses in which the blood velocity was more than 1 1/2
times normal had either moderate or severe anemia, necessitating a blood
transfusion before the 34th week of pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
	   The diagnosis was confirmed with the current standard test for fetal anemia:
cordocentesis, which involves inserting a needle through the mother's uterus and
into the umbilical cord to withdraw fetal blood.
</P>
<P>
	   An estimated 14,000 pregnancies in the United States each year involve a
risk of fetal anemia. Currently, all of those mothers must undergo repeated
cordocentesis, even though only about 10 percent to 20 percent of the fetuses
will actually develop serious anemia, said Dr. Giancarlo Mari, a Yale University
researcher who led the study.
</P>
<P>
	   Cordocentesis carries a risk of infection, bleeding and fetal death, and
also increases the likelihood the mother will develop the antibodies that cause
serious fetal anemia in the first place.
</P>
<P>
	   Ultrasound diagnosis would allow most at-risk mothers to avoid
cordocentesis, which would be needed only to confirm the presence of anemia
after it is detected by ultrasound, Mari said.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is the problem -- we do invasive procedures in 80 to 90 percent of
pregnant women who do not need anything," Mari said.
</P>
<P>
	   The most common type of fetal anemia occurs when the mother's blood is
Rh-negative and the fetus's blood is Rh-positive. Screening for the Rh factor is
nearly universal in developed countries and a simple treatment is available to
prevent antibody formation.

<HEADLINE> Strep Prevention in Pregnancy Helps  </HEADLINE>
    By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   A U.S. public health effort to detect and treat streptococcus B in pregnant
women has cut the rate of strep in newborns by 65 percent, researchers reported
today in the New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
	   The most dramatic decrease came among black newborns, who got streptococcus
B at nearly twice the rate of white newborns when the study began in 1993. The
rate of infection for black infants fell from about 2.5 per 1,000 live births to
0.8 in 1998, close to the 1998 rate for white infants of 0.5.
</P>
<P>
	   Streptococcus B can cause death or disabilities, including mental
retardation, vision and hearing problems, in newborns infected while passing
through the birth canal. Transmission can be prevented by giving infected women
antibiotics during labor.
</P>
<P>
	   The study involved monitoring, testing and treatment for the disease in
eight areas of the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The number of cases of newborn streptococcus B dropped steeply after joint
guidelines for prevention were issued in 1996 by the American Academy of
Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the study found. The study was led
by Stephanie Schrag of the CDC.

<HEADLINE> End Nears for Century-Old Okla. Farm  </HEADLINE>
    By RENEE RUBLE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   THOMAS, Okla. (AP) -- Miles from the closest paved road squats a small
A-frame house. Its wooden frame is sunken, as if the home just exhaled another
moment in its century-old life.
</P>
<P>
	   A petite, elderly woman in a flowered cotton smock shuffles in the kitchen.
Dinner time is approaching and the men should be returning from the fields.
</P>
<P>
	   Alice Horton spreads out shortening and flour for a pie crust. The
85-year-old hands press on a wooden rolling pin that is older than the state of
Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
	   On this summer day, her 78-year-old brother Ed soon will be driven by hunger
and heat from the wheat fields.
</P>
<P>
	   Their parents started the homestead, and with 10 children -- six boys and
four girls -- it quickly became the community's social spot. It was one of the
first homes in the area to have a radio. Families would travel miles to hear
election results from the big, brown box.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, everyone stays home to watch cable television and eat microwaveable
food, she says.
</P>
<P>
	   At high noon, life erupts in a small, white dog that begins a piercing bark.
A short, pudgy man in overalls and a cap enters the kitchen. Ed Horton washes
his hands then checks the oven.
</P>
<P>
	   The Horton farm has survived the worst of Mother Nature -- the Dust Bowl --
and the worst of humankind -- two world wars. But what threatens the homestead's
future is close at heart.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't know what will happen when Ed and I are gone," Miss Horton says.
Neither one married. They only have each other and the farm.
</P>
<P>
	   No one gathers in town on the weekend anymore. The one-room schoolhouse is
gone. Most of the food has to be purchased. The trendy eats are disappointing.
The pair once substituted their meat and potato supper for a pizza.
</P>
<P>
	   "It wasn't good," she says. "No, no, Ed didn't care for it."
</P>
<P>
	   Over the years, Horton has seen machinery replace horses. Prayers have given
way to pesticides. And their friends' children have been seduced by city lights.
</P>
<P>
	   "Neighbors would help neighbors," he says. "Now you don't even know them.
You don't have to."
</P>
<P>
	   About one in seven Oklahomans was a farmer in 1900. Today, about one in 46
Oklahomans farm, the state Department of Agriculture says. The average size of a
farm has doubled.
</P>
<P>
	   But the profits farmers make are stuck in the past. The latest state figures
show that in 1997 the average net income for a farmer was $6,145.
</P>
<P>
	   Why do some continue to do it? Why do they work 12-hour days, seven-day
weeks, in scorching and freezing conditions without vacations to earn thousands
below the poverty level?
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a good life. This is what we all did, this is home," Horton says. "I'm
on my own and work for myself. I wouldn't change it. I would do it again."
</P>
<P>
	   The clock approaches one. The ice in the tea has melted. Horton shifts in
his chair.
</P>
<P>
	   He works for his brothers and sisters who died. For the farmers who didn't
make it through the droughts and the homesteads that fell to corporate
competition. And he will keep farming in the new century.
</P>
<P>
	   Someday, Horton says, he will retire -- "When I'm six feet under."
</P>
<P>
	   Until then, the wheat awaits.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Mom Died Saving Son  </HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN GUTKIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CARMEN DE URIA, Venezuela (AP) -- When Venezuela's killer floods ravaged her
home, Andrea Prada lifted her 7-year-old son high above her head so he could
cling to a wooden beam for his life.
</P>
<P>
	   She didn't let go, even as an avalanche of water, mud and boulders crashed
down a mountain overlooking this seaside town and into the house.
</P>
<P>
	   Then Vangelis Prada felt his mother's hands go cold.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I told her 'wake up, Mommy, wake up!''' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
	   But Mrs. Prada did not wake up. She was among as many as 30,000 victims of
the mudslides unleashed Dec. 15.
</P>
<P>
	   Her husband Oscar also died; of those in the house, only Vangelis and his
66-year-old grandmother, Rosario Segarra, survived.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Segarra, who survived in an air pocket inside a bathroom, held her
grandson as he described what happened the morning his parents drowned.
</P>
<P>
	   Their eyes bloodshot, their lips swollen from infection, and their bodies
bruised and stitched, they spoke to The Associated Press on the day last week
when Vangelis was released from Caracas' Children's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   As he gripped the beam begging his mother to respond, a wall collapsed,
giving Vangelis a concussion and a thick gash on his back. But the boy remained
conscious, holding on while the world around him crumbled in a deluge of mud and
water.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Prada -- a schoolteacher in Carmen de Uria -- may have done what most
any mother would do, but to her sister Elizabeth Granados, she was a hero.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She was a person of extraordinary spiritual values. Only someone like that
would give her life to save her child in the way that she did,'' Mrs. Granados
said.
</P>
<P>
	   When the waters subsided, Vangelis' grandmother crawled out of the bathroom
and found him badly hurt but still alive.
</P>
<P>
	   She comforted him for hours until a rescue worker came and pried Vangelis
from beneath the collapsed wall. The boy and his grandmother made their way to a
school where Mrs. Segarra spent a harrowing night trying to stem the child's
bleeding.
</P>
<P>
	   Help arrived by helicopter the next day, but only Vangelis was allowed to
board since helicopter space was reserved only for the most severely injured.
</P>
<P>
	   Vangelis spent two weeks in the hospital, most of it in intensive care.
Today he lives with relatives in the capital, Caracas, where he cries himself to
sleep at night and is getting help from a government psychologist. His
12-year-old sister, who was in Caracas and out of harm's way when the avalanches
hit, is still unable to discuss what happened.
</P>
<P>
	   Their two-story house, which their grandmother and her late husband built 35
years ago, has been reduced to rubble. Truck-sized boulders that tumbled down
the mountain litter the area where the house once stood.
</P>
<P>
	   Two weeks after the mudslides, Vangelis' father's body still lay in a body
bag in front of the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
	   Returning last week to the ruins, Vangelis' aunt, Mrs. Granados, placed a
strip of white tape reading ``Oscar Prada'' on the body bag.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was always talking about how the world was going to end because people
were destroying the planet,'' said Mrs. Granados, who also lost her home to the
landslides in a nearby town.
</P>
<P>
	   Carmen de Uria is a ghost town now: A handful of national guardsmen fend off
looters and a few residents load belongings into vehicles. Most of the town was
simply washed into the Caribbean Sea.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Granados returned to the schoolhouse where her sister taught and her
nephew studied.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is her handwriting,'' she said of a lively poster describing magic
and fantasy. Mrs. Prada, she said, loved music and painting and passed along
that passion to her children.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Prada, whose body was dug up from the rubble more than a week after the
landslides, was buried Tuesday without ceremony in a numbered coffin along with
14 other mudslide victims at a Caracas cemetery.

<HEADLINE> Lakers 118, Clippers 101  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Shaquille O'Neal had 40 points and 19 rebounds Wednesday
night as the Los Angeles Lakers pulled away in the fourth quarter to beat the
Los Angeles Clippers 118-101 for their 12th straight victory.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Neal, who came out of the game for good with 6:49 remaining and the Lakers
leading 94-81, just missed the third 40-point, 20-rebound game of his career.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Neal had 38 points and 15 rebounds a night earlier to lead the Lakers past
the Clippers 122-98.
</P>
<P>
	   The Lakers' winning streak is the longest in the NBA this season, and the
longest since they won 16 in a row during the 1990-91 season -- the last time
they reached the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
	   Their 19th victory in 20 games gave the Lakers an NBA-best 27-5 record. In
addition, it was their 12th straight win over the Clippers and 12th consecutive
victory at home.
</P>
<P>
	   Kobe Bryant added 26 points, 10 rebounds and six assists for the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
	   Lamar Odom led the Clippers, who lost their fourth straight, with 26 points
and 12 rebounds. Tyrone Nesby added 23 points and Maurice Taylor had 22 points
and 11 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   The game was tied at halftime 52-all, and neither team led by more than
three points in the third quarter before the Lakers went on a 10-2 to finish the
period for a 79-73 lead. O'Neal scored eight of the 10 points.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Neal scored five straight points early in the fourth quarter to make it
84-75, and the Clippers weren't closer than seven points after that.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Neal picked up his third foul with 5:28 left before halftime and the
Lakers leading 43-42. O'Neal, who had 20 points and 10 rebounds at that stage,
was lifted and didn't return until the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Glen Rice, averaging 17.1 points, missed his first six shots and didn't
score until the opening 30 seconds of the third quarter. He finished with seven
points.

<HEADLINE> Bulls 77, Wizards 66  </HEADLINE>
    By NANCY ARMOUR AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- All the Chicago Bulls needed was Toni Kukoc.
</P>
<P>
	   Playing in his first game in almost two months, Kukoc hit his first four
shots and finished with a team-high 18 points Wednesday night as the Bulls beat
the Washington Wizards 77-66, snapping an 11-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
	   Kukoc, activated a few hours before the game after missing the last 24
because of lingering back spasms, looked pretty good for a guy who's been on an
extended layoff. He had 11 rebounds, five assists, two steals and two blocked
shots in 39 minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   His presence gave the woeful Bulls a desperately needed boost, and they
responded with a night of highs. Despite only dressing nine players, they scored
their most points in a first quarter (29), set a season-high for biggest lead
(19 points) and won for the first time since Dec. 10.
</P>
<P>
	   Washington's 66 points were a franchise low, beating the 69 scored against
Houston in 1993. It also was the second-lowest in the NBA this season behind the
63 scored by Chicago on Monday. The Wizards were a dismal 24-of-84 (29 percent)
from the floor.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Bulls being the Bulls, they had to give their fans a late gut-check.
After a goaltending call gave Chicago a 66-52 lead at the end of the
third-quarter, the Wizards suddenly seemed to get interested in the game. They
opened the fourth quarter with an 11-0 run, including five points from Tracy
Murray, to close to 66-63 with 8:16 left to play.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bulls, finally looking worn out, didn't help themselves with four
turnovers in five possessions. They didn't score until Dickey Simpkins made the
first of two free throws with 6:04 left.
</P>
<P>
	   But that was the only enthusiasm Washington could muster. They went almost
nine minutes without a field goal, while Elton Brand then went on his own run,
scoring six points in a 2:20 span to put Chicago back up 73-63 with 1:51 left.
</P>
<P>
	   After that, all that was left was the celebrating.
</P>
<P>
	   Brand finished with 16 points and 16 rebounds for the Bulls. Fellow rookie
Ron Artest had 16 points, and Simpkins had 10 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   Murray led the Wizards with 18 points, including 3-of-6 from 3-point range.
Juwan Howard, who had 12, was the only other Wizard in double figures. Rod
Strickland was 0-of-9 from the floor.
</P>
<P>
	   With Kukoc leading the way, the Bulls actually looked like a real NBA team
for the first 2 1/2 quarters. He nailed a 13-foot jumper about 20 seconds into
the game, made three more shots, two free throws and had an assist as Chicago
jumped out to a 16-6 lead. He didn't miss a shot until there was four minutes
left in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Chicago led 29-18 at the end of the first quarter, but two layups from
Richard Hamilton closed the gap to 36-34 with 5:05 left in the first half. Kukoc
rescued the Bulls again with a layup -- with a goaltending assist from Jahidi
White -- to start an 11-0 run, and Chicago took a 50-36 lead at the half.

<HEADLINE> Norway Rescue Effort a Disaster  </HEADLINE>
   By NILS MYKLBOST Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RENA, Norway (AP) -- It was a rescue worker's nightmare. Intense heat from
the burning trains. Freezing cold of a Norwegian winter. Trapped, tortured
victims almost within arm's reach yet impossible to save.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The worst thing to experience is to stand there and watch people burn,''
said Ola Sunderaal, one of the first rescuers on the scene.
</P>
<P>
	   The head-on collision between two passenger trains on Tuesday was one of the
worst in Norwegian history, with 20 believed dead. The exact number remained
unclear a day after the crash because of uncertainly about precisely how many
people -- about 100 -- were on board.
</P>
<P>
	   The high-speed crash was so savage that several rail cars were compressed
into a pile of metal the length of a single car. A 100-ton locomotive lay on its
side, which rescuers hope to move today.
</P>
<P>
	   Fires blazed for about six hours hampering initial rescue efforts. Five
bodies were pulled from the wreckage before darkness fell Wednesday. Twelve in
all have been recovered with at least four more bodies are on the train.
</P>
<P>
	   Sixteen bodies have been recovered. Police late Wednesday adjusted the
number of missing and presumed dead to 4, from about 20 earlier in the day. They
gave no reason for the downward revision, but said there was no hope of finding
more survivors.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the 30 passengers and crew who were injured, 12 remained in the hospital,
some with broken bones.
</P>
<P>
	   The accident happened at Rena, Norway, about 110 miles north of the capital
Oslo.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, the high-pitched scream of cutting tools ripped through the
forest silence and tangled wreckage of the trains to pry loose bodies, many
burned beyond recognition. The process could take days to complete.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is very hard work because (the bodies) are so stuck in the wreckage.''
said Trond Simarud, a rescue specialist. ``We have to work millimeter by
millimeter (inch by inch) to get in there.''
</P>
<P>
	   During the day, three busloads of friends and relatives of the dead and
missing arrived to place flowers, light candles and seek solace. Young soldiers,
many of whom had spent the freezing night in tents, cordoned off the wreck site.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, family members, some crying, joined rescue workers and police in
uniform for memorial services in nearby churches, where torches burned outside
in the darkness.
</P>
<P>
	   During the day, bulldozers, army tanks and workers felled tall pine trees to
improve access to the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
	   The lingering stink of smoke from the burned-out wreckage was a pungent
reminder of the chaos, terror and frustration of the previous day.
</P>
<P>
	   Sunderaal, an ambulance crewman, recalled he had entered wrecked cars trying
to help. The fire drove him back.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was the worst thing I have experienced, going through the train seeing
people who were alive and conscious who we couldn't help,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   An express train, with 83 people aboard, was headed south for the city of
Trondheim. A local train, at first said to have 17 people aboard, was headed
north. The state railroad NSB on Wednesday said that number was no longer
certain.
</P>
<P>
	   The cause of the crash has not been determined. The trains raced at each
other at about 55 mph around a corner. The engineers had no chance to stop,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The railroad directorate said it was investigating media reports that
traffic managers, who remotely monitor trains, had been unable to warn the
trains because they had the wrong cellular phone numbers for the engineers.
</P>
<P>
	   At a news conference in Oslo Wednesday evening, Steinar Killi, the head of
the directorate, said there had not been contact between the traffic managers
and the engineers just before the crash, although it was not clear why. He also
said no technical faults were found on the line Wednesday, so one of the trains
apparently missed a stop signal.

<HEADLINE> Public Waker Alerts Cairo To Pray  </HEADLINE>
   By TANALEE SMITH Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Bundled up against the winter chill, Garia Mohammed
Bayoumi treads a familiar path through the darkened streets of old Cairo,
thumping out a regular rhythm on a small drum and pausing to call sleeping
residents by name.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Wake up, Hassan! Wake up, Ali! Wake up and start your prayers!''
</P>
<P>
	   It is 2:30 a.m., and Bayoumi, wrapped in a long gray overcoat and dark
woolen scarf, is performing an annual ritual that dates back seven generations
in her family. She is a mesaharati, a public waker, who rouses faithful Muslims
for prayers and breakfast in the wee hours of the holy month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
	   During Ramadan, Muslims abstain from food, drink, smoking and sex from
sunrise to sunset as an act of sacrifice and purification. They break the fast
with a sunset meal, called iftar, and then wake early to eat a pre-dawn meal,
called sohour, before fasting again. Ramadan ends with the first sighting of the
crescent moon, likely today. However, if the moon is not seen, Ramadan ends a
day later, on Friday. The three-day Eid al-Fitr feast begins the following day.
</P>
<P>
	   Mesaharatis were once a common sight -- and sound -- throughout Cairo, but
now many neighborhoods are without a traditional waker. Sometimes young
entrepreneurs fill the void, clanging noisemakers through the streets, hoping to
be paid for their halfhearted services.
</P>
<P>
	   But Bayoumi, 52, is from the old school, trained by her father, whom she
accompanied as a child, learning the names of every head of household in the
neighborhood. Now, 36 years after she became the mesaharati of the Hosh Qadam
section of old Cairo, she is a respected figure.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A lot of people do not feel like Ramadan has started until they hear her
voice,'' said her son, Mohammed, 17. ``I am very proud of my mother.''
</P>
<P>
	   It is unusual for a woman to be a mesaharati, but Bayoumi's father had no
sons and she wanted to keep the family tradition alive. The people of the
neighborhood supported her, even turning away another mesaharati who tried to
take over her area in 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I feel a responsibility to wake the people,'' she said. ``I like them and
they like me.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bayoumi, who cleans lion cages at the National Circus during the day, begins
her night job with a cup of ginseng tea and a few puffs on a water pipe known as
a shisha at a coffee shop near her apartment. The shisha is habit; the tea is to
soothe her throat for hours of calling and singing.
</P>
<P>
	   And then she's ready. The regulars at the cafe bid her good luck as she
heads back out into the narrow, unpaved streets for her two-hour night journey.
</P>
<P>
	   Her loud voice, rising in pitch in the traditional call, rouses most. The
persistent drumming wakes others. And on some nights, Bayoumi also carries a
wooden walking stick and raps on the doors of those sound sleepers who have
requested special attention.
</P>
<P>
	   Children run out to hug the woman, distinctive in the light of her father's
rusted oil lantern, and two toddlers dance to the beat of her drum. Passers-by
press money into her hand, calling her by name and wishing her a happy holiday.
Groups of men in coffee shops squeeze into side streets, calling out their
greetings.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We saw her grandfather and father doing the same job,'' said an elderly
man sipping hot, sweet tea. ``Garia is one of the cornerstones of the area.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The neighborhood would not be the same without her,'' said Nabil el-Mihy
between puffs on a shisha pipe, lamenting that the tradition has been lost in
other areas of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
	   Bayoumi said that while Cairo has changed over the past decades, there is
still a need for her service.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People used to sleep early. TV has changed their lives and they stay up
late into the night,'' she said. ``But a lot of people are still waiting for me
to wake them up.''
</P>
<P>
	   Most residents tip her, paying extra for special services, such as an extra
rap on their door or adding the name of their young son to her repertoire during
his first fast.
</P>
<P>
	   Some people wait until the end of the month to tip, but others show their
appreciation during her moonlit walks. People come to their doors to hand her
small bills; residents on higher floors open their windows and lower baskets
containing money.
</P>
<P>
	   Bayoumi said neither illness nor bad weather can keep her from performing
her duties.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm going to keep my career until the last second of my life,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> China Catholic Church Defies Vatican  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- China's state-controlled Catholic church defied the Vatican
today, ordaining five bishops in a ceremony that underscored the communist
government's nearly half-century rift with the pope.
</P>
<P>
	   Priests in white ceremonial vestments and nuns in black habits gathered with
several dozen believers for the ordination in Beijing's 95-year-old South
Cathedral. Presided over by a senior bishop in the state church, the ceremony
adhered to ritual, absent approval from the pope.
</P>
<P>
	   The timing seemed an intentional snub to the Vatican, something a Chinese
church official denied. Pope John Paul II was scheduled to ordain nine bishops
from seven other countries at St. Peter's Basilica in a ceremony later today
coinciding with the Roman Catholic Church's feast of the Epiphany.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We had no information about'' the Vatican ceremony, said Liu Bainian, vice
secretary of the China Patriotic Catholic Association. ``We do these ceremonies
according to the needs of our dioceses.''
</P>
<P>
	   Liu said the five were being elevated to replace bishops who were old or in
ill-health.
</P>
<P>
	   The Vatican has assailed the ordinations, calling them a disappointing
setback after positive signals in recent months that the two sides were ready to
improve relations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This gesture will raise obstacles that certainly hinder the process,''
Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   China and the Vatican have had no formal relations since 1951. Newly in
power, the Communist Party then kicked out missionaries and forced Catholics to
sever ties with the Vatican to end what the government saw as foreign
domination. The Vatican moved its ties to Taiwan, where many Chinese clerics
fled.
</P>
<P>
	   Now Beijing is interested in wooing rival Taiwan's last remaining diplomatic
allies to increase the island's isolation. While the Vatican has expressed
interest in re-establishing ties, the stumbling block remains papal authority,
which is mainly asserted through the pope's appointment of bishops.
</P>
<P>
	   The five bishops appointed in Beijing today will help minister to Catholics
whose numbers, even the official church admits, are swelling by 60,000 new
believers a year. China has nearly 5 million Catholics by official count but
missionaries say the real number of believers is closer to 12 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Many Catholics move between official and underground churches, where the
pope is openly venerated. The religious resurgence has forced the official
church into an uneasy coexistence with the unofficial church. Priests sometimes
conduct services in both, and state churches offer low-key prayers to the pope.
</P>
<P>
	   At Beijing's South Cathedral, a sign near a side courtyard celebrates the
Jubilee, the Holy Year on the 2000th anniversary of Jesus' birth in which
Catholics can gain pardon for sins. ``Christ: Yesterday, Today and Forever,''
read the sign.
</P>
<P>
	   ``With this new millennium, our church is entering a new golden era,'' Liu
Yuanren, bishop of Nanjing and president of the state-approved Chinese Catholic
Bishops College, told worshippers at the ordination.
</P>
<P>
	   Ordained in the ceremony were: Lu Xingping to bishop of Nanjing, Zhan Silu
to bishop of Mindong in eastern Fujian province, Fang Zhanping to bishop of
Tangshan in northern Hebei province, Jin Daoyuan to bishop of central Shaanxi
province and Su Changshen to bishop of Baoding, also in Hebei.
</P>
<P>
	   Su, a 76-year-old cleric, will run one of China's most active and
controversial parishes. In the mid-1990s, police destroyed a shrine to the
Madonna near Baoding and detained believers. An overseas Catholic monitoring
group reported arrests and, in one case, torture of underground worshippers in
Baoding last year.

<HEADLINE> Cubans Warned Against Elian Optimism  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- While an important step, the U.S. government decision to
return 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez to Cuba does not guarantee that the boy will be
repatriated, the communist leadership warned.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Nothing is certain concerning his return to Cuba,'' said a government
communique, read Wenesday night at a pro-Elian rally attended by President Fidel
Castro. Cuban exiles in Miami will now ``proceed with all their resources to
impede or delay'' the decision by the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
	   The government exhorted citizens to keep up mass protests pressing for
Elian's return until the boy comes home. ``We cannot stop mobilizing! The
struggle must not stop for one minute!'' said the message, read during the rally
of several thousand Cuban scientists by Hassan Perez, president of the
government's University Students Federation.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuba appealed to world opinion, and American opinion in particular, to help
prevent its enemies in Miami from trying to block the child's return.
</P>
<P>
	   Found clinging to an inner tube off the coast of Florida in late November,
Elian has been the subject of an international custody battle.
</P>
<P>
	   His mother died trying to get Elian and herself to the United States. The
boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, lives in Cuba and wants him back.
</P>
<P>
	   But Elian's relatives in Miami have fought to keep the boy permanently,
saying they could provide him with a better life than he would have on the
communist island. They said they would appeal the decision, announced Wednesday
by INS Commissioner Doris Meissner, that Elian must be returned to his father by
Jan. 14.
</P>
<P>
	   Gonzalez has not appeared publicly since the announcement. Neither he nor
Elian's four grandparents could be located Wednesday in their hometown of
Cardenas, east of Havana.

<HEADLINE> Germans Feel Cheated by Gas Tax  </HEADLINE>
   By TONY CZUCZKA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERLIN (AP) -- It's never been cheap to speed down the autobahn, but now a
sharp hike in gasoline prices has outraged even usually docile German motorists.
</P>
<P>
	   After back-to-back increases marred the holiday mood in the speed-loving
nation, some Germans are not only griping at the pump but going to court to try
to overturn a new energy tax.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a rip-off, pure and simple,'' taxpayer advocate Karlheinz Daeke
declared Wednesday, adding that his group would challenge the levy as
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
	   For Germany's center-left government, which includes for the first time the
environmentalist Greens, the ``ecology tax'' on energy is one of its proudest
achievements. Critics say the measure, designed to promote conservation, is
backfiring by raising the cost of public transportation -- in addition to
everything from taxi fares to the drive to the shopping mall.
</P>
<P>
	   While Germans like to lecture other Europeans on the environment, the furor
indicates where they draw the line.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Gasoline madness,'' screamed the capital's main tabloid, B.Z.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds of drivers lined up Wednesday at a central Berlin gas station to
experience how much cheaper filling the tank would be without the heavy taxes
raked in by the government.
</P>
<P>
	   For an hour, motorists paid about a quarter of the normal price, thanks to a
publicity stunt financed by the Free Democrats, a small anti-tax opposition
party.
</P>
<P>
	   For much of last year, Germans watched as fuel prices crept up along with
the cost of crude oil and the strength of the U.S. dollar. But the pent-up anger
exploded when oil companies announced yet another price hike just before New
Year, swiftly followed by phase two of the new tax on fossil fuels, which went
into effect on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The double punch sent premium unleaded gasoline soaring above the
psychological barrier of $4 per gallon -- up more than 20 percent from the start
of 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   That included an earlier hit from the energy tax, which was introduced in
April. And the government has already set further increases for each year
through 2003.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What I hear from almost all my customers is: Where does it end?'' said
Berlin gas station operator Jiri Rada. ``I can only shrug my shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
	   Daeke and others hope the end will come in Federal Constitutional Court,
Germany's highest tribunal.
</P>
<P>
	   The taxpayer group says it's preparing to challenge the ``ecology tax'' as
unconstitutional. It charges the government is hiding a simple grab for revenue
behind ecological arguments.
</P>
<P>
	   Trucking firms also plan to file a constitutional complaint. So do cold
storage companies fighting a rise in electricity prices included in the energy
tax. They assert they are being unfairly hit because the government, worried
about adding to unemployment, shielded some heavy industries from the increases.
</P>
<P>
	   Some legal experts say the challenges could succeed, forcing the government
to rework the tax. However, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's spokesman,
Uwe-Karsten Heye, said Wednesday the government would weather the storm.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea's Young Democracy Fumbles  </HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- In the waning days of 1999, a group of activists
in downtown Seoul trampled paper boxes symbolizing corrupt politics and chanted:
``Goodbye, 20th century. Begone, stale politics!''
</P>
<P>
	   The message resonates in South Korea, where the tainted political landscape
has seen it all in recent months: scandals and mudslinging, hasty resignations
and legislative gridlock.
</P>
<P>
	   Industrial South Korea may be an economic powerhouse, but its young
democracy is still fumbling for maturity one decade after its authoritarian era
faded. In the runup to parliamentary elections in April, fatigue has eclipsed
optimism among many voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Grubby politics are hardly a novelty worldwide, but the often rank tone
during the reformist presidency of Kim Dae-jung -- once the champion of a
persecuted democratic movement -- has been particularly hard to bear for many
South Koreans.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Like many others, I once expected that things would be different under
this new government. But as far as corruption goes, things seem to be the
same,'' said Lee Young-hee, a 45-year-old insurance saleswoman.
</P>
<P>
	   The opposition Grand National Party gleefully seized on the most
embarrassing scandal, dubbed ``Furgate'' by local media. It involved allegations
that the wife of a jailed businessman tried to lobby Cabinet ministers on his
behalf by paying for expensive clothes for their wives.
</P>
<P>
	   Three of the wives, an ex-justice minister and a former presidential legal
adviser have been indicted on perjury and other charges.
</P>
<P>
	   In May, the environment minister, a former actress, quit for accepting an
envelope of cash from South Korean businessmen after she performed in a play in
Moscow that coincided with a state visit there by Kim.
</P>
<P>
	   The opposition, ousted from power by Kim in 1997 elections, says the
president is hardly living up to his campaign pledge of clean government.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet partisan quarreling in the 299-member National Assembly has sidelined
debate on bills and stalled efforts to reform the precinct voting system in time
for the April 13 elections.
</P>
<P>
	   Reluctant to compromise, the rival camps, particularly the opposition, have
filed dozens of lawsuits against each other.
</P>
<P>
	   The antagonism at times overshadows the notable achievements of Kim's
administration: labor reforms, better ties with Japan, recovery from economic
crisis and a policy of engagement with communist North Korea. Tension on the
divided Korean peninsula has eased considerably in recent months.
</P>
<P>
	   One expert calls it ``transitional trauma,'' the turbulent reversal of roles
for the once-dominant, now resentful Grand National Party and Kim's ruling
coalition, which spent years as a political underdog.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Moon Jung-in, a political science professor at Yonsei University, said
Kim sometimes echoes the style of his authoritarian predecessors, pushing
through policies without seeking consensus.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The ruling party has not mastered the art of governing,'' Moon said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kim recently failed to merge his National Congress for New Politics with its
coalition partner, the United Liberal Democrats, as part of a strategy to
consolidate power ahead of the parliamentary poll. Scandals have sapped his
popularity.
</P>
<P>
	   If the opposition makes big gains in April, Kim's remaining three years in
office will be a grind. His coalition has 160 seats, but the Grand National
Party is the biggest party with 131 seats.
</P>
<P>
	   South Korea shifted toward democracy in 1987 when President Roh Tae Woo, a
former military commander, took office in a fair election.
</P>
<P>
	   Previous political transitions since independence from Japanese colonial
rule in 1945 had been tumultuous: a student uprising, an assassination and two
military coups.
</P>
<P>
	   Another obstacle to the full blooming of South Korean democracy is the
regional loyalty on which South Korea's three main political parties rely for
their support. Kim narrowly won election with the help of voters from his native
Cholla province, a rural southern area.
</P>
<P>
	   On Dec. 19, Kim urged South Koreans to cease emphasizing divisive regional
ties and apologized for government scandals. It will take more than that to
appease voters weary of their squabbling lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't know what they are fighting about. But I can tell you I am really
sick of all that,'' said Kim Sang-soo, a 30-year-old home appliance repairman.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Communist Poised To Lead Croatia  </HEADLINE>
   By SNJEZANA VUKIC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) -- The leader poised to become Croatia's prime minister
admitted it right away: He inhaled.
</P>
<P>
	   Ivica Racan's admission to have smoked marijuana once didn't seem to hurt
him at all in the country's first parliamentary elections since the death of
Balkan strongman Franjo Tudjman.
</P>
<P>
	   Racan's coalition crushed Tudjman's party during the Monday balloting,
winning over voters with promises of economic revival and better ties with the
West.
</P>
<P>
	   With that landslide, the 56-year-old former communist leader turned Social
Democrat is ushering in a new era for a nation struggling to gain economic
strength and stability 9 years after declaring its independence from Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
	   With his relative youth and low-key style, Racan symbolizes the country's
desire to make the transition to a modern European state.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The whole philosophy should be changed -- how to contribute to the state,
not take from it,'' he said in a pre-election interview to the independent
weekly Globus. ``The one who loves this country and believes in it, must be
ready for sacrifices.''
</P>
<P>
	   Backed by a solid majority of 71 seats, Racan is likely to easily become
prime minister, a job that may be even more important in the post-Tudjman era
than that of president. Though Tudjman assumed near monarchial authority after
leading the country to independence from Yugoslavia in 1991, it is likely many
of those powers will revert back to parliament.
</P>
<P>
	   The two men could not be more different. Racan speaks softly and rarely
lambastes his opponents. That is in sharp contrast to Tudjman, whose bluster
often served to keep people frightened and obedient.
</P>
<P>
	   Racan pledged that the new government would work around-the-clock for lower
salaries, bringing about hard economic reforms which Tudjman's party shunned.
Racan warned he would not tolerate any ``improprieties.''
</P>
<P>
	   Unlike other leaders tainted by corruption, Racan apparently did not use his
old post as Croatian communist party leader to enrich himself. He wears jeans
and spends summer vacations in a small cottage on the island of Brac. He is
married to an American of Croatian origin.
</P>
<P>
	   Even more critical, Racan appears more focused on the future rather than the
past. Unlike Tudjman, who often seemed obsessed by history, Racan rarely
mentions his own family's past: He was born in 1943 in a labor camp in
Ebersbach, Germany, that was run by the Nazis for those opposed to fascism. His
father died there.
</P>
<P>
	   His coalition's television campaign ad showed puppets, representing World
War II antifascists and fascists, fighting fiercely. The voice-over said: ``Have
you had enough of this? We have.''
</P>
<P>
	   He also made an effort to appeal to the country's young people, attending
rock concerts and defending the right of teen-agers to ``live your life the way
you want it.'' That remark was a slam against Tudjman's conservative taste for
folk music, and the former leader's aversion toward modern culture.
</P>
<P>
	   Cameras also caught Racan dancing enthusiastically at the Zagreb concert of
urban rock bands who supported his coalition. Racan shouted: ``Do you feel
good?'' Youngsters responded: ``Yeah!''
</P>
<P>
	   Then there was the marijuana admission, which prompted Tudjman's supporters
to suggest that he would bring ``sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll'' to Croatia.
</P>
<P>
	   Racan took it in stride, together with claims by opponents that he planned
to restore communism to the Balkan country.
</P>
<P>
	   He ignored such suspicions. And he entered a coalition with Drazen Budisa, a
prominent dissident jailed by communist authorities in the 1970s. Budisa runs
for president later this month.
</P>
<P>
	   Though a politically odd couple, Racan said they will pull the country
closer to Western institutions like the European Union and NATO, offering ``a
democratic government that will sit at the European table where European affairs
are being discussed.''

<HEADLINE> Many cabbies observe Ramadan, prepare for Eid  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Hanukkah is over, Christmas a memory and the New Year
well underway. But the city is not entirely through the holiday season. At
sunset every evening, cabs are oddly few and far between, parked instead near
mosques or Middle Eastern restaurants.
<P>
	   It is Ramadan in New York, where hundreds of cabbies are observant Muslims
and stop to break their fast every sunset and do not drive at all on Eid
al-Fitr, or feast of the fast-breaking, a major celebration at the end of the
Muslim holy month.
</P>
<P>
	   "When we break our fast at home or at mosques or at halal restaurants," the
Islamic equivalent of kosher, "it is beautiful, beautiful," said Sajid Ayub, a
cabbie from Queens, halfway through his fast Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   During the Islamic lunar month of Ramadan, which started Dec. 9, Muslims
abstain from eating, drinking and smoking between sunrise and sunset as an act
of sacrifice and purification, stopping work to break their fast together each
evening.
</P>
<P>
	   "We do get some complaints during Ramadan, especially when we break our
fast," admitted Farooq Bhatti, president of the Pak Brothers Yellow Cab Drivers
Union. "But it's a special time for us. At that time, if you go to Lexington
Avenue between 26th and 30th streets, where there are halal Pakistani
restaurants, you will find many many cabbies."
</P>
<P>
	   At the Chatkhara restaurant, up to 50 cabbies break their fast with dates
and juice every Ramadan evening before praying at the restaurant or at a nearby
mosque and then eating a big meal of kebab and other delicacies, said cashier
Badar Raja. "Out front it's all taxis and limousines," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Other Muslim cabbies break the fast at home or at mosques.
</P>
<P>
	   "At this time, we have very beautiful everything," Ayub, 40, of Queens, said
enthusiastically. "There is hot food and wonderful juice, beautiful!"
</P>
<P>
	   On Eid, which is determined by the sighting of the new moon and is expected
to fall on Friday or Saturday this year, most Muslim drivers take the day off
for communal prayers and time with their families.
</P>
<P>
	   "Oh no way, we could never work on Eid," said Ayub, who has been driving in
the city for 12 years and estimated that 60 percent of cabbies are Muslim.

<HEADLINE> Home Work Safety Rules Withdrawn  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans in Congress are vowing to investigate a Labor
Department decision to first issue, and then withdraw, a letter telling a Texas
company it must extend workplace safety protections to at-home workers.
</P>
<P>
	   Labor Secretary Alexis Herman on Wednesday withdrew the advisory letter amid
a firestorm of criticism from corporate America and Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
	   Herman said the advisory on at-home workers was an informal response to
questions from a single company and was not intended as a statement of policy
for all businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   But Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., insisted that ``we caught them with their
hands in the cookie jar.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``You can be sure this idea is not dead,'' said Bond, who as chairman of the
Small Business Committee is leaning strongly toward hearings on the matter.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, chairman of the House Workforce Committee's panel
on employer-employee relations, said he wants the labor secretary to give
Congress all memos and other documentation relating to the advisory letter.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's a fine line separating big government from Big Brother,'' Boehner
said. ``Americans deserve to know the full extent of this intrusive scheme.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Pete Hoekstra, R-Mich., chairman of the House Workforce Committee's
investigations panel, has promised a hearing as early as this month.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You don't spend two years working on a four-page letter, then issue it,
then 36 hours later after it goes public, withdraw it,'' Hoekstra said. ``I'd
like to know what their decision-making process was.''
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans already had pledged to scrutinize the department over
regulations proposed in November that would require employers to minimize
everyday physical -- or ``ergonomic'' -- stresses of certain jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., a member of the House leadership team, said he
expects several different hearings on the ergonomic and home office rules.
</P>
<P>
	   The controversy has raised important questions about what protections
Americans working at home can expect from the government, Herman said, so she
will convene a conference of business and labor leaders and set up an
interagency task force to study the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We acknowledge ... that employers are responsible for employee safety and
health, but we don't know what that means and how that applies to these new work
arrangements in the home today. That is why we need a national dialogue on this
subject,'' Herman said.
</P>
<P>
	   House Majority Leader Dick Armey scoffed at the idea, saying, ``Based on the
overwhelming outrage these regulations sparked, I'd say this will be a short,
one-sided conversation.''
</P>
<P>
	   The letter was written by officials at Labor's Occupational Safety and
Health Administration in response to a Texas-based credit services company that
sought advice about moving some sales executives into home offices.
</P>
<P>
	   The area of law has been unclear even as the number of Americans regularly
working at home has swelled to almost 20 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The now-retracted OSHA letter said, ``All employers, including those which
have entered into 'work at home' agreements with employees, are responsible for
complying with ... safety and health standards.''
</P>
<P>
	   It described how an employer could be liable if it knew or reasonably should
know about home workplace hazards -- such as computers that overload home
electrical circuits, creating a fire hazard, or rickety stairs leading to a
basement office.
</P>
<P>
	   And it suggested companies should train people to set up safe home offices
and periodically inspect at-home workers' quarters.
</P>
<P>
	   Such ``interpretation'' letters to individual companies often are made
public, and other businesses look to them for guidance. This one, dated Nov. 15,
was posted on the Labor Department's Internet site.

<HEADLINE> Race Starts for Tudjman Successor  </HEADLINE>
   By EUGENE BRCIC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) -- Candidates scrambled to get into the race for
Croatia's presidency after the party that has ruled the country since
independence suffered a bruising defeat in parliamentary balloting.
</P>
<P>
	   Just days after an opposition coalition trounced the late President Franjo
Tudjman's Croatian Democratic Union in the first elections since his death,
eight candidates raced to meet a deadline at midnight Wednesday to register to
seek the post in the Jan. 24 ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   The coalition's candidate, Drazen Budisa, is likely to enjoy strong support
-- if the group's landslide win in parliamentary races Monday is any guide.
Tudjman's party, known by its Croatian acronym, HDZ, nominated the foreign
minister, Mate Granic.
</P>
<P>
	   Most opinion polls had indicated Granic, a moderate, was an outright
favorite to win the presidency -- though his chances are likely to suffer from
the election drubbing. The party's biggest loss was in the capital, Zagreb,
which had Granic leading the slate.
</P>
<P>
	   Granic was selected only hours before the filing deadline, hinting at
infighting within the HDZ. Tudjman did not groom a successor, and the quarrel
between hard-liners and moderates in the HDZ for control has only been
exacerbated further by the election debacle.
</P>
<P>
	   The coalition won -- by a 2-1 margin in some districts -- on promises to
push reforms to prepare Croatia for integration into Western European
institutions, such as the European Union and NATO.
</P>
<P>
	   Six other candidates are also seeking the post held by Tudjman since he led
Croatia to independence in 1991 until his death on Dec. 10.
</P>
<P>
	   Stipe Mesic, a former Croat representative under the old Yugoslav presidency
and a former justice minister, Zvonimir Separovic, also entered the race, as did
sociologist Slaven Letica, and businessman Ante Ledo.
</P>
<P>
	   Rounding out the field were two hard-line conservatives, Ante Djapic and
Tomislav Mercep.
</P>
<P>
	   The victorious coalition is rallying behind Budisa, a former dissident who
served four years in jail for leading a student movement in the 1970s that
demanded greater autonomy for Croatia within Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The presidential elections are the second half of the same match,'' said
Zdravko Tomac, deputy president of the Social Democrats. ``We need to win and
hope to do so without a runoff.''

<HEADLINE> Clintons Settle Into New Home  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAPPAQUA, N.Y. (AP) -- After the moving vans departed, and some of the boxes
were stowed, a pal brought over some dinner for the new homeowners. A typical
scene, perhaps, except that the new neighbors showed up in an armored limousine,
with a motorcade of Secret Service agents, staff and reporters in tow.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton and his wife, Hillary, were unpacking, with help from the
president's mother-in-law, on their first night in what the family says will be
its post-White House house.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Like any new homeowners, they're excited,'' White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart said Wednesday evening. ``They're excited to go in and get to work
making it their home.''
</P>
<P>
	   As Lockhart spoke outside the gracious, $1.7 million Dutch colonial home in
this well-to-do hamlet north of New York City, the president and Mrs. Clinton
were visible walking through the brightly lighted rooms of the home's first
floor.
</P>
<P>
	   Soon, the vans filled with Clinton's entourage pulled away, and the Clintons
settled in for the night.
</P>
<P>
	   A friend who also lives in Westchester County and has vacationed with the
Clintons in Massachusetts brought over home-cooked food for dinner. A crowd of
reporters and onlookers were held behind barricades at the top of the Clintons'
new street.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton planned only a short stay. He has left most of his schedule open
this week so he can husband the Israeli-Syrian peace talks under way in
Shepherdstown, W.Va.
</P>
<P>
	   While some of the 17,000 residents in upscale Chappaqua have complained
about the attention drawn by the Clintons, many seemed eager to greet them.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think there's been some disturbance for the people'' on the Clintons'
street, said Wilma Rapp. ``Other than that, people feel pretty good about the
Clintons. You tell somebody you live in Chappaqua and they say, `Oh! Hillary!'''
</P>
<P>
	   The town already has had its share of the famous: actor Chevy Chase and
actress Glenn Close, and New York Yankees center fielder Bernie Williams.
</P>
<P>
	   Initially, Mrs. Clinton, who needs a New York address to run for the U.S.
Senate, was scheduled to arrive alone to unpack. An unexpected break in the
president's schedule allowed him to accompany the first lady, Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clintons' furniture and other goods arrived Tuesday afternoon in two
moving vans. The president has said they both plan to live in Chappaqua after he
leaves office in January 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   Lockhart said the couple and Mrs. Clinton's mother, Dorothy Rodham, were
eager to start the task of organizing the family possessions. The Clintons took
time over the holidays to choose items Mrs. Clinton would take with her from the
family's private residence at the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   Even before their arrival, the Clintons had caused several minor stirs.
</P>
<P>
	   In September, protesters upset by U.S. policy in East Timor marched outside
the home, even though it was still vacant. In November, the government quashed
plans to sell T-shirts reading ``Secret Service, Chappaqua Bureau, Presidential
Detail,'' saying use of the Secret Service label was illegal.
</P>
<P>
	   Local officials soon made parking on the Clintons' cul-de-sac illegal to
spare neighbors any imposition from the media. Authorities also approved
installation of an 8-foot fence and a guard booth on the Clintons' property;
neither is yet in place.
</P>
<P>
	   New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Mrs. Clinton's likely Republican
opponent in this year's Senate race, played on the ``carpetbagger'' theme he has
used against Mrs. Clinton in offering a backhanded welcome to her and the
president.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I feel very, very proud of the fact that people from around the country
want to come to New York, including people from Arkansas,'' Giuliani said. ``We
welcome all newcomers, and recognize the fact that they are newcomers.''
</P>
<P>
	   Similar sentiments were offered by Gov. George Pataki, another Republican,
during his state of the state address in Albany: ``Why, even people from Hope,
Arkansas, understand that New York is the best state to live in.''

<HEADLINE> Influenza Is the True Y2K Bug  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- They are the familiar sights and sounds of winter: the
sniffling nose, the dry, throaty voice and the grimace that follows a swallow of
medicine.
</P>
<P>
	   Better get used to them, health officials say. The flu, which struck the
West hard last month, has arrived like a storm along the East Coast, filling
hospital waiting rooms and doctors' offices with ailing patients.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's bad all over the country," said Dr. Robert McNamara, chief of
emergency medicine at Temple University Hospital in Philadelphia. "The flu shot
apparently is not doing its job, and from all reports, it could be one of the
worst seasons we've seen in years."
</P>
<P>
	   Patients at emergency rooms nationwide have found out as much in the last
couple of weeks. At McNamara's hospital, patients line the halls on gurneys,
waiting for rooms. Others huddle around rows of chairs waiting to be seen by a
doctor. Other hospitals across the country are scrambling to add extra staff,
while others are even turning people away due to overcrowding.
</P>
<P>
	   "If the trend continues the way it is now, within the next month we are
going to have a great challenge to find beds to admit anybody in the state of
Maryland," said Dr. Rick Alcorta, head of the Emergency Medical Resource Center,
which tracks the status of hospitals in the Baltimore area.
</P>
<P>
	   At South Georgia Medical Center in Valdosta, Ga., supervisors went from
wearing business suits to white nurses' coats to help with the crush of mostly
flu-ridden patients. In Newnan, southwest of Atlanta, a spokeswoman at Emory
Peachtree Regional Hospital said doctors are calling this round of flu the worst
strain since 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
show that more than 99 percent of the cases reported so far are influenza type
A. Most of the cases, officials say, appear to be the Sydney strain of the
virus, which also struck last year.
</P>
<P>
	   The first substantial cases were reported in California and Arizona last
month. Since then, 19 states -- including Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey and
Virginia -- have reported widespread or regional flu activity, the CDC said.
</P>
<P>
	   While the agency said about 3 percent of doctor visits in those states were
related to flu-like symptoms, hospital workers say cases in the East seemed to
have spiked since Christmas.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've been used to seeing (the flu) in late January, February and even
March," said Dr. Luther Rhodes, chief of infectious disease at Lehigh Valley
Hospital in Allentown, Pa. "We weren't thinking about it over the Christmas
holiday."
</P>
<P>
	   As of Wednesday, flu patients occupied half of Lehigh Valley's 70
single-patient rooms. Normally, Rhodes said, that number reaches only three or
four at the height of the season.
</P>
<P>
	   For the first time, Rhodes said, the hospital has asked inbound flu patients
to call ahead.
</P>
<P>
	   Flu symptoms include fever, coughing and runny or stuffy noses, along with
headaches, muscle aches and extreme fatigue. The virus is distinguished by its
quick onset and its affect over an entire body.
</P>
<P>
	   "These are people who come in and generally feel terrible," said Dr. Anthony
Cirillo, chief of emergency medicine at Memorial Hospital in Pawtucket, R.I.
"Often times, they're dehydrated. These aren't people who move through the
system overnight."
</P>
<P>
	   Those considered at risk of more serious flu complications include infants,
the elderly and people with chronic illnesses such as asthma, AIDS, sickle cell
anemia, diabetes or heart disease.
</P>
<P>
	   The situation is so bad at Claremont Nursing and Rehabilitation Center near
Carlisle, Pa., that visitors are banned through at least Sunday. Ed Quinlan,
president of the Hospital Association of Rhode Island, said some swamped
hospitals have been forced to reschedule elective surgeries.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is no good flu year," said Dr. Matthew Carter, epidemiology program
coordinator for the Connecticut Department of Public Health.

<HEADLINE> China Sentences Falun Gong Members  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- A couple arrested in the crackdown on the Falun Gong
spiritual movement were sentenced Thursday to prison terms of eight and six
years in a secret trial in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, a rights group
reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The Wuhan No. 1 Intermediate People's Court convicted Xu Xianglan and her
husband Wang Hansheng of organizing and using a cult to undermine the law in the
trial that began on Dec. 23, the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human
Rights and Democratic Movement in China reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Xu, who was a chief organizer for Falun Gong in central China, was sentenced
to eight years in prison and her husband, Wang, to six years, it said.
</P>
<P>
	   The court was unable to find evidence to support accusations in state news
media that the movement's founder, Li Hongzhi, shared huge profits made by the
couple's sales of Falun Gong books and photos, the Information Center said.
</P>
<P>
	   It said the couple had not yet been able to discuss an appeal with their
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
	   Court officials have refused to comment on the case.
</P>
<P>
	   The government banned the popular spiritual movement in July, calling it the
worst threat to communist control since nationwide democracy demonstrations in
1989.

<HEADLINE> Weld: I'd be hard to stop for New York governor in 2006  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   BOSTON (AP) - Former Massachusetts Gov. William Weld began his first day
as a Manhattan resident with a grand claim: If he decided to run for the top job
in New York in 2006, he could well become only the second American elected
governor of two states.
<P>
	   "I'd be hard to stop," Weld said in a telephone interview Wednesday with The
Associated Press from his New York law office.
</P>
<P>
	   Should Weld succeed, he would join Sam Houston as the only two-state
governor in history. Houston was governor of Tennessee from 1827 to 1829 and
Texas from 1859 to 1861.
</P>
<P>
	   Weld's claim to political viability in a new state may not be far-fetched.
</P>
<P>
	   "If anyone can do it, Bill Weld can do it," said Gov. Paul Cellucci, Weld's
running mate and lieutenant governor for six years. "He certainly was the person
who led our state back from some pretty tough times - he'll always be remembered
fondly."
</P>
<P>
	   Before he had even carried his suitcase into his Upper East Side apartment,
Weld was chatting about his roots in Long Island's Smithtown and his vacation
homes in the Adirondacks.
</P>
<P>
	   The moderate Republican's not-so-subtle message: He's no carpetbagger,
unlike Hillary Rodham Clinton, who also moved to New York state on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton - who became friends with Weld when they were both young
lawyers working on the Watergate hearings - is running for Senate from her new
home in Chappaqua, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
	   Weld, 54, cannot run for governor until he satisfies New York's five-year
residency requirement for the post. And he said he wouldn't challenge his two
New York pals - Gov. George Pataki or New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who hired
him as a federal prosecutor in 1981 - if either one were to run for governor in
2006.
</P>
<P>
	   New York may have a harsh political environment, but Massachusetts is even
harsher, said former New York Mayor Ed Koch.
</P>
<P>
	   "Massachusetts chews you up more than New York, and we do plenty of
chewing," said Koch, who recently encountered Weld in a barbershop.
</P>
<P>
	   "I wouldn't write him off as a kook," said Gerald Doherty, former
Massachusetts state Democratic chairman who worked on Robert F. Kennedy's 1964
Senate race in New York and ran Jimmy Carter's presidential campaign there.
"I've become a great respecter of him and his abilities to relate to people."
</P>
<P>
	   Brainy, funny and unpredictable - he once dived, fully clothed, into the
Charles River after signing an environmental bill - Weld strongly appealed to
suburban voters.
</P>
<P>
	   He also attracted Irish and Italian voters, despite his patrician lineage
that includes his namesake, William Floyd, who signed the Declaration of
Independence from New York.
</P>
<P>
	   "I may be a tightly wound Yankee, but that's not how I feel," Weld said
Wednesday. "I feel much more ethnic. I think I was separated at birth from an
Irish-Italian mother."
</P>
<P>
	   He narrowly won his long-shot campaign for governor in 1990 on a platform of
fighting crime, reforming welfare and cutting taxes. Over the next four years,
heavily Democratic Massachusetts came to like his brand of fiscal conservatism
and social liberalism and re-elected him by a landslide five years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   He has a notoriously short attention span, however, and soon got bored.
</P>
<P>
	   "Governor is the longest I've ever had a job," Weld said.
</P>
<P>
	   He challenged incumbent John Kerry for the Senate in 1996 and lost. The next
year he resigned, and President Clinton nominated him as ambassador to Mexico.
But Sen. Jesse Helms thought Weld too liberal, and blocked the nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Since then, he has written two suspense novels, "Mackerel by Moonlight" and
"Big Ugly."
</P>
<P>
	   These days, he said, he is fully engaged as managing partner at McDermott,
Will &AMP; Emery's New York office, where he has been busy buying and selling
companies. "I'm enjoying that," he said. "I've got a reasonably steep learning
curve."
</P>
<P>
	   He will not sell his house in Cambridge, where his five children grew up.
His wife, Susan Roosevelt Weld, lectures at Harvard University and Boston
College.
</P>
<P>
	   If he does run in 2006, he will first have to win the hearts and minds of
New York Republicans and Conservative Party members.
</P>
<P>
	   "Bill Weld would face the high prospect of a Republican primary," New York
consultant Jay Severin said. "If he gets beyond that, 'President Weld' is a very
plausible phrase."

<HEADLINE> Bradley, Gore Debate in N.H.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURHAM N.H. (AP) -- In a feisty first debate of the new year, Democratic
presidential candidate Bill Bradley said Al Gore is stuck ``in a Washington
bunker,'' and the vice president accused his rival of leaving New Hampshire
residents ``high and dry'' on health care.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley was more aggressive than usual Wednesday night, forcing Gore to
defend himself on a string of issues related to President Clinton. Gore, armed
with notecards and notepads, initially appeared uncomfortable but warmed to the
task of challenging Bradley's health care plan.
</P>
<P>
	   Holding up a chart, Gore said New Hampshire residents would be ``left out.
They would be left high and dry'' under Bradley's proposal for near-universal
health care coverage.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, the former New Jersey senator who makes much of his sabbatical from
Washington after leaving the Senate in 1997, said: ``I've been out talking to
people in the country the last two years. And quite frankly, they think a lot of
people in Washington stay too long and fight too much.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore is the national front-runner by far, but Bradley has mounted a
surprisingly strong challenge for the Democratic presidential nomination, and is
even or ahead in polling in advance of the first primary set for Feb. 1 in New
Hampshire. That prompted Gore to allude to his ``underdog'' status.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Your underdog pitch brings tears to my eyes,'' Bradley said wryly.
</P>
<P>
	   Said Gore: ``I hope my upset victory brings tears to your eyes on Feb. 1.''
</P>
<P>
	   The 60-minute debate was their fourth of the campaign. Tonight, the six
Republican presidential candidates square off in the same University of New
Hampshire theater.
</P>
<P>
	   The two candidates agreed on the need for stricter gun control laws and on
letting gays serve in the military. But Gore went further, saying he would not
appoint anyone to the Joint Chiefs of Staff who disagreed with his position on
homosexuals in the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley suggested he would not need to resort to any such litmus test:
``When you're president, you are commander-in-chief and you issue orders. And
soldiers are good soldiers. And they follow your orders ... whatever the policy
is.''
</P>
<P>
	   The rivals came prepared for battle, clashing on local issues -- including
development within the White Mountain National Forest in northern New Hampshire
-- as well as national concerns.
</P>
<P>
	   Health care drew the sharpest distinction, with Bradley saying he was
offended by Gore's claims that his proposal would hurt minorities. Bradley wants
to scrap Medicaid and give people vouchers to buy insurance. He also would open
the federal employees health care benefit system to all Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think you're in a Washington bunker. And I can understand why you're in
a bunker. I mean there was (former House Speaker Newt) Gingrich. There was the
fund-raising scandals. There was the impeachment problem. And I think that the
major objective in the last several years in the White House has been political
survival. I understand that,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   He suggested that the bunker had blinded Gore to the need to expand access
to health care. ``We should have the leadership to get behind it and make it
happen,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore shrugged off Bradley's complaints, paraphrasing Harry Truman's famous
utterance: ``I'm not giving him hell. I'm just telling the truth and he thinks
it's hell.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley launched a sharp attack on U.S. relations with Russia, saying the
Clinton-Gore administration had not pushed hard enough to reduce the stockpile
of nuclear weapons and had agreed to send international aid to Russia ``knowing
that corruption was rampant.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore issued a defense, saying, ``I think that in spite of the problems there
have been some successes, including a new leader committed to reform, a free
press and free elections.''
</P>
<P>
	   Given the chance to question one another, Gore asked Bradley whether he
believed he had erred by voting for President Reagan's budget cuts in 1981, in
opposition to authorizing the ground war against Iraq in 1990 and against the
welfare overhaul signed by Clinton. Bradley defended each vote.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said, ``I think all three were mistakes.'' While serving in Congress,
Gore voted against the budget cuts and in favor of using force in Kuwait. As
vice president, he supported the welfare law.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said he was worried that Bradley had refused to own up to any mistakes
-- a quality he said was essential for any president.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley then broke in to own up to a past mistake: his 1987 vote against
confirmation of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. ``Now that was a
mistake,'' he said to laughter from the audience. Clinton nominated Greenspan to
a fourth term this week.
</P>
<P>
	   While Bradley said Gore was guilty of campaign distortions, Gore said he
wouldn't level that charge against his rival. ``I won't accuse him of that. If
you want a no, I'll give you a no,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> House GOP Marks Takeover Anniversary  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans celebrated five years in power by
hailing their legislative victories and promising to continue to battle
President Clinton over such issues as the scale of tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 60 GOP House members, many from the combative class of 1994,
gathered in Washington Wednesday to mark their fifth anniversary as the majority
party and discuss how to get their message out in the coming year. Congress
officially returns to work on Jan. 24.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have changed the nation's fiscal landscape,'' said Rep. J.C. Watts of
Oklahoma, chairman of the House Republican Conference. He was one of the 73
House GOP freshmen who championed the ``Contract with America'' when they
arrived in Washington in January 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   Watts and other Republicans listed overhaul of the welfare system, balancing
the budget, providing tax relief, boosting military spending and extending local
controls over education money as among their major accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House insists it deserves much of the credit for some of those
achievements, particularly attaining a budget surplus while winning more money
for schools and fighting crime.
</P>
<P>
	   The Democratic administration has also thwarted some of the more ambitious
GOP goals, such as last year's $792 billion tax cut vetoed by Clinton.
Republicans have gained ``a healthy dose of what can and can't be accomplished
in a legislative body,'' said Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., who is retiring after
three terms at the end of this session.
</P>
<P>
	   Former Speaker Newt Gingrich, who led the GOP takeover and was the chief
voice for change in the way government does business, received little mention at
Wednesday's news conference. Gingrich resigned after Republicans lost seats in
the 1998 election and in the past year was involved in a very public divorce
proceeding.
</P>
<P>
	   Watts said that while Gingrich helped lead the charge in the GOP revolution,
``we want to focus on the future.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Republicans face a tough future, trying to carry out their agenda with a
slim majority in the House of 222-212, with one independent who usually votes
with the Democrats. In addition, 21 House Republicans have announced they are
retiring at the end of this session, against only six Democrats, boosting
Democratic chances of recapturing the House.
</P>
<P>
	   The Republican majority in the Senate, 55-45, appears secure.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our vital signs show that we are in very good shape,'' Watts insisted,
saying that Republicans will stay on the offensive in battling the White House
on such issues as tax cuts.

<HEADLINE> Interest Groups Paid $697M To Lobby  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two major antagonists in the debate over how much to
regulate managed care health organizations spent the most on lobbying during the
first half of 1999, a private analysis found.
</P>
<P>
	   The American Medical Association, which favored new regulations, and the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which opposed them, each spent more than $8 million
from January to June. Both groups lobbied on other issues besides health care.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've had some very important issues that we've been lobbying on,'' said
Dr. Thomas Reardon, president of the AMA, which spent $8.8 million. ``There was
a lot of emphasis on the Patients' Bill of Rights. We began to do work on health
care coverage for all Americans.''
</P>
<P>
	   The chamber spent $8.4 million.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The chamber is delivering what its members want most: advocacy on Capitol
Hill,'' spokesman Frank Coleman said. ``Our key issues are trade, legal reform,
preserving health care and fighting for reasonable regulation on business.''
</P>
<P>
	   Overall, health insurers, high-tech companies, banks and other interest
groups spent $697 million to lobby Congress and the federal agencies during the
first six months of 1999, according to a report released today by FEC Info, an
Internet consulting firm that specializes in tracking political money.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is an incredible amount,'' said Tony Raymond, a founder of FEC Info.
``These are the moneymakers. They have two groups they work on: the legislators,
the people who write the laws, but they also work on their home offices, saying
'Our competitors are spending this much on lobbying; we need to catch up with
them.'''
</P>
<P>
	   The amount is similar to the $710 million spent on lobbying during the first
six months of 1998, according to figures compiled by researchers at the Center
for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research group that also analyzes federal
lobbying disclosure reports. FEC Info is a subsidiary of the Internet public
policy and health care technology company Netivation.com.
</P>
<P>
	   This time around, the health care industry spent more on lobbying than
anyone else, shelling out $95.5 million as Congress debated whether to impose
new regulations on managed care health plans. Congress didn't pass the new
rules.
</P>
<P>
	   In second place were communications and technology companies, which fought
over providing high-speed Internet access and sought approval for several
telecommunications mergers. Those companies spent $94.6 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The financial services industry, which won approval of a long-sought bill to
drop Depression-era barriers against banks, insurance companies and investment
houses competing against each other, spent $89.8 million on lobbying.
</P>
<P>
	   The top lobbying firm was Cassidy &AMP; Associates, which was paid $10 million
during the first half of 1999. Former Reps. Fred Rooney of Pennsylvania and
Marty Russo of Illinois both work for the firm, whose clients have included
Boeing, Exxon, and a number of colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
	   Patton Boggs, which counts former Rep. Greg Laughlin of Texas in its ranks,
was second at $9.2 million. The firm has represented the Association of Trial
Lawyers, MCI Worldcom and US Airways.
</P>
<P>
	   Verner, Liipfert, Bernhard, McPherson and Hand, home to former Senate
majority leaders George Mitchell and Bob Dole and former Texas Gov. Ann
Richards, was paid $7.3 million.
</P>
<P>
	   During the first six months of 1998, the powerhouse firm received $7.1
million from the tobacco companies alone, but the industry paid just $80,000
during the same period this year.

<HEADLINE> Military Housing Raise Proposed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's proposed 2001 budget will include a
raise in military members' monthly off-base housing allowance.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials said it is part of an effort to make military service more
desirable at a time when the Pentagon is having trouble keeping people in
uniform and attracting new recruits.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense Secretary William Cohen was announcing the proposed increase in
housing allowances during a troop visit today at Camp Pendleton, Calif., a major
Marine Corps base north of San Diego.
</P>
<P>
	   Pentagon officials who disclosed the planned increase Wednesday would not
reveal details.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen has said in several recent appearances with U.S. troops abroad that
housing allowances should go up. During a stop in Naples, Italy, on Dec. 21,
Cohen told sailors and Marines that he was determined to improve housing and
health care for troops during his final year as Pentagon chief in the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are going to do our level best to make sure you and your family have
the best we can provide,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
	   As more bases have closed in recent years, military members have
consolidated at a smaller number of locations -- in many cases finding
themselves in more expensive off-base real estate markets.
</P>
<P>
	   Increasing allowances for those who live off base is one of several aspects
of Cohen's plan to improve housing. The others are using military construction
funds to repair or replace some of the 200,000 military housing units judged to
be substandard, and using private contractors to build more on-base housing.
</P>
<P>
	   Late last year the Army signed a 50-year, $3 billion contract with Carson
Family Housing of Charlotte, N.C., to privatize family housing at Fort Carson,
Colo. The privatization approach is meant to achieve housing improvements more
quickly than through the traditional use of government construction funds.
</P>
<P>
	   Housing and other living costs are among the most important issues to
service members, many of whom are leaving to take more lucrative jobs in the
private economy. Cohen wants to provide more financial incentives to keep people
in uniform longer.
</P>
<P>
	   This year's budget gave military members a 4.8 percent across-the-board pay
raise, the largest since 1981. Congress also made a one-time adjustment to the
Pentagon's pay scales, so that about 75 percent of all service members will
receive extra pay raises on July 1 ranging up to an additional 5.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Lightning 3, Canucks 3, Tie  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Pavel Kubina had a goal and an assist as
the Tampa Bay Lightning ended a seven-game losing streak Wednesday night with a
3-3 tie against the Vancouver Canucks.
</P>
<P>
	   Vancouver's Markus Naslund foiled the Lightning's victory bid, scoring with
9:50 left in the third period.
</P>
<P>
	   Ed Jovanovski made a game-saving play with 70 seconds left in overtime,
diving to poke the puck off away from Vincent Lecavalier, just as the
Lightning's second-leading scorer was coming in on a breakaway.
</P>
<P>
	   The Canucks (12-18-8) have gone 1-9-2 in their last 12 games. The Lightning
(10-21-6) are 0-7-2 since beating Carolina on Dec. 10, and 0-6-3 in their last
nine road games
</P>
<P>
	   Bryan Muir and Fredrick Modin also scored and Mike Sillinger set up a pair
for the Lightning, who earned their first point in seven visits to Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
	   Tampa Bay goalie Dan Cloutier stopped 35 shots, enjoying his best
performance in almost a month after giving up 23 goals in his last five starts,
all losses.
</P>
<P>
	   Alexander Mogilny and Peter Schaefer scored 32 seconds apart to give the
Canucks a brief 2-1 lead in the second period. Vancouver managed more than two
regulation goals for only the second time in 17 games.
</P>
<P>
	   Twisting and turning to elude two Tampa Bay defenders, Naslund scored his
team-leading 13th goal by snapping a 25-foot shot through a crowd, beating
Cloutier to tie it at 3.
</P>
<P>
	   Naslund's goal came five minutes after Muir scored a weak goal, beating
Felix Potvin through the legs with a shot from just inside the Canucks blue
line.
</P>
<P>
	   The Canucks, whose power-play is ranked 24th in the league, went 0-for-8
with the man advantage, including a 73-second two-man-advantage midway through
the second period.
</P>
<P>
	   The Lightning ran into injury troubles, losing two players. Forward Stan
Drulia did not return after sustaining a concussion when checked heavily into
the boards two minutes into the game.
</P>
<P>
	   Veteran defenseman Petr Svoboda was forced to leave in the second with a
shoulder injury.
</P>
<P>
	   Tampa Bay also played without Darcy Tucker, who served the second game of a
two-game suspension for spearing Florida's Todd Simpson on Dec. 27.

<HEADLINE> Panthers 5, Mighty Ducks 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Victor Kozlov ended a six-game goal-scoring drought
with his first hat trick and Pavel Bure had a goal and two assists as the
Florida Panthers beat the Anaheim Mighty Ducks 5-1 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Ray Whitney had a goal and an assist for the Panthers, who are 6-3-2 against
the Ducks since the teams entered the NHL in 1993. Jaroslav Spacek and Robert
Svehla each recorded two assists.
</P>
<P>
	   Anaheim lost for the fourth-straight game.
</P>
<P>
	   A breakaway goal by Anaheim's Jeff Nielsen six minutes into the second
period prevented Mikhail Shtalenkov from blanking his ex-teammates for the
fourth time in five starts.
</P>
<P>
	   The seven-year veteran is 6-1 against the Ducks and has stopped 135 of 138
shots in his last five outings against them.
</P>
<P>
	   Kozlov broke open a scoreless game with a pair of power play goals just over
two minutes apart in the first period.
</P>
<P>
	   Guy Hebert was yanked after surrendering three first-period goals for the
first time this season.
</P>
<P>
	   Kozlov began his scoring binge midway through the first with a 35-foot slap
shot from the left circle that snuck between Hebert's legs. His next goal was a
one-timer from above the left circle.
</P>
<P>
	   The Panthers' third goal came with just three seconds left in the period.
Bure carried the puck across the blue line and faked a shot in the left circle
before Whitney redirected Bure's centering pass past Hebert.
</P>
<P>
	   Kozlov's third goal gave Florida a 4-0 cushion at 5:11 of the second. The
Panthers' center was credited with his 11th goal after his attempted centering
pass for Whitney banked off defenseman Niklas Havelid and past relief goalie
Dominic Roussel.
</P>
<P>
	   The hat trick was Florida's fourth of the season and first by someone other
than Bure, who scored four times in the Panthers' previous game on New Year's
Day.
</P>
<P>
	   Koslov became the first player to get a hat trick against the Ducks since
last Feb. 17.
</P>
<P>
	   Bure ended the scoring 1:50 into the third with his 26th goal. The Panthers
are 15-1-1 this season when Bure scores.

<HEADLINE> Media Accused of Gun Control Bias  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The television networks are so badly slanting the gun
control debate they have become the ``communications division of the anti-gun
lobby,'' says the head of a conservative media watchdog group that studied the
issue.
</P>
<P>
	   The Media Research Center, chaired by Brent Bozell, released a study
Wednesday on two years of television news stories on gun control.
</P>
<P>
	   The study analyzed the morning shows and evening newscasts between July 1,
1997 and June 30, 1999 on ABC, CBS, CNN and NBC.
</P>
<P>
	   In many cases, the study claimed, pro-gun themes were not covered and gun
proponents were not given air time.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's a powerful pervasive bias in the media,'' said Oliver North, the
former Iran-Contra figure who now hosts a political talk show on MSNBC and is a
national board member of the National Rifle Association. ``This blitz of bias is
having an extraordinary impact on public policy and legal opinion.''
</P>
<P>
	   CNN spokesman David Bittler defended its reporting saying, ``We do not
advocate for or against any particular position and we stand behind the balance
and fairness that goes into all our reporting.''
</P>
<P>
	   Calls made to the three other networks were not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
	   The issue of guns has increasingly been in the news as the nation has
grappled with school shootings in places like Littleton, Colo., Paducah, Ky. and
Pearl, Miss.
</P>
<P>
	   Bozell's group says it examined 653 morning and evening news stories on gun
policy issues and found that stories advocating more gun control outnumbered
stories opposing gun control 357 to 36 or a ratio of 10 to 1. The group said 260
stories were neutral.
</P>
<P>
	   Naomi Paiss, spokeswoman for Handgun Control, said the complaints were
unfounded. ``This is clearly the comedy press conference with which to start off
the new year.''

   McALESTER, Okla. (AP) -- A man who raped and suffocated a 76-year-old woman
in her Oklahoma City apartment in 1981 was executed by injection early Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Unveils Legislative Agenda  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton says he is hopeful he can get Congress
to agree on ``a simple bill'' to shore up Social Security as part of his
final-year legislative agenda.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton emerged from a meeting Wednesday with Senate Minority Leader Tom
Daschle, D-S.D., and House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., saying he
believes the Social Security program, which faces insolvency by 2034 as baby
boomers retire, can be extended through a compromise that would devote interest
savings from the national debt and the Social Security surplus to its trust
fund.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If we just did that, a simple bill, we could take Social Security out
beyond the life of the baby boom generation,'' Clinton said. ``If there is a
willingness to do it, I am certainly more than willing to do my part and to meet
them halfway on it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton revealed the Social Security idea as part of an overall legislative
agenda for his final full year in office. The agenda is focused on a plan to fix
crumbling schools -- the type of issue on which polls say Democrats hold an
advantage, even though Republicans have tried to improve their image by, among
other things, supporting added spending for schools.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We can't expect our students to meet high academic standards if their
schools don't even meet high building standards,'' Clinton said. ``Our New
Year's resolution is to reach across party lines to help our children reach for
the sky.''
</P>
<P>
	   Otherwise, Clinton's agenda consists mostly of efforts he pursued
unsuccessfully last year, such as hate crime legislation, gun restrictions, a
minimum wage increase, a patient's bill of rights and boosting Social Security
and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This unfinished agenda was a casualty of last year's raw partisan
politics,'' Gephardt said. ``We all hope this year can be different.''
</P>
<P>
	   House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas, said that despite
Clinton's proposal, the GOP is planning another school construction proposal as
part of an overall tax relief package.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For the past two years, the House of Representatives passed plans to help
build and renovate public schools, but both times the president blocked them,''
Archer said. ``I hope this year that our schoolchildren will come before
politics, and that the president works with us. We need to get this done.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said he does not worry that, in an election year, he may lose
support among Democrats for much of his agenda.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There will always be differences of opinion that will shape the coming
election, and that is in the very nature of democracy,'' Clinton said. ``So I
don't believe that it, in any ways, weakens the position of my party in the
coming elections to do things that are good for America now.''
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic sources speaking on condition of anonymity said that in their
private meeting, Clinton, Gephardt and Daschle also agreed that Congress should
act early on legislation relating to China's membership in the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House signed off on WTO membership for China as part of
negotiations concluded last fall, but Congress must award Beijing normal trade
status permanently for U.S. companies to benefit from WTO rules. Current law
requires Congress to vote each year on whether to extend normal trade relations
to the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
	   The issue divides both political parties in the House, but Democrats more so
than Republicans. Organized labor generally opposes China's entry into the WTO
on grounds it would cost some domestic workers their jobs. Some Republicans cite
Chinese human rights violations as a cause for opposition.
</P>
<P>
	   The president wants a new program that devotes $1.3 billion a year to school
construction. He also is seeking to revive earlier efforts to use tax breaks to
help communities upgrade existing schools. The plan will be included in the
fiscal 2001 budget he will send to Congress on Feb. 7.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not expected to be embraced by the GOP-controlled Congress, which
consistently has been cool to his education proposals. But White House spokesman
Joe Lockhart said there is a sense this year that Republican leaders will not be
able to thwart the plan during budget negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're determined to get this problem addressed any way we can, and if the
Republican majority wants to block it, we're going to find innovative ways to
unblock it,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, Clinton's budget proposed using $3.7 billion in tax credits over
five years to help local governments issue nearly $25 billion worth of bonds for
school repair and modernization. He said that would be enough to improve 5,000
schools.

<HEADLINE> Honduran Indian Leader Slain  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) -- Prosecutors have announced they are mounting a
criminal investigation into the Dec. 31 strangling death of a leader of the
country's Lenca Indian group.
</P>
<P>
	   The death of Jose Cosme Reyes, a local secretary of the National Lenca
Indigenous Organization, brings to 54 the number of indigenous leaders killed in
the last 9 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Gilberto Sanchez, the government's special prosecutor for ethnic groups,
said Wednesday that ``we still do not know the circumstances'' of Reyes' death
in the village of La Campa, 120 miles west of Tegucigalpa.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A large number of Indian leaders have been persecuted in Honduras because
of their efforts. Our aim is to find out if this case involves racism or
repression against Honduran Indians,'' Sanchez said.
</P>
<P>
	   In May, prosecutors asked courts to issue arrest warrants for 10 landowners
on charges of killing at least 42 of the Indian leaders in land disputes.
</P>
<P>
	   Indian groups have long accused landlords, woodcutters and some soldiers of
killing their leaders in conflicts over lands in central Honduras, where some
12,000 members of the Lenca tribe live.
</P>
<P>
	   About 10 percent of Honduras' 6.3 million people are Indians of seven
tribes. Most live in poverty and many have struggled against encroachments on
their lands.

<HEADLINE> Cubans Warned Against Elian Optimism  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- While an important step, the U.S. government decision to
return 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez to Cuba does not guarantee that the boy will be
repatriated, the communist leadership warned.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Nothing is certain concerning his return to Cuba,'' said a government
communique, read Wednesday night at a pro-Elian rally attended by President
Fidel Castro. Cuban exiles in Miami will now ``proceed with all their resources
to impede or delay'' the decision by the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
	   The government exhorted citizens to keep up mass protests pressing for
Elian's return until the boy comes home. ``We cannot stop mobilizing! The
struggle must not stop for one minute!'' said the message, read during the rally
of several thousand Cuban scientists by Hassan Perez, president of the
government's University Students Federation.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuba appealed to world opinion, and American opinion in particular, to help
prevent its enemies in Miami from trying to block the child's return.
</P>
<P>
	   Found clinging to an inner tube off the coast of Florida in late November,
Elian has been the subject of an international custody battle.
</P>
<P>
	   His mother died trying to get Elian and herself to the United States. The
boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, lives in Cuba and wants him back.
</P>
<P>
	   But Elian's relatives in Miami have fought to keep the boy permanently,
saying they could provide him with a better life than he would have on the
communist island. They said they would appeal the decision, announced Wednesday
by INS Commissioner Doris Meissner, that Elian must be returned to his father by

<HEADLINE> Solitary confinement ordered for inmate who confessed to killing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A gang leader who calmly described his role in killing
six men will face solitary confinement after a judge apparently decided he was
too dangerous to be around other inmates.
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum questioned Peter Rollock about
the murders during his guilty plea Tuesday. Rollock, nicknamed "Pistol Pete,"
had agreed to plead guilty to avoid a possible death sentence.
</P>
<P>
	   By Wednesday, Rollock was in solitary confinement awaiting a March 24
sentencing for the murders carried out by the Sex, Money and Murder gang he led
from 1990 through 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of his plea deal, Rollock agreed to solitary confinement with no
contact with other prisoners.
</P>
<P>
	   Rollock admitted participating in six murders, two conspiracies to murder,
witness tampering by murder, drug distribution and using and carrying firearms
in connection with crimes of violence.
</P>
<P>
	   He faces life in prison without parole.
</P>
<P>
	   During the plea, Rollock described each of the killings, demonstrating his
role as leader of the group most vividly with his description of a former
associate's murder.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he was in prison in North Carolina when he gave his gang permission
to murder the former associate, someone who had helped him murder others in the
past.
</P>
<P>
	   "Did you agree to it or did you order it?" Cedarbaum asked.
</P>
<P>
	   "I approved it," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Did they need your approval?" she asked.
</P>
<P>
	   "Yes. I don't think they would have acted if they didn't get my approval,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Repeatedly, Rollock admitted he was a gang leader with deadly intentions,
beginning with the August 1993 killing of a man in Manhattan who Rollock thought
had a gun.
</P>
<P>
	   "You're telling me this was self defense?" the judge asked.
</P>
<P>
	   Then Rollock explained that he actually wanted to kill the man because he
viewed him as a threat to other members of his drug operation.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was your regular practice as the leader of this group to carry a gun?"
the judge asked.
</P>
<P>
	   "Yes," he said.

<HEADLINE> Pataki: The future begins in changing New York education  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A new era in New York can only begin after the
state's education system is reformed, despite the state's impressive record of
tax cutting, welfare roll slashing and crime fighting, Gov. George Pataki says.
<P>
	   The New York Republican, still angling for a possible vice presidential
nomination, sought to burnish his conservative credentials Wednesday as he
delivered his sixth State of the State message to open the 223rd session of the
New York Legislature.
</P>
<P>
	   And Pataki used education as his starting point, calling for school children
to adhere to codes of conduct and teachers to undergo background checks and
crisis training.
</P>
<P>
	   "History must say that we were not just marking time, that we were not
content to merely carry the torch of time, but that we did all that could be
done to make it burn as bright as possible before handing it on to the next
generation," Pataki told lawmakers during his one-hour speech.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to a $700 million tax-cut proposal aimed mostly at businesses,
Pataki also called for legislation that would permit those convicted of three
misdemeanors to be tried as felons on subsequent misdemeanor arrests.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki's education plan - called "Schools 2000" - follows last year's
well-publicized rash of school shootings in Colorado, Oklahoma, Georgia and
other states. While his state was spared the violence epitomized by the massacre
at Columbine High, Pataki has stressed that school safety should go hand-in-hand
with the ongoing campaign to bring more accountability to New York's educational
system.
</P>
<P>
	   "Schools 2000 will create safe schools for our children and families, ensure
that all our children have a qualified teacher and insist that failing schools
are held accountable," said Pataki, who admitted he felt "sick as a dog" before
his early afternoon speech was delivered to a joint session of the state
Legislature in the cavernous Assembly chamber of the state Capitol.
</P>
<P>
	   Braving freezing temperatures, thousands of state workers demonstrated
outside the Capitol against the governor. They have been without a contract
since April of last year. Concern about the demonstrations had led to unusually
tight security in and around the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
	   To help keep schools safe, Pataki wants all school districts to establish
codes of conduct that would cover everything from appropriate standards for
language and dress to rules for expulsion of students. He again called for
teachers to get the power to banish unruly students from their classrooms for up
to 10 days.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor said all districts should also be required to teach students
about "civility, character and citizenship" and instruct them on "principles
including honesty, tolerance ... (and) observance of laws and rules, courtesy
and dignity."
</P>
<P>
	   Those proposals were largely taken from the 1999 recommendations of a task
force on school violence appointed by Pataki and chaired by Lt. Gov. Mary
Donohue.
</P>
<P>
	   Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver applauded the governor for his concern but
noted that Pataki didn't mention anything about new gun control laws. "Guns in
our schools, guns on our streets ... He didn't touch on that at all," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki also called for creation of a statewide database that would track all
violent crimes in schools and mandatory violence prevention training for
teachers and school administrators.
</P>
<P>
	   To fight crime generally, Pataki called on the Legislature to adopt his
measure that would allow criminals convicted of multiple misdemeanors to be
tried as felons.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor renewed his calls for ending parole for all felons - it was
ended for violent felons last year - and for taking DNA samples from everyone
convicted of a crime. Currently, the state is only authorized to take DNA
samples from those convicted of certain violent felonies.
</P>
<P>
	   New York ran into education problems last year while trying to move to
higher educational standards, as seen in reports of teacher-approved cheating on
standardized tests in New York City and statewide test results showing more than
half of last year's fourth graders failing a standardized English test.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki's plan would battle the problem by getting more teachers into the
schools that would need them.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki called for the creation of 5,000 awards that would cover tuition
costs of up to $3,400 a year - equivalent to tuition at State University of New
York campuses - for prospective teachers agreeing to work in areas of the state
with chronic teacher shortages.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor also called for creation of "alternative credentialing" of
teachers that would allow people who have lived lives of accomplishments to
serve as classroom teachers, even though they don't have traditional teacher
training.
</P>
<P>
	   "Right now, Colin Powell can't teach in the New York schools that he grew up
in," Pataki said. "Billy Joel is not 'qualified' to teach piano to kids on Long
Island."
</P>
<P>
	   Education Commissioner Richard Mills and Regent Chancellor Carl Hayden both
applauded Pataki's speech.
</P>
<P>
	   "You have the governor of the state of New York giving a powerful recruiting
message for teachers," Mills said.
</P>
<P>
	   Not everyone approved, however. Alan Lubin, executive vice president of New
York State United Teachers union, called Pataki's plan unrealistic. He says
there's already a system that would allow non-teachers to get a waiver to teach
for a year.
</P>
<P>
	   "No matter how talented, Billy Joel or any other prospective teacher must
prove they can cut it in the classroom and show mastery of teaching methods," he
said.

Bradley, Gore Face Off on Health Care
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   DURHAM N.H. (AP) -- In a feisty first debate of the new year, Democratic
presidential candidate Bill Bradley said Al Gore is stuck "in a Washington
bunker," and the vice president accused his rival of leaving New Hampshire
residents "high and dry" on health care. Bradley was more aggressive than usual
Wednesday night, forcing Gore to defend himself on a string of issues related to
President Clinton. Gore, armed with notecards and notepads, initially appeared
uncomfortable but warmed to the task of challenging Bradley's health care plan.
Holding up a chart, Gore said New Hampshire residents would be "left out. They
would be left high and dry" under Bradley's proposal for near-universal health
care coverage.

Media Accused of Gun Control Bias

<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The television networks are so badly slanting the gun
control debate they have become the "communications division of the anti-gun
lobby," says the head of a conservative media watchdog group that studied the
issue. The Media Research Center, chaired by Brent Bozell, released a study
Wednesday on two years of television news stories on gun control. The study
analyzed the morning shows and evening newscasts between July 1, 1997 and June
30, 1999 on ABC, CBS, CNN and NBC. In many cases, the study claimed, pro-gun
themes were not covered and gun proponents were not given air time.

the middle of an international tug-of-war since he was found Thanksgiving Day

of five random numbers, adding to a growing body of evidence that animals have
some basic numerical ability. The chimp had already demonstrated that she could
put five numbers in ascending order. But researchers took the experiment a step
further. When the chimp touched the first number, the four others were covered
up behind small white squares on the screen. She then had to touch the squares
in the proper order. Kawai and Matsuzawa said the chimp had to memorize all the
numbers in order to make the right choices. The chimp succeeded better than 90
percent of the time in identifying four numbers in the proper order.

<HEADLINE> China Sentences Falun Gong Members  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- A couple arrested in the crackdown on the Falun Gong
spiritual movement were sentenced Thursday to prison terms of eight and six
years in a secret trial in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, a rights group
reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The Wuhan No. 1 Intermediate People's Court convicted Xu Xianglan and her
husband Wang Hansheng of organizing and using a cult to undermine the law in the
trial that began on Dec. 23, the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human
Rights and Democratic Movement in China reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Xu, who was a chief organizer for Falun Gong in central China, was sentenced
to eight years in prison and her husband, Wang, to six years, it said.
</P>
<P>
	   The court was unable to find evidence to support accusations in state news
media that the movement's founder, Li Hongzhi, shared huge profits made by the
couple's sales of Falun Gong books and photos, the Information Center said.
</P>
<P>
	   It said the couple had not yet been able to discuss an appeal with their
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
	   Court officials have refused to comment on the case.
</P>
<P>
	   The government banned the popular spiritual movement in July, calling it the
worst threat to communist control since nationwide democracy demonstrations in
1989.
</P>
<P>
	   The Information Center also reported that a former student leader of the
1989 Tiananmen Square democracy protests was sentenced to four years in prison
for tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
	   Yang Tao, 29, was arrested in Guangzhou city in May on subversion charges
for trying to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the June 4, 1989, military
assault in which hundreds, perhaps thousands, of unarmed protesters died.
</P>
<P>
	   The Tianhe District Court sentenced Yang on Wednesday to four years in
prison for evading more than $1,200 in taxes on earnings from his private
computer business, after it was unable to find enough evidence to convict him on
the subversion charges.
</P>
<P>
	   The group said that since Yang's business was small, the government had no
records to work from and that police had intimidated witnesses into testifying
that he owed more money than he had paid.
</P>
<P>
	   Yang, a former history student at prestigious Beijing University, was
imprisoned for 18 months after the protests were crushed.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Approves Khmer Rouge Trial  </HEADLINE>
   By KER MUNTHIT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) -- The Cambodian government gave quick approval
today to a plan to try surviving Khmer Rouge leaders for genocide, despite
lingering U.N. concerns over limits on how much influence international jurists
will have.
</P>
<P>
	   Hours before the Cabinet heeded Prime Minister Hun Sen's urgings to back the
proposal, U.N. legal counsel Hans Corell told Cambodia's U.N. ambassador, Ouch
Borith, in New York of ``some remaining concerns.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hun Sen did not mention that meeting as he opened the Cabinet session, but
he warned his ministers they might have to work into the night to pass the
tribunal framework. Instead, they approved it before lunchtime, said government
spokesman Khieu Thakiva.
</P>
<P>
	   The passage of the tribunal plan comes on the eve of the 21st anniversary of
the Khmer Rouge's fall from power after an invasion by Vietnamese forces. After
their fall, the horrors of their ultra-radical rule were uncovered.
</P>
<P>
	   Less than four years earlier, the Khmer Rouge had won a civil war against a
U.S.-backed regime and emptied Cambodia's cities, forcing the entire population
into Maoist-style farming collectives.
</P>
<P>
	   Starvation, disease and systematic executions cost the lives of 1.7 million
people, about one Cambodian in five.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Khmer Rouge were not entirely defeated after the Vietnamese invasion
and fought a guerrilla war against successive governments until 1996, when the
leadership began breaking up. By the end of 1998, the movement was finished.
</P>
<P>
	   Cambodia has wooed U.N. support for a trial of surviving leaders, but has
rejected calls for a U.N.-run international tribunal, arguing it would violate
national sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
	   Cambodia's current plan calls for a handful of U.N.-selected judges to work
alongside a majority of Cambodians.
</P>
<P>
	   The formula, which requires the agreement of at least one foreign judge to
pass rulings, has received support from the United States. But some diplomats at
the United Nations warn it gives Cambodian judges effective control and the
power to acquit.
</P>
<P>
	   And despite Hun Sen's assurances that the tribunal will be independent,
human rights groups worry Cambodian judges will still be subject to intense
political pressure.
</P>
<P>
	   Cambodia's court system is notoriously corrupt and biased toward Hun Sen's
ruling party, which is led by former Khmer Rouge who fled purges of the movement
in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
	   Hun Sen also negotiated the defection of several senior Khmer Rouge,
currently living freely in a former stronghold, leading to the group's collapse
as a fighting force.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics fear the defectors may escape justice if Cambodians control the
tribunal.
</P>
<P>
	   At the moment, just two senior Khmer Rouge figures -- guerrilla chief Ta Mok
and Kaing Khek Iev, who headed a prison and torture center -- are in custody
awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
	   International pressure is nonetheless building for the United Nations --
which still recognized the Khmer Rouge as part of Cambodia's government for a
decade after their overthrow -- to find justice for the victims and survivors of
the Cambodian genocide.
</P>
<P>
	   The Khmer Rouge escaped trial for many years because the United States and
China supported the guerrillas over Hun Sen's Vietnamese-backed government of
the 1980s. Longtime leader Pol Pot died on the run last year.
</P>
<P>
	   While trials are expected to be limited to the 1975-79 rule of the Khmer
Rouge, the question of involvement by the United States, China and the United
Nations in fostering the movement's survival is certain to emerge.

<HEADLINE> Duval Feeling Fit To Catch Tiger  </HEADLINE>
    By DOUG FERGUSON AP Golf Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KAPALUA, Hawaii (AP) -- David Duval had one of the best years no one
remembers. He returns to the Mercedes Championship as a defending champion, and
no one talks about it.
</P>
<P>
	   It was only 12 months ago that Duval overwhelmed the Plantation course at
Kapalua for a 9-stroke victory, the largest winning margin of the year. And that
was only the start.
</P>
<P>
	   He shot a 59 to the win the Bob Hope Classic, had a gutsy performance on a
brutally tough course to win The Players Championship, followed by his fourth
victory in eight starts in Atlanta -- a stretch of golf that elevated him to No.
1 in the world.
</P>
<P>
	   "That was a long time ago," Duval said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   It certainly feels like it.
</P>
<P>
	   The 30 players who won PGA Tour events last year gathered on the west coast
of Maui to start the year, but only one name seems to really matter right now --
Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods became the first player in 25 years to win eight times on tour, and
his four-tournament winning streak to close out his sensational season was the
longest since 1953.
</P>
<P>
	   "Whether I raised the bar too high, I don't know," Woods said Wednesday. "I
just know I'm going to continue to try to improve."
</P>
<P>
	   That means everyone else will have to get better, too.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's on top of it right now," Duval said. "He's played super golf for a
long time. He's been on his game and he's playing like he thinks he can. I would
expect nothing less for a while to come."
</P>
<P>
	   Duval was in Woods' shoes two years ago. He won the final three events of
the 1997 season and came to the winners-only Mercedes Championship with a chance
to become the first player since Ben Hogan in 1953 to win four in a row. He tied
for sixth.
</P>
<P>
	   "It didn't feel to me like I was trying for a fourth in a row," Duval said.
"There was no continuity for it. It's the start of a new year."
</P>
<P>
	   Woods played three more events after the tour season ended -- winning two of
them -- then returned to golf last week in his Williams World Challenge in
Arizona. But it's back to business now, and Woods has a chance at more history.
</P>
<P>
	   Hogan was the last player to win five straight, in 1953, although the PGA
Tour didn't recognize his win in the British Open -- the oldest championship in
golf -- as an official event back then.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, matching Hogan is one thing. Another victory by Woods might send a
signal that the new year won't be much different than the old year.
</P>
<P>
	   Or it might not.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think Tiger needs to send any messages," Olin Browne said. "I think
he sent them already. He proved his point. He's out to play his best every
week."
</P>
<P>
	   His best last year was better than anyone could have imagined, especially
with the wealth of talent on tour these days.
</P>
<P>
	   No one since Johnny Miller in 1974 had won eight tour events in one year.
Beyond the victories were the close calls -- Woods only once finished lower than
seventh in his final 14 tournaments of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   "To win eight times with the strength of all the players today is beyond
words," Jesper Parnevik said. "I really can't see it being done again. But with
Tiger, you never know."
</P>
<P>
	   Thanks to Woods and Duval, who together won 12 tournaments last year, the
Mercedes field is limited to 30 players. Just as notable is who's not here --
Davis Love III, Phil Mickelson, Justin Leonard, Nick Price, Tom Lehman and Fred
Couples are among those who failed to win last year.
</P>
<P>
	   In their place are first-time winners Rich Beem, Ted Tryba, Notah Begay,
J.L. Lewis, Brent Geiberger, Mike Weir, Carlos Franco, Glen Day and Brian
Henninger.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is an unbelievable feeling to be here," Beem said. "I'm still coming
to grips with being a winner on the tour."
</P>
<P>
	   Duval, meanwhile, has sent his own message -- not by anything he has said,
but by the toned, chiseled look of a player determined to prove he can be the
best in the world. Over the past couple of months, Duval has stuck to a
disciplined regimen of exercise and diet. He looks as though he has shed 25
pounds, but the weight instead converted to muscle.
</P>
<P>
	   "What it does is it generally makes me feel better," he said. "It makes me
know that I am as fit and as athletic as anybody playing right now."
</P>
<P>
	   The question is how it will translate to scoring. Duval concedes that Woods
has set a new standard for everyone to reach, similar to what Duval did in the
first three months of a year ago. Only he's not ready to concede that Tiger will
be the only target.
</P>
<P>
	   "It might be Ernie Els," he said. "It just so happens that he (Woods) is
leading the pack right now. I guess I was the leader last year, and somebody
before that. It's just the progression."
</P>
<P>
	   Still, it all starts with Woods. The drive for five began today.

	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- The day after Virginia Tech lost its first real chance
to win a national football title, coach Frank Beamer didn't feel as disappointed
as he did the night before.
</P>
<P>
	   "I feel a lot better right now in the fact that we came back," Beamer said
Wednesday of his team's 46-29 loss in Tuesday night's Sugar Bowl. "I think I'd
really be a miserable son of a gun if that score had ended up 55-7."
</P>
<P>
	   Beamer never expected special teams and big plays to be the Hokies' undoing
in the big game, but two punts resulted in touchdowns 5:34 apart for Florida
State, and the Seminoles scored on pass plays covering 64, 63 and 43 yards.
</P>
<P>
	   "When it's all said and done, I think we're going to kick ourselves for some
of the things that took place in that ballgame," Beamer said. "It just wasn't
us. But then maybe it wasn't us because it was them, at least a little bit."
</P>
<P>
	   Virginia Tech has been the best team in the '90s at using special teams to
change games, but it was the Seminoles who turned the tide Tuesday night,
scoring one touchdown on a blocked punt and another on a 59-yard punt return.
</P>
<P>
	   The Seminoles seemed on their way to a rout early on, taking a 28-7 lead
after about 19 minutes. But with freshman phenom quarterback Michael Vick
leading the way, the Hokies rallied to lead 29-28 heading into the final
quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   The comeback ended there and Florida State put the game away, but Beamer
felt the once-maligned Hokies had proved they belonged. Their finish at No. 2 in
The Associated Press poll seemed to offer respect.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's pretty amazing, isn't it?" he said. "That's neat. I think it is some
respect for our program."
</P>
<P>
	   Beamer also gushed about Vick, whose electrifying scrambles and athletic
ability often left the largest Sugar Bowl crowd in history gasping in disbelief.
Vick was sacked seven times, and he still escaped more often than not.
</P>
<P>
	   "Boy did he make some great, just unbelievable plays," Beamer said, shaking
his head like a burned defender. "I've never seen a quarterback like that.
People have him dead to rights and can't get him. Have ya'll ever seen anybody
like that?
</P>
<P>
	   "About three or four times I was going 'Duck, Michael!' I was afraid and
then all of a sudden there he goes. Just unbelievable, just an amazing talent."
</P>
<P>
	   Vick also made some mistakes, including a fumble after a 12-yard run in the
fourth quarter when the Hokies trailed 36-29 and were driving. Another fumble
ended the first series when Beamer went for it on fourth-and-goal from the 1.
</P>
<P>
	   "The bad plays hurt, too, and Michael knows that," Beamer said. "I think his
key in the future -- and he will -- is just to become a very consistent
quarterback."
</P>
<P>
	   Vick promised that his encore in 2000 will be something to behold.
</P>
<P>
	   "I plan to come back an even better player, even better quarterback,
mentally and physically," the 19-year-old Vick said. "Expect a lot from me next
year."
</P>
<P>
	   The Hokies will have to, especially with nine offensive starters coming
back. But the defense and special teams need to be rebuilt almost completely.
</P>
<P>
	   Defensive end Corey Moore was a non-factor in the Sugar Bowl, a first for
the consensus All-American, and he and the other top four defensive lineman will
move on. Gone, too, will be linebackers Jamel Smith and Michael Hawkes,
cornerback Anthony Midget and every member of the Hokies' punting and kicking
teams.
</P>
<P>
	   Ike Charlton, the Hokies' best defensive back, also said after the game he's
likely to forego his final year of eligibility and apply for the NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
	   With the images of losing still fresh Wednesday, Beamer was still reliving
crucial plays and second-guessing risky calls that didn't work out.
</P>
<P>
	   "Would you guys have gone for that fourth down the first time?" he asked,
recalling Vick's opening-drive fumble that started the Hokies' trouble.
</P>
<P>
	   Several reporters said they would have gone for it, too.
</P>
<P>
	   "You're just saying that, aren't you, to make me feel better," Beamer
laughed. Then, easing back with a pained groan, he added: "Yeah, I'd do it again
too."
</P>
<P>
	   Beamer has insisted all along that the Hokies have risen to stay, but it
also wasn't lost on him that this may have been their best title opportunity.
</P>
<P>
	   Big underdogs, they led until 12:59 remained in the championship game.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm very disappointed that we didn't get it, because I think when we look
back, we're going to see how close, how we were right there," he said.

<HEADLINE> Lima Gets $18.75M Astros Deal  </HEADLINE>
    By MARK BABINECK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HOUSTON (AP) -- Jose Lima saw what the Houston Astros did with Mike Hampton
when he decided to test the free-agent market rather than sign a long-term deal.
They quickly traded him to the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
	   Lima, who endeared himself to Houston fans with his flamboyance on the
mound, agreed Wednesday to an $18.75 million, three-year contract that avoids
salary arbitration.
</P>
<P>
	   "I won't take my chances and go to New York," Lima said Wednesday,
accompanied by his wife, Melissa, and 18-month-old son, Jose Jr. "I'm glad they
signed me long term, and I'm the happiest man in the world today."
</P>
<P>
	   Lima, an afterthought in an eight-player trade with the Detroit Tigers in
1996, has gone 37-18 in the past two seasons, including 21-10 with a 3.58 ERA
last year as Houston won its third straight NL Central title.
</P>
<P>
	   "Jose waited for the opportunity, seized the opportunity, took advantage of
the opportunity and has become one of the best pitchers in the National League,"
Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lima, 27, is known for his on-mound exuberance.
</P>
<P>
	   "Like it or not, I like to do my dancing, my (shark-fin style) rally cap,"
he said. "If you don't like it, don't play against me. Take the day off and
enjoy it from the dugout. That's just how I am."
</P>
<P>
	   Hunsicker, a button-down traditionalist, said he'd like to see some of
Lima's spontaneity rub off on his teammates.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think what makes Jose unique is not his skill as a pitcher but his
willingness to express himself when he's not only out on the mound, but whenever
he's in public," Hunsicker said. "He's not afraid of what people think. I really
believe that has played a part in his success."
</P>
<P>
	   Lima had been an unremarkable pitcher who had little major-league success
when, after an awful 1998 spring training, he predicted he'd win at least 15
games.
</P>
<P>
	   "People laughed behind my back," Lima said. He answered with a 16-8 season.
</P>
<P>
	   Lima drew the same guffaws last spring when he promised a 20-win season on a
national radio talk show.
</P>
<P>
	   "They say, 'There goes Lima again,' " he said. "People don't want to believe
in me. But I believe in myself more than anybody. When I take the mound, I think
I'm the best pitcher on Earth.
</P>
<P>
	   With December's trade of 22-game winner Hampton to the Mets, Lima and Shane
Reynolds will anchor a rotation that likely will include Chris Holt and newcomer
Octavio Dotel. Scott Elarton, rebounding from offseason shoulder surgery, also
could have a spot if he's ready this spring.
</P>
<P>
	   Hunsicker said Tuesday he's pursuing another pitcher who could make the
rotation. Such a deal could be announced this week, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lima, who made $2,225,000 last year, would have been eligible for free
agency after the 2001 season. He gets a $4.5 million signing bonus that's
payable over three years, $3.75 million this season, $4.75 million in 2001 and
$5.75 million in 2002. He can earn a total of $2.25 million in performance
bonuses in the final two years of the contract.
</P>
<P>
	   Holt and outfielder Roger Cedeno are the only Astros still eligible for
arbitration.

<HEADLINE> Phillips: Baseball Encouraged Umps  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Calling each other nicknames like "Cowboy," "Shorty" and
"Moose," Larry Poncino thought major league umpires had solidarity when they
agreed to resign their jobs to protest their wages.
</P>
<P>
	   But Poncino, a National League umpire, told a National Labor Relations Board
hearing officer Wednesday that he discovered instead that he was out of a job,
and a renegade group of umpires had formed a new union.
</P>
<P>
	   Confronted with his own resignation letter, Poncino said he signed it
because he thought all umpires were signing similar letters. Instead, a majority
of American League umps either didn't resign or quickly withdrew their
resignations.
</P>
<P>
	   The collapsed effort ruined the strategy of the Major League Umpires
Association, led by Richie Phillips.
</P>
<P>
	   "We were a Erector set going in and we came out a bunch of Tinker Toys,"
Poncino said.
</P>
<P>
	   Phillips' union is trying to convince the hearing officer to overturn the
election it lost 57-35 to the insurgents in November.
</P>
<P>
	   Phillips claimed Wednesday that baseball commissioner Bud Selig and other
top leaders of the sport encouraged a group of insurgent umpires to form a new
union.
</P>
<P>
	   Citing telephone records of calls between Selig's office and insurgent
leader John Hirschbeck, Phillips said the owners illegally conspired with the
anti-Phillips faction.
</P>
<P>
	   The hearing officer, David L. Leach III, refused to let Phillips question
baseball lawyer Frank Coonelly or an organizer of the insurgent Major League
Umpires Independent Organizing Committee about conversations between the two.
</P>
<P>
	   Phillips said the questioning was crucial to support testimony earlier in
the day by Drew Coble, among the 22 umps who lost their jobs in September. Coble
said he was told Selig promised he could have his job back if he dropped his
support for Phillips.
</P>
<P>
	   Phillips, who has led the umpires since 1978, said the insurgents "were used
by Bud Selig and baseball as a vehicle to break the union and to send a message
to others in baseball."
</P>
<P>
	   Phillips cited telephone records that showed six telephone calls on July 22
between Selig's Milwaukee office and Hirschbeck's home, "all at the critical
time these people (umpires) allegedly were being replaced."
</P>
<P>
	   Phillips said there was a meeting that day in Selig's office of the nine top
executives in baseball, including both league presidents. He claimed they talked
about how to break the union.
</P>
<P>
	   "What happened to the 22 was done to bust the Umpires' Association," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Poncino testified that he was told by Hirschbeck's brother, Mark, that the
insurgents could have a labor contract within 72 hours if Phillips was ousted or
his union dismantled.
</P>
<P>
	   Poncino said Mark Hirschbeck, an NL ump, said in late September that with
Phillips out of the picture, the umpires could get improved severance benefits
and larger work crews, among other contract improvements.
</P>
<P>
	   Poncino said he asked Mark Hirschbeck how he learned about the possible
contract improvements, and Hirschbeck wouldn't say.
</P>
<P>
	   Poncino later asked him if he would repeat the claims at an arbitration
hearing in Philadelphia. The MLUA filed a grievance attempting to regain the
jobs of the 22.
</P>
<P>
	   "He told me he would have to deny that the conversation ever existed,"
Poncino said.
</P>
<P>
	   The MLUA rested its case, and the insurgents planned to call one or two
witnesses today. Owners weren't sure whether they would call any witnesses.

<HEADLINE> State workers protest while Pataki delivers State of State  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Unions' leaders representing 130,000 state workers
said their protest Wednesday in frigid temperatures got their message of
frustration across, even though their boss, Gov. George Pataki, wasn't
listening.
<P>
	   Thousands of workers showed their anger over working without a contract and
the little progress between labor unions and the Pataki administration. But
while the protest failed to disrupt Pataki's upbeat State of the State address,
the event made a point, labor leaders said.
</P>
<P>
	   The protest left an impression with Albany city law enforcement, too; one
that officials don't want repeated.
</P>
<P>
	   Some demonstrators taunted and threw objects at state and city police, and
part of the crowd closed a downtown street after breaking through a temporary
fence on the Capitol lawn. But there were no arrests at the demonstration
sponsored by the Civil Service Employees Association and the Public Employees
Federation, said state Criminal Justice Services Director Katherine Lapp.
</P>
<P>
	   "On behalf of everyone, we are greatly disappointed in today's acts," she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Albany Mayor Gerald Jennings said the activities of some demonstrators could
have warranted arrests, but that police decided to avoid making them.
</P>
<P>
	   Immediately after the event, several troopers at the scene said the crowd
was cooperative and they knew of no serious problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Crowd estimates varied widely.
</P>
<P>
	   State officials said 5,000 to 6,000 members of the two unions protested,
while the unions themselves said the figure was closer to 20,000.
</P>
<P>
	   While Pataki was delivering his State of the State speech in the state
Assembly chamber, union members chanted, blew whistles and beat drums outside
across the street from the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
	   Union members also toted signs for more than an hour in wind chills of
minus-2 degrees calling Pataki a hypocrite for providing double-digit raises to
lawmakers and his staff while offering little to the union members despite
budget surpluses. Some signs compared Pataki to Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
	   Forty-five minutes into Pataki's hour-long speech, protesters outside broke
through a temporary fence and streamed closer to the back of the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
	   A hundred troopers with wooden clubs held chest-high got between the
protesters and the building, flanked by Albany police in riot helmets with
visors down. They held the line with the help of union leaders as protesters
chanted "Show your face!" and "Georgie! Georgie!"
</P>
<P>
	   Protesters insisted they simply wanted their voices heard.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's all about respect," said Frank Horodysky, 60, from Poughkeepsie. "I
voted for the governor and I have a lot of respect for him, but he shouldn't
shun his people. I don't expect a 33 percent raise, but we should get at least 4
or 5 percent."
</P>
<P>
	   The Pataki administration's latest offer included 11-percent raises over
four years.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's not offering me anything," said Diane Lilly, 43, of Brooklyn. After
nine years as a keyboard specialist while also performing the duties of
timekeeper, purchasing agent and commissary worker at the Queens Borough
Correctional Facility, she said she and her three children live on her salary of
$23,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
	   "The state is dealing with us like a public assistance project," said George
Gergis, 57, who with 18 other PEF members left on a 5:30 a.m. bus from Long
Island. The pharmacist has worked at the Pilgrim Psychiatric Center for 23 years
and makes $43,000 a year. He said the private-sector equivalent would be
$65,000.
</P>
<P>
	   The 11 percent, four-year package offered to the unions is similar to deals
already approved by CSEA members at the state Thruway Authority and by United
University Professions, Pataki spokesman Michael McKeon said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've tried to talk to the union in recent weeks, but they said they can't
go," McKeon said. "CSEA has made it clear to us they don't have time to
negotiate."
</P>
<P>
	   "This was the Y2K of union protests," McKeon added. "A whole lot of hype
that didn't hold up."
</P>
<P>
	   McKeon said union leaders are too busy getting re-elected to negotiate and
he called Wednesday's protest nothing more than a campaign rally for CSEA
President Danny Donohue.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pataki administration said it has made a "solid offer" to the unions
that represent 130,000 workers and treated the members as the best public
workers in the nation.
</P>
<P>
	   State police refused to say how many additional officers were assigned to
the Capitol Wednesday or the cost, but uniformed state police could be seen at
doorways in the Capitol and throughout the adjoining Empire State Plaza in
numbers rarely seen.

<HEADLINE> Teen Hockey Player Pleads Innocent  </HEADLINE>
    By MIKE ROBINSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WAUKEGAN, Ill. (AP) -- A teen-ager pleaded innocent to aggravated battery
stemming from a high school hockey game last November in which the captain of a
rival team was paralyzed after being slammed into the boards.
</P>
<P>
	   The youthful defendant, 15, sat silently through a brief hearing before
Circuit Judge John G. Radosevich on Wednesday, allowing his attorneys to do the
talking. He left the Lake County courthouse out of sight of reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   "When he learned the magnitude of the injuries, I think it's fair to say
that he was devastated," defense attorney Jeffrey Steinback said at a news
conference later.
</P>
<P>
	   The Glenbrook North student, who hasn't been identified because he is a
juvenile, is charged with two counts of aggravated battery for delivering the
hit that sent Neal Goss, also 15, into the boards head first. Goss is paralyzed
from the chest down.
</P>
<P>
	   The collision occurred close to the buzzer ending the game between Glenbrook
North and New Trier, both located in Chicago's north suburbs.
</P>
<P>
	   Radosevich told the defendant that if he is found guilty, the penalties
could range from supervision -- after which his record could be expunged -- to
confinement in a juvenile facility until he is 21 years old.
</P>
<P>
	   The head of the criminal division of the Lake County State's Attorney's
office, George Strickland, said that his department had a "responsibility under
the law" to bring charges due in part to the severity of the injury.
</P>
<P>
	   "He intended to injure the victim," Strickland said. "We're not contending
that he intended to paralyze him."
</P>
<P>
	   Steinback said it was too early to say exactly what happened in the Nov. 3
incident.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are no facts that have been established in this case whatsoever,"
Steinback said. But he said he believed that what happened "was in the context
of the game."
</P>
<P>
	   The game was marked by taunting and intense hits before the incident.
</P>
<P>
	   A civil lawsuit filed by Goss includes officials with the Illinois Hockey
Officials Association as defendants, contending they were unable during and
after the game "to adequately and ably control the game between the two teams."
</P>
<P>
	   The suit also claims Glenbrook North coach Adam Young "rallied his players
during the game to take special action against" Goss because of his leadership
on the New Trier team.
</P>
<P>
	   The next hearing in the case has been set for Jan. 26.

<HEADLINE> Saints Fire Mike Ditka  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Mike Ditka, who came to New Orleans three years ago
talking Super Bowl, is leaving with regrets that he didn't get one more year.
</P>
<P>
	   "It surprised me," Ditka said after Saints owner Tom Benson fired him and 22
assistants Wednesday. "I really thought we would get another year to try to get
untracked."
</P>
<P>
	   Ditka followed a pair of 6-10 records with a 3-13 mark this season, the
second-worst in franchise history. The losses, poor play and apparent
disorganization during games infuriated fans, who booed Ditka for the first time
in his tenure this season.
</P>
<P>
	   "I walked to the door and started cheering," said Saints fan Alan Cousin Sr,
a 46-year-old U.S. Postal Service manager. "Ditka is great personally. I love
him, but I think the game has passed him by. The cost of the product wasn't
worth it."
</P>
<P>
	   Beloved in Chicago for 11 seasons after leading "Da Bears" to the Super Bowl
in 1986, Iron Mike could not stop a downward slide in New Orleans. Add to that a
trade of eight draft picks to get running back Ricky Williams, and Ditka ran out
of chances.
</P>
<P>
	   "We tried, but we didn't get it done," Ditka said. "That's the bottom line.
When you don't get it done, you're going to get out of there in a hurry."
</P>
<P>
	   The 60-year-old Ditka said he had hoped to stay on as coach despite the
team's troubles but, with the firing, said he would never coach a football team
again.
</P>
<P>
	   "Nope, never, no," Ditka said.
</P>
<P>
	   When he drafted him, Ditka proclaimed Williams the "final piece of the
puzzle" for the Saints and again talked of taking the team to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   But Williams, who was injured for much of the season, gained only 884 yards
and two touchdowns rushing -- including 7 yards on 14 carries in the final game
against Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   "I understand it fully: You're 3-13, you have the expectations we do, you
bring in Ricky Williams, and it doesn't work out," Ditka said. "I mean, we got
to be realists."
</P>
<P>
	   Ditka originally signed a three-year contract and said he should be fired if
he couldn't accomplish his goals. He finished with a 15-33 record, including
6-23 in the last 29 games, and a league-leading 14-game road losing streak.
</P>
<P>
	   This season's record is the worst ever for Ditka. His previous worst mark
was 5-11 with the Bears in 1992, which led Chicago to fire him.
</P>
<P>
	   Also fired Wednesday by Saints owner Tom Benson were general manager Bill
Kuharich, senior vice president Terry O'Neil and 19 assistant coaches. Benson
described it as the first step in returning the Saints to the spot the team
enjoyed in the late 1980s, when it had its only winning years and made four
trips to the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
	   "This was a difficult decision," Benson said. "Mike Ditka is one of the
greatest football people ever."
</P>
<P>
	   Financial terms of Ditka's departure were not disclosed, but he signed a
contract extension two years ago. The new deal runs through 2002 and is
reportedly worth $2 million a year.
</P>
<P>
	   Benson said the search for a new general manager and coach would begin
immediately and continue until he finds candidates to "take us where our
organization and our fans want to be."
</P>
<P>
	   Under Ditka, Chicago dominated the NFC Central with 52 regular-season
victories between 1985-88. That was the most wins by an NFL team in any
four-year period.
</P>
<P>
	   Ditka ranked second among Bears coaches in both tenure and victories. He
coached the Bears to six NFC Central titles, three appearances in the NFC title
game and a Super Bowl title in 1986. The Bears were 18-1 that year. After the
Super Bowl, Ditka was honored as coach of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   After being fired by Chicago, Ditka worked as an NBC commentator for four
years. He was hired by the Saints on Jan. 28, 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Ditka's first year was marked by sideline tantrums, yanking players out of
games and even a threat to quit, which he rescinded later.
</P>
<P>
	   "With all the ranting and raving that people saw, he always left it on the
field," quarterback Billy Joe Tolliver said. "He had his say and moved on. He
was never devious. He's a man's man and a stand-up guy, and I have a lot of
respect for him."
</P>
<P>
	   Ditka maintained close ties with Chicago, where he has a restaurant. His
newly completed restaurant in New Orleans is scheduled to open Jan. 14.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite his Chicago connections, Ditka tried to adopt New Orleans as his

</P>
<P>
	   After he drafted Williams, Ditka donned a dreadlocks wig and formal attire
and posed with the running back in a wedding dress on the cover of a national
magazine.

	   Ditka played in five Pro Bowls, two league championships (1963, 1971) and a
Super Bowl during his NFL playing career with Chicago, Philadelphia and Dallas.
</P>
<P>
	   He was the first tight end to be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of
Fame. He was the NFL rookie of the year in 1961. Ditka was also an assistant
coach with Dallas in 1977.
</P>
<P>
	   Ditka's firing was the fifth NFL coaching change since the end of the
regular season. Ray Rhodes of Green Bay and Pete Carroll of New England were
fired, and the New York Jets had a double resignation, with Bill Belichick
following Bill Parcells.

<HEADLINE> AP Names Kurt Warner NFL MVP  </HEADLINE>
    By BARRY WILNER AP Football Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Last winter, Kurt Warner was an obscure quarterback
available in the expansion draft. The Cleveland Browns could have had him for
next to nothing.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, Warner was selected the NFL's Most Valuable Player by The
Associated Press. If the Browns or anyone else want him now, well, forget it.
He's not available.
</P>
<P>
	   "Kurt is an example of what a team player is all about," St. Louis Rams
coach Dick Vermeil said. "He's not about individual things or in this for
individual awards."
</P>
<P>
	   Yet Warner received the most significant individual honor in pro football,
joining the likes of Brett Favre, the only three-time recipient; Joe Montana;
and many other quarterbacks with Hall of Fame credentials.
</P>
<P>
	   That Warner would be in such a position is astonishing. A refugee from NFL
Europe, where he led the league in passing, and a three-year starter with Iowa
of Arena Football, not even Warner could imagine the kind of season he had.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner joined Dan Marino as the only NFL players with at least 40 touchdown
passes. He completed 325 of 499 passes (65.1 percent) for 4,353 yards and had
just 13 interceptions. His 109.2 rating easily led the league as he helped
engineer the Rams' turnaround from 4-12 to 12-3 and a favorite's role in the NFC
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
	   He was a questionable backup in training camp before Trent Green, signed as
a big-money free agent, wrecked his knee.
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought we could be successful," Warner said, "but to think in training
camp that it would happen for me this way was pretty farfetched. They were not
sure what they would do going in, they had some questions if I was an NFL
backup."
</P>
<P>
	   He obliterated all the questions throughout the league. Warner's big year
earned him 33 votes in balloting by a nationwide panel of 50 media members. That
far outdistanced teammate Marshall Faulk and Indianapolis quarterback Peyton
Manning, each of whom had eight votes. Colts rookie running back Edgerrin James
got one.
</P>
<P>
	   "I just felt comfortable out there," Warner said, noting how the experience
in other leagues helped him recognize defenses and make quick decisions. "I when
out there not thinking about it as a different game than what I had been
playing. It is all playing football and making plays wherever you are. You have
seen it at numerous times. Maybe the systems are different and the people are
different, but you are playing football. It's all very similar to what I have
done in the past."
</P>
<P>
	   Except now he has done it on the biggest stage. And he's made the folks from
his past proud.
</P>
<P>
	   "There may not be a more deserving player than Kurt Warner, a man who
represents all the good things in sports: courage and character and
determination," AFL commissioner David Baker said. "We are honored to say Kurt
was a part of the Arena Football League."
</P>
<P>
	   Warner is the second Rams quarterback to win MVP; Roman Gabriel won it in
1969.
</P>
<P>
	   Without the likes of Faulk, only the second player to gain 1,000 yards
rushing and 1,000 receiving in a season -- he broke Barry Sanders' total yardage
mark of 2,358 by gaining 2,429 -- wideouts Isaac Bruce, Az-Zahir Hakim and Torry
Holt and a steady line, Warner might still be a relative unknown.
</P>
<P>
	   "It never hurts when you have the guys we have," Warner, 28, said. "Marshall
is a special back and does so many things well. I have as good a wide receiver
corps as anyone in the NFL. It's great to be in my position and have all those
weapons at your disposal."
</P>
<P>
	   Plus a coach who has such faith in you.
</P>
<P>
	   "Dick was very instrumental in this," Warner said. "He had that much
confidence in me and he showed it when he said I'd be the guy and he was going
with me. That was a big confidence-booster for me, to know that he had so much
confidence in me was a big help to me."
</P>
<P>
	   Few players ever have rewarded such faith so well.

<HEADLINE> Benched Flutie Still Angry  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) -- Buffalo quarterbacks Doug Flutie and Rob Johnson
have switched roles. Now, Johnson will play and Flutie will watch.
</P>
<P>
	   The benched quarterback wasn't any happier Wednesday than he was Monday, the
day coach Wade Phillips selected Johnson to start the wild-card playoff game at
Tennessee on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Flutie's demotion rekindled old resentments for the 1984 Heisman Trophy
winner and six-time Canadian Football League MVP.
</P>
<P>
	   "The thing that frustrates me more than anything is I've been waiting 10
years for this opportunity," Flutie said. "We've got a great football team.
We've got the best defense in the league.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've got a real chance," Flutie said. "And this is the reason I came back
... and then all of a sudden you turn it over. That's the frustrating part for
me."
</P>
<P>
	   Flutie said that when he signed with the Bills in January 1998, he was told
there would be open competition for the starting job. Then Johnson signed and
was designated the starter before training camp began despite having just one
NFL start to his credit.
</P>
<P>
	   After Johnson was hurt in the fifth game last season, Flutie took over and
led the team to the playoffs. Phillips waited about a month to declare Flutie
the starter.
</P>
<P>
	   Phillips designated Flutie and Johnson co-starters in training camp this
season and again hesitated to declare Flutie his No. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   Flutie was suspicious when the Bills told him to rest and decided to start
Johnson for Sunday's game against Indianapolis, which the Bills won 31-6 as
Johnson completed 24 of 32 passes for 287 yards and two touchdowns. Johnson also
played well in the final game last season against the New Orleans Saints.
</P>
<P>
	   Flutie thought something was up then, too.
</P>
<P>
	   "I saw it coming last year," he said. "I thought that's why they were
starting Rob at New Orleans. But I'm paranoid about that stuff because I've been
through it too many times ... going to the Pro Bowl last year, leading the team
to the playoffs and going to training camp and being named co-starter."
</P>
<P>
	   The Bills deny the ill-timed quarterback controversy is a distraction.
</P>
<P>
	   "Both guys throw the ball well, so whoever they put in there, I just catch
passes from," Bills receiver Eric Moulds said. "Of course, Rob has a stronger
arm and he's a little bit bigger quarterback."
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think the guys on the team care," Johnson said. "If you don't play
well, they'll find somebody else. The team is confident in me right now."
</P>
<P>
	   Flutie is rated 13th in the AFC and 23rd in the league with a rating of
75.1, a notch below New England's Drew Bledsoe. He has thrown 19 touchdown
passes and 16 interceptions.
</P>
<P>
	   "You should talk to my wife," Flutie said. "Basically she said 'I told you
so' and can't wait for me to come home. I don't think my role with this team is
through. We'll see how it plays out."

    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Those listening to Gov. George Pataki's sixth State

<HEADLINE> Seahawks' Watters Still Hurting  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    KIRKLAND, Wash. (AP) -- Ricky Watters watched the afternoon practice in the
Seattle Seahawks' practice bubble with a hood drawn tightly over his head.
</P>
<P>
	   The star running back wasn't part of Wednesday's workout because he's still
bothered by a sprained right knee.
</P>
<P>
	   Coach Mike Holmgren, looking for a running attack to go with quarterback Jon
Kitna in Sunday's playoff game against Miami, hopes to have Watters practice
today and Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Watters was asked Wednesday if he was going to play.
</P>
<P>
	   "Is that a question?" he asked. "I played last Sunday. You know I'm going to
play this Sunday."
</P>
<P>
	   He promised to be a different player Sunday than the Watters who showed up
at Giants Stadium in a regular season-ending loss against the New York Jets. He
had 30 yards on nine carries in a 19-9 defeat.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm definitely going to be effective," he said. "I heard that last time. It
was like, 'He's not effective, he wasn't effective.' Come on, coach didn't want
to get me hurt. It had nothing to do with me being effective. I still could have
done it."
</P>
<P>
	   Watters said he would like to play without a knee brace against the
Dolphins. He used a brace last week, but found it too bulky. If he does have to
wear one, he'd like to find a lighter one.
</P>
<P>
	   Watters expects Holmgren to go exclusively with him, not backup Ahman Green.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think he knows what time it is: It's the playoffs and we've got to do it.
I've got to go out there and I've got to do it," Watters said.
</P>
<P>
	   During the regular season, Watters rushed for 1,210 yards and five
touchdowns on 325 carries, the sixth career 1,000-yard rushing season for the
five-time Pro Bowl running back.
</P>
<P>
	   Beset by fumbling problems and injuries, Green had 120 yards on 26 carries,
with no touchdowns. Against the Jets, he got one carry.
</P>
<P>
	   Holmgren sounded less than certain about Watters' status.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think he will be better than he was last week, but he's not going to be
100 percent," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Holmgren said Watters will start against the Dolphins, but will be yanked
quickly if he can't produce. Holmgren then will turn to Green, a second-year
back from Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
	   "Ricky wanted to play last week," Holmgren said. "Our medical people said he
could play. In some respects, I kick myself. He could have played a little bit
and then I should have taken him out and let Ahman play.
</P>
<P>
	   "If that's the way it is this week, I told Ricky already that I would do
that. So everyone's on alert."
</P>
<P>
	   It will take a strong running game to beat the Dolphins, so Holmgren doesn't
want turn quarterback Kitna loose. Kitna passed a career-high 45 times against
the Jets.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's not the best way for us to win the game," Holmgren said. "I wouldn't
anticipate doing that."
</P>
<P>
	   The Seahawks lost five of their last six games, but made the playoffs as AFC
West champs when Kansas City lost in overtime to Oakland. They hope to redeem
themselves in their first playoff game since 1988.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a brand new season," Holmgren said. "You're three games away from the
Super Bowl and you're two games away from the AFC championship game. If you
can't get a spark and get fired up about that kind of stuff, something's wrong.
Then, quite honestly, those players aren't going to be around here very long."
</P>
<P>
	   In Green Bay, where Holmgren coached for seven seasons, his Packers went to
two Super Bowls and to the playoffs six times. They compiled a 9-5 record in the
playoffs, including 5-0 at home.
</P>
<P>
	   Holmgren had cold weather on his side in Green Bay. He will have the
Kingdome's noise as an ally Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Sunday's game will be the final one for the Kingdome, which is scheduled to
be demolished after the season to make way for an outdoor football stadium for
the Seahawks. The Seahawks will play two seasons at Washington's Husky Stadium
before their stadium is ready for the 2002 season.

<HEADLINE> Smith Says Payton Was Inspiration  </HEADLINE>
    By JAIME ARON AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Emmitt Smith was inspired by the death of his
childhood idol the last time he played Minnesota. This time, he'll be motivated
by the pursuit of the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith revealed Wednesday that when the Dallas Cowboys played the Vikings on
Nov. 8, he dedicated his game to the memory of Walter Payton, who died a week
before.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith would've made Sweetness proud, running for 140 yards and two
touchdowns in just 1 1/2 quarters as Dallas took a 17-0 lead. He left with a
broken hand, and the Cowboys ended up losing 27-17.
</P>
<P>
	   Dallas returns to the Metrodome on Sunday for a first-round playoff game.
Smith expects to have another big game, but for different reasons.
</P>
<P>
	   "My mindset every week is to go out and perform, but that particular night
was just a special moment for me," Smith said. "Now, this is a special moment,
too, but in a different light."
</P>
<P>
	   Smith missed only one game because of his broken hand, but a strained groin
limited him to one carry in another game. Still, he finished the season with
1,397 yards -- 8 shy of the NFC lead and his best since 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   For his career, Smith has 13,963 yards, third on the career list. He's 2,764
yards from breaking Payton's record.
</P>
<P>
	   "I lost an individual that I had looked at his personal accomplishments in
life as well as in the game of football," Smith said. "I think any player who
cares anything about the game of football understands who he was, what he stood
for and what he did for the game."
</P>
<P>
	   Payton died at age 45 on Nov. 1, exactly a week before the Cowboys played
the Vikings on a Monday night. The NFL announced that all stadiums that weekend
would have a moment of silence, and Smith began planning his own personal
tribute.
</P>
<P>
	   When it was time for the fans who usually fill the Metrodome with deafening
cheers to stand quietly, Smith played out in his mind a scene he'd been planning
for days.
</P>
<P>
	   "I draped his jersey, 34, on my back, gave him honor and said, 'Let me go
play now,"' Smith said. "It was just a moment, a moment that I wanted to lift
him up and say, 'Thank you, thank you for what you've done."'
</P>
<P>
	   Smith ran for 49 yards in the first quarter against the Vikings, but it only
led to two missed field goals. Two carries later, Payton's spirit took over.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith took a handoff at the Cowboys' 37, went off right guard and charged 63
yards down the sideline for a touchdown. He got past the final defender, Kenny
Wright, with a stiff-arm to the face.
</P>
<P>
	   The Vikings fumbled the kickoff and Dallas recovered at the Minnesota 24.
Smith got the ball again and he scored without being touched.
</P>
<P>
	   Then he went into the locker room for X-rays, and his night was over,
leaving him wondering whether he might've broken his career-best 237 yards, or
even Payton's NFL record of 275, which he set against the Vikings.
</P>
<P>
	   "God saw it fit that this hand be broken that particular day. And that's
that," Smith said. "If it was meant for me to be out there and do more than I
did, I probably would have never broken my hand."

<HEADLINE> Lawrence Taylor Drug Charge Dropped  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TEANECK, N.J. (AP) -- A municipal court judge agreed to drop a minor drug
charge against former New York Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor if he stays out
of trouble for six months.
</P>
<P>
	   Taylor, 40, of Saddle River, asked for and received the conditional
discharge in the case, stemming from discovery of drug paraphernalia in a room
rented under his name in a Teaneck hotel in September 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Taylor attended Wednesday's proceeding, but did not speak. He left hurriedly
afterward and refused to answer reporters' questions.
</P>
<P>
	   Teaneck police, acting on a tip, searched the hotel room and found crack
cocaine and a pipe. Taylor was not in the room. The Bergen County Prosecutor's
Office declined to pursue the drug possession charge and in May 1999 downgraded
the paraphernalia case to a disorderly person's offense.
</P>
<P>
	   Municipal Court Judge James E. Young Jr. accepted Taylor's request for a
conditional discharge.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was treated the same as someone who's never before been convicted of a
drug offense," said Taylor's lawyer, Mark A. Berman.
</P>
<P>
	   Taylor has no prior drug convictions, despite highly publicized drug arrests
in Florida and South Carolina. He is an admitted drug abuser who has undergone
extensive rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
	   On Nov. 30, Taylor pleaded no contest to purchasing crack cocaine from an
undercover police officer in St. Pete Beach, Fla. In that case, the judge said
she will likely hand down an 18-month probationary term when Taylor faces
sentencing on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   In May 1996, Taylor was arrested in South Carolina on charges he tried to
buy crack cocaine. But he cleared his record by performing 60 hours of community
service and agreeing to undergo drug counseling and random drug testing.
</P>
<P>
	   Taylor pleaded guilty in June 1997 to a federal tax fraud charge and is
awaiting sentencing in that case.
</P>
<P>
	   Considered the dominant defensive player of his time, Taylor played 13
seasons with the Giants, leading them to two Super Bowl wins. He was inducted
into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in August.

<HEADLINE> Colts' Berry Ready To Step In  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Third-year linebacker Bertrand Berry likely will start
for Indianapolis in place of the injured Cornelius Bennett in the Colts' first
playoff game Jan. 16.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a great opportunity for me. It's one that I've waited on my whole
career," said Berry, a third-round draft pick in 1997 out of Notre Dame. "To
start in a playoff game, that's what every guy who ever played football dreamed
about, from a little kid, up to an adult."
</P>
<P>
	   Until Sunday, Berry was mainly a special teams player for the AFC East
champions. He saw limited action on defense -- two solo tackles, three assisted
tackles and one sack -- until Bennett suffered a season-ending knee injury in
the 31-6 loss at Buffalo on the Bills' first play of the game.
</P>
<P>
	   The 6-foot-3, 250-pound Berry started 12 games at defensive end last year,
but moved to linebacker this season.
</P>
<P>
	   "He went into the game (Sunday) and did a pretty good job," coach Jim Mora
said. "Whoever it is, it is still going to be a loss, not having Cornelius."
</P>
<P>
	   The Colts (13-3) had Tuesday and Wednesday off, but planned to return to the
practice field today and Friday while waiting to learn whether they will meet
Seattle, Buffalo or Tennessee in the RCA Dome on Jan. 16.
</P>
<P>
	   Berry realizes the difficulty of stepping in to fill the hole left by
Bennett, who led the Colts with 114 tackles in his 13th NFL season.
</P>
<P>
	   "All I can say is I'm going to go out and make sure that the level of play
doesn't decrease because Cornelius isn't in there," Berry said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bennett, the Colts' oldest player at 34, also had been an inspirational
leader on the team. He was hoping to play in his sixth Super Bowl and earn the
winners' ring that eluded him in five previous appearances.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're going to miss his leadership, and his ability to make a lot of
plays," Berry said. "He's going to be in the Hall of Fame one of these days.
He's been playing great for us all season.
</P>
<P>
	   "At the same time, I'm a very capable linebacker and I can go in and make
plays. This is my opportunity to go in and show that."
</P>
<P>
	   Mora said he'll be watching Berry in practice this week and next before
deciding if he will start.
</P>
<P>
	   The Colts had their worst performance of the season Sunday as Buffalo
dominated offensively and defensively while ending the Colts' 11-game winning
streak.
</P>
<P>
	   "The score indicated how ugly it was. We watched the film and that pretty
much confirmed it," Berry said. "We just have to put this behind us and totally
get it out of our system. It's over with."
</P>
<P>
	   The Colts recorded the biggest single-season turnaround in league history
this season after finishing 3-13 in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Randy Moss's Game Is Maturing  </HEADLINE>
    By ARNIE STAPLETON AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- Randy Moss admittedly got bored with being a
superstar this season.
</P>
<P>
	   But he also became a better receiver in his second year with the Minnesota
Vikings, even though his touchdown catches dropped from 17 to 11.
</P>
<P>
	   Although he's still not a student of the game like teammate Cris Carter,
Moss added plenty to his repertoire.
</P>
<P>
	   "Now you have to cover me all over the field," said Moss, who caught 80
passes for an NFC-best 1,413 yards, a year after taking the league by storm.
</P>
<P>
	   Carter and Moss combined for 2,654 yards receiving this season, 41 yards shy
of the league record set by Mark Clayton and Mark Duper of the Miami Dolphins in
1984.
</P>
<P>
	   Carter had 90 catches for 1,241 yards and 13 touchdowns -- a typical year
for the perennial Pro Bowl receiver.
</P>
<P>
	   What makes Moss's stats more impressive is that his game no longer consists
of just going deep along the sideline like the best kid on the playground.
</P>
<P>
	   Moss lines up in the slot, runs crossing routes underneath, goes in motion.
He even throws touchdown passes off fake reverses.
</P>
<P>
	   "Randy is primarily a big-play receiver," said coach Dennis Green, who has
forgiven Moss transgressions such as dropped touchdown passes, simply because he
has the talent to make up for it on the next play.
</P>
<P>
	   Moss can still slip a cornerback like a cheap coat and scoot past the safety
for a quick-strike touchdown like last year, when he had a record-tying 10 TDs
for 40-plus yards.
</P>
<P>
	   "He can make a big play with a 5-yard catch and a 55-yard run or he can make
a big play with a 60-yard bomb," Green said.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, it seemed it was all bombs.
</P>
<P>
	   "Last year was basic," Moss said. "When I came to camp, they told me, 'Moss,
you learn and that's it.' This year, with me being able to read the coverages,
they give me a little more leisure to go out there and make plays in the slot,
across the middle."
</P>
<P>
	   That's part maturation and part necessity. Teams successfully double- and
triple-covered Moss early on, so he had to adapt.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's kind of hard to cover me that way if you're used to me going down the
sideline," Moss said. "Me catching slants, me catching hitches, stops, whatever.
Now, you've got to cover me all over the field ... and you don't know what I'm
going to do."
</P>
<P>
	   Moss still has work to do, however.
</P>
<P>
	   He was publicly chastised by team owner Red McCombs last month after
dropping several routine passes and walking away from a defender who had caught
an interception.
</P>
<P>
	   McCombs' criticisms were the first public gripes from the organization about
the moody Moss, who sulked on the sideline, nonchalantly cut off routes when the
plays weren't designed for him and dropped at least four potential touchdown
passes.
</P>
<P>
	   Moss responded by saying the boss had every right to say what he did and
admitted that he did get bored sometimes when he wasn't directly involved in the
action. He also replied by playing better.
</P>
<P>
	   A week later, Moss' five catches for 131 yards and two touchdowns lifted
Minnesota over Green Bay, 24-20. His five-catch, 155-yard performance Sunday
against Detroit included a 67-yard TD and helped the Vikings (10-6) earn a home
wild-card game against Dallas (8-8).
</P>
<P>
	   "I like big games, that's how I'm made," Moss said.

<HEADLINE> Titans' Gambling Defense Is Working  </HEADLINE>
    By TERESA M. WALKER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The Tennessee Titans have a simple philosophy on
defense: Attack the quarterback and get the football.
</P>
<P>
	   They did both as well as anybody in the NFL this season, coming up with 54
sacks and a league-high 24 fumbles. Only Jacksonville and St. Louis, with 57
each, got more sacks.
</P>
<P>
	   Linebacker Barron Wortham said the defense loves handing the ball back to
the offense.
</P>
<P>
	   "We know if we get them the ball again, they'll score again. That's
motivation," said Wortham, who has recovered three fumbles this season.
</P>
<P>
	   This from a defense that got only 19 turnovers in 1998. But the Titans
(13-3), who play host to Buffalo (11-5) on Saturday in an AFC wild-card game --
their first playoff game since 1993 -- had 16 interceptions. They are plus-18 in
turnover margin, which is the best of any team in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
	   It's the team's best turnover margin since 1979, when the former Oilers were
plus-18. They reached the AFC Championship game that season.
</P>
<P>
	   "Turnovers are key," Fisher said. "I think that's a major reason why we are
where we are right now because we've been able to get the ball back for the
offense."
</P>
<P>
	   The Titans ranked 17th overall on defense. Only Detroit (18), Minnesota
(27), Seattle (23) and Washington, which was better than only expansion
Cleveland, ranked worse among playoff teams.
</P>
<P>
	   "This defense will never be ranked high in statistics, but we'll be ranked
high in turnover ratio because this is a hit-or-miss defense," safety Blaine
Bishop said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We gamble. We take risks. We're either going to make a big play or we're
going to get a big play against us. That's how we live in this defense, and we
like it that way."
</P>
<P>
	   Fisher also pointed out that the Titans pressured the quarterback 125 times
during the season.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've made a lot of plays off pressures where we haven't gotten to the
quarterback," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense wasn't supposed to be a strength of the Titans this season. They
simply wanted to get better after getting only 30 sacks last season.
</P>
<P>
	   They hired Jim Washburn to coach the defensive line and signed veteran
tackles Mike Jones and Jason Fisk. The trio has provided much needed guidance
and motivation to a young line.
</P>
<P>
	   But the biggest improvement came from drafting Jevon Kearse.
</P>
<P>
	   He became the first rookie to lead a conference in sacks with 14 1/2, one
more than the entire Tennessee defensive line had in 1998. He also forced a
team-high 10 fumbles and was the first rookie end voted to the AFC Pro Bowl
team.
</P>
<P>
	   Bills veteran Bruce Smith has been impressed with Kearse.
</P>
<P>
	   "He has my vote for being defensive player of the year," Smith said
Wednesday. "I usually don't give my vote away very easily or quickly, but he
deserves it. He had one hell of a year."
</P>
<P>
	   The defense wants to make sure the season doesn't end with one game in the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're going to try to build on that momentum and keep it going," Wortham
said.

<HEADLINE> Deadline looms in land claim, parties want intensive talks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   VERONA, N.Y. (AP) - Oneida County leaders are hoping that a series of
"around-the-clock" meetings with the Oneida Indian Nation could spark a
breakthrough between the groups and thus avoid sending the two sides back to
court.
<P>
	   Court-appointed mediator Ron Riccio has scheduled the meetings for Jan.
24-26 and has said he would decide after that whether it is possible to reach an
out-of-court settlement in the 30-year-old land claim.
</P>
<P>
	   All parties involved in the talks need to commit to a "very intensive"
negotiation schedule, Oneida County Executive Ralph Eannace and Rocco
DiVeronica, chairman of the Madison County Board of Supervisors, said in a
written statement issued Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   County leaders said they would like to see talks resume sooner.
</P>
<P>
	   "The lack of a more aggressive schedule on the part of all parties would
mean taking this claim to court, which could take years, and lead to a great
deal more expense to all," DiVeronica said.
</P>
<P>
	   "But more importantly, it would mean increased tensions and instability to
Central New York, where relations and civility among formerly friendly neighbors
have already deteriorated dramatically," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, Oneida Nation Representative Ray Halbritter accused the counties
of jeopardizing negotiations by taking steps to foreclose on tax-delinquent
Oneida-owned land. The state and counties then accused Halbritter of ruining
negotiations by seeking the federal government's approval to serve liquor at the
Turning Stone casino.
</P>
<P>
	   The Oneidas have always been willing to negotiate aggressively, said Mark
Emery, a spokesman for the Oneida Indian Nation of New York, which is joined in
the claim by Oneida tribes from Wisconsin and Canada.
</P>
<P>
	   The Oneidas, with the support of the U.S. Justice Department, are seeking
the return of 250,000 acres of ancestral land in Oneida and Madison counties.
The U.S. Supreme Court found in 1985 that the land was seized in questionable
transactions with the state and private individuals and ruled the Oneidas were
entitled to compensation.
</P>
<P>
	   After 13 years of failed negotiations, Riccio entered the case in February
as a court-appointed settlement master. Talks have been held regularly.
</P>
<P>
	   The two sides have been unable to agree on three main issues: land
ownership, money and sovereign Indian jurisdiction. They have come together on
some minor issues such as hunting and fishing rights.
</P>
<P>
	   Arlinda Locklear, a lawyer for the Oneida Indian Nation of Wisconsin, was
not optimistic that a settlement could be reached.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're at a stage where we know what the possibilities are. I think it is
more of a question of whether each side is willing to make the compromises
needed for a settlement," Locklear said.
</P>
<P>
	   If Riccio declares an impasse, the case would return to U.S. District Judge
Neal McCurn. McCurn's first task would be to rule on the Oneida's outstanding
request to expand the case to sue the state and 20,000 landowners.

<HEADLINE> Ewing, Hastert Clash Over Primary  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Retiring Rep. Tom Ewing says Speaker Dennis Hastert has
betrayed their nearly two-decade-old friendship and alienated other members of
Congress by endorsing another Republican over Ewing's son in the race to succeed
him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It sends kind of cold chills down the backs of other members,'' Ewing,
R-Ill., said Wednesday. ``If he'll do it to a friend, what will he do to someone
else? I think he has confused his responsibility to his party with his desire to
keep himself in office.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hastert announced his support for Republican state Rep. Bill Brady at an
appearance Tuesday in Ewing's mostly rural eastern Illinois district. Three
other Republicans also are running, including Sam Ewing, whom his father's
supports as his replacement.
</P>
<P>
	   Ewing said his longtime confidant and fellow Illinois Republican broke an
earlier promise to stay out of the race. He also said Hastert was unwise to
exert his influence in a safely GOP district unlikely to fall out of Republican
hands. President Clinton barely won the district in 1996, but Ewing always won
re-election by wide margins.
</P>
<P>
	   ``To me, it's going to hurt the speaker,'' Ewing said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hastert spokesman John Feehery said the speaker was convinced Ewing's
retirement left the seat vulnerable to a Democratic takeover and felt it
necessary to act to protect House Republicans' narrow majority. Two Democrats
are competing for their party's nomination in the March primary.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's certainly not a given'' that Republicans will keep the seat, Feehery
said. ``With our slim majority, there really is no margin for error.''
</P>
<P>
	   Party leaders generally avoid openly taking positions in primary races, but
often support a candidate behind the scenes to ensure the strongest goes on to
the general election. For instance, even before Hastert's public endorsement, he
and his staff provided fund-raising help to Brady.

<HEADLINE> NTSB Probes Fatal Greyhound Case  </HEADLINE>
   By CLAUDE R. MARX Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lax safety procedures, a sleepy driver who was impaired
by an antihistamine and a policy that allowed trucks to park on the side of the
Pennsylvania Turnpike caused a June 1998 crash that killed seven people and
injured 18, federal investigators say.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Transportation Safety Board said Wednesday that Milton Wisner's
alertness was adversely impacted by an antihistamine and Greyhound Lines Inc.'s
scheduling of irregular work periods for its drivers. The board also said the
Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission's practice of allowing non-emergency parking in
pull-off areas contributed to the accident's severity.
</P>
<P>
	   Greyhound Executive Vice President Jack W. Haugsland disputed the findings
and said fatigue was ``not a major factor'' in causing the accident. He said
studies by the company's pathologists indicated Wisner had suffered a heart
attack, a claim the board specifically rejected.
</P>
<P>
	   Haugsland also said the company's scheduling was sound and that it had a
good safety record.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission would not comment on the board's
findings, said spokeswoman Kathy Liebler.
</P>
<P>
	   Wisner, 61, of Boothwyn, Pa., suffered from chronic fatigue syndrome and had
complained to his physician about it. He was taking an antihistamine to combat a
chronic sinus problem. In addition, NTSB records indicated that Wisner had been
involved in seven accidents since 1990 and had been cited for speeding twice.
One of those incidents resulted in a five-day suspension.
</P>
<P>
	   Wisner was on his last run before retiring on June 20, 1998, and driving in
a mountainous area, when his bus ran into a tractor-trailer legally parked in a
roadside area. The crash -- which occurred at 4:30 a.m. about 60 miles west of
Harrisburg -- pushed the truck into the back of another truck parked in front of
it.
</P>
<P>
	   Wisner, his wife and an 8-year-old boy in their care were killed along with
four other passengers. The truck's two co-drivers, who had been asleep in the
cab, also were injured.
</P>
<P>
	   The board criticized Greyhound's ``lax'' procedures in documenting safety
violations and monitoring the ``widespread speeding'' of its drivers. The board
said the company does not adequately respond to consumer concerns about safety,
noting it had taken no action when a woman complained about Wisner's driving
habits.
</P>
<P>
	   The NTSB recommended that Greyhound revise its scheduling process, improve
its record keeping, and insure that complaints made on its 800 phone line are
acted on and placed in drivers' files.
</P>
<P>
	   The board also suggested that the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission prohibit
non-emergency parking in pull-off areas adjacent to the highway, provide
adequate rest areas for non-emergency parking and conduct more drills to improve
handling of large-scale disasters.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Syria Get Down to Business  </HEADLINE>
   By DONNA ABU-NASR Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- President Clinton is ready to plunge back into
difficult peacemaking between Israel and Syria as the two longtime foes engage
in intensive negotiations on a number of thorny issues.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, who was here for the first two days of the talks this week, stayed
away Wednesday. A senior U.S. official said in Washington that the president
probably would return, but would not make a decision until today.
</P>
<P>
	   State Department spokesman James Rubin said Wednesday: ``I think he will be
coming back Thursday.'' He added: ``We see President Clinton's presence as
always useful but we don't want to overdo it.''
</P>
<P>
	   The task now, Rubin noted, is ``how we get from chugging along to a fast
track. ... Our expectations are still neither great nor bleak.''
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, the two delegations began discussions for the first time in
almost four years on issues of substance.
</P>
<P>
	   A committee dealing with mutual security concerns met all day, focusing on
the establishment of a demilitarized zone and an early warning system, Rubin
said. Another team of negotiators took up in some detail the issue of
normalizing relations, he added.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin gave no indication, however, that agreements were reached on any of
the tough issues that stand in the way of this fledgling pursuit of peace.
</P>
<P>
	   Gen. Shlomo Yamai of Israel and Gen. Ibrahim Omar of Syria headed their
governments' delegations in the security talks, while Zvi Shtauber and Walid
Muallem were the Israeli and Syrian delegation leaders, respectively, in the
negotiations on peaceful relations.
</P>
<P>
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, along with her military aide, Army
Lt. Gen. Donald Kerrick, joined the security committee sessions, and Assistant
Secretary of State Martin Indyk engaged in the peace terms discussion.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright met over lunch with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and later
held talks with Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa. She also held talks
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy.
</P>
<P>
	   The delegates worked in the seclusion of a U.S. government retreat just
outside this 239-year-old town, the oldest in West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
	   If the negotiations succeed -- and no one is making any such claim at this
preliminary stage -- Israel would surrender the Golan Heights security buffer
zone along the border, and Syria would establish diplomatic relations with its
longtime adversary.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak has signaled his willingness to make territorial concessions, but is
holding back until Syrian President Hafez Assad authorizes his delegation to
outline what kind of diplomatic, economic and political relationship he would
extend in return.

<HEADLINE> Rich Defendants Guilty in Manila  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM GOMEZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- A court sentenced a group of young men from rich
families to life imprisonment Thursday for the murders of a family of three in a
widely publicized case that helped prompt lawmakers to re-impose the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds of police stood guard at the courtroom as the 5-hour-long decision
was broadcast live over six television networks to millions of crime-weary
Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
	   The eight suspects, two of whom are still at large, were found guilty of
stabbing to death Estrellita Vizconde and her two daughters, Carmela, 18 and
Jennifer, 7, in their house in Paranaque city, a Manila suburb, on June 29,
1991. Carmela was raped repeatedly before being stabbed 17 times, court records
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The defendants include Hubert Webb, the son of a former senator and brother
of a TV newscaster. Webb claimed he was in the United States at the time of the
killings.
</P>
<P>
	   At one point during the reading of the decision, Estrellita's husband,
Lauro, cried as the wounds of the victims were described. He was living in the
United States at the time of the murders and has since become an anti-crime
crusader.
</P>
<P>
	   The case has been one of the most closely followed in the Philippines.
Newspapers and TV stations regularly reported developments during the years of
the trial, and many Filipinos believed the defendants' wealthy families
attempted to subvert justice.
</P>
<P>
	   A policeman who allegedly was close to the Webb family was implicated as an
accomplice in the case for ordering the burning of bloodied bedsheets and other
evidence shortly after the killings.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors relied mainly on the testimony of a woman, Jessica Alfaro, who
said she was with the eight men when they committed the killings while high on
drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense lawyers, however, said Alfaro's testimony was not credible because
she was a former drug user.
</P>
<P>
	   They accused Judge Amelita Tolentino of bias and said they would appeal to
the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
	   The killing of the Vizcondes was one of several sensational crimes cited by
Filipino legislators when they decided to restore capital punishment in the
country in 1994.
</P>
<P>
	   The new law does not apply retroactively to the Vizconde case, and the
defendants were subject to a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Close Lower  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo share prices fell Thursday on hefty selling of
high-technology issues despite Wall Street's overnight rebound. The dollar was
higher against the yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average ended the day down 374.28
points, or 2.02 percent, at 18,168.27. On Wednesday, the key average plunged
460.31 points, or 2.42 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar bought 104.38 yen at 3 p.m. (1 a.m. EST), up 1.20 yen from 103.18
yen posted late Wednesday in Tokyo and above 104.35 yen overnight in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stock market, traders taking profits sold high-tech issues which had
posted significant gains over the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   "The market is under a correction phase after rallies late last year in high
technology and information shares," said Hidenori Karaki, general manager at
Tokyo-Mitsubishi Personal Securities.
</P>
<P>
	   "But the market's fundamentals are not bad," he said, citing steady buying
interest from foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
	   In a market dominated by sell orders, pharmaceutical issues rose as
investors shifted away from high-tech into domestic demand-related issues.
</P>
<P>
	   "Until price fluctuations of information technology shares stabilize,
investors will shift to biotechnology-related issues," said Kunihiro Hatae,
general manager at Tokyo Securities.
</P>
<P>
	   Overnight on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 124.72
points, or 1.1 percent, to 11,122.65. The Dow had risen as much as 216 points in
earlier trading. It plunged 359.58 points on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The technology-laden Nasdaq Composite Index ended a highly volatile session
Wednesday with a loss of 24.09 points, or 0.6 percent, at 3,877.60. On Tuesday,
it suffered its worst point loss, declining 229.46 points.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section shed 42.25 points, or 2.56 percent, to 1609.59. The TOPIX closed down
65.63 points, or 3.82 percent Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency trading, the dollar climbed higher after overseas investors sold
yen for dollars to cash in on Japanese stocks and other yen-denominated assets.
</P>
<P>
	   Japanese life insurers and investment trust funds also bought the dollar,
traders said. The same players bought the euro for yen as well.
</P>
<P>
	   The euro was traded at 108.28 yen, up from 107.24 yen late in Tokyo on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar began gaining earlier this week after the Bank of Japan bought
the currency to stem the yen's rise.
</P>
<P>
	   Japan's vice finance minister, Haruhiko Kuroda, told reporters Thursday that
the yen was still too strong.
</P>
<P>
	   "In terms of fundamentals, it is still clearly excessive," Kuroda said.
</P>
<P>
	   Too strong a yen hurts the income of export-based industries, which
repatriate profits earned overseas in dollars back to Japan.
</P>
<P>
	   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond was at 1.7000,
up from 1.6950 Wednesday. Its price stood at 101.70, down 0.04 point from
101.74.

	   "The Hurricane," however is not so much about Carter, the boxer, as about
inmate No. 45472, who served 19 years in prison in New Jersey after being
wrongfully convicted in 1967 of three murders.
</P>
<P>
	   Carter's New York appearance on Wednesday was really an event staged for
television. When a couple of print media guys talked to Carter after the cameras
were shut off, some Hollywood-type flacks stopped the "interview" quicker than a
faint-hearted referee prematurely halts a fight.
</P>
<P>
	   Carter posed for television and still cameras with 26-year-old John Molnar,
introduced as a welterweight prospect, and said when asked if he was still
interested in boxing, "Oh yea. I'm on my way to Philadelphia to see some
fighters."
</P>
<P>
	   However, in the interview, which lasted about three minutes (one full
round), he said "I'm not interested in boxing, I'm interested in saving lives."
</P>
<P>
	   Carter is associated with the Defense of the Wrongfully Convicted that helps
people correct legal wrongs.
</P>
<P>
	   While Carter said he has no interest in attending fights or watching them on
television, he also said, "Boxing is the sweetest sport in the whole world --
two human beings going fist-to-fist."
</P>
<P>
	   As for "The Hurricane." Carter said, "I think the movie depicts the 63 years
of my life (he'll turn 63 on May 6) accurately."
</P>
<P>
	   The film follows Carter's 1974 book, "The Sixteenth Round," written while he
was in prison. It shows a man who grew up tough, spent time in a reformatory and
gained a following as a glaring, power-punching middleweight who made an
unsuccessful title bid against Joey Giardello on Dec. 14, 1964.
</P>
<P>
	   In the movie, a television broadcaster says while waiting for the decision
to be announced that everyone knows that Carter has won. In the "The Sixteenth
Round," Carter wrote he lost a split decision. Actually, the decision was
unanimous for Giardello.
</P>
<P>
	   Oh well, fighters often see fight different than the judges, and where would
movie makers be without a little poetic justice?
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, Carter recalled a flawed strategy of boxing with the idea of
going the full 15 rounds against Giardello, a master boxer.
</P>
<P>
	   "Any other time, I was in there to get you out of there," Carter said.
</P>
<P>
	   One of those wins, which Carter considers the highlight of his career, came
in on Dec. 20, 1963, against welterweight champion Emile Griffith, who had just
been named Fighter of the Year. Carter angered Griffith at a prefight news
conference, and Griffith was determined to slug it out. Carter knocked him down
twice and stopped him in the first round.
</P>
<P>
	   Carter's boxing record was only a fair 27-12-1, with 19 knockouts, not the
kind of career that would warrant a movie. But, as has been said, "The
Hurricane" is a film about a man whose fierce pride -- he refused to wear prison
clothes -- helped enable him to win his freedom and who now is fighting for
others who claim to be unjustly imprisoned.

<HEADLINE> Some Jenny Craigs Refuse Lewinsky  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   APPLETON, Wis. (AP) -- Some Jenny Craig franchises have decided to run old
advertisements rather than use the company's new campaign featuring Monica
Lewinsky as a spokeswoman for the weight-loss program.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Lewinsky, 26, is featured in television commercials that began airing
Sunday. The ads show her slimmed-down figure and a ``before'' picture of her
looking heavier.
</P>
<P>
	   The former White House intern was at the center of President Clinton's
impeachment scandal. Clinton later admitted to a sexual relationship with her.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of her role in the scandal, David Lahey, owner of Jenny Craig
locations in Green Bay, Grand Chute and Des Moines, Iowa, said he will not use
the ads.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I wouldn't be pleased if my daughter came home and said, 'I want to be
just like Monica Lewinsky,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lahey said he plans to stick with an old ad campaign rather than pay for TV
commercials of Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
	   Jenny Craig spokesman Brian Luscomb said Wednesday that other U.S.
franchises also have decided against airing the ads, but he declined to say
where or how many. Fifteen percent of Jenny Craig franchises are privately
owned.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's quite common for franchises to use different ads or create their
own,'' Luscomb said from company headquarters in La Jolla, Calif.
</P>
<P>
	   The overall response to the new ads has been favorable, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Jenny Craig Inc. said it considers Ms. Lewinsky a good role model for weight
loss because she has been successful on the program. She claims to have lost 31
pounds since starting the program last summer.
</P>
<P>
	   But Lois Brown, a customer at the Grand Chute center and a public school
teacher, said she would quit Jenny Craig if Ms. Lewinsky continues to be a
spokeswoman for the company, ``even though I love the program and it's worked
very well for me.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``She's a woman that has not done a great deal as a positive role model for
young women in the United States,'' Ms. Brown said. ``I think she's damaged the
institution of marriage, and I think she's made a mockery of our presidency.''

<HEADLINE> Voters Uncertain as Primaries Near  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The presidential campaigns are heating up, candidates are
debating day after day and the news media is delivering it all to the public.
But who's paying attention?
</P>
<P>
	   Only one in 10 say in a new poll that they had thought about the
presidential campaign or talked about it with anyone on the previous day. And
nearly three-fourths of the public say they hadn't yet picked a candidate, says
the poll on voter interest taken by the Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press
Politics and Public Policy. That's compared with roughly two-thirds in November.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is a depressing fact that the American people seem to be less
interested in the campaign, less impressed by the candidates than they have been
in a long time,'' Marvin Kalb, executive director of the center's Washington
office, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Vanishing Voter Project plans to interview at least 1,000 Americans
weekly through the November election -- more than 50,000 voters in all -- to see
what makes them tick.
</P>
<P>
	   The increase in the number of undecided potential voters less than three
weeks before Iowa's Jan. 24 presidential caucuses surprised the researchers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We had expected the opposite finding,'' said Harvard professor Thomas
Patterson, co-director of the project. ``Apparently, the upswing in the Bradley
and McCain campaigns has served mainly to raise doubts about all the
candidates.''
</P>
<P>
	   When people were asked which candidate they supported, but given the option
of saying they hadn't picked one yet, 74 percent said they didn't support
anyone. In November, 64 percent said they hadn't made a choice.
</P>
<P>
	   Texas Gov. George W. Bush was the choice of 13 percent, Vice President Al
Gore of 6 percent, Arizona Sen. John McCain of 3 percent and former Sen. Bill
Bradley of 2 percent. Other candidates were at 1 percent or less.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think that it's something inherent in the political system,'' said Kalb.
``Part of the explanation may be the rise of Bradley and McCain -- but the
larger explanation is that there is an unusually large disconnect between the
potential voter and the campaign ... deep down, we don't know.''
</P>
<P>
	   When people were asked whether they'd talked about the campaign or thought
about it in the past day, nine out of 10 people said they had not.
</P>
<P>
	   The poll of 1,012 people was taken Dec. 28 through Jan. 2 and has an error
margin of plus or minus 3 percentage points, larger for subgroups.
</P>
<P>
	   The poll is part of a broader project that looks at the campaigns, media
coverage and public interest in the process.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The whole project was born of a concern that fewer Americans are voting at
a time we should be more proud of the system in which we live than just about
any other time,'' Kalb said. ``This is the surviving superpower, the country is
at peace. ...
</P>
<P>
	   ``Why aren't people cheering these developments?''

    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Calling each other nicknames like "Cowboy," "Shorty,"
and "Moose," Major League Baseball umpires thought they had solidarity when they
agreed to resign their jobs to protest their wages, an umpire says.
<P>
	   But Larry Poncino, a National League umpire, told a National Labor Relations
Board hearing officer Wednesday that he discovered instead that he was out of a
job and a renegade group of umpires had formed a new union.
</P>
<P>
	   Confronted with his own resignation letter, Poncino said he signed it
because he thought all umpires were signing similar letters. Instead, a majority
of American League umps either didn't resign or quickly withdrew their
resignations.
</P>
<P>
	   The collapsed effort ruined the strategy of the Major League Umpires
Association, led by Richie Phillips.
</P>
<P>
	   "We were an Erector Set going in and we came out a bunch of Tinker Toys,"
Poncino said.
</P>
<P>
	   Phillips' union is trying to convince the hearing officer to overturn the
election it lost 57-35 to the insurgents in November.
</P>
<P>
	   Phillips claimed Wednesday that baseball commissioner Bud Selig and other
top leaders of the sport encouraged a group of insurgent umpires to form a new
union.
</P>
<P>
	   Citing telephone records of calls between Selig's office and insurgent
leader John Hirschbeck, Phillips said the owners illegally conspired with the
anti-Phillips faction.
</P>
<P>
	   The hearing officer, David L. Leach III, refused to let Phillips question
baseball lawyer Frank Coonelly or an organizer of the insurgent Major League
Umpires Independent Organizing Committee about conversations between the two.
</P>
<P>
	   Phillips said the questioning was crucial to support testimony earlier in
the day by Drew Coble, among the 22 umps who lost their jobs in September. Coble
said he was told Selig had promised he could have his job back if he dropped his
support for Phillips.
</P>
<P>
	   Phillips, who has led the umpires since 1978, said the insurgents "were used
by Bud Selig and baseball as a vehicle to break the union and to send a message
to others in baseball."
</P>
<P>
	   Phillips cited telephone records showing six telephone calls on July 22
between Selig's Milwaukee office and Hirschbeck's home, "all at the critical
time these people (umpires) allegedly were being replaced."
</P>
<P>
	   Phillips said there was a meeting that day in Selig's office of the nine top
executives in baseball, including both league presidents. He claimed they talked
about how to break the union.
</P>
<P>
	   "What happened to the 22 was done to bust the Umpires Association," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Poncino testified that he was told by Hirschbeck's brother, Mark, that the
insurgents could have a labor contract within 72 hours if Phillips was ousted or
his union dismantled.
</P>
<P>
	   Poncino said Mark Hirschbeck, an NL ump, said in late September that with
Phillips out of the picture, the umpires could get improved severance benefits
and larger work crews, among other contract improvements.
</P>
<P>
	   Poncino said he asked Mark Hirschbeck how he learned about the possible
contract improvements and Hirschbeck wouldn't say.
</P>
<P>
	   Poncino later asked him if he would repeat the allegations at an arbitration
hearing in Philadelphia. The MLUA filed a grievance attempting to regain the
jobs of the 22.
</P>
<P>
	   "He told me he would have to deny that the conversation ever existed,"
Poncino said.
</P>
<P>
	   The MLUA rested its case, and the insurgents planned to call one or two
witnesses Thursday. Owners said they weren't sure whether they would call any
witnesses.

<HEADLINE> A New Hampshire Electoral Sampler  </HEADLINE>
   By TED ANTHONY AP National Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- When Bill Bradley got snippy, they snickered. When Al
Gore invoked Harry Truman, they grinned the grins of those who'd heard the quote
the first time around. And when it came to the issues, they were ready with the
perspective and wisdom that only age can bring.
</P>
<P>
	   They huddled around Lois Brown's TV set and listened -- nine American
voters, seven centuries of life experience among them, processing the ideas and
proposals and mannerisms of two men who would be president.
</P>
<P>
	   For the group of retirees who watched Bradley and Gore go at it Wednesday
night, two things seemed evident: Neither candidate, they concurred, trounced
the other. And, despite both men's faults and striking similarities, both
probably would do a capable job of leading the country.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I found it very difficult to differentiate,'' said Lloyd Heidgerd, 81, a
Democrat and retired science librarian. ``Either could be president, and I
wouldn't be upset.''
</P>
<P>
	   Deep conviction resonated among this group of mostly Democrats, some of them
married couples. Mrs. Brown, 81, declared Gore ``has earned the presidency.''
Robert Back, who turned 77 today, proclaimed Bradley ``comfortable -- like an
old dog.'' And Norm Wilson, a GOP-leaning independent, questioned the vice
president's commitment to candor.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Gore is willing to accept a lot of credit for things he had nothing to do
with,'' groused Wilson, 80, a retired engineer.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Aw, c'mon -- he invented the Internet,'' Back quipped, referring to Gore's
onetime claim.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley is challenging Gore for the Democratic presidential nomination, and
is even or ahead in polling leading up to the New Hampshire primary, the
nation's first. It is set for Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   In the minutes after the debate ended, Mrs. Brown's living room was an
exhilarating place to be. Spirited back-and-forths unfolded. Enthusiastic
splinter conversations erupted. These clearly were folks who, regardless of
their politics or history, pride themselves on being involved in the process.
They scorn those who aren't.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Brown, a widow and retired municipal official who has voted Democratic
all but once in her life and grew to adulthood during the Depression, suggested
the problem with an indifferent electorate might be protracted prosperity.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The trouble is, times have been too good,'' she said. ``People have to
wake up.''
</P>
<P>
	   But how were the candidates? The answers came fast.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Gore was more relaxed than usual,'' said Muriel Back, 77, a retired
librarian.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Gore's answers were more canned,'' countered John Ray, 80, a retired
engineer. ``He comes across as more presidential, but I don't necessarily think
he'd make a better president.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Bradley's more free of the establishment, so he has more chance to be a
real leader,'' said Nan Bliss, 79, a retired arts-and-crafts shop manager.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He seems to be more flexible in his thoughts and expressions,'' said June
Wilson, 76, a retired teacher.
</P>
<P>
	   Health care concerns many of these folks. They live in Heritage Heights, a
retirement community just east of downtown Concord, where Gore plans a visit
Jan. 14. And though they all are independent and mobile, they know many who
aren't. They're aware of the stakes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They're not really saying how their health plans would be financed. They
don't go into enough detail,'' complained Tay Ray, 79, a retired school
librarian.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Either one of them could help a lot of people in this country by modifying
the tax rules on Social Security and prescriptions,'' Wilson said. ``We're
taking a belt in the teeth.''
</P>
<P>
	   Then there is that final intangible: image. The character issue is the bane
and triumph of modern presidential politics. And despite the massive changes
that television has wrought, the image thing predates even the tube.
</P>
<P>
	   Take it from those who were there and are still around, still trying to
figure out the world and make the right choices to elevate the right leaders.
It's complicated, they agreed, even after doing it for so long.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's still a cult of personality. It's not new,'' said Back, born when
Warren Harding was president. ``The presidents we think of are personality boys.
Roosevelt was. Johnson was. I think we're still looking for them.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``FDR,'' mused Norm Wilson, a Woodrow Wilson baby.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Now there was a man,'' said Back.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Now there,'' added Wilson, ``was a leader.''

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong shares fall hard  </HEADLINE>
    By DIRK BEVERIDGE AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HONG KONG (AP) -- Adding to the red ink from Asia's massive stock slide,
Hong Kong blue chips tumbled 5.6 percent by late Thursday afternoon and Tokyo
prices finished down as traders shrugged off Wall Street's calmer performance
and dumped high-tech shares.
</P>
<P>
	   Most Asian stocks were lower in the wake of Wednesday's selloff that hit
some markets so hard it brought back memories of the way prices had plunged more
than two years ago as the financial crisis spread through the region.
</P>
<P>
	   In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index fell sharply from the outset, extending
Wednesday's ominous 7.2 percent dive that was its worst one-day drop since late
October 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   With less than an hour left to trade, the Hang Seng was down 887.04 points,
or 5.6 percent, to 14,959.68. Jittery investors gathered around stock quotation
machines in local banks to survey the damage to a market that had rung in the
new year on Monday with a record finish.
</P>
<P>
	   Hong Kong traders bet wrongly early in the morning that prices would recover
in line with the rebound overnight Wednesday by the New York's Dow Jones
industrial average, which rose 1.1 percent after a 3.2 percent drop on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors pushed futures contracts higher before the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange opened -- only to see share prices fall fast from the start.
</P>
<P>
	   On Asia's top market, the Tokyo Stock Exchange, blue chips shed 2 percent as
investors bailed out of high-tech companies that have taken a beating globally.
</P>
<P>
	   A 5.6 percent drop in the U.S. Nasdaq Composite Index on Tuesday sparked the
selloffs, and although the Nasdaq held its losses Wednesday to just 0.6 percent,
traders figured many high-tech companies were still too expensive.
</P>
<P>
	   Tokyo's Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues closed 374.28 points
lower to 18,168.27.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of the big decliners in Tokyo included high-tech concerns Sony and
Softbank.
</P>
<P>
	   "Unless Nasdaq and Internet shares stabilize, we'll see some more
corrections in Japan," said David Shirt, a stock salesman at investment house
Jardine Fleming in Tokyo.

<HEADLINE> Health Plan Debated in N.H.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore bent Bill Bradley's health care plan out of shape.
Bradley muddled the history of welfare reform. And a near-classic piece of
misrepresentation from another time came back to tweak Republicans again.
</P>
<P>
	   The Democratic presidential rivals did not go as far off course in their
latest debate as they did in earlier matchups.
</P>
<P>
	   But here and there, truth was a casualty and complex ideas were boiled down
into barely recognizable form.
</P>
<P>
	   As usual, the main point of contention Wednesday night was Bradley's
signature health care plan and especially his proposal to end Medicaid and use
subsidies to make health insurance accessible to nearly everyone.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore left viewers of the New Hampshire debate with the impression that the
subsidy would be capped at a measly $150 a month, while Bradley says the figures
in play are weighted averages, not caps.
</P>
<P>
	   But beyond that, $150 a month is Bradley's figure for individuals -- the
average subsidy for a family of four would be more than $400 a month.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All of the people who would be affected in New Hampshire would be left
out,'' Gore stated. Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a specialist in the veracity of
campaign rhetoric and ads, said the claim was wrong.
</P>
<P>
	   While it is reasonable at least to argue that people now on Medicaid may not
make out as well under Bradley's proposals, his plan would reach poor people who
currently are not covered by Medicaid, she said. ``Those people will get a net
advantage in any event.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore tried to put Bradley on the defensive for opposing the 1996 welfare
changes that are generally considered a success. In the course of fighting back,
Bradley did not get legislative history quite right.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley suggested the welfare restrictions he voted against were harsher
than those that exist now. But while some immigrant benefits have been restored,
the major provisions of the welfare legislation, such as time limits, work
requirements and an end to the federal guarantee of benefits, remain unchanged.
</P>
<P>
	   As well, he said ``this bill came in October of 1996. October of 1996 -- who
knew if Bill Clinton was going to win? Maybe it would have been Bob Dole. If it
had been Bob Dole, there would have been a long time before there were any
changes made in that welfare reform bill.''
</P>
<P>
	   But the welfare overhaul became law in August 1996. Moreover, Clinton's
defeat of the Republican Dole in the 1996 election was widely expected by
October, if not earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was a strange explanation,'' said Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg
School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania. ``There was not a
point in which Clinton was not leading Dole in the polls.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore took credit in the debate for helping to pass what he called the most
significant gun-control legislation in a generation, with his tie-breaking vote
in the Senate on a bill to require instant background checks at gun shows. He
neglected to mention the bill did not become law.
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president also revived what Jamieson called ``that standard old
deception'' from the 1996 campaign when he said, ``You know, when Newt Gingrich
took over the Congress, he proposed slashing Medicare, making terrible changes
in a lot of the programs that help the American people.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``That was the most often repeated deceptive statement from Democratic
ads,'' Jamieson said. The Republican congressional majority, when Gingrich was
House speaker, did not propose a net cut but rather a slowing in the rate of
growth, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats at one point also proposed cutting the rate of growth of Medicare,
but more modestly.
</P>
<P>
	   Jamieson also was baffled by Bradley's comment, when asked about taking
campaign money from the pharmaceutical industry as a senator, that he never did
anything against the interests of his constituents or his country.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Shares Fall Hard  </HEADLINE>
    By DIRK BEVERIDGE AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HONG KONG (AP) -- Hong Kong blue chips tumbled 5.6 percent by late this
afternoon and Tokyo prices finished down as traders shrugged off Wall Street's
calmer performance and dumped high-tech shares, adding to the red ink from
Asia's massive stock slide a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Most Asian stocks were lower in the wake of Wednesday's selloff that hit
some markets so hard it brought back memories of the plunge more than two years
ago when the financial crisis spread through the region.
</P>
<P>
	   In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index fell sharply from the outset, extending
Wednesday's ominous 7.2 percent dive that was its worst one-day drop since late
October 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   With less than an hour left to trade, the Hang Seng was down 887.04 points,
or 5.6 percent, at 14,959.68. Jittery investors gathered around stock quotation
machines in local banks to survey the damage to a market that had rung in the
New Year on Monday with a record finish.
</P>
<P>
	   Hong Kong traders bet wrongly early in the morning that prices would recover
in line with the rebound overnight Wednesday by the New York's Dow Jones
industrial average, which rose 1.1 percent after a 3.2 percent drop on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors pushed futures contracts higher before the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange opened -- only to see share prices fall fast from the start.
</P>
<P>
	   On Asia's top market, the Tokyo Stock Exchange, blue chips shed 2 percent as
investors bailed out of high-tech companies that have taken a beating globally.
</P>
<P>
	   A 5.6 percent drop in the U.S. Nasdaq Composite Index on Tuesday sparked the
selloffs, and although the Nasdaq held its losses Wednesday to just 0.6 percent,
traders figured many high-tech companies were still too expensive.
</P>
<P>
	   Tokyo's Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues closed 374.28 points
lower at 18,168.27.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of the big decliners in Tokyo included high-tech concerns Sony and
Softbank.
</P>
<P>
	   "Unless Nasdaq and Internet shares stabilize, we'll see some more
corrections in Japan," said David Shirt, a stock salesman at Jardine Fleming in
Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   South Korean prices swung wildly, with an early gain of 2.9 percent
evaporating as blue chips flip-flopped to finish with a loss of 2.6 percent on
concerns of higher U.S. interest rates.
</P>
<P>
	   Prices in Singapore, Australia, Malaysia and Thailand gave up initial gains
and turned lower, while markets rebounded in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
	   Prices closed marginally higher in the Philippines. New Zealand prices
closed today with a loss of 1.3 percent, with traders saying New York's better
performance failed to improve sentiment.
</P>
<P>
	   Taiwanese blue chips continued to buck the trend, finishing with a gain of
0.8 percent today -- on top of a 1.1 percent gain that made the Taipei market
the region's only winner Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Hong Kong market has been by far the hardest hit, leaving experts
sharply divided today in estimates of what might come next.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. investment bank Morgan Stanley Dean Witter predicted the Hang Seng
could fall another 30 percent to 12,000 points by the end of the year, while
rival Goldman Sachs forecast a record rally to 19,000.

Israel, Syria Get Down to Business
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- President Clinton is ready to plunge back into
difficult peacemaking between Israel and Syria as the two longtime foes engage
in intensive negotiations on a number of thorny issues. On Wednesday, the two
delegations began discussions for the first time in almost four years on issues
of substance. A committee dealing with mutual security concerns met all day,
focusing on the establishment of a demilitarized zone and an early warning
system, State Department spokesman James Rubin said. Clinton, who was here for
the first two days of the talks this week, stayed away Wednesday, but a senior
U.S. official said that the president probably would return Thursday.

bunker," and the vice president accused his rival of leaving New Hampshire
residents "high and dry" on health care. Bradley was more aggressive than usual
Wednesday night, forcing Gore to defend himself on a string of issues related to
President Clinton. Gore, armed with notecards and notepads, initially appeared
uncomfortable but warmed to the task of challenging Bradley's health care plan.

Freed Militant Arrives in Pakistan

	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) -- One of three Kashmiri militants freed as part of a
deal to end the Indian Airlines hijacking called on his followers Wednesday to
destroy India and the United States. Maulana Masood Azhar told 10,000 supporters
"I have come here because this is my duty to tell you that Muslims should not
rest in peace until we have destroyed America and India," Azhar said. Though the
Pakistani government earlier said that the hijackers would be arrested if they
stepped foot in their country, there was no effort to detain Azhar or to bar him
from speaking Wednesday.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The presidential campaigns are heating up, candidates are

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The television networks are so badly slanting the gun

issue. The Media Research Center, chaired by Brent Bozell, released a study
Wednesday on two years of television news stories on gun control. The study
analyzed the morning shows and evening newscasts between July 1, 1997 and June
30, 1999. In many cases, the study claimed, pro-gun themes were not covered and
gun proponents were not given air time.

<HEADLINE> Police investigating second suspect, even as murder trial underway  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   DANIELSON, Conn. (AP) - While prosecutors were trying Ryan Thompson on a
murder charge, police were investigating whether another teen-ager may have
pulled the trigger in the fatal shooting of Robert McCaffrey.
<P>
	   Thompson, now 20, is accused of shooting McCaffery outside an April, 1998
party in the Moosup section of Plainfield.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors say Thompson was not invited to the party and became involved in
a fight with several guests before the shooting occurred. McCaffery was shot
while sitting on the roof of a garage watching the altercation, authorities say.
</P>
<P>
	   In testimony at Thomspson's trial Wednesday, State Police Major Crime Squad
Sgt. John Turner acknowledged that within the past week, a detective was
investigating the theory that Thompson's friend David Stebbins fired the fatal
shot.
</P>
<P>
	   Stebbins, Thompson and several other teens were in a car together just
before the fatal shot was fired.
</P>
<P>
	   When questioned by defense attorney Arthur Meisler, Turner said detective
David LeBlanc came upon information that Stebbins was the shooter. He did not
elaborate, but said LeBlanc did interview a witness.
</P>
<P>
	   Police confiscated a rifle from Stebbins' home, but it has not been proven
that the rifle was used in the shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   An earlier witness said Stebbins' was upset about being picked on at the
party and he told her he had guns in the car and would use them if he had to,
according to court testimony.
</P>
<P>
	   But other evidence points to Thompson.
</P>
<P>
	   Two teen-agers told police Thompson jumped out of the car with a gun and
came back saying he thought he shot someone. Other witnesses also reported
seeing Thompson run to the car after the shot was fired.
</P>
<P>
	   The trial was to continue today.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan To Attack World Government  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURHAM, N.H. (AP) -- Pat Buchanan, seeking support for his fledgling Reform
Party presidential bid, is promising to lead a ``millennial struggle'' against
an emerging world government ``where all nations yield up their sovereignty and
fade away.''
</P>
<P>
	   In a draft of a speech was delivering to the Boston World Affairs Council
today, the former Republican said, ``Loyalty to the New World Order is
disloyalty to the Republic. In nation after nation, the struggle between
patriotism and globalism is underway.''
</P>
<P>
	   Buchanan, in his third run for the presidency, said the Clinton
administration is allowing the United Nations to intrude on America's
sovereignty. At the same time, he said, the United States is guilty of
``trampling on the sovereignty'' of other nations by injecting troops in
internal conflicts, such as Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If ever sovereignty becomes obsolete, we may expect America's involvement
in endless wars until, one day, we pay a horrific price in some act of
cataclysmic terror on our own soil,'' Buchanan said. ``For interventionism is
the spawning pool of international terror.''
</P>
<P>
	   Buchanan left the GOP last year to seek the Reform Party nomination after
his initial 2000 presidential bid as a Republican stalled. He blamed the
Republican establishment for his failure, saying party leaders were lining up
behind the front-runner, Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   New York tycoon Donald Trump also is seeking the Reform nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Buchanan named politicians, journalists and Clinton administration officials
who appear to embrace globalism over nationalism -- proponents of the so-called
``New World Order,'' a phrase Buchanan attributed to Bush's father, former
President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   Buchanan's examples included President Clinton calling himself a ``citizen
of the world,'' Vice President Al Gore -- a candidate for the Democratic
presidential nomination -- agreeing to a global environmental pact. The United
Nations is increasingly seeking authority over U.S. troops and control of the
nation's borders, Buchanan warned..
</P>
<P>
	   ``This then is a millennial struggle that succeeds the Cold War: It is the
struggle of patriots of every nation against a world government where all
nations yield up their sovereignty and fade away,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My vision is of a republic, not an empire -- a nation that does not go to
war unless she is attacked, or her vital interests are imperiled, or her honor
impugned. And when she does go to war, it is only after following a
constitutional declaration by the Congress,'' Buchanan said. ``We are not
imperialists; we are not interventionists; we are not hegemonists; and we are
not isolationists. We simply believe in America first, last and always.''

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Seeks More Emergency Rule  </HEADLINE>
   By DILIP GANGULY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- The government asked Parliament today to extend
emergency rule, accusing Tamil Tiger rebels who have conducted a string of bomb
attacks recently of trying to destabilize the small island nation.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense Minister General Anuruddha Ratwatte put forward the request in
Parliament a day after a Tamil rebel blew herself up outside the prime
minister's office, killing herself and 12 others in the third major guerrilla
attack in the past 18 days in Colombo. The prime minister was not in her office
at the time of the attack.
</P>
<P>
	   The emergency rule allows the armed forces to search any home and detain any
person on suspicion of involvement with the rebels, who have been fighting a
secessionist war in the north and east since 1983. The emergency rule has been
in force for more than two years across Sri Lanka, and the government needs
Parliament's approval every month.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The government cannot take any chances, and steps have to be taken in the
national interest by extending the emergency rule,'' said Ratwatte, who is
coordinating the government's war efforts against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam. Ratwatte has escaped two assassination attempts.
</P>
<P>
	   Parliament is expected to approve the motion later today.
</P>
<P>
	   There was unprecedented security in and around Parliament today.
Anti-terrorist commandos with dogs scanned the area.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, a female assassin killed herself as police tried to question
her outside the office of Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike.
</P>
<P>
	   It wasn't clear whether she wanted to attack the 82-year-old prime minister,
who mostly works from home because of poor health but had been expected at the
office Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Two hours later, unidentified gunmen on motorcycles shot and killed a
pro-rebel Tamil politician, Kumar Ponnambalam. The motive for slaying the
60-year-old politician was not known.
</P>
<P>
	   Three weeks ago, another female suicide bomber blew herself up at an
election rally of President Chandrika Kumaratunga, the prime minister's
daughter. Kumaratunga suffered a serious eye injury.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said today the woman was a member of the Black Tigers, a group they
characterized as the deadliest weapon in the armory of the rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   The LTTE describes the Black Tigers as a ``major wing'' of its fighting
formations and the female commandos as ``Birds of Freedom.''
</P>
<P>
	   A female LTTE suicide bomber killed former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandhi in 1991 in southern India.
</P>
<P>
	   Male and female suicide bombers begin training as children, sometimes at the
age of 10.
</P>
<P>
	   About half of the Tamil Tiger rebels are women.

<HEADLINE> McCain Denies Ties To TV License  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE KELLMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEDFORD, N.H. (AP) -- As the race for the Republican presidential nomination
heats up in New Hampshire over tax cuts and his chairmanship of the Senate
Commerce Committee, Sen. John McCain is challenging fellow candidates to reject
attack politics and to make the process noble again.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, the Arizona senator and frequent critic of the influence
of money in politics says his new status here as a serious challenger to George
W. Bush, the GOP presidential front-runner and Texas governor, is raising all
sorts of questions about his ethics.
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, McCain found himself on the defensive Wednesday, the same day the
Boston Globe reported that he had prodded a federal agency by letter to rule on
a license application submitted two years earlier by a campaign donor, Paxson
Communications.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said that he only pushed the Federal Communications Commission to
act, not on which decision to make -- which said is an appropriate step for a
congressional committee chairman with oversight of what he says is an
inefficient agency.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I didn't tell them to approve it; I told them to act,'' he said. ``I think
it's entirely appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, once a back-of-the-pack challenger who now is a genuine threat to
Bush in this state with the nation's first presidential primary on Feb. 1, says
his new status is making him a target for conflict-of-interest questions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are going to be more stories like that,'' McCain said of the Boston
Globe article. ``When you get increased visibility you get more scrutiny.''
</P>
<P>
	   The New York Times followed up late Wednesday night with a story on its Web
site about the Paxson matter and other instances where it said McCain urged the
FCC to act on a matter that later benefited a major contributor to his
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain noted that the Commerce Committee has jurisdiction over 80 percent of
the nation's businesses, some of whom have contributed to his campaign. So, he
said, ``there is a natural suspicion'' if he makes decisions that ultimately
help those supporters.
</P>
<P>
	   It is not unusual for members of Congress to send letters to the FCC about
transactions under review. Nine other lawmakers, including Rep. John Dingell,
D-Mich., Rep. Ed Markey, D-Mass., and Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., also sent
inquiries to the agency about Paxson Communications, which owns 73
family-oriented TV stations and has legally provided a private jet for McCain's
use.
</P>
<P>
	   The Boston Globe also reported that company officials coordinated $20,000 in
campaign contributions to McCain, who appeared on at least two nationally
televised news programs Wednesday night to answer questions about his Dec. 10
letter to the FCC concerning Paxson.
</P>
<P>
	   Though McCain defended himself throughout the day, he ended up canceling a
weekend fund-raiser that was to be held by company chairman Lowell ``Bud''
Paxson, saying it would be inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
	   And, in a sign that McCain's campaign was growing increasingly concerned
about the matter, campaign officials poured through his Senate files Wednesday
looking for other instances in which he acted in cases involving donors. Fearing
the Globe story would prompt increased scrutiny of the candidate, aides wanted
to be ready to put his actions into context.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the issue gave Bush a chance to criticize McCain for the second
time in as many days as Republican contenders fought for advantage in this
first-in-the-nation primary state.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it's really important for people who are advocating reforms to
live up to the spirit of reforms they are advocating,'' Bush told reporters
while campaigning in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, in Manchester, N.H., Bush said, ``I respect John McCain'' and
acknowledged that ``I haven't seen the facts.'' But he also said, ``I think
somebody who makes campaign financing an issue has got to be consistent and walk
the walk.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's place in the polls here and his strong fund raising haven't
threatened Bush's front-runner status nationally. But Bush has shown his
determination to prevent that from happening by going after McCain on tax cuts
Monday in their first major policy dispute. The attack inspired McCain to
release details of a tax plan he hadn't intended to put out until Jan. 11.
</P>
<P>
	   At one point Wednesday, McCain appeared with William Bennett, the former
education secretary and presidential drug adviser who has written widely on
morality. And he delivered a speech calling for presidential candidates to
refrain from personal attacks and distortion.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Please do not think I claim some special virtue among the candidates,''
McCain told the Boys and Girls Club of Manchester. ``If we accomplish anything
in this campaign, let those of us who seek the highest office in the land help
turn the practice of politics toward a higher plane.''

<HEADLINE> Taxes Top GOP Presidential Debate  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEDFORD, N.H. (AP) -- After sparring at a distance for two days, Republican
presidential contenders George W. Bush and Sen. John McCain meet tonight for a
debate that is likely to provide a prime-time platform for their brewing
argument over who has the better tax-cut plan.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, R-Ariz., also faces the prospect of questions about his decision to
prod a federal regulatory agency to act on a request from one of his campaign
donors.
</P>
<P>
	   The one-hour debate, being held at the University of New Hampshire in
Durham, N.H., is sponsored by The (Manchester) Union Leader, New England Cable
News and New Hampshire Public Television. The moderator was NBC's Tim Russert.
</P>
<P>
	   In the latest spin on the tax theme, Bush said Wednesday that he was
``startled'' that McCain and Democrat Al Gore agree that his proposed five-year,
$483 billion tax plan may be too big for the country to afford.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it is just right,'' Bush, the Texas governor, told reporters after
touring a Fidelity Investments office here. ``It's a plan that I intend to
defend in the primaries. It's a plan I'm going to campaign on in the general
election, and it's a plan I hope to put in place when I become president of the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
	   In June, McCain proposed to expand the 15 percent bottom tax bracket,
eliminate the so-called ``marriage penalty,'' give relief to Social Security
recipients who work and eliminate taxes on estates worth up to $5 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Next week, in response to Bush's challenge, McCain will expand on his plan.
Aides said the package will be significantly smaller than Bush's, but focus on
Americans earning $30,000 to $70,000 a year and with more than half his cuts
helping people who are not wealthy.
</P>
<P>
	   Under McCain's plan, 60 percent of the surplus would help shore up Social
Security and the rest would go to Medicare and debt reduction. Bush has no plans
to pump extra money into Social Security.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Governor Bush should explain to those nice people at his news conference
why 60 percent of his tax plan helps the rich without doing anything to save
Social Security,'' said McCain spokesman Dan Schnur.
</P>
<P>
	   One other expected debate subject centered on whether McCain lives up to his
stern campaign rhetoric about the corrosive effect of special interests on the
political process.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, urged the Federal
Communications in a Dec. 10 letter to act quickly on a matter involving Paxson
Communications, a company that owns 73 family-oriented TV stations and has
legally provided a private jet for McCain's use.
</P>
<P>
	   The Boston Globe first reported the story Wednesday, saying company
officials coordinated $20,000 in campaign contributions to McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said Wednesday that he did not tell the FCC which way to vote. ``I
told them to act,'' the senator said. ``I think it's entirely appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sharing the stage with Bush and McCain tonight are conservative activist
Gary Bauer, millionaire publisher Steve Forbes, Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah and
former U.N. ambassador Alan Keyes.
</P>
<P>
	   Bauer said he again will train his focus on Bush, who is running even with
McCain in New Hampshire polls but holds a sizable lead in national surveys.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want to nail Governor Bush on whether he's a conservative,'' Bauer told
a news conference in Manchester on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes, on the other hand, dismissed as ``this little food fight'' the
sparring between Bush and McCain over taxes. He said neither candidate was
getting to the heart of the problem.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This little tax credit, this little tinkering with the code. I think
you've got to be bold, get rid of the thing, give a real tax cut to people
instead of making them go through hoops and loops,'' Forbes told reporters after
greeting voters at a restaurant in Franklin. Forbes has proposed scrapping the
existing tax code, and replacing it with a 17 percent flat tax for everyone,
with exemptions of $13,000 for adults and $5,000 for children.

<HEADLINE> Villagers Await Reunion With Syria  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE COPANS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GHAJAR, Golan Heights (AP) -- Stranded behind enemy lines during the 1967
Mideast War, the residents of this Alawite village chose to accept Israeli
citizenship rather than leave their homes on the banks of the three main
tributaries to the Jordan River.
</P>
<P>
	   But the precious water in those tributaries could prevent their village from
going back to Syria as part of a peace deal with Israel, being negotiated this
week in Shepardstown, W.Va.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel will demand that any Golan territory it hands back to Syria exclude
the area around the Hatsbani, Dan and Banias rivers. The water runs into the Sea
of Galilee, Israel's main source of drinking water.
</P>
<P>
	   As Alawite Arabs -- members of the Muslim sect to which Syrian President
Hafez Assad belongs -- many in Ghajar anticipate that the sides will work out an
arrangement that will either restore their village to Syrian sovereignty or
allow them to join their families in Syria.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am hoping and praying that we will be returned to Syria,'' said Yousef
Salman, 26, who said most of the 1,760 villagers are willing to relocate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But my father's brothers, who fled the village to Syria, have memories.
They want to come back here.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bloody battles almost 33 years ago over the precious water sources were
fought east of Ghajar, ending with Israeli troops capturing the farmland
villagers had cultivated for more than 300 years.
</P>
<P>
	   In that war, Israel captured the Golan Heights, which it later annexed and
is now considering returning in exchange for peace with Syria. The Syrian
government says it must return the entire Golan -- which would include the
village.
</P>
<P>
	   But during the 1967 war, neither Israeli nor Syrian soldiers even tried to
enter Ghajar, located on the border between Lebanon and the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
	   The villagers said Syria forgot about them.
</P>
<P>
	   All but 200 residents fled, and the rest, unable to reach their fields, were
on the verge of starvation three months after the war ended. Village elders
finally asked to be put under Israeli control, so they could return to their
fields.
</P>
<P>
	   Salman Mohammed al-Hatib, who has headed the village for the last 41 years
and presided over the decision to come under Israeli control, is cautious about
expressing his loyalties. He refuses to say which country he prefers, Syria or
Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We don't have personal opinions,'' said al-Hatib, 70, seated under the
Israeli flag that hangs behind his desk. ``We want peace and hope for the
reunification of the families.''
</P>
<P>
	   The residents of Ghajar do not, like many of the 18,000 Druze Arabs living
on the Golan Heights, hold pro-Syrian protests to demonstrate their loyalty to
Assad.
</P>
<P>
	   The Alawites want to make sure not to antagonize Israel since it may
continue to rule over them even after a peace deal.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, because they have common roots with Assad, Ghajar residents feel
confident that the Syrian leader will treat them fairly if the village comes
under Syrian control, regardless of their behavior now.
</P>
<P>
	   The Alawite people make up between 6 and 11 eleven percent of Syria's 15
million citizens. Many Muslims consider members of the secretive, Shiite sect to
be heretics, and the group tends to stick together.
</P>
<P>
	   In Ghajar, most of the older residents still work the land, tending olive
groves or cows in the pastures set among the mine fields that surround the
village.
</P>
<P>
	   But younger villagers have largely shrugged off their parents' attachment to
the land in favor of mostly menial jobs in nearby Israeli towns.
</P>
<P>
	   Salman admits that he studied mechanical engineering at an Israeli
university, speaks Hebrew and carries an Israeli ID card.
</P>
<P>
	   But he has always dreamed of leaving this land for Syria.
</P>
<P>
	   He hopes eventually to take the woman he will marry next week, also from
Ghajar, to Syria. He said he is ready for a fresh start in a new place.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everyone here has a deep connection to the home, like the olive trees to
the land,'' Salman said, playing with a gold ring on his finger. ``But I don't
feel Israeli. My nationality is Syrian.''

<HEADLINE> Limits Eased on Supplement Claims  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government says dietary supplements can legally claim
to treat a variety of symptoms -- from morning sickness to memory loss -- that
are considered common passages of life.
</P>
<P>
	   The final regulation issued Wednesday by the Food and Drug Administration
surprised consumer advocates, who maintain it weakens patient protections.
</P>
<P>
	   The new rule ``allows supplement manufacturers to make claims regarding
serious health conditions without any pre-market review by the FDA,'' said Bruce
Silverglade of the Center for Science in the Public Interest.
</P>
<P>
	   The Grocery Manufacturers of America said the rule ``makes strides which
will allow beneficial health information'' to be conveyed to consumers.
</P>
<P>
	   At issue are the $6 billion worth of dietary supplements that Americans buy
each year -- pills, capsules and teas that do not undergo any government
scrutiny for safety or effectiveness before selling.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal law allows the products to make truthful claims that they maintain
the healthful ``structure or function'' of the body -- but they may not claim to
treat diseases.
</P>
<P>
	   The question was where to draw the line between what is a real disease and
what is just a symptom or annoyance that supplements could legally claim to
ease.
</P>
<P>
	   The FDA proposed in 1998 that supplements cannot even imply that they
diagnose, treat, prevent or cure a disease or definitive disease symptom. But
the agency received thousands of letters, from the supplements industry and
consumers, complaining that was too strict.
</P>
<P>
	   So Wednesday, the FDA relented a little: Supplements will be allowed to
claim to help ``common conditions'' associated with ``passages of life'' such as
pregnancy, menopause, adolescence and aging -- but clear diseases and serious
symptoms are still off-limits.
</P>
<P>
	   That means supplements could claim to ease ordinary morning sickness or the
common leg swelling of late pregnancy, but not toxemia or other serious
pregnancy complications. They could claim to treat teen-age acne and menopausal
hot flashes. They could claim to treat muscle pain -- but not joint pain because
that's a classic symptom of arthritis, clearly a disease. They could claim to
treat ``mild memory loss associated with aging'' -- but not real dementia.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a difficult line to draw,'' acknowledged FDA associate policy chief
Peggy Dotzel. But ``if it's a symptom you encounter in the context of stages of
everyday life, that's not a disease.''

<HEADLINE> Algerian Held on Immigration Charges  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- An Algerian accused of illegally entering the United States
remains jailed without bond as investigators look into whether there is a
widespread plot to smuggle explosives into the country.
</P>
<P>
	   Abdel Hakim Tizegha, 29, was to appear before a federal magistrate on
Wednesday, but his attorney did not challenge a government motion to detain him.
</P>
<P>
	   Tizegha is charged with illegally entering the country and eluding federal
officers at the Canadian border. He was arrested Dec. 24 in Bellevue, a suburb
east of Seattle, after allegedly crossing the border at Blaine, about 100 miles
north of here.
</P>
<P>
	   No link has been made in court between Tizegha and Ahmed Ressam, who has
pleaded innocent to federal charges accusing him of having bomb-making materials
in his rental car as he entered the country on Dec. 14.
</P>
<P>
	   But newspaper reports have said that Tizegha is linked to Ressam and that
Tizegha and another man investigated in the case, Abdel Ghani, are longtime
friends. Ghani is charged with helping Ressam.
</P>
<P>
	   A fourth man, Abdel Majid Dahoumane, is believed to have stayed with Ressam
at a motel in British Columbia. Warrants have been issued for his arrest.
</P>
<P>
	   According to former CIA counterterrorism chief Vincent Cannistraro, all four
are part of a terrorist splinter group in Algeria that is supported by Osama bin
Laden, the Saudi exile believed to have masterminded last year's attack on two
U.S. embassies in Africa.
</P>
<P>
	   Cannistraro, citing French counterterrorism officials, said Wednesday the
men belong to a faction that broke with the Armed Islamic Group in Algeria,
known by its French acronym GIA, over its practice of targeting fellow Muslims.
</P>
<P>
	   French investigators have said Ressam has links to Fateh Kamel, who has been
jailed in Paris since April and is suspected of being the leader of an Islamic
militant group. Cannistraro said Kamel is the leader of the GIA splinter group.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Rebel Supporters Threatened  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A pro-government gang harassed a group of 29 supporters
of the leftist Zapatista rebel movement in a region of Mexico's southern Chiapas
province that was scene in 1997 to the massacre of 45 Indian villagers.
</P>
<P>
	   The rebel supporters were some of the hundreds of Chiapas Indians who fled
their homes after the December 1997 massacre in the hamlet of Acteal, and who
rarely venture out of refugee camps, mainly to work or harvest their fields.
</P>
<P>
	   The rebel supporters were trying to harvest their coffee fields on Wednesday
when they were surrounded by pro-government villagers from the town of Chenalho,
where prosecutors say the 1997 massacre was planned. Both those charged in the
massacre and the group involed in Wednesday's standoff support the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
</P>
<P>
	   Army troops intervened to end the standoff and took the 29 rebel supporters
to a nearby army base, arresting three of them on outstanding warrants for
killings that occurred before the massacre.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The PRI supporters wanted to fight with us, but we didn't pay attention to
them,'' Pedro Gomez Perez, one of the rebel supporters. ``Then the soldiers and
police came and took us to their base. They said it was in order to protect
us.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Zapatistas staged a brief armed uprising in 1994, demanding greater
democracy and Indian rights. Peace talks between the government and rebels are
stalled, but a truce remains in effect.

</P>
<P>
	   "The market is under a correction phase after rallies late last year in high
technology and information shares," said Hidenori Karaki, general manager at
Tokyo-Mitsubishi Personal Securities.
</P>
<P>
	   "But the market's fundamentals are not bad," he said, citing steady buying
interest from foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
	   In a market dominated by sell orders, pharmaceutical issues rose as
investors shifted away from high-tech into domestic demand-related issues.
</P>
<P>
	   "Until price fluctuations of information technology shares stabilize,
investors will shift to biotechnology-related issues," said Kunihiro Hatae,
general manager at Tokyo Securities.
</P>
<P>
	   Overnight on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 124.72
points, or 1.1 percent, to 11,122.65. The Dow had risen as much as 216 points in
earlier trading. It plunged 359.58 points on Tuesday.

<P>
	   The technology-laden Nasdaq Composite Index ended a highly volatile session
Wednesday with a loss of 24.09 points, or 0.6 percent, at 3,877.60. On Tuesday,

	   In currency trading, the dollar climbed higher after overseas investors sold
yen for dollars to cash in on Japanese stocks and other yen-denominated assets.
</P>
<P>
	   Japanese life insurers and investment trust funds also bought the dollar,
traders said. The same players bought the euro for yen as well.
</P>
<P>
	   The euro was traded at 108.28 yen, up from 107.24 yen late in Tokyo on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar began gaining earlier this week after the Bank of Japan bought
the currency to stem the yen's rise.
</P>
<P>
	   Japan's vice finance minister, Haruhiko Kuroda, told reporters Thursday that
the yen was still too strong.
</P>
<P>
	   "In terms of fundamentals, it is still clearly excessive," Kuroda said.
</P>
<P>
	   Too strong a yen hurts the income of export-based industries, which
repatriate profits earned overseas in dollars back to Japan.
</P>
<P>
	   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond was at 1.7000,
up from 1.6950 Wednesday. Its price stood at 101.70, down 0.04 point from

<HEADLINE> Russia's Yeltsin Visits Holy Land  </HEADLINE>
   By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Boris Yeltsin said Wednesday he felt ``like a saint''
after arriving in the Holy Land on a Christmas pilgrimage that afforded the pomp
and security befitting the head of state he was until last week.
</P>
<P>
	   He was greeted at Ben-Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv by Education Minister
Yossi Sarid, one of the highest ranking ministers currently in Israel, in an
informal welcome ceremony organized by the Foreign Ministry's protocol
department.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a private visit, but he will get the reception accorded to a figure
of his stature -- `ex' or not,'' said Yaffa Ben-Ari, a spokeswoman for the
Foreign Ministry. Israel's prime minister and foreign minister are in the United
States holding peace talks with Syria.
</P>
<P>
	   Yeltsin appeared pleased to be in the Holy Land at Orthodox Christianity's
Christmas season.
</P>
<P>
	   ``On holy land, I feel like a saint,'' he joked to the crowd of reporters
who met him and his wife at the Jerusalem Hilton. He seemed ruffled, though,
after an hour-long drive in an armored Russian limousine through driving sleet
and rain.
</P>
<P>
	   The former Russian president's official schedule reflects the poor health
that overshadowed much of his second term.
</P>
<P>
	   It includes frequent rest stops at his hotel, and significantly omits an
appearance at the midnight Mass in Bethlehem on Thursday night -- apparently
because the service is a grueling three-plus hours, much of it standing up,
although Christmas is ostensibly the reason for Yeltsin's visit.
</P>
<P>
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has invited the leaders of seven European
nations where Orthodox Christianity predominates to attend Christmas services in
Bethlehem on Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   It's a rehearsal of the presidential duties Arafat hopes to assume when he
declares statehood by the end of this year, as he has pledged to do.
</P>
<P>
	   Yeltsin was invited as president weeks ago, and although he relinquished
that role to Vladimir Putin last week, he understood that the attention he was
getting was linked in part to Arafat's ambitions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have supported and we shall further support'' the peace process, he
said. ``We have had numerous meetings with Arafat and we shall support him in
order to hasten the process of two countries coming together.''
</P>
<P>
	   Russia hopes to re-establish the influence it once wielded in this region, a
prospect that appeals to Palestinians, who see Russia as a counter to what they
perceive as pro-Israel American policy.
</P>
<P>
	   Yeltsin will have private meetings with Arafat, Israeli President Ezer
Weizman and acting Prime Minister Yitzhak Mordechai during his 72 hours here.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russian church is acting as Yeltsin's host in the Holy Land, and is
staying at the Hilton -- the newest and most expensive of Jerusalem's luxury
hotels.
</P>
<P>
	   Hilton deputy manager Guy Klaiman said the Yeltsins would stay in the same
room occupied by President Clinton and his wife a year ago during a critical
juncture in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
	   Klaiman said the Yeltsins would eat all meals at the hotel, noting that the
Russians had forwarded 1,100 pounds of Russian delicacies to satisfy the palates
of the 150-member entourage, including the Russian foreign minister and other
senior officials.
</P>
<P>
	   The Hilton was forced to turn away the food, Klaiman said, because it was
not kosher -- blessed by rabbis according to Jewish religious ritual. The church
donated the food to Jerusalem's poor.
</P>
<P>
	   Also banned -- this time on Russian orders -- were the traditional pile of
sweets the Hilton leaves for its guests. Officials were worried that Yeltsin
would be tempted by foods that would hurt his ailing system.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, Klaiman said, ``We will offer him a wide array of fruit,''
including cherries imported from France.

<HEADLINE> Wildlife activists blame whale's death on captivity  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NIAGARA FALLS, Ontario (AP) - A whale's death at a marine park has
revived a wildlife protection group's complaints about keeping animals captive.
<P>
	   The white beluga whale, along with eight others, was taken from the Russian
Sea of Okhotsk by Zoolex, a Moscow broker. Zoolex transported the whales across
Russia to Moscow, where they rode 10-hour flights to Toronto and then were
brought to Marineland in Niagara Falls, Ontario, in October.
</P>
<P>
	   The whale died Dec. 26.
</P>
<P>
	   Zoocheck Canada, a Toronto-based animal protection agency, has repeatedly
criticized Marineland for importing the belugas and has been investigating the
park for three years. So while preliminary tests did not indicate the animal's
cause of death, the group has already blamed the stress of being taken from the
ocean and the park environment.
</P>
<P>
	   "The autopsy found no organ problems or disease," said John Holer, owner of
the Marineland theme park, who maintains that the capture and travel caused no
trauma. Tissue from the dead whale has been sent to an offsite laboratory for
further tests.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's very unscientific, but my belief is that these animals just give up
the will to live," said Rob Laidlaw, director of Zoocheck Canada. "They are put
into situations where they experience enormous amounts of stress that they
haven't evolved to deal with."
</P>
<P>
	   Laidlaw said some Russian businesses capture whales "netted in fishing nets,
tied to boats and driven to shore where they are pulled up onto shore by their
tails."
</P>
<P>
	   He added, "Even under the very, very best circumstances, there's still
stress involved in lifting an animal out of the water when that's their normal
habitat."
</P>
<P>
	   Laidlaw also argued that Marineland's tank isn't large enough.
</P>
<P>
	   The remaining belugas, including three purchased from Zoolex last May, live
in a tank of 5 million gallons of seawater.
</P>
<P>
	   Because Marineland is a privately owned business, animal habitats are not
subject to Ontario government regulation.
</P>
<P>
	   Holer said the whale seemed healthy until Christmas Day, when it stopped
eating and hung to one side of its tank. Blood tests that day indicated a
failing immune system.
</P>
<P>
	   Belugas, which can grow to be up to 16 feet long and 3,300 pounds, have been
known to swim 3,000 to 4,000 square-miles in a three month period. They can dive
up to 6,500 feet.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's very upsetting to the staff when an animal dies," said Ann Marie
Rondinelli, of Marineland's marketing department. "It's like a family, so it's
painful that the poor animal is dead."
</P>
<P>
	   Nine North American aquariums and zoos house beluga whales.

<HEADLINE> Writers and photographers sue National Geographic over CD-ROM and  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - The rights to the electronic duplication of photographs
and words that may be as much as 108 years old are at stake in a class-action
lawsuit brought against National Geographic Magazine and a for-profit
subsidiary.
<P>
	   Lawyers say the work is contained in a CD-ROM that incorporates all 108
years of the magazine.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit, filed Dec. 27 in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, alleges that
the non-profit National Geographic Society corporation has created a for-profit
entity to republish its pages in electronic format.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit sought a permanent injunction to block the sale of the products
and an order barring further acts of unfair competition.
</P>
<P>
	   It also sought unspecified compensatory and punitive damages as well as
legal fees.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit said it seeks to win payments for scores of writers and
photographers whose work makes up "The Complete National Geographic, 110 Years
of National Geographic Magazine on CD-ROM" and a later version in DVD format.
</P>
<P>
	   A message for comment left at the Washington offices of National Geographic
on Wednesday was not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit said some contracts with writers and photographers specifically
limited the reproduction of the photographs or words to the magazine. Others
said they cannot be reproduced electronically without the permission of the
author or photographer, according to the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
	   "These plaintiffs did not intend to have their work used for profit and
commercial purposes on CD-ROM and in DVD formats for the price that they
negotiated," the lawsuit said. "It is believed that there are hundreds of
writers and photographers in this situation."
</P>
<P>
	   Packaging for the new products say they contain "178,567 pages with
spectacular photographs, 9,048 fascinating articles and 100 years of classic
advertising."
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit alleged that the National Geographic Society created its
for-profit subsidiary, National Geographic Ventures, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Since then, it said, the subsidiary has sold products for television as well
as maps and interactive entertainment.
</P>
<P>
	   Included in the CD-ROM or DVD products are animated video and advertisements
for various companies that also infringe on the rights of the authors and
photographers, the lawsuit alleged.

<HEADLINE> Weld: I'd be hard to stop for New York governor in 2006  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   BOSTON (AP) - Former Massachusetts Gov. William Weld began his first day
as a Manhattan resident with a grand claim: If he decided to run for the top job
in New York in 2006, he could well become only the second American elected
governor of two states.
<P>
	   "I'd be hard to stop," Weld said in a telephone interview Wednesday with The
Associated Press from his New York law office.
</P>
<P>
	   Should Weld succeed, he would join Sam Houston, the only two-state governor
in history. Houston was governor of Tennessee from 1827 to 1829 and Texas from
1859 to 1861.
</P>
<P>
	   Weld's claim to political viability in a new state may not be far-fetched.
</P>
<P>
	   "If anyone can do it, Bill Weld can do it," said Gov. Paul Cellucci, Weld's
running mate and lieutenant governor for six years. "He certainly was the person
who led our state back from some pretty tough times - he'll always be remembered
fondly."
</P>
<P>
	   Before he had even carried his suitcase into his Upper East Side apartment,
Weld was chatting about his roots in Long Island's Smithtown and his vacation
homes in the Adirondacks.
</P>
<P>
	   The moderate Republican's not-so-subtle message: He's no carpetbagger,
unlike Hillary Rodham Clinton, who also moved to New York state on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton - who became friends with Weld when they were both young
lawyers working on the Watergate hearings - is running for Senate from her new
home in Chappaqua, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
	   Weld, 54, cannot run for governor until he satisfies New York's five-year
residency requirement for the post. And he said he wouldn't challenge his two
New York pals - Gov. George Pataki or New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who hired
him as a federal prosecutor in 1981 - if either one were to run for governor in
2006.
</P>
<P>
	   New York may have a harsh political environment, but Massachusetts is even
harsher, said former New York Mayor Ed Koch.
</P>
<P>
	   "Massachusetts chews you up more than New York, and we do plenty of
chewing," said Koch, who recently encountered Weld in a barbershop.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've become a great respecter of him and his abilities to relate to
people," said Gerald Doherty, former Massachusetts state Democratic chairman who
worked on Robert F. Kennedy's 1964 Senate race in New York and ran Jimmy
Carter's presidential campaign there.
</P>
<P>
	   Brainy, funny and unpredictable - he once dived, fully clothed, into the
Charles River after signing an environmental bill - Weld strongly appealed to
suburban voters.
</P>
<P>
	   He also attracted Irish and Italian voters, despite his patrician lineage
which includes his namesake, William Floyd, who signed the Declaration of
Independence from New York.
</P>
<P>
	   "I may be a tightly wound Yankee, but that's not how I feel," Weld said
Wednesday. "I feel much more ethnic. I think I was separated at birth from an
Irish-Italian mother."
</P>
<P>
	   He narrowly won his long-shot campaign for governor in 1990 on a platform of
fighting crime, reforming welfare and cutting taxes. Over the next four years,
heavily Democratic Massachusetts came to like his brand of fiscal conservatism
and social liberalism and re-elected him by a landslide five years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   He has a notoriously short attention span, however, and soon got bored.
</P>
<P>
	   "Governor is the longest I've ever had a job," Weld said.
</P>
<P>
	   He challenged incumbent John Kerry for the Senate in 1996 and lost. The next
year he resigned, and President Clinton nominated him as ambassador to Mexico.
But Sen. Jesse Helms thought Weld too liberal, and blocked the nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Since then, he has written two suspense novels, "Mackerel by Moonlight" and
"Big Ugly."
</P>
<P>
	   These days, he said, he is fully engaged as managing partner at McDermott,
Will &AMP; Emery's New York office, where he has been busy buying and selling
companies. "I'm enjoying that," he said. "I've got a reasonably steep learning
curve."
</P>
<P>
	   He will not sell his house in Cambridge, where his five children grew up.
His wife, Susan Roosevelt Weld, lectures at Harvard University and Boston
College.
</P>
<P>
	   If he does run in 2006, he will first have to win the hearts and minds of
New York Republicans and Conservative Party members.
</P>
<P>
	   "Bill Weld would face the high prospect of a Republican primary," New York
consultant Jay Severin said. "If he gets beyond that, 'President Weld' is a very
plausible phrase."

<HEADLINE> Neighbors welcome Clintons to their town  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   CHAPPAQUA, N.Y. (AP) - When the first dog, Buddy Clinton, needs a
shampoo, the pet care center in Chappaqua is ready.
<P>
	   Christine DiPaulo, owner of Wags &AMP; Whiskers pet grooming, said the Secret
Service already had visited her store. After the Clintons leave the White House
for good, this will likely be the place the presidential pooch gets his
shampoos.
</P>
<P>
	   The agents "asked if it would be all right if somebody stayed with the pet,"
DiPaulo said. "I said, 'Of course.' I don't really expect to see Mrs. Clinton,
though."
</P>
<P>
	   The Westchester County hamlet is welcoming its newest arrivals - President
Clinton and wife Hillary - with open arms.
</P>
<P>
	   "I would be willing to offer my services, and I'm pleased to have her in
this little town," said hair stylist Santa Nikkels, owner of Santa's Salon &AMP;
Spa. "I would be able to do her hair at (her) home."
</P>
<P>
	   Nikkels was so thrilled by the Clintons' imminent arrival that she sent Mrs.
Clinton a letter volunteering her services.
</P>
<P>
	   "I told her, 'I'm excited because I'm new here, too,"' said Nikkels, an
Ecuadorian immigrant who opened her Chappaqua shop just six months ago.
</P>
<P>
	   While some residents in the town of 17,000 have griped about the incessant
attention drawn by the Clintons, most people seemed eager to greet them as they
moved into their $1.7 million home.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think there's been some disturbance for the people on the (Clintons')
street," said Chappaqua resident Wilma Rapp, a customer at the Q Nails salon.
"Other than that, people feel pretty good about the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
	   "You tell somebody you live in Chappaqua and they say, 'Oh! Hillary!"'
</P>
<P>
	   Town Supervisor Marion Sinek, who stopped outside the Clintons' home on
Wednesday, said the couple had chosen to live in Chappaqua for the same reason
as many locals.
</P>
<P>
	   No, not to run for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a beautiful suburb with beautiful streets like this," the Democratic
official said, standing on the Clintons' new block. "We are happy to have them.
We welcome them."

<HEADLINE> Competition May Affect Electricity  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An Energy Department task force says the electric
industry's rush toward competition is making America's power system less
reliable.
</P>
<P>
	   The group examined power disruptions during peak electricity demand last
summer in Chicago, New York City, Texas and other areas in the mid-Atlantic and
Gulf Coast states.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Aging infrastructure and increased demand for power have strained many
transmission and distribution systems to the point of interrupting service,''
said the interim task force report. It said some utilities, in focusing on
surviving in a competitive market, cut spending on areas aimed at reliability.
</P>
<P>
	   Increased electricity use and new demands caused by the trend toward
competition among power providers ``are stressing the electrical system'' and
increasing the risk of temporary blackouts or brownouts during peak demand
periods, the report continued.
</P>
<P>
	   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said cooperation between industry and the
government in dealing with the Y2K computer glitch ``was a good step toward
achieving a more reliable electric grid.''
</P>
<P>
	   But he said the report by the department's task force investigating power
disruptions last summer was evidence that additional steps must be taken to
ensure electricity reliability. He urged Congress to enact legislation aimed at
increasing reliability of the power grids.
</P>
<P>
	   The interim report, given to Richardson this week with a final version
expected in March, found that electric utilities were undergoing fundamental
change from operating as local monopolies to becoming rivals in an increasingly
competitive market.
</P>
<P>
	   The disruptions last summer ``demonstrate that the necessary operating
practices, regulatory policies and technological tools for dealing with the
changes are not yet in place to guarantee an acceptable level of reliability,''
said the report.
</P>
<P>
	   The task force, made up of power industry experts from the government and
private industry, was asked to examine power disruptions and electricity price
spikes that occurred during high electricity demand last summer.
</P>
<P>
	   They included outages in Chicago, New York City, Long Island, New Jersey,
the mid-Atlantic from Virginia to Delaware, Mississippi, Arkansas, Texas and
Louisiana as well as some non-outage electricity grid disturbances in New
England and the mid-Atlantic states.
</P>
<P>
	   The task force said competitive pressures make it more difficult to
coordinate the flow of electricity since more parties participate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Unfortunately the development of reliability management reforms, tools,
technologies and operating procedures has lagged behind economic reforms in the
electric industry,'' said the report.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In anticipation of competitive markets, some utilities have adopted a
strategy of cost-cutting that involves reduced spending on reliability... The
overall effect has been that infrastructure for reliability assurance has been
considerably eroded.''

<HEADLINE> Suspects arrested in money-laundering prostitution case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   DALLAS (AP) - Federal agents operating fake financial-services companies
in Dallas and Columbus, Ohio, helped uncover a money-laundering ring tied to
prostitution in cities across the nation.
<P>
	   One undercover Dallas company, Tejas Financial, laundered more than $2
million in credit-card charges paid to prostitutes during the investigation,
which goes back to the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
	   Trials or sentencing dates are set for January and February for the
suspects, including a New Jersey lawyer and a Garland man who once claimed to
control much of the Dallas area's prostitution business, The Dallas Morning News
reported today.
</P>
<P>
	   Assistant U.S. Attorney James T. Jacks said hundreds of escort services were
netted in the cases. Most of the cases have been farmed to other U.S. attorney's
offices for prosecution.
</P>
<P>
	   But up to 15 cases are being handled in Dallas, including those of about 10
suspects from the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
	   Jacks obtained a conspiracy and money-laundering indictment against Boston
resident John Okowinski. He is accused of using at least five Massachusetts
escort services as fronts for prostitution and laundering some proceeds through
Tejas Financial Services, an Internal Revenue Service shell company in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
	   Also last month, U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall sentenced former Boston
pimp Carl Orlowski, 46, to five months in prison and fined him $4,000 for
promoting prostitution in interstate commerce.
</P>
<P>
	   Orlowski agreed to cooperate with prosecutors after admitting he ran
prostitutes through his escort services.
</P>
<P>
	   The investigation put many prostitution operations out of business, but it
was aimed at the money laundering business, Jacks said.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the suspects netted were the business partners involved with Paramus,
N.J., company Entertainment Management Services Inc., which prosecutors say
charged prostitution clients up to 18 percent of their profits for laundering
credit-card charges.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm running a national prostitution money-laundering ring," Robert A.
Hollis, a New Jersey lawyer and partner in EMS, told two undercover IRS agents,
Andrew Merlino and Mark Parsons. "All of our clients are pimps and madams."
</P>
<P>
	   Hollis has pleaded guilty to money laundering and admitted that he helped
wash up to $3.4 million in profits from illegal sex operations and is scheduled
to be sentenced Feb. 7.
</P>
<P>
	   Hollis' business partners, former Boston escort-service operator Kenneth
Patrick Byrnes and former EMS bookkeeper David S. Schneider, were indicted this
fall on money-laundering charges. They are set for trial Jan. 18, although that
might be delayed.

<HEADLINE> Michael Douglas, Zeta-Jones Engaged  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones are engaged.
</P>
<P>
	   Douglas, 55, proposed to the 30-year-old Welsh actress on New Year's Eve at
his home in Aspen, Colo.
</P>
<P>
	   "While no date has been set, they plan to wed later this year. He's now
given her a ring," said Allen Burry, Douglas' publicist.
</P>
<P>
	   Todd Adair, who represents Zeta-Jones, said the marriage proposal came with
a "big ol' diamond ring."
</P>
<P>
	   "She's ecstatic, thrilled and very, very happy," Adair said.
</P>
<P>
	   The relationship was said to be on the rocks just last month when Zeta-Jones
opted to spend Christmas in Wales. Douglas showed up in time to join her for the
holiday.
</P>
<P>
	   The two met at the Deauville Film Festival in August 1998 and have been
dating since March 1999. They share a Sept. 25 birthday.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, the actress, who has starred in "The Mask of Zorro," "The
Haunting" and "Entrapment," said she was in no hurry to marry the star of "Fatal
Attraction" and "Basic Instinct."
</P>
<P>
	   She told Harper's Bazaar magazine then that "there are no words of
marriage." Douglas separated from his wife of 22 years, Diandra, in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Rapper's Film Career Successful  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Ice Cube's foray into the film world is proving to be just
as successful as his rap career.
</P>
<P>
	   The 30-year-old rapper, who made his acting debut in 1991's "Boyz 'N the
Hood," is releasing the sequel to his successful comedy "Friday" next week.
"Next Friday" was written and produced by Ice Cube, who also stars in the film.
</P>
<P>
	   "I wrote them because we had seen South Central movies like 'Boyz 'N the
Hood' and 'Menace II Society' showing my neighborhood one way, and I wanted to
show what I thought about it," the rapper says in the Jan. 6 edition of Time Out
New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Ice Cube also made his directorial debut with 1998's "The Players Club" and
was one of the stars of last year's critically acclaimed "Three Kings" with
George Clooney.
</P>
<P>
	   Ice Cube said he was not disappointed that "Three Kings" underperformed at
the box office.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's no guarantee that a lot of people are going to see a movie. But the
people who did see it: Do they like it? That's all that matters."

    	   OLD LYME, Conn. (AP) - State police are looking for people who might
have seen a fatal accident on Interstate 95 Tuesday night.
<P>
	   Troopers are trying to find out what happened and need help in identifying
the woman killed in the fiery limousine crash.
</P>
<P>
	   The white Lincoln Town Car went out of control, crashed through the
guardrail, flipped over and exploded in flames.
</P>
<P>
	   The limo's driver, seriously injured in the crash, hasn't been able to give
police many details and does not know the passenger's name, police said.

examiner's office in Farmington.

<HEADLINE> Dow Steady; Nasdaq Falls 46  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices are mixed in early trading. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average is little changed in today's early going, helped by some of
the financial stocks. Losing issues on the New York Stock Exchange hold an
eight-to-five lead over gainers.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq Composite Index is off 46 points and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
Stock Index is down two points.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts say market sentiment remains nervous in the wake of this week's
technology-led selloff. Global markets have weakened again heading into today's
session. There is also some nervousness ahead of the release tomorrow of
December employment data. True, this morning's weekly jobless claims report was
weaker than expected. But the Labor Department advises that the report released
this time of year tends to be volatile because of the holidays.
</P>
<P>
	   Computer maker Gateway did nothing to help tech investors get over their
case of the nerves, after revealing late yesterday that fourth-quarter earnings
will fall below expectations. It cited a Y2K-induced sales slowdown, coupled
with what it described as difficulty getting components from Intel.
</P>
<P>
	   Retail chains have reported their same-store sales figures. While Toys R Us
has reported lackluster results, jewelry seller Tiffany has delivered blowout
sales numbers.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 5.89; Nasdaq Down 56.77  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were narrowly mixed at the start of trading today,
with technology shares remaining weak while blue chips managed a slight advance.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 5.89 at 11,128.54.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was
down 7.66 at 1,394.45, and the Nasdaq composite index was down 56.77 at
3,820.77.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology stocks continued to tumble in profit-taking from last year's
record-breaking rise. Some of last year's best performers fell. Yahoo! fell 8
5/8 to 401 7/8, and Qualcomm fell 5 15/16 to 150 1/2.
</P>
<P>
	   The sector was also pressured by Gateway's warning late Wednesday that
fourth-quarter earnings would miss expectations. The computer maker blamed a
decline in sales due to Y2K fears and component supply problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Gateway, which fell steeply in extended-hours trading Wednesday, bounced
back today and was up 4 11/16 to 58 11/16. But traders said the company's
warning contributed to weakness in other computer makers' share prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Dell dropped 2 7/16 to 47 1/2, and Apple fell 1 1/2 to 102 1/2.
</P>
<P>
	   The market has been rattled this week by growing concerns that the Federal
Reserve will soon raise interest rates in an effort to stave off inflation. The
Fed raised rates three times in 1999, and is expected to resume its course of
action as early as Feb. 2.
</P>
<P>
	   Traders said the market might revive on Friday if the Labor Department's
monthly unemployment report, which contains data on wages and the number of jobs
created, shows modest or slowing growth.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, the government said its weekly tally of new claims for unemployment
benefits rose by 33,000 last week, the largest increase in a year. Jobless
claims had fallen by 7,000 in the previous week.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Labor Department analysts stressed that the claims level is often
volatile during holiday periods and they cautioned against reading too much into
one week's movement in jobless claims.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 4-to-3 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 118.79 million shares, slightly behind
Wednesday's early pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index fell 1.61 to 477.22.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas indexes continued to slip amid fears of higher interest rates in
the United States. Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 2.02 percent. In afternoon
trading, Germany's DAX index was down 1.0 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was down
1.2 percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 1.0 percent.

<HEADLINE> Influenza Is the True Y2K Bug  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- They are the familiar sights and sounds of winter: the
sniffling nose, the dry, throaty voice and the grimace that follows a swallow of
medicine.
</P>
<P>
	   Better get used to them, health officials say. The flu, which struck the
West hard last month, has arrived like a storm along the East Coast, filling
hospital waiting rooms and doctors' offices with ailing patients.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's bad all over the country," said Dr. Robert McNamara, chief of
emergency medicine at Temple University Hospital in Philadelphia. "The flu shot
apparently is not doing its job, and from all reports, it could be one of the
worst seasons we've seen in years."
</P>
<P>
	   Patients at emergency rooms nationwide have found out as much in the last
couple of weeks. At McNamara's hospital, patients line the halls on gurneys,
waiting for rooms. Others huddle around rows of chairs waiting to be seen by a
doctor. Other hospitals across the country are scrambling to add extra staff,
while others are even turning people away due to overcrowding.
</P>
<P>
	   "If the trend continues the way it is now, within the next month we are
going to have a great challenge to find beds to admit anybody in the state of
Maryland," said Dr. Rick Alcorta, head of the Emergency Medical Resource Center,
which tracks the status of hospitals in the Baltimore area.
</P>
<P>
	   Said Beth Allen, director of patient services at Community Hospital in
Anderson, Ind.: "This morning our medical-surgical unit was at 150 percent
capacity. I think we are approaching record numbers."
</P>
<P>
	   At South Georgia Medical Center in Valdosta, Ga., supervisors went from
wearing business suits to white nurses' coats to help with the crush of mostly
flu-ridden patients. In Newnan, southwest of Atlanta, a spokeswoman at Emory
Peachtree Regional Hospital said doctors are calling this round of flu the worst
strain since 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
show that more than 99 percent of the cases reported so far are influenza type
A. Most of the cases, officials say, appear to be the Sydney strain of the
virus, which also struck last year.
</P>
<P>
	   The first substantial cases were reported in California and Arizona last
month. Since then, 19 states -- including Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey and
Virginia -- have reported widespread or regional flu activity, the CDC said.
</P>
<P>
	   While the agency said about 3 percent of doctor visits in those states were
related to flu-like symptoms, hospital workers say cases in the East seemed to
have spiked since Christmas.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've been used to seeing (the flu) in late January, February and even
March," said Dr. Luther Rhodes, chief of infectious disease at Lehigh Valley
Hospital in Allentown, Pa. "We weren't thinking about it over the Christmas
holiday."
</P>
<P>
	   As of Wednesday, flu patients occupied half of Lehigh Valley's 70
single-patient rooms. Normally, Rhodes said, that number reaches only three or
four at the height of the season.
</P>
<P>
	   For the first time, Rhodes said, the hospital has asked inbound flu patients
to call ahead.
</P>
<P>
	   Flu symptoms include fever, coughing and runny or stuffy noses, along with
headaches, muscle aches and extreme fatigue. The virus is distinguished by its
quick onset and its affect over an entire body.
</P>
<P>
	   "These are people who come in and generally feel terrible," said Dr. Anthony
Cirillo, chief of emergency medicine at Memorial Hospital in Pawtucket, R.I.
"Often times, they're dehydrated. These aren't people who move through the
system overnight."
</P>
<P>
	   Those considered at risk of more serious flu complications include infants,
the elderly and people with chronic illnesses such as asthma, AIDS, sickle cell
anemia, diabetes or heart disease.
</P>
<P>
	   The situation is so bad at Claremont Nursing and Rehabilitation Center near
Carlisle, Pa., that visitors are banned through at least Sunday. Ed Quinlan,
president of the Hospital Association of Rhode Island, said some swamped
hospitals have been forced to reschedule elective surgeries.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is no good flu year," said Dr. Matthew Cartter, epidemiology program
coordinator for the Connecticut Department of Public Health. But whether the
season as a whole will prove to be worse than average won't be known until it
has run its course, he said.

<HEADLINE> HUD To Insure Larger Mortgage Loans  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a move to boost homeownership, the Department of
Housing and Urban Development is raising its insurance limits on home mortgage
loans.
</P>
<P>
	   Secretary Andrew Cuomo said today that HUD has begun insuring mortgage loans
for single-family homes ranging from $121,296 in communities where housing costs
are lower to a limit of $219,849 in areas with higher housing costs.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1999, the limits ranged from $115,200 to $208,800.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These higher loan limits will help create more homeowners, more home
construction, more jobs and more economic growth,'' Cuomo said. ``They will
transform the American dream of homeownership into a reality for families across
the nation.''
</P>
<P>
	   The new loan limits are part of a regular annual adjustment HUD makes to
account for rising home prices.

<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today, with technology shares remaining
weak while blue chips advanced on the strength of old-fashioned cyclical
companies.
</P>
<P>
	   In morning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up
61.12 at 11,183.77.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was

	   Technology stocks continued to tumble in profit-taking from last year's
record-breaking rise. Some of last year's best performers fell. Yahoo! lost 10
13/16 to 399 11/16, and Qualcomm fell 7 1/2 to 148 15/16.
</P>
<P>
	   That wave of selling, which has been exacerbated by investors' desire to
sell now and pay their capital-gains taxes in 2001, may soon ebb, said Larry
Rice, chief investment officer at Josephthal &AMP; Co. in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   "These stocks will bounce back," he said. "There are too many people who are
still eager to buy. And these companies still hold great potential for making a
lot of money."
</P>
<P>
	   Still, fears of slowing profits for two high-tech firms depressed the sector
today. Gateway warned late Wednesday its fourth-quarter earnings would miss
expectations due to a slowdown in sales. The computer maker blamed Year 2000
computer worries and component supply problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Gateway, which fell steeply in extended-hours trading Wednesday, bounced
back today and was up 5 7/8 to 59 7/8. But traders said the company's warning
contributed to weakness in other computer makers' share prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Dell dropped 2 21/64 to 47 39/64, and Apple fell 3 5/8 to 100 3/8.
</P>
<P>
	   Intel fell 2 3/8 to 81 1/4. Gateway blamed the semiconductor maker for some
of its supply problems.
</P>
<P>
	   MCI WorldCom was down 3 9/16 at 47 3/4 after Salomon Smith Barney analyst
Jack Grubman lowered his earnings and revenue estimates for fiscal year 2000.
Grubman said the company's revenue is likely to grow 14.4 percent from 1999 to
2000, below his previous estimate of 15.2 percent.

	   As fears have escalated, investors have shifted some money from technology
stocks to cyclical stocks, which depend upon economic growth. Caterpillar rose 2
to 51 1/8 and Johnson &AMP; Johnson rose 1 11/16 to 91 7/16.

<HEADLINE> Asia, Europe Stocks Continue Fall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Prices were mixed on Wall Street today as investors, still
taking profits on technology stocks, invested their gains in blue-chip issues.
Prices dropped sharply in earlier trading in Asia, and were off more modestly in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average was up 75.70 at 11,198.35 at midday in New
York, while the Nasdaq composite index, which suffered its biggest-ever point
drop on Tuesday amid concerns about rising U.S. interest rates, was off 75.10 at
3,807.44.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology stocks, the most severely battered by this week's selling, were
hurt today by news from the computer maker Gateway that its quarterly earnings
will fall short of Wall Street's expectations. But blue chip stocks including
the Dow industrials rose as investors gravitated toward companies that do well
during times of higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
	   In Europe, key market gauges fell 1.36 percent in London, 0.54 percent in
Paris and 0.42 percent in Germany.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. and European trading was calm compared to Asia, where big declines have
brought back memories of the way prices plunged more than two years ago as the
financial crisis spread through the region.
</P>
<P>
	   The main market indicator in Hong Kong dropped 4.4 percent today and Tokyo's
main index lost 2 percent after bigger declines on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index slid sharply from the outset, at one point
coming close to matching Wednesday's ominous 7.2 percent dive that was its worst
one-day drop since late October 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   The Hang Seng finished with a loss of 693.49 points, or 4.4 percent, at
15,153.23.
</P>
<P>
	   On Asia's top market, the Tokyo Stock Exchange, its best-known index shed 2
percent as investors bailed out of high-tech companies that have taken a beating
globally.
</P>
<P>
	   A 5.6 percent drop in the Nasdaq on Tuesday sparked the selloffs, and
although the Nasdaq held its losses Wednesday to just 0.6 percent, traders
figured many high-tech companies were still too expensive.
</P>
<P>
	   Tokyo's Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues closed 374.28 points
lower at 18,168.27. The index had fallen 2.4 percent on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   South Korea's main market index fell 2.6 percent. Prices in Singapore,
Australia, Malaysia and Thailand gave up initial gains and turned lower. The key
market gauge fell 1.3 percent in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
	   The market in Indonesia rebounded, while prices rose marginally in the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
	   Taiwanese blue chips continued to buck the trend, finishing with a gain of
0.8 percent today -- on top of a 1.1 percent gain that made the Taipei market
the region's only winner Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Soybeans Lead Wheat, Corn Higher  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices rose today in early
dealings on the Chicago Board of Trade.
</P>
<P>
	   The rise extended gains Wednesday when March soybeans reached a four-week
high -- mostly on forecasts calling for continued dry weather in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat futures posted smaller gains in part due to technical factors. The
gains were milder due to continued weak export demand.
</P>
<P>
	   Traders are monitoring dry soil conditions in the southern Plains states
that may damage red winter wheat crops, eventually lessening the supply.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts say corn is also likely to get a boost from the rise in soybean
prices. But they say any increases will continue to be tempered by farmers'
large stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
	   In early trading, wheat for March delivery was up  3/4 cent to $2.50 1/2 a
bushel; March corn rose 1 1/4 cents to $2.04 1/4 a bushel; March oats were a 
1/4 cent higher at $1.09 1/2 a bushel; and March soybeans rose 1 3/4 cents to
$4.78 3/4 a bushel.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, livestock and meat futures prices were mixed in early trading on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   February live cattle were up 0.28 cent to 69.35 cents a pound; March feeder
cattle rose 0.27 cent to 85.97 cents a pound; February lean hogs fell 0.35 cent
to 55.27 cents a pound; and February pork bellies were up 0.43 cent to 81.55
cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Sales of New Homes Fall 7.1 Pct.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sales of new homes fell 7.1 percent in November, the
biggest decline in two years, as higher mortgage rates started to have a bigger
impact on sales activity.
</P>
<P>
	   The drop in single-family sales followed a big 9 percent October increase.
Even with the setback, the Commerce Department reported today, homes were sold
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 865,000 units in November.
</P>
<P>
	   New-home sales have been above an annual rate of 800,000 for a record 23
straight months. The previous record was a five-month string of sales at that
level set in late 1977.
</P>
<P>
	   Economists had been predicting a slowdown in the red-hot housing market
since June, when the Federal Reserve started pushing interest rates higher in an
effort to dampen such interest-sensitive sectors of the economy as housing.
</P>
<P>
	   Thirty-year, fixed-rate mortgages rose to 8.06 percent last week, compared
to 6.83 percent at the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   However, even with the November setback for new-home sales, which was the
biggest decline since December 1997, housing sales remained above an annual rate
of 800,000 homes for a record 23rd straight month.
</P>
<P>
	   Because housing and consumer spending have remained so strong, many
economists are looking for the Federal Reserve to boost interest rates further
this year, possibly engineering another three rate increases in an effort to
slow economic activity and keep inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite interest-rate worries, the Dow Jones average of 30 blue-chip stocks
today continued regaining some of the ground lost in the big sell-off Tuesday.
The Dow was up 100 points at midday but the broader Nasdaq index was losing
again, down 75 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Meantime, many of the nation's big retail chains reported
better-than-expected sales last month and apparently took no big losses at the
hands of Internet sellers.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi retail sales index, which tracks sales at about
80 U.S. chains, rose 6.6 percent in December, above the expected 5.5 percent to
6 percent. It was the index's highest level since 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   With the robust sales figures, Wall Street analysts today raised their
fourth-quarter earnings estimates for many retailers, including Wal-Mart,
Federated Department Stores and Tiffany.
</P>
<P>
	   	   In a separate report today, the Labor Department said the number of
Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose by 33,000 last week,
the biggest increase in a year.
</P>
<P>
	   The number of new applications for jobless benefits climbed to 309,000 for
the week ending Saturday, the first time this figure has been above the 300,000
level in 13 weeks. Jobless claims had fallen by 7,000 in the previous week.
</P>
<P>
	   But Labor Department analysts stressed that the claims level is often
volatile during holiday periods and they cautioned against reading too much into
one week's movement in jobless claims. They noted that the last huge weekly jump
in claims, a gain of 60,000, occurred for the week ending Dec. 26, 1998, also a
period around the Christmas holidays.
</P>
<P>
	   Even with the falloff in homes sales, the price of a new home continued to
rise to record levels.
</P>
<P>
	   The average price climbed 4.2 percent to a record $209,700. The median
price, meaning the point where half the homes sold for more and half for less,
also rose to a record of $167,400, up 5.3 percent from October.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales declines occurred in all parts of the country with the Northeast
suffering the biggest percentage decline, a drop of 31.5 percent which left
sales in that region of the country at an annual rate of 50,000 units, the
slowest pace of activity since January 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales fell 7.8 percent in the Midwest to a seasonally adjusted annual rate
of 188,000 units while the South saw a 3.1 percent drop in sales to an annual
rate of 380,000 units. Sales in the West fell 5.4 percent to a rate of 247,000
homes.

<HEADLINE> Kellogg Hires Ford Exec As CFO  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BATTLE CREEK, Mich. (AP) -- Kellogg Corp. has hired Thomas J. Webb, a Ford
Motor Co. financial specialist, as its chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
	   Webb becomes executive vice president of the cereal maker, which has
suffered flat cereal sales and a sliding market share. He was chief financial
information officer of Ford, where he worked for 22 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Kellogg's chief financial officer John R. Hinton and four other top
executives resigned in March.
</P>
<P>
	   "Tom Webb brings outstanding financial and analytical skills to Kellogg,"
said Kellogg president and chief executive Carlos M. Gutierrez. He said the
appointment completes the company's executive overhaul.
</P>
<P>
	   Long the biggest U.S. cereal maker, Kellogg fell behind Minnesota-based
General Mills in the four-week period ended Dec. 5.
</P>
<P>
	   Kellogg's market share was 27.9 percent, compared with 29.8 percent for
General Mills, according to supermarket data collected by Information Resources
Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   In the last two years, Kellogg has cut hundreds of jobs worldwide to save
money.
</P>
<P>
	   In November, it closed the oldest part of its historic hometown cereal plant
in Battle Creek.
</P>
<P>
	   Kellogg has said it will debut at least five new cereals in 2000, along with
promotions featuring supermodel Cindy Crawford and basketball star Grant Hill.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 84.39; Nasdaq Down 81.79  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today, with technology shares remaining
weak while blue chips advanced on the strength of old-fashioned cyclical
companies that rise with a growing economy.
</P>
<P>
	   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up
84.39 at 11,207.04.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was
down 1.04 at 1,401.07, and the Nasdaq composite index was down 81.79 at
3,795.75.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology stocks continued to tumble as investors sold stocks to lock in
profits from last year's record-breaking rise. Some of the best performers of
1999 declined, with Yahoo! down 10 13/16 to 399 11/16, and Qualcomm off 7 1/2 at
148 15/16.
</P>
<P>
	   A three-day selloff in technology stocks, which has been exacerbated by
investors' desire to sell now and pay their capital-gains taxes in 2001, may
soon ebb, said Larry Rice, chief investment officer at Josephthal &AMP; Co. in New
York.
</P>
<P>
	   "These stocks will bounce back," he said. "There are too many people who are
still eager to buy. And these companies still hold great potential for making a
lot of money."
</P>
<P>
	   Still, fears of slowing profits for two high-tech firms depressed the sector
today. Personal computer maker Gateway warned late Wednesday its fourth-quarter
earnings would miss expectations due to a slowdown in sales. The company blamed
Year 2000 computer worries and component supply problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Gateway, which fell steeply in extended-hours trading Wednesday, bounced
back today and was up 5 3/8 to 59 3/8. But traders said the company's warning
contributed to weakness in other computer makers' share prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Dell dropped 2 1/4 to 47 11/16, and Apple fell 4 3/8 to 99 5/8.
</P>
<P>
	   Intel fell 2 3/4 to 80 7/8. Gateway blamed the semiconductor maker for some
of its supply problems.
</P>
<P>
	   MCI WorldCom was down 4 3/16 at 47 1/8 after influential Salomon Smith
Barney analyst Jack Grubman lowered his earnings and revenue estimates for
fiscal year 2000. Grubman said the company's revenue is likely to grow 14.4
percent from 1999 to 2000, below his previous estimate of 15.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader market has been rattled this week by growing concerns that the
Federal Reserve will soon raise interest rates in an effort to stave off
inflation. The Fed raised rates three times in 1999, and is expected to resume
its course of action as early as Feb. 2.
</P>
<P>
	   As inflation fears have escalated, investors have shifted some money from
technology stocks to cyclical stocks, which depend upon economic growth.
Caterpillar rose 2 to 51 1/8 and Johnson &AMP; Johnson rose 2 11/16 to 92 7/16.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors are now awaiting Friday's monthly unemployment report from the
Labor Department, which contains data on wages and the number of jobs created.
Any sign of modest or slowing growth could prompt some new buying, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, the government said its weekly tally of new claims for unemployment
benefits rose by 33,000 last week, the largest increase in a year. Jobless
claims had fallen by 7,000 in the previous week.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Labor Department analysts stressed that the claims level is often
volatile during holiday periods and they cautioned against reading too much into
one week's movement in jobless claims.
</P>
<P>
	   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an 8-to-7 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 459.69 million shares, slightly behind
Wednesday's midday pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index fell 2.64 to 476.19.

<HEADLINE> Germans Recall some Soccer Jerseys  </HEADLINE>
    By HANS GREIMEL Associate Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Three major department store chains are yanking
yellow-and-black jerseys of one of Germany's most popular soccer teams after
reports that the Nike-made shirts are laced with a toxic chemical usually
reserved for anti-barnacle paint on ships.
</P>
<P>
	   The Kaufhof and Karstadt department stores stopped selling the $75 jerseys
for the northern German soccer club Borussia Dortmund Wednesday after the German
magazine "Plusminus," which commissioned a private lab to test various textiles,
reported the problem.
</P>
<P>
	   Tributyltin, or TBT, might seem a good additive for sports shirts in that it
is used to kill bacteria and quell the stench of excessive sweating. But British
and Dutch tests have shown the substance to cause mutations in marine snails and
the World Wildlife Fund is calling for its global ban.
</P>
<P>
	   At high levels in humans, it is believed to cause neurological problems,
damage the immune system and harm the liver, said Juergen Kundke, a scientist
with the German Institute for the Protection of Consumer Health.
</P>
<P>
	   "We don't know how much is in the shirts, so we can't analyze the risks," he
said. "We knew that the substance was still used in coatings for ships, but it
shouldn't be in textiles that people wear."
</P>
<P>
	   However, by Thursday afternoon, mega-chain Hertie had joined the recall and
Karstadt said it was also pulling other official team jerseys made by Nike as a
precaution, even though only the Borussia Dortmund shirts were tested.
</P>
<P>
	   A Nike spokeswoman in Germany, Susanne Walter, said the company was still
looking into the claims, but didn't say when the company was likely to have
results from its own inquiry.
</P>
<P>
	   "We didn't know anything about the existence of the substance in the jerseys
until Monday," she said. "We are taking the situation very, very seriously."
</P>
<P>
	   Kundke suggested that it may be too soon to jump to conclusions about the
toxicity of the shirts.
</P>
<P>
	   "From a strictly scientific standpoint, only one lab has analyzed the
textiles so far. So it would really need more testing to know more specifics,"
he said. "Right now, we don't know how high the levels are."
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Kundke said those who are worried should wash the shirts to rinse off
the TBT or wear the jersey with an undershirt to keep it from touching the body,
as the chemical is known to pass through skin.
</P>
<P>
	   Borussia Dortmund, one of the nation's most popular clubs and 1997 European
champion, doesn't seem too worried, though. The team plans to wear the jerseys
at a scrimmage Saturday, and club spokesman Josef Schneck noted that all of the
players tend to wear undershirts.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are taking the issue seriously," Schneck said. "But the team is not
overcome with panic."

<HEADLINE> Technology Shares Fall Again  </HEADLINE>
    By BRUCE MEYERSON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks fell for a third straight session today,
extending a new year's slide as investors cash in on 1999's phenomenal gains in
the 2000 tax year.
</P>
<P>
	   The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index was down 68.82 at 3,808.72 in midday
trading, pushing its three-day decline past 300 points, or about 8 percent below
the record high set on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the selling remained modest compared with Tuesday and early
Wednesday, before the market staged a partial recovery. Even prior to that
rebound, analysts had stressed that the losses were a small price to pay for the
Nasdaq's 50 percent gain of the past two months, or the 85 percent gain for all
of 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, rather than the fears of rising interest rates widely blamed for
the sudden downturn, the sheer size of 1999's gains may have been the driving
force behind the post New Year's drop, many analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   With such huge profits tucked away in stocks --especially technology and
Internet-related shares -- many investors were waiting to sell after Dec. 31 so
they could delay paying taxes on those gains until April 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   "A lot of the selling in the technology stocks was really tax-related, and
most of it has flushed through the system," said Richard A. Dickson, a technical
analyst at Scott &AMP; Stringfellow Inc. in Richmond, Va.
</P>
<P>
	   But, he added, "Does this mean we're heading straight up? I doubt it. I
don't think we can bring this straight up until there's a further wash out in
technology."
</P>
<P>
	   After tumbling a record 229 points on Tuesday, the Nasdaq composite fell
another 166 points in Wednesday's early trading before reversing course and
finishing the day just 24.15 points lower at 3,877.54.
</P>
<P>
	   While most experts agree that there's plenty of excess that can be wrung
from technology stocks, they also stand by the main premise behind 1999's stock
swell -- that even through most Internet companies continue to lose money, tech
and non-tech companies alike willl eventually prosper from the rapid spread of
electronic commerce into all types of business and everyday life.
</P>
<P>
	   That's why the main question Wednesday wasn't why, but how long and how far
stocks might drop before resuming the powerful rally of the past five years.
</P>
<P>
	   Notably, the selloff didn't stop Goldman Sachs on Tuesday from issuing a
list of stocks the investment firm expects to rise at least 35 percent this
year.
</P>
<P>
	   More than a third of the 85 names on that list had Internet-related themes.
Among them were America Online, the leading Web service, and Cisco Systems, the
biggest manufacturer of Internet equipment. Both companies saw their share
prices more than double last year, exceeding virtually every benchmark for
measuring a company's value.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Internet is the most important business phenomenon in our lifetime,"
said Byron Wien, the U.S. investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
"I still believe that, but many stock prices were suggesting a profit reality
that was pretty hard to achieve."
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, even as evidence continued to mount Wednesday that the Federal
Reserve may need to slow the economy again with higher interest rates to prevent
inflation, tech-stock proponents were undeterred.
</P>
<P>
	   "Clearly, December was a fantasy that could not be prolonged in light of the

<HEADLINE> Eleanor Roosevelt Explored by PBS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Eleanor Roosevelt could be the subject of a wonderful
documentary, filmmaker Sue Williams believed, because hers was "a wonderful
story."
</P>
<P>
	   From anguished childhood to an important but difficult marriage to her role
as a powerful woman on the U.S. and international stage, there was unending
drama in the life of what Williams calls America's preeminent first lady of the
century.
</P>
<P>
	   After six years of effort, Williams' fascination has resulted in "Eleanor
Roosevelt," a presentation of PBS' "The American Experience." The documentary,
narrated by Alfre Woodard, was directed and written by Williams and produced by
her and Kathryn Dietz.
</P>
<P>
	   The two-and-a-half-hour film airs 9 p.m. EST Monday, Jan. 10, on PBS
stations.
</P>
<P>
	   Relying on archival film and photos, historians and the memories of friends
and family, the documentary explores the personal and the political aspects of a
woman in whom the two were inextricably united, Williams said.
</P>
<P>
	   Images of Mrs. Roosevelt supporting her polio-stricken spouse, charming
American troops in the Pacific during World War II and helping craft a human
rights resolution for the infant United Nations show the sweep of her
experience.
</P>
<P>
	   The film opens with details of Mrs. Roosevelt's troubled early years. She
was born in 1884 to Anna Hall and Elliott Roosevelt, part of the Oyster Bay,
N.Y., clan of Roosevelts that included Theodore Roosevelt. Franklin D.
Roosevelt, Eleanor's future husband, was a member of the family's Hyde Park,
N.Y., branch and a distant cousin.
</P>
<P>
	   Eleanor's father doted on her but his attentions were undercut by
alcoholism.
</P>
<P>
	   Considered homely by her mother, who called her "Granny" and openly mused
about her child's unattractiveness and prospects, Eleanor was largely cut out of
her affections. Her mother's headaches gave her a rare chance to feel loved.
</P>
<P>
	   "The only way she could please her mother was to try to make her feel
better," said Williams. "You could argue her whole professional life was spent
trying to make people's lives better."
</P>
<P>
	   The death of her parents, her introduction to social activism, marriage to
the dashing Franklin and marital and family woes -- Eleanor's own childhood did
not prepare her to be a mother -- are detailed. So are the friendships, such as
the one with Lorena Hickock, that were rumored to be more than platonic.
</P>
<P>
	   Some Roosevelt family members are blase about the relationship with Hickock
and whether or not it was sexual, but not all, Williams said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think some people were very uncomfortable," the filmmaker said.
</P>
<P>
	   It was Mrs. Roosevelt's support of causes including civil rights that made
her politically controversial during her time -- and encouraged a decades-long
investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   "She was ahead of her time, and to be speaking the way she did for the
rights of African Americans in the '30s and '40s, especially during wartime,
must have just made people crazy," Williams said. "She made the people who were
comfortable very uncomfortable, as does anybody who is upsetting the status
quo."
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Roosevelt managed to keep her beliefs at the forefront, even when she
appeared in a television commercial for Good Luck margarine (the money going, in
part, to help her often financially troubled children), Williams said.
</P>
<P>
	   "She's sitting there with her cup of tea and talking about, 'If we really
wanted we could end poverty in the world.' Her political agenda is right there.
She's still trying to help people but at the same time she's making thousands of
dollars," Williams said.
</P>
<P>
	   That and other episodes indicate Mrs. Roosevelt's complexity, the filmmaker
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have enormous respect and affection for her because I think she overcame
great personal tragedy to become a real role model, someone who dedicated
herself to making other people's lives better. I don't think you could ever
question her motives. They were, I think, really sincere.
</P>
<P>
	   "And yet I wouldn't want to leave a totally goody-goody, holier-than-thou
picture of her. She loved politics. She was tough. She would fight really hard
for what she believed in. So she was a woman of great contradiction and, in some
ways, great emotional pathos.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a sad life, and it's a triumphant life."
</P>

	   DESK SET: "National Desk," billed by PBS as a provocative public affairs
series and one that has drawn fire for past programs, returns for its third
season with new programs on politics, education, immigration and urban life.
First up is "The Picking of the President: The Parties Are Over," Friday, Jan.
14 (check local listings), which traces the presidential nomination process from
the smoke-filled rooms of conventions past to today's open primary and asks if
the change has been for the better.

<HEADLINE> Northland Selling Juice Business  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WISCONSIN RAPIDS, Wis. (AP) -- Northland Cranberries Inc. has agreed to sell
its private label juice business, which makes cranberry blends under supermarket
store brand names.
</P>
<P>
	   The business is being sold to Cliffstar Corp. of Dunkirk, N.Y., for $32
million to $36 million, Northland chairman and chief executive John Swendrowski
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The final price of the sale will depend on the value of inventory when the
sale closes at the end of February, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Northland's private label business accounts for about $43 million of the
company's $237 million in annual revenue.
</P>
<P>
	   Northland's flagship products are its pure juice blends.

<P>
	   "This sale will allow us to focus entirely on building the Northland and
Seneca brands within the juice category," Swendrowski said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ocean Spray, a growers' cooperative based in Lakeville-Middleboro, Mass.,
holds about half of the U.S. cranberry juice market, compared to 12.6 percent
for Northland, based in Wisconsin Rapids.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Confidence Not Rattled  </HEADLINE>
    By DIRK BEVERIDGE AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HONG KONG (AP) -- The market was way down Thursday as a dozen men crowded
around a computer in the Wing Lung Bank, staring at stock prices as intently as
Las Vegas die-hards would watch the bars and cherries spin on a slot machine.
</P>
<P>
	   There were no jackpots to cheer for, as the blue chips got pounded by heavy
selling that pushed the Hang Seng Index down 4.4 percent following Wednesday's
precipitous dive of 7.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   But instead of panicking, many stock-crazy Hong Kong investors are trying to
guess when prices will bottom out so they can buy more.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it's overselling," said Frederick Wong, a bank clerk checking the
prices at a branch of BOCI Securities Ltd.
</P>
<P>
	   Hong Kong has been harder hit than any other major market since the world's
traders staged a sell-off that began Tuesday in New York. But analysts say
ordinary stock players are correct in thinking the current jolt -- while painful
-- isn't about to derail Hong Kong's recovery from recession.
</P>
<P>
	   The Hong Kong market just got too high, market professionals say, in rallies
fueled more by Internet hype than sound economics.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was way ahead of itself," said Vivian Kwok, chief stock analyst at
Sassoon Securities. She predicts more price volatility in the market but says
"Hong Kong's economy is on track."
</P>
<P>
	   The economy recently turned the corner and is growing again after a 15-month
recession.
</P>
<P>
	   Every time Hong Kong stocks go a bit wild, people congregate around
computers in the lobbies of local banks and brokerages, calling up prices every
few seconds to make sure they don't miss a thing. Hong Kong exists to make
money, and playing the stocks is a natural in a town where horse racing is the
main sport and the casinos of nearby Macau are a favored weekend haunt.
</P>
<P>
	   Many investors have been cursing out loud at the stock quotation screens,
but they aren't deterred.
</P>
<P>
	   Wong said he lost about 20,000 Hong Kong dollars ($2,560) over the past two
days. This after seeing the market set a record on Monday, the first trading day
of 2000. Will he sell out? Of course not.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm trying to wait and buy at the bottom," Wong said.
</P>
<P>
	   The volatile market has attracted some wildly differing price forecasts.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. investment bank Morgan Stanley Dean Witter raised eyebrows Thursday by
predicting the Hang Seng could tumble another 30 percent this year to 12,000
points. Rival Goldman Sachs quickly countered that the Hang Seng should set new
records -- all the way to 19,000.
</P>
<P>
	   But after Wednesday's slide, which saw the Hang Seng plunge from above
17,000 points to below 16,000 in just minutes -- only to be followed by a brief
dip below 15,000 points on Thursday -- who knows what to bet on next?
</P>
<P>
	   The Hang Seng finished Thursday at 15,153.23 after bouncing off late
afternoon lows that had it down as much as 6.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the small-time investors were packed in six deep in a lobby of
the Po Sang Bank, watching every price.
</P>
<P>
	   "Overall, I'm confident," said Dick Wong, a customs officer. "The economy is
getting better."

<HEADLINE> HUD Insuring Larger Mortgage Loans  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a move designed to boost the number of homeowners
around the nation, the government will begin insuring mortgage loans up to
nearly $220,000 in high-cost areas for single family homes.
</P>
<P>
	   Housing and Urban Development Secretary Andrew Cuomo said Thursday that on
Jan. 1, HUD began insuring mortgage loans for single-family homes ranging from
$121,296, in communities where housing costs are lower, to $219,849, in areas
with higher housing costs.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1999, the limits ranged from $115,200 to $208,800.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These higher loan limits will help create more homeowners, more home
constructions, more jobs and more economic growth,'' Cuomo said. ``They will
transform the American dream of homeownership into a reality for families across
the nation.''
</P>
<P>
	   The new loan limits are part of a regular annual adjustment HUD makes to
account for rising home prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Under federal law, the loan limits are indexed to the conforming loan limits
of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, federally chartered corporations that buy and
package mortgages.
</P>
<P>
	   HUD also raised the mortgage loan limits for Federal Housing Administration
insurance for two, three and four-family homes.
</P>
<P>
	   For two family units, the new limit in low cost areas is $155,232 ranging to
$281,358 in high cost areas. The limit had been $147,408 up to $267,177.
</P>
<P>
	   The new range for three-family units is from $187,632 in low cost areas to
$340,083 in more expensive neighborhoods. The limit had been $178,176 to
$322,944.
</P>
<P>
	   For four family units, the new limit range is $233,184 in less costly areas
to $422,646. The limit range had been $221,448 to $401,375.
</P>
<P>
	   The new limits are expected to help drive the nation's home ownership rate
past its current level of 67 percent of all households. More than 70 million
American families own their homes, more than any other time in the nation's
history, according to HUD officials.
</P>
<P>
	   The FHA, which does not make home loans directly but insures loans made by
private lenders, insured nearly 1.3 million home mortgages in 1999 at a value of
$124 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   One housing expert said that while the increase probably would not greatly
affect first time home buyers because they will purchase homes that fall under
the limit ceiling, the higher loan limit could help others.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It will have a marginal impact overall but every little bit helps. For
people on the margins of affording homes, it will be a windfall,'' said Robert
E. Litan, a former associate director of the Office of Management and Budget who
now works at the Brookings Institution, a political think tank.

<HEADLINE> Man Claims Frito-Lay Stole Can Idea  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A Utah inventor has filed suit claiming snack food
maker Frito-Lay Inc. stole his idea for a can shaped like a soda-pop container
that can dispense other food.
</P>
<P>
	   Mark Kirkland filed the suit late last month in U.S. District Court alleging
the PepsiCo Inc. division violated a patent he has been awarded by the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages.
</P>
<P>
	   Frito-Lay spokeswoman Lynn Markley on Wednesday said the company had not yet
seen the lawsuit and therefore could not comment on the case.
</P>
<P>
	   Frito-Lay, headquartered in Plano, Texas, last year sold more than $11
billion of snack foods such as Lay's potato chips, Doritos tortilla chips and
Cheetos cheese-flavored snacks.
</P>
<P>
	   Kirkland alleged in the suit that he filed for patent protection for this
new method of vending snack foods in 1993 and later approached Frito-Lay with
his idea in hopes of forming a joint venture.
</P>
<P>
	   Developing a can capable of dispensing food provides a way for a variety of
snacks to be sold in machines originally manufactured to sell only beverages.
</P>
<P>
	   "While his patent applications were pending, Frito-Lay had been
(independently) test marketing this exact idea," said Julie Morriss, Kirkland's
attorney.
</P>
<P>
	   Kirkland was awarded a patent on Dec. 28 and filed the suit the same day. He
lives in Sandy, Utah, and Frito-Lay has a manufacturing plant in Kearns.

<HEADLINE> GOP Plans Early Marriage Tax Vote  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Looking to spotlight a top Republican priority early in
this election year, House Speaker Dennis Hastert said today that the House's
first major vote of 2000 will be on easing the ``marriage tax penalty'' on
millions of couples.
</P>
<P>
	   Hastert, R-Ill., said the House would also vote quickly on tax breaks to
help families save for public and private school costs, and ``community
renewal'' tax cuts for businesses investing in low-income and rural areas.
</P>
<P>
	   He also said the GOP was working on a plan to erase the national debt, the
accumulated mountain of federal IOUs that now stands at $5.6 trillion. No
details of that plan were available.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is only the start of our agenda to make certain that we secure the
blessings of prosperity for our children into the next century, but I think it's
a good start,'' Hastert said in remarks prepared for a news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   Though GOP aides said the cost of the tax cuts was not yet available, they
said the reductions -- and their price tag -- would be similar to elements of
the tax package President Clinton vetoed last September. Together, the three tax
cuts the House will vote on had a 10-year cost of $125 billion in last year's
vetoed bill.
</P>
<P>
	   The cuts would be paid for from projected budget surpluses, a House aide
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Votes on the tax measures are expected before the spring, said the aide.
</P>
<P>
	   When Clinton vetoed the $792 billion, 10-year tax package last September, he
argued it would have devoured federal budget surpluses that should instead be
devoted to shoring up Medicare and other federal programs.
</P>
<P>
	   Many Republicans feel the three tax cuts Hastert described were among the
most popular elements of the vetoed tax measure. They hope that advancing them
as separate, smaller bills will draw more attention to the proposals themselves,
blunting Clinton's ability to focus the debate on their price tag.
</P>
<P>
	   The strategy will also align congressional Republicans with Texas Gov.
George W. Bush, the GOP's leading presidential contender. He has made reducing
the marriage penalty tax a major feature of his $483 billion, five-year tax cut.
</P>
<P>
	   The ``marriage penalty'' is the additional tax many two-income couples must
pay above what they would owe if they were single. To ease it, last year's GOP
tax bill would have gradually doubled the standard deduction, and increased the
amount of income subject to the lowest, 15 percent tax bracket for couples
filing jointly.
</P>
<P>
	   That bill would also have created 20 ``renewal communities,'' including four
in rural areas, where businesses could get tax breaks for creating jobs,
cleaning up former industrial sites and other actions.
</P>
<P>
	   It also would have raised to $2,000 the current $500-a-year limit on
families' contributions to education savings accounts. The money can be
withdrawn tax-free and used for public and private elementary and secondary
schools and colleges.
</P>
<P>
	   The economy has continued performing so well that budget analysts from both
political parties say they expect surplus projections from the Congressional
Budget Office and the White House, due in several weeks, to be hundreds of
billions of dollars bigger over the next decade than was expected last summer.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, both budget offices envisioned 10-year surpluses of $3 trillion,
two-thirds of which came from Social Security and was considered untouchable by
both parties for use for spending or tax cuts.

<HEADLINE> Hastert:Tax Relief Heads GOP Agenda  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tax relief for married couples and for parents saving for
education costs will be among the first legislative items lawmakers will take up
when they return later this month, House Speaker Dennis Hastert said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Hastert, R-Ill., said another early priority will be legislation he proposed
with President Clinton in November that would steer investments to America's
neediest communities. Congress reconvenes on Jan. 24.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We passed an ambitious tax relief package last year which the president
decided to veto,'' Hastert said after two days of House GOP leadership meetings
to discuss this year's agenda. ``This year we will continue to fight for tax
relief for working families.''
</P>
<P>
	   Provisions to address the education savings account and the extra tax burden
faced by some married couples who file jointly were both part of the $792
billion, 10-year tax package passed by Congress last year but vetoed by Clinton
as being excessively large.
</P>
<P>
	   Reducing the marriage penalty paid by millions of two-income couples would
have cost an estimated $119 billion, while raising tax-exempt contribution
limits to IRA-like education savings accounts and other steps to promote
education savings were estimated at $15 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The marriage penalty is the additional tax many two-income couples must pay
above what they would owe if they were single. To ease it, last year's GOP tax
bill would have gradually doubled the standard deduction, and increased the
amount of income subject to the lowest, 15 percent tax bracket for couples
filing jointly.
</P>
<P>
	   That tax bill also would have raised to $2,000 the current $500-a-year limit
on families' contributions to education savings accounts. The money can be
withdrawn tax-free and used for public and private elementary and secondary
schools and colleges.
</P>
<P>
	   The GOP outline of its goals for the election-year session came a day after
Clinton and Democratic leaders met at the White House and said they would push
legislation to shore up Social Security and to fix the nation's crumbling
schools.
</P>
<P>
	   The Democrats also said they would also seek to pass legislation unfinished
from last year, including gun restrictions, an increase in the minimum wage and
a patient's bill of rights.
</P>
<P>
	   Hastert said House Republicans also were working to formulate a plan to
retire the nation's debt in the near future. He said that in the past three
years, as perennial budget deficits have changed into surpluses, the government
has paid off more than $300 billion in public debt.
</P>
<P>
	   Vice President Al Gore, who is campaigning for the Democratic presidential
nomination, has said that one of his goals is to retire the national debt, now
at $5 trillion, by 2015.

<HEADLINE> IMF Successor To Be Named by Feb.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- International Monetary Fund chief Michel Camdessus plans
to step down as scheduled in mid-February and a successor is expected to be
named by then, a top IMF official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Frenchman has said he would leave by Feb. 16 after heading the
182-nation lending institution for a record 13 years.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is no reason to believe he is changing his plans," said Camdessus'
deputy, Stanley Fischer, an American.
</P>
<P>
	   "We haven't discussed what would happen if a successor hasn't been named,"
Fischer said when reporters asked if he would serve as interim managing director
while the search continues. "I notice that as deadlines get closer, they usually
promote action so I expect a successor will have been named by the time he
leaves."
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and finance ministers from the
other industrialized nations are expected to discuss a new IMF leader when they
meet this month in Japan.
</P>
<P>
	   Under an informal agreement made when the IMF and its sister institution,
the World Bank, were set up after World War II, the top IMF job goes to a
European while an American heads the bank.
</P>
<P>
	   Germany has been pushing the name of its deputy finance minister, Caio
Koch-Weser, a Brazilian born, 26-year veteran of the World Bank, but so far his
candidacy has drawn a lukewarm response in other European countries and the
United States.

<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today, with technology shares remaining
weak while blue chips advanced on the strength of old-fashioned cyclical
companies that rise with a growing economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Im midafternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was
up 158.22 at 11,280.87.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up
7.41 at 1,409.52, and the Nasdaq composite index was down 69.10 at 3,808.44.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology stocks continued to tumble as investors sold stocks to lock in
profits from last year's record-breaking rise. Some of the best performers of
1999 declined, with Yahoo! down 22 1/64 at 388 31/64, and Qualcomm off 9 at 147
7/16.
</P>
<P>
	   A three-day selloff in technology stocks, which has been exacerbated by
investors' desire to sell now and pay their capital-gains taxes in 2001, may
soon ebb, said Larry Rice, chief investment officer at Josephthal &AMP; Co. in New
York.
</P>
<P>
	   "These stocks will bounce back," he said. "There are too many people who are
still eager to buy. And these companies still hold great potential for making a
lot of money."
</P>
<P>
	   Still, fears of slowing profits for two high-tech firms depressed the sector
today. Personal computer maker Gateway warned late Wednesday its fourth-quarter
earnings would miss expectations due to a slowdown in sales. The company blamed
Year 2000 computer worries and component supply problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Gateway, which fell steeply in extended-hours trading Wednesday, bounced
back today and was up 6 5/16 to 60 5/16. But traders said the company's warning
contributed to weakness in other computer makers' share prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Dell dropped 1 15/16 to 48, and Apple fell 3 1/8 to 100 1/8.
</P>
<P>
	   Intel fell 3 1/16 to 80 9/16. Gateway blamed the semiconductor maker for
some of its supply problems.
</P>
<P>
	   MCI WorldCom was down 4 at 47 5/16 after influential Salomon Smith Barney
analyst Jack Grubman lowered his earnings and revenue estimates for fiscal year
2000. Grubman said the company's revenue is likely to grow 14.4 percent from
1999 to 2000, below his previous estimate of 15.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader market has been rattled this week by growing concerns that the
Federal Reserve will soon raise interest rates in an effort to stave off
inflation. The Fed raised rates three times in 1999, and is expected to resume
its course of action as early as Feb. 2.
</P>
<P>
	   As inflation fears have escalated, investors have shifted some money from
technology stocks to cyclical stocks, which depend upon economic growth.
Caterpillar rose 2 13/16 to 51 15/16 and Johnson &AMP; Johnson rose 3 9/16 to 93
5/16.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors are now awaiting Friday's monthly unemployment report from the
Labor Department, which contains data on wages and the number of jobs created.
Any sign of modest or slowing growth could prompt some new buying, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, the government said its weekly tally of new claims for unemployment
benefits rose by 33,000 last week, the largest increase in a year. Jobless
claims had fallen by 7,000 in the previous week.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Labor Department analysts stressed that the claims level is often
volatile during holiday periods and they cautioned against reading too much into
one week's movement in jobless claims.
</P>
<P>
	   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3-to-2 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 720.28 million shares, slightly ahead of
Wednesday's midday pace.

<HEADLINE> Retail Sales Exceed Expectations  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Even with all the hype about the Internet during the
holiday season, shoppers still piled into the nation's big retail chains and
spent more money than storeowners had expected.
</P>
<P>
	   Many bricks-and-mortar merchants reported Thursday that sales in December
were the strongest for the month since 1992 and they made it through Christmas
virtually unscathed by competition from their Web-only rivals.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was a great holiday season, and the Internet didn't take away many sales
from anybody," said Michael Niemira of Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd., which saw
its retail sales index of about 80 U.S. chains rise 6.6 percent in December,
above estimates of a 5.5 percent to 6 percent gain.
</P>
<P>
	   The last year has been very strong for the nation's merchants. With low
unemployment and big gains on Wall Street, Americans have been comfortable about
their financial well-being and eager to shop.
</P>
<P>
	   The buying binge clearly didn't stall out over Christmas. Consumers began
their holiday buying over Thanksgiving weekend, and kept the shopping spree
going well into the new year. In fact, the last week of December was one of the
strongest of the month.
</P>
<P>
	   Many chains said that sales were so good that they didn't have to slash
prices drastically to clear out inventory, as has been the case in some past
years. That will likely mean higher profits for those stores that sold more
goods at full price.
</P>
<P>
	   With the robust sales figures in hand, Wall Street analysts raised their
fourth-quarter earnings estimates for many retailers, including Wal-Mart,
Federated Department Stores and Tiffany.
</P>
<P>
	   "The markdowns this time around were much less than we saw a year ago.
That's great news for earnings," said Kurt Barnard, who runs the consulting firm
Barnard's Retail Trend Report in Upper Montclair, N.J.
</P>
<P>
	   The strong season for traditional retailers came even with the intense buzz
surrounding the Internet. Web merchants spent heavily on advertising that touted
the convenience of online shopping compared with the crowds at the mall during
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
	   But most Americans still choose to shop at bricks-and-mortar stores. A new
survey of about 500 people by Andersen Consulting found that 98 percent bought
at least some of their gifts at retail chains this Christmas.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, many merchants found great success of their own on the Internet
during the holidays. Some of fastest-growing Web sites -- including Gap.com, and
JCPenney.com -- were linked to physical stores.
</P>
<P>
	   "The traditional retailers are just starting to make their move on the
Internet, but still many people came to them because of their brand names,"
Barnard said.
</P>
<P>
	   The big winners last month were the discount chains, including Wal-Mart and
Target. Not only did shoppers buy toys, electronics and Christmas decorations at
their stores, but they also stocked up on water, flashlights and batteries in
preparation of any problems that could have come with Y2K.
</P>
<P>
	   It was also a big season for jewelry stores, including Tiffany and Zale
which had indulgent consumers snapping up expensive rings and earrings.
Electronics chains, such as Best Buy and Circuit City, saw brisk sales on DVD
players, digital cameras and other gadgets.
</P>
<P>
	   Stores specializing in clothing were hurt by warmer-than-normal weather at
the start of December, but most -- such as the Gap and Limited -- managed to win
back shoppers once temperatures turned cooler at mid-month.
</P>
<P>
	   While the season overall was strong, there were some weak spots.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pokemon craze couldn't help two of the nation's biggest toy stores. Toys
R Us reported disappointing sales, due in part to the fact that it ran out of
some popular electronic toys and video games. Consolidated Stores' K-B Toys
chain also struggled with weak sales.
</P>
<P>
	   Moderately priced department store chain J.C. Penney faced another tough
month, with its sales just rising slightly. Women's clothing chain Ann Taylor
also only had a tiny gain last month.

<HEADLINE> Census Seeks Head Count Workers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Uncle Sam wants you!
</P>
<P>
	   The Census Bureau launched an effort Thursday to hire a half-million
part-time workers to conduct the national head count.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our goal is to have a pool of local people who are familiar with their
communities and committed to a successful count in their own neighborhoods,''
Census Director Kenneth Prewitt said at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
	   His agency has 520 offices open across the country with each needing to hire
800 to 1,000 people for four to six weeks around census day, April 1. He said
the agency will spend $9.5 million on help-wanted advertising.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall, the census is on schedule, Prewitt said, with 150,000 people hired
so far and a pool of about 1 million applicants. He said the agency wants an
overall pool of about 3 million to choose from.
</P>
<P>
	   Those hired so far include about 6,000 welfare-to-work applicants, he said.
And special exemptions have been granted so Social Security and public
assistance recipients can take Census jobs without losing benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   Legal residents aged 18 and older are eligible to work for the Census
Bureau. They do not need to be citizens, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In many areas the agency is seeking bilingual workers. Pay varies from $8.25
to $18.50 per hour.
</P>
<P>
	   Prewitt urged anyone interested in a Census job to call the agency's
toll-free number, 1-888-325-7733.
</P>
<P>
	   Prewitt said other aspects of the effort are also on schedule, including:
</P>
<P>
	   --The first local counts will get underway in two weeks in rural parts of
Alaska.
</P>
<P>
	   --Printing is ahead of schedule with all 123 million long forms finished and
the work about 75 percent complete on the short forms.
</P>
<P>
	   --The agency has verified 20 million rural addresses, adding 10,000 new
ones, and is now sending the 100 million city addresses to local governments for
verification.
</P>
<P>
	   --Advertising campaigns are beginning and will increase leading up to census
day, in an effort to improve on the 65 percent of households that returned forms
by mail in 1990.
</P>
<P>
	   --The agency has obtained 4.5 million square feet of office space, 17,000
telephones, 100,000 pieces of furniture and thousands of pieces of office
equipment.
</P>
<P>
	   Prewitt said about two-thirds of the workers hired so far are women, many
seeking a second part-time job. And he noted that the majority of people who
worked for the agency in dress rehearsals are coming back for the final count.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall there are about 860,000 jobs to be filled, but not all at the same
time, so Prewitt said the agency expects many people will do more than one of
them.
</P>
<P>
	   The effort to count the estimated 274 million people in the United States is
a decade-long effort, Prewitt stressed, noting that planning for the 2010 count
is already underway.
</P>
<P>
	   He warned that ``the conditions that make it difficult to count this country
completely have magnified since 1990,'' including the presence of more
immigrants, a larger non-English speaking population, a more mobile population,
more total households and more irregular living arrangements.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We believe we can do a basic enumeration better than we did in 1990,'' he
said, but that does not necessarily mean a more accurate census.
</P>
<P>
	   Prewitt said he expects there will still be an undercount, in particular
among minorities, and the agency will need to do a post-census quality check to
measure that undercount and correct it in the overall totals.

<HEADLINE> Mortgage Rates Up in Latest Week  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mortgage rates started off 2000 by hitting their highest
levels since last August amid fears that the Federal Reserve will boost interest
rates higher next month.
</P>
<P>
	   The average interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages climbed to 8.15
percent for the week ending Jan. 7, up from 8.06 percent last week, according to
a weekly survey released Thursday by Freddie Mac, the mortgage company.
</P>
<P>
	   Before last August, the last time mortgage rates were this high was on April
18, 1997, when they reached 8.16 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Fifteen-year mortgages, a popular option for refinancing, also were up this
week with an average rate of 7.73 percent this week, up from the average rate of
7.66 percent last week.
</P>
<P>
	   On one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an average
initial rate of 6.60 percent this week, up from 6.56 percent the previous week.
</P>
<P>
	   The rates do not include add-on fees known as points, which averaged at or
just over 1 percent of the loan amount for all three types of mortgages.
</P>
<P>
	   "Fear that the Federal Reserve will substantially raise rates at its next
meeting in February has caused interest rates to rise for the eighth consecutive
week," said Robert Van Order, Freddie Mac's chief economist.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed boosted interest rates three times last year to slow the economy and
keep inflation under control.

<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Apparently, the attraction wasn't fatal.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones are getting married.
</P>
<P>
	   Douglas, 55, proposed to the 30-year-old Welsh actress on New Year's Eve at
his home in Aspen, Colo.
</P>
<P>
	   "While no date has been set, they plan to wed later this year. He's now
given her a ring," said Allen Burry, Douglas' publicist. Added Todd Adair, who
represents Ms. Zeta-Jones: "She's ecstatic, thrilled and very, very happy."
</P>
<P>
	   The couple at the Deauville Film Festival in France in August 1998 and have
been dating since last March.
</P>
<P>

Haunting" and "Entrapment," said she was in no hurry to marry the star of "Fatal
Attraction" and "Basic Instinct."

<HEADLINE> 'Satisfaction' Said Rock's Best  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Every air guitarist knows the riff -- da, da, da-da-da,
da-da-da -- and anyone who has ever been a teen-ager can relate to the lyrics.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rolling Stones' "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction" topped the list of the
100 greatest rock songs in a VH1 poll of 700 people in the music industry.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1965 song about rock's favorite subject -- sex -- has one of the most
recognizable guitar riffs in music. Keith Richards said it came to him one night
while he was sleeping.
</P>
<P>
	   "It kind of sticks up as an anthem for the time it was released and for
every generation that came since," Todd Schwartz, VH1 programming director, said
after the list was released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Beatles had nine songs on the list, easily the most. But their best,
"Hey Jude," came in at only No. 9.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Beatles had so many songs that the vote got divided," Schwartz said.
</P>
<P>
	   Madonna, Fleetwood Mac, Neil Young, U2 and R.E.M. were shut out of the Top
100 for the same reason: Voters couldn't decide on one song.
</P>
<P>
	   Aretha Franklin's "Respect" came in second and Led Zeppelin's "Stairway to
Heaven," a staple of FM radio in the 1970s, was third.
</P>
<P>
	   Rounding out the top 10 are "Like a Rolling Stone" by Bob Dylan; "Born to
Run" by Bruce Springsteen; "Hotel California" by the Eagles; "Light My Fire" by
the Doors; "Good Vibrations" by the Beach Boys; "Hey Jude"; and "Imagine" by
John Lennon.
</P>
<P>
	   Five Stones cuts made it, with four each by Elvis Presley and Led Zeppelin.
Bob Dylan had three plus his composition "All Along the Watchtower," but voters
liked Jimi Hendrix's version better.
</P>
<P>
	   The list's oldest song was "Rock Around the Clock" by Bill Haley &AMP; His
Comets, released in 1955. The newest was Nirvana's "Smells Like Teen Spirit,"
from 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   Nirvana's hit was the only one from the 1990s to make it. Schwartz said it
may be because VH1's voters were even older than the network's usual audience.
VH1 aims at age 30 and up.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the musicians to vote on VH1's panel were U2's Bono, Johnny Cash, Art
Garfunkel, Bonnie Raitt, Lou Reed and the late Curtis Mayfield.
</P>
<P>
	   VH1 will count down the list in a special that runs over five nights,
starting Jan. 17, featuring video clips and interviews.

<HEADLINE> Bono: Forgive Third World Debt  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    PARIS (AP) -- Ballad writer Bono has turned his pen to editorials.
</P>
<P>
	   Opining in Thursday's edition of the French daily Le Monde, the lead singer
of the Irish rock group U2 urged France to forgive billions of dollars owed by
Third World.
</P>
<P>
	   "The moment has come for France to take center stage. It can completely
erase $11.5 billion of debt owed by the world's poorest countries," Bono wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   Bono has also urged the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and
other individual countries to write off poor country debt, adding his voice to
those of Pope John Paul II and the Dalai Lama.
</P>
<P>
	   "Debt relief will change the lives of a billion people, the poorest of the
poor, who live on less than a dollar a day," he wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   The Center for International Development at Harvard University says 700
million poverty-stricken people live in countries so burdened with foreign debt
they cannot address citizens' health and social needs.

<HEADLINE> Professors: Glass Ceiling in Place  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    STANFORD, Calif. (AP) -- Women may be moving up to corporate boards and
chief executive offices, but a national study concludes that at the dawn of the
new century, the glass ceiling is still firmly in place.
</P>
<P>
	   Women make up just 10 percent of senior managers in Fortune 500 companies,
according to a Harvard Business Review article published this week, because
barriers to promotion remain widespread.
</P>
<P>
	   In "A Modest Manifesto for Shattering the Glass Ceiling," authors Debra
Meyerson and Joyce Fletcher said that the way to end workplace discrimination is
to stop trying for a revolution.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead the women, who are both business professors, suggested a strategy of
what they call "small wins" -- a series of incremental changes aimed at the
subtle discriminatory forces still at work in organizations.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not the ceiling that's holding women back; it's the whole structure of
the organizations in which we work: the foundation, the beams, the walls, the
very air," said Ms. Meyerson. She spoke from her office at Stanford University,
where she is a visiting professor at the Center for Work, Technology and
Organization in the School of Engineering.
</P>
<P>
	   Specific changes could include scheduling longer job interviews to give job
seekers a better chance to explain their strengths and abilities, or devising
new ways to let employees get credit for "invisible work" -- tasks that are
necessary but rarely noticed.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Meyerson said that because each organization is unique, its expressions
of gender inequity are as well.
</P>
<P>
	   She and Ms. Fletcher said that a small-wins system must be driven by men and
women together, because both benefit from a world where gender is irrelevant to
the way work is designed and distributed.
</P>
<P>
	   Ellen Hancock, president and chief executive of Exodus Communications, a
leading Internet host for businesses, said that "there is a real problem when
there are so few women running the top 500 companies in the U.S."
</P>
<P>
	   She urged women "to make sure that the corporate culture of their company
supports them," adding: "If not, they should move."
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Hancock also said that women have to position themselves where they'll
be seen.
</P>
<P>
	   "They have to make sure that they are in significant line positions," she
said. "They are often overlooked because they are in a staff role."
</P>
<P>
	   A study published in November by the Catalyst group found that some 11.9
percent of the 11,681 corporate officers in America's top 500 firms were women,
up from 8.7 percent five years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   But the New York-based women's advocacy group also found that women are most
likely to be in "staff" jobs such as human relations and public relations and
not in "line" jobs. It is from line officer positions -- those who run the
factories, head the sales staffs and supervise the accounting -- that promotions
to senior management tend to come, the group said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hewlett-Packard Co. chief executive Carly Fiorina, who garnered national
attention when she was appointed in July, has said that she believes
"competitive industries don't have any time for glass ceilings."
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Fiorina said that while some people said discouraging things to her, she
personally never believed them and didn't let them get her down.
</P>
<P>
	   Her advice: "Believe in yourself and invest in yourself and ignore the
naysayers."
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Fletcher, a professor of management at Harvard's Simmons Graduate School
of Management in Boston, Mass., argues that it takes more than personal
confidence.
</P>
<P>
	   "Yes, the times are changing. Yes, Carly Fiorina made it through. But when
you look at the patterns you see that gender bias is still widespread," she
said.

    PARIS (AP) -- British actress Jane Seymour, TV's "Dr. Quinn, Medicine

<HEADLINE> Women's Group To Honor 3 Companies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- A New York-based women's advocacy group said Thursday that
three American companies will be honored for programs that advance women --
Charles Schwab &AMP; Co., IBM Corp. and Northern Trust Co.
</P>
<P>
	   Catalyst said in a statement that its annual awards will be presented to the
firms in a ceremony March 21 at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   Charles Schwab &AMP; Co., the principal operating subsidiary of The Charles
Schwab Corp. based in San Francisco, is being honored for a quarter of a century
of efforts to hire and promote women, Catalyst said. It said that at Schwab,
women make up 36 percent of corporate officers.
</P>
<P>
	   The group cited IBM for its global women leaders development task force. It
said women now make up 20 percent of IBM's North American executives, up from 14
percent in 1995. IBM is based in Armonk, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
	   Northern Trust Co., the flagship of Northern Trust Corp. of Chicago,
specializes in banking, investment and trust services. Catalyst said its
"diversity at work" program has resulted in women representing 49 percent of the
company's officers, up from 39 percent a decade ago. It said that nearly a
quarter of the women were from minority groups.
</P>
<P>
	   Catalyst has presented the awards since 1987. The nonprofit research group
also produces several surveys a year on women executives and advises businesses
on women's issues.

its history.

	   Sales of New Homes Fall 7.1 Pct.
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sales of new homes fell 7.1 percent in
November, the biggest decline in two years, responding to higher
mortgage rates. The drop in single-family sales followed a big 9
percent October increase. Even with the setback, the Commerce
Department reported today, homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 865,000 units in November. Economists had been
predicting a slowdown since June, when the Federal Reserve started
pushing interest rates higher in an effort to dampen such
interest-sensitive sectors of the economy as housing.

	   Jobless Claims Jump by 33,000
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of Americans filing new claims for
unemployment benefits rose by 33,000 last week, the largest
increase in a year, the government reported today. The Labor
Department said the number of new applications for jobless benefits
climbed to 309,000 for the week ending Saturday, the first time
this figure has been above the 300,000-level in 13 weeks. Jobless
claims had fallen by 7,000 in the previous week. But Labor
Department analysts stressed that the claims level is often
volatile during holiday periods and they cautioned against reading
too much into one week's movement in jobless claims.

	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Even with all the hype about the Internet during

Many brick-and-mortar merchants reported Thursday that sales in
December were the strongest for the month since 1992 and they made
it through Christmas virtually unscathed by competition from their
Web-only rivals. ``It was a great holiday season, and the Internet
didn't take away many sales from anybody,'' said Michael Niemira of
Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd., which saw its retail sales index of
about 80 U.S. chains rise 6.6 percent in December, above estimates
of a 5.5 percent to 6 percent gain.

<HEADLINE> Nike Examines Jerseys for Toxins  </HEADLINE>
    By TONY CZUCZKA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERLIN (AP) -- Nike said Thursday it is investigating allegations that its
jerseys for a popular German soccer club are laced with a toxic antibacterial
chemical.
</P>
<P>
	   German department stores didn't wait for the results. They pulled the shirts
off their shelves.
</P>
<P>
	   The action followed a German television report that the yellow-and-black
jerseys contained tributyltin, or TBT, a heavy metal compound used in
anti-barnacle paint for ships.
</P>
<P>
	   Also used to kill bacteria and quell the smell of sweat, TBT would seem an
ideal additive for sports shirts. But British and Dutch tests have shown the
substance can cause mutations in marine snails, and the World Wildlife Fund is
calling for it to be banned.
</P>
<P>
	   Three German department store chains yanked the shirts as a precaution, and
the club whose jerseys were tested said it had suspended their sale at its
official fan store.
</P>
<P>
	   At high levels in humans, TBT is believed to cause neurological problems,
damage the immune system and harm the liver, said Juergen Kundke, a scientist
with a German institute for consumer health.
</P>
<P>
	   "We don't know how much is in the shirts, so we can't analyze the risks," he
said. "We knew that the substance was still used in coatings for ships, but it
shouldn't be in textiles that people wear."
</P>
<P>
	   Nike's world headquarters in Beaverton, Ore., pledged a quick probe to
determine whether any of its products contain the substance.

	   "We're doing independent tests on our end to ensure there is no risk to the
public," spokesman Vada Manager said. "We're obviously going to take the step of
checking on products sold in Germany, but we will check worldwide as well."
</P>
<P>
	   He added: "As of right now there's no legitimate reason to believe there's
any risk."
</P>
<P>
	   German public television's consumer show Plusminus said a private lab it
commissioned to test clothing items found TBT and similar compounds in the Nike
jerseys and several other products. The items were chosen at random in German
stores, according to the TV report. It provided no figures on the TBT levels.
</P>
<P>
	   The soccer jerseys caused the biggest storm because the club, 1997 European
champion Borussia Dortmund, has a big national following.
</P>
<P>
	   Six other first-division clubs that use Nike jerseys said Thursday they were
asking the company's German headquarters to confirm their equipment was safe.
</P>
<P>
	   Kaufhof and Karstadt department stores stopped selling the $75 Dortmund
jerseys Wednesday. By Thursday, the Hertie chain joined in, and Karstadt said it
also was pulling other official team jerseys made by Nike as a precaution.
</P>
<P>
	   Kundke said it was too early to conclude the shirts are a health hazard, but
he advised worried owners to wash the jerseys or wear them with an undershirt.
</P>
<P>
	   Borussia Dortmund didn't seem too worried, though. While fan jersey sales
were stopped for now, the team plans to wear its regular outfit at an exhibition
match Saturday, club spokesman Josef Schneck said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are taking the issue seriously," he said. "But the team is not overcome
with panic."

<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today, with technology shares remaining
weak while blue chips advanced on the strength of old-fashioned cyclical
companies that rise with a growing economy.
</P>
<P>
	   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 174.98 at 11,297.63. About 45 points of the gain came
from 3M, the maker of Post-It notes and Scotch tape, which soared 9 1/8 to 102
3/8.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up
4.96 at 1,407.07, and the Nasdaq composite index was down 111.69 at 3,765.85.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology stocks continued to tumble as investors sold stocks to lock in
profits from last year's record-breaking rise. Yahoo! dropped 33 9/16 at 376
15/16, and Qualcomm fell 13 3/16 at 143 1/4.
</P>
<P>
	   A three-day selloff in technology stocks, which has been exacerbated by
investors' desire to sell now and pay their capital-gains taxes in 2001, may
soon ebb, said Larry Rice, chief investment officer at Josephthal &AMP; Co. in New
York.
</P>
<P>
	   "These stocks will bounce back," he said. "There are too many people who are
still eager to buy. And these companies still hold great potential for making a
lot of money."
</P>
<P>
	   Still, fears of slowing profits for two high-tech firms depressed the sector
today. Personal computer maker Gateway warned late Wednesday its fourth-quarter
earnings would miss expectations due to a slowdown in sales. The company blamed
Year 2000 computer worries and component supply problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Gateway, which fell steeply in extended-hours trading Wednesday, bounced
back today and was up 4 9/16 to 59 9/16. But traders said the company's warning
contributed to weakness in other computer makers' share prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Dell dropped 11/16 to 47 13/16, and Apple fell 4 1/2 to 98 3/4.
</P>
<P>
	   Intel fell 1 7/8 to 80 1/8. Gateway blamed the semiconductor maker for some
of its supply problems.
</P>
<P>
	   MCI WorldCom was down 4 3/16 at 47 1/8 after influential Salomon Smith
Barney analyst Jack Grubman lowered his earnings and revenue estimates for
fiscal year 2000. Grubman said the company's revenue is likely to grow 14.4
percent from 1999 to 2000, below his previous estimate of 15.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader market has been rattled this week by growing concerns that the
Federal Reserve will soon raise interest rates in an effort to stave off
inflation. The Fed raised rates three times in 1999, and is expected to resume
its course of action as early as Feb. 2.
</P>
<P>
	   As inflation fears have escalated, investors have shifted some money from
technology stocks to cyclical stocks, which depend upon economic growth.
Caterpillar rose 2 5/8 to 51 3/4 and Johnson &AMP; Johnson rose 3 1/8 to 92 7/8.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors are now awaiting Friday's monthly unemployment report from the
Labor Department, which contains data on wages and the number of jobs created.
Any sign of modest or slowing growth could prompt some new buying, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, the government said its weekly tally of new claims for unemployment
benefits rose by 33,000 last week, the largest increase in a year. Jobless
claims had fallen by 7,000 in the previous week.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Labor Department analysts stressed that the claims level is often
volatile during holiday periods and they cautioned against reading too much into
one week's movement in jobless claims.
</P>
<P>
	   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3-to-2 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 867.00 million shares, slightly ahead of
Wednesday's late pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index fell 1.98 to 476.85.

<HEADLINE> Military Housing Raise Proposed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's 2001 budget will include $160 million
to reduce the amount that military members pay for off-base housing, and he will
propose to Congress that such housing be provided cost-free within five years,
Defense Secretary William Cohen announced today.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is real money going into your pockets,'' Cohen said in unveiling the
proposal during an address to troops at Camp Pendleton, Calif., a major Marine
Corps base north of San Diego.
</P>
<P>
	   Under a 1997 law, military members who live off base are required to pay 15
percent of their housing costs, with the government picking up the difference.
Cohen said that currently, on average, military members pay about 18 percent.
Under Clinton's budget proposal, that would be reduced to 15 percent in 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   Within five years, Cohen said, the government would pay the entire cost of
such housing, just as it does now for those who live on base. That will cost the
government about $3 billion over the next five years, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
	   Many service members choose to live off base because, in the Defense
Department's reckoning, about 200,000 of its 300,000 housing units are
substandard and in need of repair or replacement.
</P>
<P>
	   The housing initiative is part of an effort to make military service more
desirable at a time when the Pentagon is having trouble keeping people in
uniform and attracting new recruits.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen has said in several recent appearances with U.S. troops abroad that
housing allowances should go up. During a stop in Naples, Italy, on Dec. 21,
Cohen told sailors and Marines that he was determined to improve housing and
health care for troops during his final year as Pentagon chief in the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are going to do our level best to make sure you and your family have
the best we can provide,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
	   As more bases have closed in recent years, military members have
consolidated at a smaller number of locations -- in many cases finding
themselves in more expensive off-base real estate markets.
</P>
<P>
	   Increasing allowances for those who live off base is one of several aspects
of Cohen's plan to improve housing. The others are using military construction
funds to repair or replace some of the 200,000 military housing units judged to
be substandard, and using private contractors to build more on-base housing.
</P>
<P>
	   Late last year the Army signed a 50-year, $3 billion contract with Carson
Family Housing of Charlotte, N.C., to privatize family housing at Fort Carson,
Colo. The privatization approach is meant to achieve housing improvements more
quickly than through the traditional use of government construction funds.
</P>
<P>
	   Housing and other living costs are among the most important issues to
service members, many of whom are leaving to take more lucrative jobs in the
private economy. Cohen wants to provide more financial incentives to keep people
in uniform longer.
</P>
<P>
	   This year's budget gave military members a 4.8 percent across-the-board pay
raise, the largest since 1981. Congress also made a one-time adjustment to the
Pentagon's pay scales, so that about 75 percent of all service members will
receive extra pay raises on July 1 ranging up to an additional 5.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> FBI: New Year's Threats Not Unusual  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite fears of terrorism over the New Year's weekend,
the number of investigations the FBI opened into computer crimes and physical
threats or violence was not unusual for any seven-day period, a senior FBI
official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The FBI opened six investigations of computer crimes and 12 investigations
into physical threats or violence nationwide from Dec. 29 through Jan. 5, said
Mike Vatis, head of the FBI's National Infrastructure Protection Center.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The level was not beyond the norm you would usually see in that number of
days,'' Vatis said. ``On neither side -- cybercrime or physical threats -- did
we think the weekend activity was particularly unusual.''
</P>
<P>
	   Vatis said some new computer viruses were found but there were no
significant millennium-related attacks during the seven days his office operated
a command post inside the FBI's Strategic Information and Operations Center in
Washington. He also said there was no increase in attacks from overseas.
</P>
<P>
	   All the investigations remain open, but any threats from people involved
have been neutralized, Vatis said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said three of the six computer crime investigations were opened in
response to reports from private companies that had downloaded special detection
software Vatis' office posted Dec. 30 on its Internet Web page. Using the FBI's
software, three private companies found hacker tools hidden on their computer
systems.
</P>
<P>
	   The software has been downloaded by more than 2,600 companies and
individuals.
</P>
<P>
	   Vatis said the computer investigations involved hacker attacks using what
are known as ``distributed denial of service'' tools. In such cases, hackers
hide tools, known as daemons, inside large computer systems, like those at
universities. The hackers later issue commands from their own computer to order
each of hundreds of daemons to attack a target computer system through various
portals. These multiple attacks can cause the target system to crash or become
so overloaded it cannot function.
</P>
<P>
	   FBI field offices, each of which also maintained a command post over the New
Year's weekend, opened a dozen investigations of physical destruction or threats
of it.
</P>
<P>
	   Vatis would not discuss details of any of the investigations but his office
is responsible for protecting computer systems, like the banking system, and
physical infrastructure, like power and telephone lines, transportation routes
and water systems, from either electronic or physical attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   In Bend, Ore., an 80-foot powerline tower carrying high-voltage electricity
from the Pacific Northwest to the Southwest was toppled Dec 30. But David Szady,
head of the FBI's Portland office, said no explosive was used. ``The cause has
been determined and has been reported as an act of malicious mischief,'' Szady
said.
</P>
<P>
	   A conservative group criticized the FBI for warning state and local police
officials to be on the lookout for violent white supremacists, apocalyptic
cults, radical lone wolf members of private citizen militias and other groups
that promote violent millennial agendas.
</P>
<P>
	   This effort, named Project Megiddo, ``did nothing to prevent terrorism,''
said Lisa Dean of the Free Congress Foundation. Because many of the cults
mentioned by the FBI ``believe, according to Scripture, that this world will
someday end and Jesus Christ will come again, the FBI used the Y2K situation to
confuse the Religious Right, who also share those beliefs, with those religious
cults whom they consider dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
	   Asked whether the Megiddo report exaggerated the potential for millennial
violence, Attorney General Janet Reno said Thursday, ``The nice answer would be
that there was no threat.''
</P>
<P>
	   But she added that authorities must ``take reasonable precautions'' and
advise Americans of risks whenever possible. ``I think we described the
heightened risk that revolved around the time of the end of the millennium,''
she said.

    NEW YORK (AP) -- Apparently, the attraction wasn't fatal.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones are getting married.
</P>
<P>
	   Douglas, 55, proposed to the 30-year-old Welsh actress on New Year's Eve at
his home in Aspen, Colo.
</P>
<P>
	   "While no date has been set, they plan to wed later this year. He's now
given her a ring," said Allen Burry, Douglas' publicist. Added Todd Adair, who
represents Ms. Zeta-Jones: "She's ecstatic, thrilled and very, very happy."
</P>
<P>
	   The couple met at the Deauville Film Festival in France in August 1998 and
have been dating since last March.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Nazi Victims, Austria Banks Settle  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- A federal judge approved a $40 million settlement Thursday
between an estimated 1,000 Holocaust victims or their heirs and two Austrian
banks accused of confiscating their assets.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Shirley Wohl Kram said that the settlement is fair and
adequate and that the alternative is years of litigation so drawn-out that many
of the victims would be dead before they saw any payout.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is an historic event" said Gerhard Randa, chairman and chief executive
of Bank Austria. He said it marks "the first time that any of the
Holocaust-related claims cases has reached a concluded settlement."
</P>
<P>
	   "We sincerely hope that the victims of the Nazi regime who are the
beneficiaries of this settlement may find a measure of solace in this tangible
acknowledgment of moral responsibility for the terrible events they suffered
more than a half century ago," Randa added.
</P>
<P>
	   It will at least several months before any payments go out. The two sides
have to wait to see whether the judge's approval is challenged on appeal, and
they also have to evaluate each of the victims' claims.
</P>
<P>
	   The amount each of the victims will get depends on how much was lost and how
well they can prove their case.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers estimate there are about 1,000 valid claims from victims or their
heirs.
</P>
<P>
	   The corporate predecessors of the two banks, Bank Austria and Creditanstalt,
were accused of confiscating Holocaust victims' assets and refusing to turn them
over to those who survived the war.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge noted that the claims are based on acts that occurred more than 50
years ago in wartime Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   "Many of the records were either lost or destroyed during or after the war,"
the judge wrote. "Litigating this case without these documents and records would
undoubtedly add to the complexity of this already difficult case."
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the survivors and heirs are old and would not receive any money
before their death if not for a settlement, the judge said.
</P>
<P>
	   Others eligible to share in the settlement include those whose assets were
looted elsewhere by the Nazis and transferred to those banks and those whose
money transfers to concentration camp inmates through the banks were diverted.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, the judge said: "Those persecuted by the Nazis were the
victims of unspeakable acts of inhumanity. It is unlikely that any sum of money,
no matter how large, could ever be thought of as righting the wrongs committed
during the Holocaust."
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement, the banks said they "unreservedly accept moral
responsibility" for the activities of the banks or their predecessors during the
Holocaust. They said they "express their profound regret" for their actions and
are committed to opening their archives to provide a greater understanding of
the period.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, notice of the settlement has been mailed directly to 27,883 current
or former Austrian citizens in 68 countries determined to be victims of Nazi
persecution. Also, notice of the deal was published in newspapers in countries
with large populations of World War II survivors, and information was also
posted on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   Only 72 people have requested exclusion from the settlement.

<HEADLINE> Talks With N. Korea To Resume  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Talks between U.S. and North Korean officials will resume
in Berlin this month, the Clinton administration announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   A previous round of talks adjourned last November 19.
</P>
<P>
	   The State Department, in a statement, said that a U.S. delegation led by
U.S. envoy Charles Kartman would meet with a North Korean delegation headed by
Vice Foreign Minister Kim Gye Gwan.
</P>
<P>
	   On the agenda are preparations for a visit to the United States by a
high-level North Korean official, said the announcement by State Department
spokesman James Rubin.
</P>
<P>
	   The discussions have dealt with ways to improve relations and with North
Korea's missile program.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration has said that North Korea's agreement in September not to
test a long-range ballistic missile was expected to lead to a visit by a senior
Pyongyang official.
</P>
<P>
	   However, a senior North Korean diplomat earlier this week cast uncertainty
on such a visit.
</P>
<P>
	   Chu Chang Jun, North Korea's ambassador to China, told a news conference in
Beijing that North Korea had been prepared to send senior officials to the
United States until Washington committed ``acts of betrayal against our
country.''
</P>
<P>
	   He did not elaborate, and U.S. officials proceeded with plans for the next
round of talks in Berlin -- and for visit to the United States by a high-level
official from the communist regime.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We look forward to hosting a high-level visit at the earliest
opportunity,'' another State Department spokesman, James Foley, said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
	   He said it was up to North Korea to designate which official would come.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will continue to work on preparations for such a visit when our
bilateral talks resume'' in Berlin, Foley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Separately, White House National Security Adviser Sandy Berger said the
administration puts a high priority on the talks because it remains concerned
about North Korea's missile program.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want to pursue that very actively,'' he said in an address to the
National Press Club. ``North Korea has a choice. It can either pursue more
normal relations ... or it can continue with its threatening nuclear and missile
programs and continue to be isolated and continue to be contained by the rest of
the world.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're prepared to go down either path,'' Berger said.

<HEADLINE> Tourist Killers Sought in Namibia  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BY JOHN GROBLER Associated Press Writer
</P>
<P>
	   WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) -- Namibian security forces have crossed into
neighboring Angola in their efforts to capture the suspected killers of two
French girls and their brother, state radio said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   France, meanwhile, has decided to conduct its own inquiry into the ambush of
the Bidoin family, which occurred Monday evening as they drove through a
conflict zone.
</P>
<P>
	   Uniformed gunmen are accused of executing the three Bidoin siblings after
the attack that left their parents wounded. Autopsies were conducted Thursday on
the bodies of Aurelie, 15, Cecile, 10, and their 18-year-old brother Michael.
The results were not immediately released.
</P>
<P>
	   The assailants' tracks led from the remote Caprivi Strip, where the attack
occurred, into Angola, the Namibian Broadcasting Corp. said.
</P>
<P>
	   The assailants reportedly wore uniforms, but it was unclear to which armed
group they belong.
</P>
<P>
	   French officials said they have received full cooperation from Namibian
authorities, but decided to conduct their own investigation into the deaths.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is serious concern back in France because it was three children who
were killed,'' said the French Embassy's charge d'affairs, Didier Ortolland.
</P>
<P>
	   The parents, Claude and Brigitte Bidoin, were recovering in the hospital in
Windhoek, he said. Both are teachers on the French island territory of Mayotte
off the southeast African coast and had been in Namibia on holiday.
</P>
<P>
	   They were to be evacuated to a hospital in France as soon as Claude Bidoin,
who was shot in the chest, is stable enough to travel, Ortolland said.
</P>
<P>
	   Namibia has blamed rebels of the National Union for the Total Liberation of
Angola, known as UNITA under its Portuguese acronym, for the assault.
</P>
<P>
	   The Angolan army, with Namibia's cooperation, last month launched an assault
on UNITA in the border region.
</P>
<P>
	   UNITA, which has blamed the attack on undisciplined Angolan troops, has
denied involvement in what it called a ``heinous crime.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We don't know exactly who these criminals are because in this region there
are different groups of armies of different origins,'' a French government
spokesman, Francois Rivasseau, told reporters in Paris.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We can only condemn this awful action very vigorously.''
</P>
<P>
	   Namibian state radio said seven UNITA soldiers were killed in a skirmish
with Namibian forces, and four captured near Susuwe, a Caprivi town which lies
close to the point where Zambia, Angola and Namibia meet.
</P>
<P>
	   Eight Angolan soldiers have been admitted to a hospital in the Namibian
border town of Rundu with wounds suffered in gunbattles and land mine explosions
near Jamba, in southeastern Angola, state radio reported.

<HEADLINE> Security Adviser Discusses Putin  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Acting President Vladimir Putin's first major test will be
whether he can protect Russia's young democratic processes in the heat of his
own presidential campaign, President Clinton's national security adviser said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If he does that, if Russia passes power from its first democratically
elected president to its second democratically elected president, I think that
will be a good thing,'' Sandy Berger told a National Press Club audience.
``We'll have to watch very carefully over the next three months.''
</P>
<P>
	   Berger, touching on a range of foreign policy issues, said the next three
months would be a crucial time in Russian history.
</P>
<P>
	   Any backsliding to a more authoritarian rule ``could present us with a
threat, which means we have a stake in Russia's success'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite sharp differences with the West over the government's military
offensive in Chechyna, Putin appears to enjoy strong support from the Russian
people and a newly elected Duma, Berger said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Acting President Putin has said he intends to uphold the rights of free
press, free speech, freedom of conscience, private property. And we obviously we
will be very interested to see him do this,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think the real test for acting President Putin will come in the next
three months when he will be both the custodian of Russian democracy and the
Russian Constitution at the same time he will be a candidate for president
within that system,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
	   Presidential elections are expected for March 26. Former President Boris
Yelstin handed power to Putin as he unexpectedly announced his own resignation
on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
	   Turning to other international issues, Berger said it was remarkable that
the world had made the transition to 2000 without a single terrorist attack.
But, he said, it wasn't by any stroke of luck -- but rather because of good
intelligence and law enforcement work.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Just because we dodged a bullet doesn't mean there was no bullet to
dodge,'' Berger said. ``Attacks were almost certainly prevented...We need to
keep meeting this challenge, just as we did last week.''
</P>
<P>
	   On other topics, the White House official:
</P>
<P>
	   --Said that, while both Israel and Syria were serious about making peace,
``one should not underestimate the degree of difficulty'' in reaching a peace
agreement in the talks now underway in West Virginia
</P>
<P>
	   --Denied a suggestion that the United States was relegating Iraq to a lower
status of concern. ``Iraq cannot be on the back burner as long as Saddam Hussein
in head of Iraq...One cannot diminish our effort on Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
	   --Expressed hope that Congress would act to grant China permanent
preferential trade status as well as enacting legislation to ease trade barriers
with sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean.

<HEADLINE> Soybeans Fall on S. America News  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    CHICAGO (AP) -- Forecasts for rain in bone-dry growing regions of South
America sent soybean prices lower Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade. Grains
were mixed.
</P>
<P>
	   Soybean futures, linked for months now to the weather in Brazil and
Argentina, rose early in the trading session to more than $4.80 a bushel. But
the higher prices failed to find support and were driven down on wet weather
forecasts for those top producing nations as well as a late drop in soymeal
prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Brazil developments also affected the corn market, with that country's
purchase of U.S. corn helping push the price upward slightly.
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat prices followed soybeans lower, giving up early gains that were
attributed to technical factors and continued weak export demand.
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat for March delivery fell 1 1/4 cents to $2.48 1/2 a bushel; March corn
rose  3/4 cent to $2.03 3/4 a bushel; March oats fell  1/4 cent to $1.09 a
bushel; March soybeans fell 1 1/2 cents to $4.75 1/2 a bushel.

<HEADLINE> Military Housing Raise Proposed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will propose in his 2001 budget that
within five years the government pay the full cost of housing for military
members who live off base, Defense Secretary William Cohen said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   As a first step, the 2001 budget will propose using $160 million to reduce
service members' out-of-pocket costs for off-base housing to an average 15
percent of the rent or mortgage from the current average of nearly 19 percent.
This will be done by raising what the Pentagon terms its ``basic housing
allowance'' -- a tax-free government stipend.
</P>
<P>
	   By 2005 all costs for off-base housing would be paid by the government, just
as is the case now for on-base housing. The Pentagon budget will earmark $3
billion over the next five years to cover these costs.
</P>
<P>
	   The initiative, which is likely to find favor in a Congress that often
pushes for quality-of-life improvements for the military, is part of a Clinton
administration campaign to make military life more attractive. The Pentagon in
recent years has had trouble recruiting new members and retaining those already
in uniform.
</P>
<P>
	   In announcing the housing plan to a group of Marines at Camp Pendleton,
Calif., on Thursday, Cohen reminded them that their base pay rose 4.8 percent on
Jan. 1, and that many will get additional increases of as much as 5.5 percent on
July 1. He said he also would seek ways to improve military health care.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the housing proposal as described by Cohen, an enlisted soldier in the
rank of Army specialist or Marine Corps corporal, for example, would see his or
her monthly housing cost drop by $35 in 2001 and by a cumulative $175 a month by
2005.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is real money going into your pockets,'' Cohen told the troops.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the active-duty military force of 1.4 million, about 750,000 receive
monthly allowances for off-base housing. Many choose to live off base because,
in the Defense Department's reckoning, about 200,000 of the 300,000 housing
units on its bases are substandard and in need of repair or replacement.
</P>
<P>
	   As more bases have closed in recent years, military members have
consolidated at a smaller number of locations -- in many cases finding
themselves in more expensive off-base real estate markets.
</P>
<P>
	   Increasing allowances for those who live off base is one of several aspects
of Cohen's plan to improve housing. The others are using military construction
funds to repair or replace some of the 200,000 military housing units judged to
be substandard, and using private contractors to build more on-base housing.
</P>
<P>
	   Late last year the Army signed a 50-year, $3 billion contract with Carson
Family Housing of Charlotte, N.C., to privatize family housing at Fort Carson,
Colo. The privatization approach is meant to achieve housing improvements more
quickly than through the traditional use of government construction funds.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The military simply cannot afford to build, own and maintain enough
quality housing to meet our needs,'' Cohen said in a statement released at the
Pentagon.

<HEADLINE> Nike To Investigate Toxic Shirts  </HEADLINE>
   By TONY CZUCZKA Associate Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERLIN (AP) -- Nike said Thursday it is investigating whether some of its
products are treated with a toxic anti-bacterial chemical that can cause serious
health problems at high levels in humans.
</P>
<P>
	   The probe by the Oregon-based manufacturer follows a German television
report that the yellow-and-black jerseys Nike made for a popular German soccer
club contained tributyltin, a heavy metal compound used in anti-barnacle paint
for ships.
</P>
<P>
	   Three German department store chains pulled the shirts off their shelves
Wednesday and Thursday as a precaution, and the club whose jerseys were tested
said it had suspended their sale at its official fan store.
</P>
<P>
	   Also used to kill bacteria and quell the smell of sweat, TBT would seem
ideal for sports shirts. But British and Dutch tests have shown the substance to
cause mutations in snails, and the World Wildlife Fund is calling for its global
ban.
</P>
<P>
	   At high levels in humans, TBT is believed to cause neurological problems,
damage the immune system and harm the liver, said Juergen Kundke, a scientist
with a German institute for consumer health.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We don't know how much is in the shirts, so we can't analyze the risks,''
he said. ``We knew that the substance was still used in coatings for ships, but
it shouldn't be in textiles that people wear.''
</P>
<P>
	   Nike's world headquarters in Beaverton, Ore., pledged a quick probe to
determine whether any of its products contain the substance.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're doing independent tests on our end to ensure there is no risk to the
public,'' spokesman Vada Manager said. ``We're obviously going to take the step
of checking on products sold in Germany, but we will check worldwide as well.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``As of right now there's no legitimate reason to believe there's any
risk,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In its Tuesday broadcast, German public television's consumer show
``Plusminus'' said a private lab it commissioned found TBT and similar compounds
in the Nike jerseys and several other products. The items were chosen at random
in German stores, according to the TV report, which provided no figures on the
TBT levels.
</P>
<P>
	   The soccer jerseys caused the biggest storm because the club, 1997 European
champion Borussia Dortmund, has a big national following.

<HEADLINE> Bahamas Hangs Convicted Stabber  </HEADLINE>
   By DEBY NASH Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- A man who stabbed a German couple to death was
hanged Thursday, the fourth execution since the Bahamas resumed capital
punishment in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   David Mitchell, 27, was convicted in the stabbing deaths of Horst and Traude
Henning on the island of Abace, where they had lived for many years.
</P>
<P>
	   No motive was ever established for the 1994 killings, which occurred as the
couple was sleeping.
</P>
<P>
	   Three hangings had been scheduled Thursday, but a second person convicted
won a stay of execution and the third, 51-year-old John Higgs, committed suicide
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Higgs apparently slashed his wrists with a razor blade even though there was
a suicide watch and heavy security at Nassau's Fox Hill Prison ahead of the
proposed hangings.
</P>
<P>
	   A death notice for Mitchell was posted on a wooden board and hung from the
prison's gate.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 300 people turned out for his burial, some crying, some cheering,
as Mitchell's casket was lowered into the ground at a Nassau cemetery.
</P>
<P>
	   Two freshly dug graves on either side, intended for the other men who were
to be executed, stood empty.
</P>
<P>
	   Higgs was convicted of the 1993 murder of his wife, Joan, whose body was
found buried under a staircase in an unfinished apartment building in Nassau.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bahamas executed its first convict in 12 years in 1996, becoming the
first of several Caribbean countries to resume hangings in a bid to deter
increasing and more violent crime.
</P>
<P>
	   Twenty-five inmates remain on death row.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Abortions Continue To Decline  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- The number of abortions in the United States fell in 1997 to
the lowest level in two decades, despite new drugs that make it easier to
terminate a pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
	   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Thursday that 20 of
every 1,000 women of reproductive age (15 to 44) had abortions in 1997, the same
rate as the previous two years and the lowest since 1975.
</P>
<P>
	   The number of abortions for every 1,000 live births dropped from 314 in 1996
to 305 in 1997 -- also a 25-year low, the CDC said.
</P>
<P>
	   The preliminary estimate of 1,184,758 legal abortions in 1997 was 3 percent
less than the 1,221,585 abortions in 1996 and was the lowest number performed
since 1978.
</P>
<P>
	   The CDC cited several factors for the decline, including reduced access to
abortion, an increased willingness to use contraception and possibly different
attitudes about the moral implications of abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   For the first time, the annual CDC report included a breakdown from some
states of which abortions were performed with surgery and which with drugs.
Previously, states had reported only the total number of abortions.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1997, 16 states reported 2,988 abortions induced by drugs. The Alan
Guttmacher Institute, an abortion rights research organization, estimated there
were 4,300 drug-induced abortions in all of the United States during the first
half of 1997 alone.
</P>
<P>
	   The drug most commonly used in the United States to induce abortion is
methotrexate. Methotrexate is used to treat certain types of gastrointestinal
disorders and cancers, but doctors have been allowed to prescribe it to induce
abortion since the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
	   Another drug, mifepristone, is designed specifically to end pregnancy and is
expected to win approval from the Food and Drug Administration this year. It is
available only through clinical trials. A similar drug used in Europe, RU-486,
remains ensnared in political battles in this country.
</P>
<P>
	   The medications are touted as a way to make the procedure more private and
convenient, without the need for surgery. Women take the medications under a
doctor's supervision during the first 49 days of pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
	   Those on both sides of the debate said the medications are unlikely to
affect the overall numbers of abortions but might shift the method away from
surgery.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think it will have any effect whatsoever on rates of abortion or
rates of unintended pregnancy,'' said Gloria Feldt, president of Planned
Parenthood Federation of America.
</P>
<P>
	   April Thompson, a spokeswoman for the National Right to Life Committee,
said: ``It's just another method of taking the life of an unborn child. It will
not change the debate and it will not change the number of abortions.''
</P>
<P>
	   The CDC said that 52 percent of the women who received an abortion in 1997
were 24 or younger. Most of the women were white and unmarried. Fifty-five
percent of the procedures were done in the first two months of pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
	   Final 1997 figures -- the most recent year for which such numbers are
available -- including the numbers of abortions in each state, will be released
in the summer.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 130; Nasdaq Down 150  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks fell for a third straight session today
as investors shifted money from the pricey shares that dominated trading in 1999
to blue-chip stalwarts like Caterpillar, 3M and Procter &AMP; Gamble.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 130.61 to 11,253.26.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq composite index, dominated by technology stocks, fell 150.34 to
3,727.20. It was the second largest point loss in history for the Nasdaq, which
has tumbled nearly 10 percent since closing at a new record on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks continued the reversal of fortunes that has marked Wall Street this
week. Technology stocks, which helped the Nasdaq composite to an unprecedented
86 percent gain in 1999, have plummeted as investors lock in profits.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, cyclical companies, which thrive in a booming economy but
languished last year in the frenzy for technology stocks, are soaring.
</P>
<P>
	   "Investors are selling Yahoo! to buy Caterpillar," said Charles Pradilla,
chief investment strategist at SG Cowen Securities in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, Yahoo! was among the Nasdaq's steepest decliners. Qualcomm, the
best-performing stock in the Nasdaq and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 last year,
also fell steeply.
</P>
<P>
	   While analysts continued to discount much of the technology selloff as
long-awaited profit-taking, fears of slowing profits for two high-tech firms
depressed the sector today. Personal computer maker Gateway warned late
Wednesday its fourth-quarter earnings would miss expectations due to a slowdown
in sales. The company blamed Year 2000 computer worries and component supply
problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Gateway, which fell steeply in extended-hours trading Wednesday, bounced
back today. But traders said the company's warning contributed to weakness in
other computer makers' share prices. Dell and Apple fell.
</P>
<P>
	   Intel fell after Gateway blamed the semiconductor maker for some of its
supply problems.
</P>
<P>
	   MCI WorldCom was down after influential Salomon Smith Barney analyst Jack
Grubman lowered his earnings and revenue estimates for fiscal year 2000. Grubman
said the company's revenue is likely to grow 14.4 percent from 1999 to 2000,
below his previous estimate of 15.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, most analysts expect the sector to rebound. Selling this week has
been exacerbated by investors' desire to sell now and pay their capital-gains
taxes in 2001. Once investors find themselves flush with cash, many will return
to the sector that rewarded them so richly in 1999, said Larry Rice, chief
investment officer at Josephthal &AMP; Co. in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   "These stocks will bounce back," he said. "There are too many people who are
still eager to buy. And these companies still hold great potential for making a
lot of money."
</P>
<P>
	   In the meantime, however, cyclical stocks like Caterpillar, 3M and Procter &AMP;
Gamble thrived amid growing concerns that the Federal Reserve will soon raise
interest rates in an effort to stave off inflation. Those stocks are viewed as
"safe havens" that are less prone to interest-rate fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors are now awaiting Friday's monthly unemployment report from the
Labor Department, which contains data on wages and the number of jobs created.
Any sign of modest or slowing growth could prompt some new buying, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, the government said its weekly tally of new claims for unemployment
benefits rose by 33,000 last week, the largest increase in a year. Jobless
claims had fallen by 7,000 in the previous week.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Labor Department analysts stressed that the claims level is often
volatile during holiday periods and they cautioned against reading too much into
one week's movement in jobless claims.

<HEADLINE> Accounting Firm Violations Found  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- A review led by an independent consultant has found
thousands of violations by accounting giant PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP -- and
many of its partners -- of rules requiring accountants to remain independent
from companies they audit.
</P>
<P>
	   The Securities and Exchange Commission, which made the consultant's review
public on Thursday, said its investigation of New York-based
PricewaterhouseCoopers is continuing.
</P>
<P>
	   A year ago, the firm agreed in a settlement to conduct the review after the
SEC alleged that some of its accountants owned stock in corporations they
audited.
</P>
<P>
	   PricewaterhouseCoopers promised at the time to take steps to ensure that
this didn't happen again.
</P>
<P>
	   In light of the disappointing results of the review, the SEC said Thursday
it has asked an accounting industry oversight board to sponsor similar
independent reviews at other accounting firms.
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC has been stressing the need for accounting firms to be more
independent of the companies they audit. The watchdog agency's rules explicitly
forbid accountants from owning stock in their audit clients.
</P>
<P>
	   Lynn Turner, the SEC's chief accountant, called the report by the
independent consultant, New York attorney Jess Fardella, "a sobering reminder
that accounting professionals need to renew their commitment to the fundamental
principle of auditor independence."
</P>
<P>
	   Fardella and his four-person team found some excusable mistakes by the
accounting firm but also "laxity and insensitivity to the importance of
independence" and "serious" problems of corporate structure and culture.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly half the firm's 2,698 partners, or 1,301, had at least one violation
of the auditor independence rules while 153 of them had more than 10 each,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
	   Of a total 8,064 violations, 81.3 percent were attributed to partners and
17.4 percent to mangers. The review found that nearly half of the violations
were committed by partners who perform services related to financial audits of
companies.
</P>
<P>
	   Almost half the violations involved direct investments by the
PricewaterhouseCoopers professionals in securities, mutual funds, bank accounts
or insurance products related to client companies.
</P>
<P>
	   Dave Nestor, a spokesman for PricewaterhouseCoopers, said he had no comment
on the report but provided a copy of a letter sent Wednesday by chairman
Nicholas G. Moore and chief executive James J. Schiro to the firm's partners.
</P>
<P>
	   The letter termed the Fardella report "embarrassing to our firm and to all
of us as partners" and said that "Equally important, it may also raise questions
and concerns among our clients and our people."
</P>
<P>
	   However, the executives added that the violations of the independence rules
cited by the report, while unacceptable, "did not in any way impair the
professional objectivity and integrity" of the company's audits.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are determined to do everything possible so that neither our firm nor
our clients ever again suffer from independence-related problems," Moore and
Schiro wrote. "To facilitate this, we have established expansive new policies
and procedures to address previous infractions and to prevent future ones."
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC appointed Fardella a year ago to supervise the internal review after
it censured PricewaterhouseCoopers for alleged violations of the independence
rules.
</P>
<P>
	   In its settlement with the SEC, the firm agreed to set up the $2.5 million
education fund, to be used to enhance awareness in the accounting profession of
the independence rules.
</P>
<P>
	   PricewaterhouseCoopers, created from the July 1998 merger of Price
Waterhouse LLP and Coopers &AMP; Lybrand LLP, neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing
in agreeing to the settlement.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the accord, the firm also agreed to be censured, to improve its
procedures for monitoring adherence to the independence rules and to conduct the
internal investigation supervised by Fardella.

<HEADLINE> Asia, Europe Stocks Continue Fall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks turned in a mixed performance today as investors,
still taking profits on technology issues, put their money into blue-chip
shares. Prices dropped sharply in earlier trading in Asia, and were off more
modestly in Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 130.61, or 1.42 percent, 11,253.26,
according to prelminary calculations, while the Nasdaq composite index, which
suffered its biggest-ever point drop on Tuesday amid concerns about rising U.S.
interest rates, was off 119.39 at 3,758.15, a loss of 2.88 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology stocks continued to tumble as investors sold stocks to lock in
profits from last year's record-breaking rise, and that gave the Nasdaq a 7.46
percent drop so far in 2000. But blue chip stocks including the Dow industrials
rose as investors gravitated toward companies that do well during times of
higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
	   In Europe, key market gauges fell 1.36 percent in London, 0.54 percent in
Paris and 0.42 percent in Germany.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. and European trading was calm compared to Asia, where big declines have
brought back memories of the way prices plunged more than two years ago as the
financial crisis spread through the region.
</P>
<P>
	   The main market indicator in Hong Kong dropped 4.4 percent today and Tokyo's
main index lost 2 percent after bigger declines on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index slid sharply from the outset, at one point
coming close to matching Wednesday's ominous 7.2 percent dive that was its worst
one-day drop since late October 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   The Hang Seng finished with a loss of 693.49 points, or 4.4 percent, at
15,153.23.
</P>
<P>
	   On Asia's top market, the Tokyo Stock Exchange, its best-known index shed 2
percent as investors bailed out of high-tech companies that have taken a beating
globally.
</P>
<P>
	   A 5.6 percent drop in the Nasdaq on Tuesday sparked the selloffs, and
although the Nasdaq held its losses Wednesday to just 0.6 percent, traders
figured many high-tech companies were still too expensive.
</P>
<P>
	   Tokyo's Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues closed 374.28 points
lower at 18,168.27. The index had fallen 2.4 percent on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   South Korea's main market index fell 2.6 percent. Prices in Singapore,
Australia, Malaysia and Thailand gave up initial gains and turned lower. The key
market gauge fell 1.3 percent in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
	   The market in Indonesia rebounded, while prices rose marginally in the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
	   Taiwanese blue chips continued to buck the trend, finishing with a gain of
0.8 percent today -- on top of a 1.1 percent gain that made the Taipei market
the region's only winner Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> FAA Computer Glitch Grounds Flights  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Computer problems grounded airplanes Thursday for a second
time this week, frustrating passengers trying to fly in and out of nearly a
dozen cities across the eastern third of the nation, the Federal Aviation
Administration said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds of flights were delayed when a computer at an FAA air traffic
control center in Leesburg, Va., experienced problems transferring data about
6:45 a.m. EST. The computer processes information from radar systems, air
traffic control centers around the East Coast and flight plans filed by airlines
and individual pilots.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Obviously people were inconvenienced, but they were not in danger,'' said
William Shumann, a spokesman at FAA's headquarters in Washington. ``The backup
system is safe, but it's a much slower system with less capacity and so we have
to hold airplanes on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
	   Normal operations resumed at 9:49 a.m., but the delays left passengers
sitting -- up to two hours or more -- aboard planes lined up on runways or
waiting at gates for flights postponed or canceled.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the passengers grounded at Washington Reagan National Airport was Rep.
Edward Pease, R-Ind., a member of the House Transportation Committee's aviation
panel. He was trying to fly to Indianapolis to deliver a speech, but his plane
never took off.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think we had been on the plane for 1 1/2 hours. The flight was
canceled,'' Pease said. ``When we finally turned around and went back to the
gate, there were planes everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
	   Pease said the delay underscores the need for Congress to give the FAA money
to further modernize the air traffic control system, which is currently
undergoing a $13 billion system upgrade. ``There is clearly a need to upgrade
equipment at the FAA and we've known about it for years.''
</P>
<P>
	   David Fuscus, a spokesman for the Air Transport Association of America, the
airlines' trade group, used the outage to call for steady funding from Congress.
``The problem is the system can't handle the traffic,'' he said. ``The system
needs to meet the demand of the American people.''
</P>
<P>
	   However, this problem occurred with a new computer.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Do we have to modernize? Absolutely,'' Shumann said. ``But the irony here
is that the computer that was involved is new. It's been fully operational in
the Washington center only since March.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said the problem has not yet been identified, but it does not appear to
be related to Y2K, the term used to describe glitches that occurred as computers
made the rollover from 1999 to 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   Thursday's delays were experienced by passengers traveling to or from Reagan
National, Dulles International and Baltimore-Washington International; John F.
Kennedy, LaGuardia and Newark, N.J. in greater New York; and Teterboro, N.J.,
Boston, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Raleigh-Durham, N.C., the FAA said.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Letzler of Baldwin, N.Y., said in a telephone interview that his wife
called him by cell phone while sitting for two hours in a plane stuck on the
tarmac at LaGuardia.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They were just sitting there. Everyone was antsy, apparently,'' Letzler
said. ``She was a little upset. She just wanted to know if I had heard anything.
The pilot said that apparently there was some sort of radar problem.''
</P>
<P>
	   Other flights affected were those routed through the airspace controlled by
the FAA center in Leesburg, which covers southern New Jersey, Delaware,
Maryland, Washington, Virginia, eastern West Virginia and eastern North
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There may have been some flights from Chicago to the Washington area that
were also delayed, but no West Coast flights were delayed,'' Shumann said.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday night, a computer malfunction at the FAA's center in Nashua, N.H.,
delayed flights at airports in Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York. FAA
officials said a backup computer system was used when the main computer at the
air traffic control center experienced problems for about three hours.
</P>
<P>
	   Shumann said the problems in Leesburg and Nashua do not point to a systemic
problem at air traffic center computers nationwide.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Weather and traffic volume account for 90 percent of all traffic delays,''
he said. ``Air traffic control outages such as what happened here account for
just under 2 percent of all air traffic delays.''

<HEADLINE> Ecuadorians Allowed in Volcano Zone  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Thousands of residents of an evacuated town near the
active Tungurahua volcano began returning to their homes Thursday under an
agreement that followed a deadly confrontation with soldiers.
</P>
<P>
	   About 3,000 residents came back to the town of Banos after the deal was
announced, and soldiers immediately started to pull out of the area.
</P>
<P>
	   The agreement signed Thursday by Ignacio Vargas, governor of surrounding
Tungurahua province, ordered the soldiers to withdraw from the area around the
volcano, and said residents could return at their own risk. It also called for
the creation of an emergency evacuation plan.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday night, a 30-year-old woman died in a confrontation between
hundreds of area residents and troops at a military checkpoint. Five soldiers
and two civilians suffered minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   Residents of the tourist town on the volcano's slopes, about 75 miles
southeast of the capital, Quito, have accused soldiers of looting abandoned
buildings and say the ban on returning has brought them economic disaster.
</P>
<P>
	   For months, authorities have warned that the 16,553-foot volcano could erupt
within days or weeks, as it has done at least a dozen times since 1534.
</P>
<P>
	   The town's 17,000 people were evacuated in October, after the volcano awoke
from a 79-year slumber. About 8,000 people from nearby villages and scattered
hamlets also were ordered out of the area.
</P>
<P>
	   Last weekend, about 2,000 Banos residents reached the town by hiking
mountain trails, bypassing the military checkpoints.
</P>
<P>
	   Defying orders to leave, they opened grocery stores, bakeries and a pharmacy
in an attempt to return to normal life. They also dug ditches in the roads to
prevent military patrols from passing through.

<HEADLINE> Mudslide Victims Found in Caribbean  </HEADLINE>
   By FABIOLA SANCHEZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Authorities have found dozens of victims of last
month's devastating mudslides floating in the Caribbean Sea near some of
Venezuela's top beaches.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the bodies were found during the last several days in Falcon state,
about 100 miles northwest of Caracas, officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Forty-one bodies have been found in the area so far, said Melquiades Jordan,
Falcon's civil defense director.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dec. 15 mudslides wiped out entire neighborhoods on the slopes of a
mountain range that separates Caracas from the Caribbean Sea. Officials estimate
that between 5,000 and 30,000 people were killed, many of them washed out to
sea.
</P>
<P>
	   Uprooted trees, refrigerators, sofas, washing machines and other household
objects have also washed up on the beaches in Falcon state.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials temporarily shut down most beaches in the state, although those in
Morrocoy National Park -- coral reef-formed islands that are a top tourist
destination -- remained open.
</P>
<P>
	   Forensic experts were attempting to identify the bodies, but Jordan said the
work was difficult because many of the bodies were badly decomposed.
</P>
<P>
	   The mudslides left 150,000 people homeless. The government is building
subsidized houses for many of the survivors as part of a plan to move city
dwellers to the countryside.
</P>
<P>
	   President Hugo Chavez said late Wednesday the government might expropriate
idle farm land from owners who refuse to pay taxes and don't cooperate with the
relocation plans.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking in a televised interview, Chavez called on land owners to donate
idle land for the relocation efforts, adding ``if they don't want to, the state
could expropriate abandoned land.'' He said the owners would be paid for their
land.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Rejoin Mideast Talks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- President Clinton plunged back into slow-moving
Mideast peace talks as face-to-face negotiations between Israelis and Syrians
ground to a halt.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. aim is a treaty that would exchange the Golan Heights, a strategic
border territory Israel has held for more than three decades, for diplomatic and
economic relations with Syria.
</P>
<P>
	   Syria began Wednesday to outline its offer in a mixed committee under the
supervision of Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk. A committee on new
border security measures met all day, as well.
</P>
<P>
	   But there were no face-to-face negotiations over Syria's key demand: a
specific timetable for Israel to relinquish the Golan Heights, which Syria lost
in the 1967 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
	   The State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said the talks, now in their
fourth day, were still ``chugging along.'' But he said the American hosts were
dissatisfied with the pace and would like to see it accelerated.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's intervention Thursday was his third of the week. On tap were
separate meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian Foreign
Minister Farouk al-Sharaa after conferring with Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright on her own 90-minute meeting with al-Sharaa.
</P>
<P>
	   The president, wearing a leather flight jacket, waved to bystanders as he
alighted from his helicopter and made no statement.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, Clinton's assistant for national security, Sandy Berger, told
reporters to ``not underestimate the degree of difficulty'' in the negotiations
being held near this oldest town in West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These are very difficult issues that divide the parties,'' Berger said.
``They've been at war three times since the 1940s. There are very strong views
on both sides.''
</P>
<P>
	   In contrast to discontent within the Syrian delegation, Barak and his
delegation appeared pleased that the negotiations were focused on peace terms
and security measures, such as installing an early-warning system at the border
and clearing it of troops.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak found time Wednesday to jog and do calisthenics at a gymnasium in the
hotel the two delegations are sharing behind police barricades.
</P>
<P>
	   An Israel source, insisting on anonymity, said the talks were likely to go
into a second week -- after a weekend break -- and that Barak planned to stay
on.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin said that Albright, meanwhile, had directed her assistants to prepare
a ``working document'' detailing negotiations held in 1996 as well as talks last
month in Washington and here this week.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That will enable us at the appropriate time to move forward,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked if Israel could be secure without retaining the Golan Heights, which
overlooks its northeastern towns that were targets of cross-border attacks
before 1967, Rubin said, ``Israel is going to have to make that decision.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We believe that Israel has legitimate security needs and we believe those
needs can be met,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton has assured Israel and Syria he was willing to play a helpful and
consistent role in trying to iron out their differences.
</P>
<P>
	   Although two trips are on his schedule for next week -- to Arizona and Texas
on Monday and Tuesday and to New York on Thursday -- White House press secretary
Joe Lockhart said the peace talks would take precedence.

	   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 1.34 to 1,403.45.
</P>
<P>
	   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-3 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, with 1,974 up, 1,158 down and 410 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE volume totaled 1.08 billion shares as of 4 p.m., vs. 1.07 billion in
the previous session.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 3.43 to 475.40.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks continued the reversal of fortunes that has marked Wall Street this
week. Technology stocks, which helped the Nasdaq composite to an unprecedented
86 percent gain in 1999, have plummeted as investors lock in profits.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, cyclical companies, which thrive in a booming economy but
languished last year in the frenzy for technology stocks, are soaring.
</P>
<P>
	   "Investors are selling Yahoo! to buy Caterpillar," said Charles Pradilla,
chief investment strategist at SG Cowen Securities in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, Yahoo! was among the Nasdaq's steepest decliners. Qualcomm, the
best-performing stock in the Nasdaq and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 last year,
also fell steeply.
</P>
<P>
	   While analysts continued to discount much of the technology selloff as
long-awaited profit-taking, fears of slowing profits for two high-tech firms
depressed the sector today. Personal computer maker Gateway warned late
Wednesday its fourth-quarter earnings would miss expectations due to a slowdown
in sales. The company blamed Year 2000 computer worries and component supply
problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Gateway, which fell steeply in extended-hours trading Wednesday, bounced
back today. But traders said the company's warning contributed to weakness in
other computer makers' share prices. Dell and Apple fell.
</P>
<P>
	   Intel fell after Gateway blamed the semiconductor maker for some of its
supply problems.
</P>
<P>
	   MCI WorldCom was down after influential Salomon Smith Barney analyst Jack
Grubman lowered his earnings and revenue estimates for fiscal year 2000. Grubman
said the company's revenue is likely to grow 14.4 percent from 1999 to 2000,
below his previous estimate of 15.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, most analysts expect the sector to rebound. Selling this week has
been exacerbated by investors' desire to sell now and pay their capital-gains
taxes in 2001. Once investors find themselves flush with cash, many will return
to the sector that rewarded them so richly in 1999, said Larry Rice, chief
investment officer at Josephthal &AMP; Co. in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   "These stocks will bounce back," he said. "There are too many people who are
still eager to buy. And these companies still hold great potential for making a
lot of money."
</P>
<P>
	   In the meantime, however, cyclical stocks like Caterpillar, 3M and Procter &AMP;
Gamble thrived amid growing concerns that the Federal Reserve will soon raise
interest rates in an effort to stave off inflation. Those stocks are viewed as
"safe havens" that are less prone to interest-rate fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors are now awaiting Friday's monthly unemployment report from the
Labor Department, which contains data on wages and the number of jobs created.
Any sign of modest or slowing growth could prompt some new buying, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, the government said its weekly tally of new claims for unemployment
benefits rose by 33,000 last week, the largest increase in a year. Jobless
claims had fallen by 7,000 in the previous week.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Labor Department analysts stressed that the claims level is often
volatile during holiday periods and they cautioned against reading too much into
one week's movement in jobless claims.

<HEADLINE> Hastert:Tax Relief Heads GOP Agenda  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans are drawing up plans to eliminate the
portion of the national debt held by the public, now estimated at $3.7 trillion,
House Speaker Dennis Hastert said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Hastert, R-Ill., also said after a GOP leadership conference that tax relief
for married couples and for parents saving for education costs will be among the
first legislative items lawmakers will take up when they return later this
month.
</P>
<P>
	   Hastert's office said it was the first time the speaker publicly committed
to eliminating the debt. With the recent emergence of budget surpluses, the
Clinton administration also is talking about abolishing the public debt by 2015.
Hastert said his plan, too, would envision an end to the debt in 10 years to 15
years.
</P>
<P>
	   The last time the debt was eliminated was 1835, when Andrew Jackson was
president. The national debt totals $5.76 trillion, which includes $3.7 trillion
owed the public in treasury bills and savings bonds and $2 trillion the
government owes Social Security and other trust funds. The national debt crossed
the $1 trillion mark in 1983.
</P>
<P>
	   Other GOP priorities announced at a news conference of party leaders include
blocking new Internet taxes, passing other high-tech bills and winning approval
for China's accession to the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
	   Hastert said another early priority will be legislation he proposed with
President Clinton in November that would steer investments to America's neediest
communities. Congress reconvenes on Jan. 24.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We passed an ambitious tax relief package last year which the president
decided to veto,'' Hastert said after two days of House GOP leadership meetings
to discuss this year's agenda. ``This year we will continue to fight for tax
relief for working families.''
</P>
<P>
	   The early-session emphasis on targeted tax relief, a strategy also deployed
by Democrats, did not rule out another try at a comprehensive tax cut package,
Hastert said. ``We may consider a bigger bill at the end'' of the session, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The speaker also noted that presidential politics will come into play this
summer, and congressional Republicans would try to coordinate tax policy with
the GOP presidential nominee. The front-runner, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, has
proposed a five-year, $483 billion tax cut plan.
</P>
<P>
	   Provisions to address the education savings account and the extra tax burden
faced by some married couples who file jointly were both part of the $792
billion, 10-year tax package passed by Congress last year but vetoed by Clinton
as being excessively large.
</P>
<P>
	   Reducing the marriage penalty paid by millions of two-income couples would
have cost an estimated $119 billion, while raising tax-exempt contribution
limits to IRA-like education savings accounts and other steps to promote
education savings were estimated at $15 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The marriage penalty is the additional tax many two-income couples must pay
above what they would owe if they were single. To ease it, last year's GOP tax
bill would have gradually doubled the standard deduction, and increased the
amount of income subject to the lowest, 15 percent tax bracket for couples
filing jointly.
</P>
<P>
	   That tax bill also would have raised to $2,000 the current $500-a-year limit
on families' contributions to education savings accounts. The money which can
now be withdrawn tax-free and used for college expenses, would be usable for
public and private elementary and secondary school costs as well.
</P>
<P>
	   The GOP outline of its goals for the election-year session came a day after
Clinton and Democratic leaders met at the White House and said they would push
legislation to shore up Social Security and to fix the nation's crumbling
schools.
</P>
<P>
	   The Democrats also said they would also seek to pass legislation unfinished
from last year, including gun restrictions, an increase in the minimum wage and
a patient's bill of rights.
</P>
<P>
	   Other tax goals named by the GOP leaders included stopping new taxes from
being imposed on Internet access and giving a tax break to people who adopt a
child with special needs.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., chairman of the House GOP Policy Committee,
said the party also will seek to pass a high-tech agenda, including electronic
signature legislation that stalled last year and a second measure setting
standards for computer encryption.

<HEADLINE> SKorea To Probe War Execution Claim  </HEADLINE>
   By SANG-HUN CHOE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- The Defense Ministry said Thursday it will
investigate a newspaper report that South Korean police massacred thousands of
political prisoners early in the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
	   The national daily Hankook Ilbo said the prisoners were people accused of
collaborating with the communists and that they were executed in the first weeks
of the war to prevent their release by advancing North Korean troops. The paper
quoted declassified U.S. documents.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have started checking into available documents in our ministry,'' said
Yoon Il-young, spokesman for the Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
	   The newspaper said the documents were uncovered by a Korean-American
scholar, Do-Young Lee, in U.S. government archives. Copies of the documents were
made available to The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the documents quotes the U.S. Embassy's Army attache at the time, Lt.
Col. Bob Edwards: ``Orders for execution undoubtedly came from top level as they
were not confined to towns in front line areas.''
</P>
<P>
	   In the report dated Sept. 23, 1950, Edwards said 1,800 political prisoners
were executed over three days in the first week of July 1950 in Taejon, 90 miles
south of Seoul.
</P>
<P>
	   Army photos uncovered at U.S. national archives also showed the execution of
political prisoners in Taegu, a provincial city in southeast South Korea, in
April 1951, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Korean Peninsula was divided into the communist North and U.S.-allied
South at the end of World War II. The North invaded the South in June 1950,
instigating a three-year war. The United States led allied U.N. forces to defend
the South against North Korean troops backed by China and the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
	   In September, The Associated Press cited U.S. veterans, Korean witnesses and
declassified documents in reporting that U.S. warplanes and ground troops killed
hundreds of South Korean refugees at No Gun Ri, South Korea, in late July 1950,
as American soldiers retreated under fire from North Korean troops.
</P>
<P>
	   South Korea and the United States are investigating that case.
</P>
<P>
	   When the war started, President Syngman Rhee's government in South Korea
rounded up tens of thousands of people accused of being communist sympathizers.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the prisoners were believed to have been killed by retreating South
Korean police who feared they would collaborate with North Korean troops,
according to historians.
</P>
<P>
	   The South Korean parliament opened an investigation after Rhee's government
was toppled in 1960 amid nationwide student uprisings.
</P>
<P>
	   But the investigation ended abruptly when military strongman Park Chung-hee
took power in a coup the following year.
</P>
<P>
	   Calls for reopening the investigation were ignored during the years of
military-backed governments that followed Rhee's ouster.
</P>
<P>
	   South Korea turned to democracy in the late 1980s, and its first civilian
president took power in 1993. Kim Dae-jung, the first opposition leader elected
president in South Korea, has made human rights issues a priority since assuming
office in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Businesses Granted New Tax Deduction  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Businesses will gain a new tax deduction for the costs of
meeting international quality standards under a ruling by the Internal Revenue
Service, which reversed its previous position.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision Thursday involves a series of quality guidelines -- known as
ISO 9000 -- that businesses around the world use for goods and services.
Companies get certified by the International Organization for Standardization by
documenting their processes so all current and future employees will continue to
meet the same standards.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Association of Manufacturers, the National Federation for
Independent Business and other organizations petitioned the IRS in 1998 to
permit companies to fully deduct the costs of gaining certification in a single
year, instead of spreading the costs out over multiple years.
</P>
<P>
	   Obtaining certification, the groups said in a joint letter, ``can be both
expensive and time consuming, particularly for small businesses.'' An average
cost estimate was placed at $60,000.
</P>
<P>
	   The IRS ruling says that costs incurred by businesses to ``obtain, maintain
and renew'' the certification will now be fully tax deductible in one year,
except for certain long-term costs such as creation of a company manual.

<HEADLINE> Technology Shares Fall Again  </HEADLINE>
    By BRUCE MEYERSON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks slid for a third straight session today,
pushing the Nasdaq market's rapid retreat from record highs as investors
scurried to protect last year's phenomenal gains.
</P>
<P>
	   The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 150.34 points to close at
3,727.20 as Wednesday's partial recovery in the technology group quickly
unraveled.
</P>
<P>
	   The loss, which would have been the biggest ever if not for Tuesday's record
229-point drop, left Nasdaq about 400 points from the record high of 4,131.15
reached on Monday, the first session of the new year.
</P>
<P>
	   For most of today's session, the selling was modest compared to Tuesday and
early Wednesday. But the losses piled up over the final hour of trading, dashing
hopes that high-flying tech shares might soon resume a powerful rally that drove
the Nasdaq to a 50 percent gain over the past two months and 85 percent for all
of 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   The sheer size of 1999's gains may have been the driving force behind the
post New Year's drop, rather than the fears of rising interest rates, many
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   With such huge profits tucked away in stocks --especially technology and
Internet-related shares -- many investors were waiting to sell after Dec. 31 so
they could delay paying taxes on those gains until April 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   While most experts agree that there's plenty of excess that can be wrung
from technology stocks, they also stand by the main premise behind 1999's stock
swell -- that even though most Internet companies continue to lose money, all
companies will eventually prosper from the rapid spread of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   The main question Wednesday wasn't why, but how long and how far stocks
might drop before resuming the rally of the past five years.
</P>
<P>
	   The selloff didn't stop Goldman Sachs on Tuesday from issuing a list of
stocks the investment firm expects to rise at least 35 percent this year. More
than a third of the 85 names on that list were Internet-related, including
America Online, the leading Web service, and Cisco Systems, the biggest
manufacturer of Internet equipment.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Internet is the most important business phenomenon in our lifetime,"
said Byron Wien, the U.S. investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
"I still believe that, but many stock prices were suggesting a profit reality
that was pretty hard to achieve."

<HEADLINE> Home Sales Fall; Retail Sales Soar  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sales of new homes, hurt by rising mortgage rates, took
their biggest tumble in two years, but the nation's retailers enjoyed their best
Christmas in seven years as confident consumers spent with abandon.
</P>
<P>
	   Economists said the latest batch of economic data released Thursday depicted
a U.S. economy that ended 1999 just as it had begun, galloping full speed ahead.
</P>
<P>
	   Financial markets, which had swooned earlier this week on worries that all
the strength will push the Federal Reserve to move interest rates up further,
were mixed on Thursday. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 131 points
Thursday to close at 11,253, but the technology-laden Nasdaq index suffered
another big loss.
</P>
<P>
	   The Commerce Department reported that sales of new homes plunged by 7.1
percent in November, the biggest decline since December 1997. Rising mortgage
rates were blamed for the weakness with sales falling in all regions of the
country, led by a huge 31.5 percent plunge in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
	   But even with the dropoff in home sales, total activity remained close to
record levels at a seasonally adjusted annual sales pace of 865,000 units.
</P>
<P>
	   The nation's big department store chains reported Thursday that they enjoyed
their strongest December sales since 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   The nationwide chains reported heavy demand for everything from toys,
jewelry and DVD players to Y2K survival items such as flashlights and batteries.
Big winners included Wal-Mart and Target, two discount chains.
</P>
<P>
	   Consumer demand has been fueled by the lowest unemployment rate in 30 years
with many economists predicting the 4.1 percent current level could fall to 4
percent when the December figure is released on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Reserve, expressing concerns that a dwindling supply of
available workers would trigger inflationary wage demands, began in late June
pushing interest rates higher to slow the economy down.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said they still believe that last year's three Fed rate increases
would be followed by two to three more rate increases in 2000 as the central
bank struggles to contain an economy Fed policymakers still believe is growing
too rapidly for comfort.
</P>
<P>
	   While Fed efforts to dampen demand in interest-rate sensitive sectors such
as housing and autos would normally raise fears of a possible recession, few
economists see any threat that higher rates will derail the current expansion,
which next month will become the longest in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
	   Part of the reason for that optimism is a belief that the global economy,
which has come through a financial crisis that saw deep recessions in Asia and
elsewhere, is beginning to recover.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Asia recovery looks spectacular," Stanley Fischer, deputy managing
director of the International Monetary Fund, told reporters at a briefing
Thursday. He said not only crisis countries South Korea and Thailand were
rebounding but also Indonesia, where he said "the outlook is much brighter,
especially after democratic elections."
</P>
<P>
	   Economists predicted sales of both new and existing homes would dip further
in coming months as mortgage rates continue to rise. A national survey by
Freddie Mac, the mortgage company, reported Thursday that 30-year, fixed-rate
mortgages hit 8.15 percent this week, a level that has not been surpassed in
more than two years.
</P>
<P>
	   David Seiders, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders,
said that the increase in mortgage rates, which started 1999 at 6.79 percent,
had added $100 a month to the cost of financing a $100,000 mortgage.
</P>
<P>
	   He predicted that new home sales would set a second consecutive record high
in 1999 of 908,000 sales but would decline to 840,000 in 2000, still a solid
year.
</P>
<P>
	   "That won't be bad news for most builders because many of them have been
having trouble finding enough construction workers to meet demand," Seiders
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Even with sales falling, new home prices kept rising with the average price
climbing to a record of $209,700 in November, up 4.2 percent from October. The
median, or midpoint, price rose 5.3 percent to $167,400.
</P>
<P>
	   Economists said the price increases were being exaggerated by a drop-off in
sales to low-income buyers because of the rising mortgage rates, while buyers of
more expensive homes remained in the market.
</P>
<P>
	   Home sales fell 31.5 percent in the Northeast to an annual rate of 50,000
units, the weakest showing since 1996. Sales fell in all regions, including
declines of 7.8 percent in the Midwest, 5.4 percent in the West and 3.1 percent
in the South.

<HEADLINE> FAA Computer Glitch Grounds Flights  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Computer problems grounded airplanes Thursday for a second
time this week, frustrating passengers trying to fly in and out of nearly a
dozen cities across the eastern third of the nation, the Federal Aviation
Administration said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds of flights were delayed when a computer at an FAA air traffic
control center in Leesburg, Va., experienced problems transferring data about
6:45 a.m. EST. The computer processes information from radar systems, air
traffic control centers around the East Coast and flight plans filed by airlines
and individual pilots.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Obviously people were inconvenienced, but they were not in danger,'' said
William Shumann, a spokesman at FAA's headquarters in Washington. ``The backup
system is safe, but it's a much slower system with less capacity and so we have
to hold airplanes on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
	   Normal operations resumed at 9:49 a.m., but the delays left passengers
sitting -- up to two hours or more -- aboard planes lined up on runways or
waiting at gates for flights postponed or canceled.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the passengers grounded at Washington Reagan National Airport was Rep.
Edward Pease, R-Ind., a member of the House Transportation Committee's aviation
panel. He was trying to fly to Indianapolis to deliver a speech, but his plane
never took off.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think we had been on the plane for 1 1/2 hours. The flight was
canceled,'' Pease said. ``When we finally turned around and went back to the
gate, there were planes everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
	   Pease said the delay underscores the need for Congress to give the FAA money
to further modernize the air traffic control system, which is currently
undergoing a $13 billion system upgrade. ``There is clearly a need to upgrade
equipment at the FAA and we've known about it for years.''
</P>
<P>
	   David Fuscus, a spokesman for the Air Transport Association of America, the
airlines' trade group, used the outage to call for steady funding from Congress.
``The problem is the system can't handle the traffic,'' he said. ``The system
needs to meet the demand of the American people.''
</P>
<P>
	   However, this problem occurred with a new computer.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Do we have to modernize? Absolutely,'' Shumann said. ``But the irony here
is that the computer that was involved is new. It's been fully operational in
the Washington center only since March.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said the problem has not yet been identified, but it does not appear to
be related to Y2K, the term used to describe glitches that occurred as computers
made the rollover from 1999 to 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   Thursday's delays were experienced by passengers traveling to or from Reagan
National, Dulles International and Baltimore-Washington International; John F.
Kennedy, LaGuardia and Newark, N.J. in greater New York; and Teterboro, N.J.,
Boston, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Raleigh-Durham, N.C., the FAA said.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Letzler of Baldwin, N.Y., said in a telephone interview that his wife
called him by cell phone while sitting for two hours in a plane stuck on the
tarmac at LaGuardia.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They were just sitting there. Everyone was antsy, apparently,'' Letzler
said. ``She was a little upset. She just wanted to know if I had heard anything.
The pilot said that apparently there was some sort of radar problem.''
</P>
<P>
	   Other flights affected were those routed through the airspace controlled by
the FAA center in Leesburg, which covers southern New Jersey, Delaware,
Maryland, Washington, Virginia, eastern West Virginia and eastern North
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There may have been some flights from Chicago to the Washington area that
were also delayed, but no West Coast flights were delayed,'' Shumann said.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday night, a computer malfunction at the FAA's center in Nashua, N.H.,
delayed flights at airports in Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York. FAA
officials said a backup computer system was used when the main computer at the
air traffic control center experienced problems for about three hours.
</P>
<P>
	   Shumann said the problems in Leesburg and Nashua do not point to a systemic
problem at air traffic center computers nationwide.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Weather and traffic volume account for 90 percent of all traffic delays,''
he said. ``Air traffic control outages such as what happened here account for
just under 2 percent of all air traffic delays.''
</P>
<P>
	   Kevin Lamberth, president of a local chapter of Professional Airways Systems
Specialists, which represents FAA employees who maintain air traffic control
equipment, said the computer problem at Leesburg involved a system that stores
flight plans.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This was just a glitch, but we're concerned about all our equipment,''
Lamberth said. ``Most of our technicians spend a lot of time putting out fires.
If we had the proper staffing, we could do more preventative maintenance. Now we
have to fix things as they break.''

<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The witch is back, or will be this fall. Producers are
scouting locations for a sequel to the low-budget blockbuster "The Blair Witch
Project" to be released in October.
</P>
<P>
	   A prequel telling the witch's early history will follow in summer 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   Artisan Entertainment, which bought "Blair Witch" and the sequel rights for
a modest $1 million at last year's Sundance film festival, hopes to rekindle the
magic that made the first film a $140 million smash.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it was the best million dollars anybody ever spent, even when you
see all the numbers in the 'dot com' world," Amir Malin, Artisan president, said
Thursday. "I don't think you've ever seen real returns, as opposed to paper
returns, like 'Blair Witch."'
</P>
<P>
	   The original "Blair Witch" was one of the most profitable movies ever.
Directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez and their company, Haxan Films, shot
the film for about $60,000, with Artisan kicking in about $260,000 more in
post-production costs, Malin said.
</P>
<P>
	   The sequel and prequel each will have budgets of about $7 million to $10
million, still small by Hollywood standards.
</P>
<P>
	   "Blair Witch 2" is scheduled to begin shooting in early February and will be
directed by documentary filmmaker Joe Berlinger, whose movies include the
acclaimed "Brother's Keeper," about a simple-minded rural man accused of killing
his brother.
</P>
<P>
	   Much of the sequel will likely be shot in the Maryland woods where the
original movie took place, Malin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite Berlinger's background, "Blair Witch 2" will not necessarily follow
the documentary pattern of the first movie, Malin said. The first movie was told
through footage supposedly shot by three fictional filmmakers who disappeared in
the woods while making a documentary about a legendary witch.
</P>
<P>
	   The film's inventive marketing on the Internet had some movie-goers
convinced the story of the witch and the vanished filmmakers was real.
</P>
<P>
	   Artisan is keeping the plots and other details about the followup films
under wraps, including whether the three characters from the original, played by
Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard and Michael Williams, will return.
</P>
<P>
	   Myrick, Sanchez and their partners with Haxan will be executive producers on
"Blair Witch 2" but are not directing the movie because they are working on
another film, Malin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Haxan spokesman Jeremy Walker said the filmmakers were unavailable for
comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Malin said the Haxan team will return to write and direct "Blair Witch 3,"
which will span episodes in the witch's history from the 18th century through
the 1990s, leading up to the disappearance of the three filmmakers.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're just hoping we find these three kids," Malin said. "Police have yet
to find the bodies."

<HEADLINE> Country Music Album Sales Decline  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Despite a booming year for the record industry,
sales of country music declined 4.5 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Country music, while still the most popular radio format, sold 69.3 million
albums last year, according to SoundScan, a Hartsdale, N.Y., company that tracks
music sales. It released the figures Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The most successful country album was Shania Twain's "Come on Over," which
sold 5.6 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Industry officials said country is no longer the fad of the moment, as it
was in the 1980s when Garth Brooks became a superstar.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, they said consolidation of the radio industry has led to tighter
playlists as conglomerates put pressure on stations to be more profitable. That
makes it harder to develop new stars and cultivate record buyers.
</P>
<P>
	   Another reason given for the drop is that many traditional country music
fans have become alienated by the influence of pop on country.
</P>
<P>
	   "What we're doing is we're giving away the music to other formats and we're
frustrating the fans of our own format," said Evelyn Shriver, president of the
country division of Asylum Records.
</P>
<P>
	   The record industry overall sold 754.8 million in 1999, up 6.1 percent. But
among country performers, only Ms. Twain and the Dixie Chicks (with 3.5 million
sales of "Wide Open Spaces") made the year's list of top 10 sellers.
</P>
<P>
	   The country industry is reliant on a select group of superstars. Brooks, the
Dixie Chicks and Faith Hill each have two of the 10 best-selling country albums
of the year. And four of the top 10 were released in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   "Trying to add some artists to that mix and create diversity is a priority
for us this year," said Ed Benson of the Country Music Association, a trade
organization that promotes country music.
</P>
<P>
	   Brooks, 37, the biggest-selling artist in country music history, has
indicated he may retire at the end of 2000 to spend more time with his three
young daughters. That could be a big blow to the Nashville.
</P>
<P>
	   The answer, industry leaders agreed, is developing new stars.
</P>
<P>
	   Nashville has survived such trends before. The industry rebounded from a
decline in the mid-1980s to reach unprecedented heights. Even now, far more
country albums are being sold than a decade ago.

<HEADLINE> Reno Backs Ruling on Cuban Boy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Hundreds of Cuban-Americans chanting ``Liberty! Liberty!''
blocked intersections and cut off access to the Port of Miami on Thursday to
protest the U.S. government's decision to return 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez to
his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Police arrested more than 70 people, including two prominent Cuban exile
leaders, for refusing to disperse.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, Attorney General Janet Reno essentially ruled out any chance
she will reverse Wednesday's decision by the Immigration and Naturalization
Service to send the boy back to the communist island.
</P>
<P>
	   For the past six weeks, Elian has been the subject of protests in Florida
and Cuba -- and in the middle of an international debate over where he belongs.
Fidel Castro kept up the pressure with another government-orchestrated
demonstration Thursday in Havana.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy was found Thanksgiving Day clinging to an inner tube at sea after
his mother, stepfather and eight other people drowned while trying to reach
Florida by boat. He has been living in Miami with his paternal great-uncle and
great-aunt.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian, whose whereabouts were kept secret after Wednesday's decision,
arrived back at his relatives' home Thursday afternoon. His great-uncle hoisted
Elian on his shoulders and the boy smiled and waved to cheering supporters
outside the house.
</P>
<P>
	   His cousin Marisleysis Gonzalez said Elian had not been told of the decision
to send him back because it may not prove final. Lawyers for the boy's American
relatives asked Reno to reverse the decision and planned to request a
restraining order from a federal judge.
</P>
<P>
	   But Reno said she had consulted with INS Commissioner Doris Meissner and
agreed with the decision. ``Based on all the information we have to date, I see
no basis for reversing,'' Reno said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The INS has until Jan. 14 to send the boy back.
</P>
<P>
	   In Miami, several hundred protesters gathered outside a downtown federal
building, pushed back police barricades and marched several blocks to the Port
of Miami, where most of the arrests were made.
</P>
<P>
	   About 50 officers in riot gear guarded the port's entrance in the shadow of
Freedom Tower, a former customs building where many Cubans entered the United
States in the 1960s. About 780,000 Cuban-Americans live in Miami-Dade County,
accounting for 35 percent of its 2.1 million residents.
</P>
<P>
	   Demonstrators shouted ``Clinton! Coward! Miami hates you!'' They carried
posters in English and Spanish and waved U.S. and Cuban flags.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm defending my rights because where the rights of one person end, the
rights of another begin,'' said Meri Pino, 70, who refused to move from the port
entry.
</P>
<P>
	   Police arrested people who sat on the pavement and others who crossed police
lines. Those arrested included Cuban exile leaders Ramon Sanchez, head of the
Democracy Movement, and Jose Basulto, founder of Brothers to the Rescue, an
anti-Castro group.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're not going to let anyone get hurt,'' said police Lt. Bill Schwartz.
``We're not going to let the streets be taken over by a mob.''
</P>
<P>
	   The headquarters of Royal Caribbean International, a leading cruise line, is
on port property, and the demonstration kept employees from leaving for several
hours. No major cruise ships were in port Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Elsewhere, small groups of protesters intermittently blocked intersections.
Gov. Jeb Bush lifted tolls on highways near protests to relieve rush-hour
congestion.
</P>
<P>
	   At least 10 people carrying a large Cuban flag sat down in the middle of a
main downtown street, crippling traffic during a downpour. Motorists honked
their horns in irritation or support.
</P>
<P>
	   During the morning rush-hour, two dump trucks and a pickup truck slowed all
three lanes of downtown-bound traffic to about 20 mph on the major east-west
route in Miami. The Florida Highway Patrol issued several citations and
threatened to arrest drivers slowing traffic.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm Haitian and they send all the Haitians back,'' motorist Fritz Rene,
31, said at one blocked intersection as he was trying to get to work. ``Whenever
anything happens to the Cubans, they go crazy.''
</P>
<P>
	   Marisleysis Gonzalez said she supported the demonstrators but asked them to
remain peaceful.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are a lot of Cubans here who have suffered and they are willing to
stop this because the laws here are not being fair,'' the boy's cousin said
outside her home. ``They haven't given us the opportunity to speak on behalf of
him.''
</P>
<P>
	   American officials had suggested that Elian's father come to Florida to get
his son. The U.S. National Council of Churches said the boy's relatives in Cuba
want the organization to bring the boy back.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Deploys Police Amid Protests  </HEADLINE>
   By CARLOS CISTERNAS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Police firing tear gas dispersed about 1,000
demonstrators marching on the presidential palace Thursday to demand President
Jamil Mahuad's resignation.
</P>
<P>
	   Similar protests over Mahuad and his handling of the economy were held in
Ecuador's largest city, Guayaquil, as well as the southern city of Cuenca.
Defying a countrywide state of emergency, the students tried to block traffic by
setting small fires in streets but were quickly driven away by police.
</P>
<P>
	   The state of emergency empowered the armed forces to maintain order and
contain demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
	   In Quito's center, heavily armed riot police, some in armored vehicles,
formed a cordon around the presidential palace. Protesters were dispersed about
six blocks from the site.
</P>
<P>
	   In several areas, large numbers of soldiers and police were patrolling
provincial highways and guarding gas stations, state buildings and streets in
the cities, radio reported. Businesses in major cities, however, were operating
normally.
</P>
<P>
	   The leftist-led Unified Workers Front, Ecuador's main labor federation with
600,000 workers, had announced the series of protests against Mahuad's
government, Congress and Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
	   The Harvard-educated Mahuad has faced three national strikes since taking
office in August 1998. His critics accuse him of incompetence in resolving
Ecuador's worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.
</P>
<P>
	   Inflation topped 60 percent in 1999, the economy shrank 7 percent, and the
value of Ecuador's currency plunged 30 percent in one year, from 7,000 sucres to
the dollar to 23,000 sucres today.
</P>
<P>
	   Mahuad has said he plans to finish his term, which runs until January 2003.
The armed forces have expressed their support for him.
</P>
<P>
	   More marches were planned for later in the day Thursday, but so far turnout
has been lower than expected. Organizers said they were hoping for the same
massive response that in February 1997 helped oust former President Abdala
Bucaram. Congress kicked Bucaram out of office for ``mental incompetence'' after
at least two million people took to the streets in major cities throughout the
small Andean country of 12 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The Popular Front, a group of unions, student organizations and neighborhood
associations, joined the front in Thursday's protests.
</P>
<P>
	   Luis Villacis, president of the Popular Front, said protesters had started
blocking provincial highways. He appealed to Ecuadorians to take to the streets.
</P>
<P>
	   Government spokesman Vladimiro Alvarez said authorities were bracing for
violence and had information about where Molotov cocktails and bombs had been
prepared.

<HEADLINE> Rector May End Mexico Univ. Strike  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The head of Latin America's largest university got
approval Thursday for a plan to completely overhaul the institution's bylaws in
hopes of ending an eight-month student strike.
</P>
<P>
	   Rector Juan Ramon de la Fuente's proposal calls for the election of a
500-member University Congress made up of faculty, students, researchers and
workers, to revise the bylaws of the National Autonomous University of Mexico.
The election will be held within the next 45 days.
</P>
<P>
	   The 120-member University Council, made up of faculty representatives,
overwhelmingly approved the plan after almost five hours of deliberation.
</P>
<P>
	   The university, popularly known as UNAM, has been shut down since April,
locking out 268,000 students.
</P>
<P>
	   Strikers initially protested a plan to raise tuition from the equivalent of
a few cents to $140 annually. Though authorities dropped the fee hike, the
demands grew to include automatic admission for UNAM prep school graduates and
relaxation of academic levels.
</P>
<P>
	   Negotiations to end the strike have repeatedly deadlocked.
</P>
<P>
	   In November, de la Fuente replaced Francisco Barnes de Castro, the rector
who had backed the fee hike and had been unable to resolve the strike.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, 500 students staged a sit-in outside the building where de la
Fuente was meeting with faculty members. The students held signs saying they
rejected his latest proposal.

<HEADLINE> Shellfish Warning Issued in France  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- France's food safety watchdog on Thursday recommended a ban on
the sale of shellfish and salt from coastlines most affected by oil spilled from
a sunken tanker.
</P>
<P>
	   The food safety agency, known as AFSSA, said that any shellfish harvested
after the oil spill and not immediately placed in purified water should not be
sold.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency also recommended a government ban on fishing from the shore in
the region, and said fish caught at sea should be tested before sale to make
sure they are not contaminated.
</P>
<P>
	   The Maltese-registered tanker, ``Erika'', broke up and sank on Dec. 12,
spilling 3 million gallons of heavy oil into the waters off the picturesque
Atlantic coast.
</P>
<P>
	   The tanker was chartered by Franco-Belgian oil group TotalFina to transport
oil from the Netherlands to Italy.
</P>
<P>
	   The oil has since begun to wash up on land. Specialists and volunteers are
still scraping the oil from 250 miles of coastline.
</P>
<P>
	   AFSSA also recommended Thursday that salt and seaweed from the ``visibly
affected'' coasts should not be sold.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency said it expected to produce a more detailed analysis of the risks
to food once it had an exact breakdown of the components contained in the leaked
oil.
</P>
<P>
	   Another worry for environmentalists is some 6 million gallons of oil still
contained in the holds of the broken vessel, most in the rear half of the
tanker.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Rejoins Mideast Talks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- President Clinton plunged back into slow-moving
Mideast peace talks as face-to-face negotiations between Israelis and Syrians
ground to a halt.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. aim is a treaty that would exchange the Golan Heights, a strategic
border territory Israel has held for more than three decades, for diplomatic and
economic relations with Syria.
</P>
<P>
	   Syria began Wednesday to outline its offer in a mixed committee under the
supervision of Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk. A committee on new
border security measures met all day, as well.
</P>
<P>
	   But there were no face-to-face negotiations over Syria's key demand: a
specific timetable for Israel to relinquish the Golan Heights, which Syria lost
in the 1967 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
	   The State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said the talks, now in their
fourth day, were still ``chugging along.'' But he said the American hosts were
dissatisfied with the pace and would like to see it accelerated.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's intervention Thursday was his third of the week. On tap were
separate meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian Foreign
Minister Farouk al-Sharaa after conferring with Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright on her own 90-minute meeting with al-Sharaa.
</P>
<P>
	   The president, wearing a leather flight jacket, waved to bystanders as he
alighted from his helicopter and made no statement.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, Clinton's assistant for national security, Sandy Berger, told
reporters to ``not underestimate the degree of difficulty'' in the negotiations
being held near this oldest town in West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These are very difficult issues that divide the parties,'' Berger said.
``They've been at war three times since the 1940s. There are very strong views
on both sides.''
</P>
<P>
	   In contrast to discontent within the Syrian delegation, Barak and his
delegation appeared pleased that the negotiations were focused on peace terms
and security measures, such as installing an early-warning system at the border
and clearing it of troops.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak found time Wednesday to jog and do calisthenics at a gymnasium in the
hotel the two delegations are sharing behind police barricades.
</P>
<P>
	   An Israel source, insisting on anonymity, said the talks were likely to go
into a second week -- after a weekend break -- and that Barak planned to stay
on.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin said that Albright, meanwhile, had directed her assistants to prepare
a ``working document'' detailing negotiations held in 1996 as well as talks last
month in Washington and here this week.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That will enable us at the appropriate time to move forward,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked if Israel could be secure without retaining the Golan Heights, which
overlooks its northeastern towns that were targets of cross-border attacks
before 1967, Rubin said, ``Israel is going to have to make that decision.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We believe that Israel has legitimate security needs and we believe those
needs can be met,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton has assured Israel and Syria he was willing to play a helpful and
consistent role in trying to iron out their differences.
</P>
<P>
	   Although two trips are on his schedule for next week -- to Arizona and Texas
on Monday and Tuesday and to New York on Thursday -- White House press secretary
Joe Lockhart said the peace talks would take precedence.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, the Sadat Peace Foundation called on al-Sharaa to convince
the world and the U.S. Congress that Syria was interested in peace with Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   The private group -- named for the late Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, who
made peace with Israel in 1979 -- said in a statement that Syria's hard-line
position strengthens the Israeli hard-liners and raises questions about Syria's
resolve to seek peace.

	   World Bank To Offer Bonds Online
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The World Bank said today it plans to launch
its first global electronic bond offering, a $3 billion issue that
will be offered, distributed and traded online. An announcement
said the firms of Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co. and Lehman Brothers would be
the lead managers on the offering. It gave no date for the launch
nor how long it would take for the bond to mature.

	   Accounting Firm Violations Found
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A review led by an independent consultant has
found thousands of violations by accounting giant
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP -- and many of its partners -- of rules
requiring accountants to remain independent from companies they
audit. The Securities and Exchange Commission, which made the
consultant's review public today, said its investigation of New
York-based PricewaterhouseCoopers is continuing. A year ago, the
firm agreed in a settlement to conduct the review after the SEC
alleged that some of its accountants owned stock in corporations
they audited. Dave Nestor, a spokesman for PricewaterhouseCoopers,
said he had no comment on the report but provided a copy of a
letter sent by chairman Nicholas G. Moore and chief executive James
J. Schiro to the firm's partners. The letter termed the report
embarrassing. The executives added that that the violatons of the
independence rules mentioned in the report, while unacceptable,
``did not in any way impair the professional objectivity and
integrity'' of the company's audits.

	   Sales of New Homes Fall 7.1 Pct.
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Higher mortgage rates dampened sales of new
single-family homes in November, the Commerce Department said
today. They fell 7.1 percent, the biggest decline in two years. The
drop followed a 9 percent October increase. Even with the setback,
homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 865,000
units in November. Economists had been predicting a slowdown since
June, when the Federal Reserve started pushing interest rates
higher in an effort to dampen such interest-sensitive sectors of
the economy as housing.
</P>
<P>
	   Jobless Claims Jump by 33,000
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of Americans filing new claims for
unemployment benefits rose by 33,000 last week, the largest
increase in a year, the government reported today. The Labor
Department said the number of new applications for jobless benefits
climbed to 309,000 for the week ending Saturday, the first time
this figure has been above the 300,000-level in 13 weeks. Jobless

	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Even with all the hype about the Internet during
the holiday season, shoppers still piled into the nation's big
retail chains and spent more money than storeowners had expected.
Many brick-and-mortar merchants reported today that sales in
December were the strongest for the month since 1992 and they made
it through Christmas virtually unscathed by e-commerce competition.

<HEADLINE> Destroyers Will Use New Technology  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Navy said Thursday its next-generation destroyer will
be the first class of ships powered by an all-electric propulsion system so
efficient that each ship would need a crew of 95 instead of the 300 on today's
destroyers.
</P>
<P>
	   Navy Secretary Richard Danzig, at a news conference, said the Pentagon
budget to be submitted to Congress in early February will propose spending about
$250 million in the next six years to develop the ``electric drive'' technology
to be used on the DD-21 ships.
</P>
<P>
	   Eventually other classes of surface ships -- and perhaps submarines, too --
would be built with the electric drive, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Navy plans to build 32 DD-21 destroyers at a cost of $25 billion. The
first is expected to enter the fleet in about 10 years. Two contractor teams --
one led by Bath Ironworks and Lockheed-Martin and the other by Ingalls
Shipbuilding and Raytheon Corp. -- are competing for the contract to build the
new destroyers.
</P>
<P>
	   The surface ships in today's Navy -- aside from nuclear-powered aircraft
carriers -- are powered by gas turbine or diesel engines that are attached to
reduction gears. Those gears reduce the speed of rotation of the drive shaft so
that it turns the ship's propeller at the appropriate speeds.
</P>
<P>
	   In the DD-21, the same gas turbine or diesel engines will be used. But the
reduction gears, which take up a tremendous amount of space and are difficult to
maintain, will be gone. In their place will be smaller, more efficient and
quieter electrical generators attached to electric motors. The motors will
control the speed of the propeller independent of the engines, and there will be
no need for a long drive shaft.
</P>
<P>
	   The result is a propulsion system that takes up much less space on board,
requires fewer people to operate and maintain, and is quieter. The ships also
will have more electric power available for on-board weapons and will be less
vulnerable to attack because the quieter engines will make them stealthier,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``From a warfighter's perspective this is a very important development,''
said Rear Adm. Michael Mullen, director of the Navy's surface warfare division.

<HEADLINE> Census Seeks Head Count Workers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Uncle Sam wants you!
</P>
<P>
	   The Census Bureau launched an effort Thursday to hire a half-million
part-time workers to conduct the national head count.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our goal is to have a pool of local people who are familiar with their
communities and committed to a successful count in their own neighborhoods,''
Census Director Kenneth Prewitt said at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
	   His agency has 520 offices open across the country with each needing to hire
800 to 1,000 people for four to six weeks around census day, April 1. He said
the agency will spend $9.5 million on help-wanted advertising.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall, the census is on schedule, Prewitt said, with 150,000 people hired
so far and a pool of about 1 million applicants. He said the agency wants an
overall pool of about 3 million to choose from.
</P>
<P>
	   Those hired so far include about 6,000 welfare-to-work applicants, he said.
And Congress is considering special exemptions so Social Security and public
assistance recipients can take Census jobs without losing benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   Legal residents aged 18 and older are eligible to work for the Census
Bureau. They do not need to be citizens, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In many areas the agency is seeking bilingual workers. Pay varies from $8.25
to $18.50 per hour.
</P>
<P>
	   Prewitt urged anyone interested in a Census job to call the agency's
toll-free number, 1-888-325-7733.
</P>
<P>
	   Prewitt said other aspects of the effort are also on schedule, including:
</P>
<P>
	   --The first local counts will get underway in two weeks in rural parts of
Alaska.
</P>
<P>
	   --Printing is ahead of schedule with all 123 million long forms finished and
the work about 75 percent complete on the short forms.
</P>
<P>
	   --The agency has verified 20 million rural addresses, adding 10,000 new
ones, and is now sending the 100 million city addresses to local governments for
verification.
</P>
<P>
	   --Advertising campaigns are beginning and will increase leading up to census
day, in an effort to improve on the 65 percent of households that returned forms
by mail in 1990.
</P>
<P>
	   --The agency has obtained 4.5 million square feet of office space, 17,000
telephones, 100,000 pieces of furniture and thousands of pieces of office
equipment.
</P>
<P>
	   Prewitt said about two-thirds of the workers hired so far are women, many
seeking a second part-time job. And he noted that the majority of people who
worked for the agency in dress rehearsals are coming back for the final count.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall there are about 860,000 jobs to be filled, but not all at the same
time, so Prewitt said the agency expects many people will do more than one of
them.
</P>
<P>
	   The effort to count the estimated 274 million people in the United States is
a decade-long effort, Prewitt stressed, noting that planning for the 2010 count
is already underway.
</P>
<P>
	   He warned that ``the conditions that make it difficult to count this country
completely have magnified since 1990,'' including the presence of more
immigrants, a larger non-English speaking population, a more mobile population,
more total households and more irregular living arrangements.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We believe we can do a basic enumeration better than we did in 1990,'' he
said, but that does not necessarily mean a more accurate census.
</P>
<P>
	   Prewitt said he expects there will still be an undercount, in particular
among minorities, and the agency will need to do a post-census quality check to
measure that undercount and correct it in the overall totals.

<HEADLINE> Money Funds Up by $15.96B  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Assets of the nation's retail money market mutual funds
rose by $15.96 billion in the latest week to $949.15 billion, the Investment
Company Institute said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Assets of taxable money market funds in the retail category rose by $11.52
billion to $787.75 billion for the week ended Wednesday, the Washington-based
mutual fund trade group said. Tax-exempt fund assets rose by $4.44 billion to
$161.40 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Assets of institutional money market funds fell by $3.75 billion to $688.52
billion for the same period. Among institutional funds, taxable money market
fund assets fell by $6.42 billion to $636.95 billion; assets of tax-exempt funds
rose by $2.67 billion to $51.56 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Total money market assets stood at $1.638 trillion for the week.
</P>
<P>
	   Assets for the previous week were revised to $1.625 trillion to reflect
reporting errors and a change in the number of funds reporting.
</P>
<P>
	   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds ell in the week
ended Tuesday to 4.90 percent from 5.13 percent the previous week, said IBC's
Money Fund Report, a trade journal published in Ashland, Mass., by IBC Financial
Data Inc. The 30-day average yield fell to 5.05 percent from 5.08 percent, IBC
Financial Data said.
</P>
<P>
	   The seven-day compounded yield fell to 5.02 percent from 5.26 percent the
previous week, and the 30-day compounded yield fell to 5.18 percent from 5.21
percent, IBC Financial Data said.

<P>
	   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was 46 days, down
from 48 days, IBC Financial Data said.
</P>
<P>
	   The online service bankrate.com said its survey of 100 leading commercial
banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks in the nation's 10
largest markets showed the annual percentage yield available on money market
accounts as of Wednesday was unchanged at 2.07 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based unit of Intelligent Life Corp. said the
annual percentage yield available on interest-bearing checking accounts rose to
0.85 percent from 0.84 percent a week earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Bankrate.com said the annual percentage yield was 4.63 percent on six-month
certificates of deposit, down from 4.66 percent the previous week. Yields were
5.01 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 4.99 percent; 5.23 percent on 2 1/2-year
CDs, up from 5.20 percent; and 5.54 percent on 5-year CDs, up from 5.50 percent.

<HEADLINE> Platinum at 6-Week Low; Cocoa Falls  </HEADLINE>
    By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Platinum prices plummeted to a six-week low Thursday on the New York
Mercantile Exchange in a continuing selloff by investors bracing for Russia to
resume its massive exports of the metal.
</P>
<P>
	   In other futures markets, cocoa fell as a result of military tensions in the
Ivory Coast, and corn rose.
</P>
<P>
	   After declining along with other precious metals at the start of the new
year when Y2K fears fizzled, platinum's plunge steepened Tuesday on news that
acting Russian President Vladimir Putin had signed quotas for the export of
platinum this year.
</P>
<P>
	   That resumption would return the world's No. 2 producer of platinum to the
market; its yearlong absence shrank world supplies and drove prices to a
two-year high three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest selloff by funds sent the price for the March contract down
another $7.90 to $394 an ounce Thursday after dipping as low as $388.10. The
closing price is some 10 percent lower than the peak of $435 reached on Dec. 14.
</P>
<P>
	   "The bottom line is that Russia's one step closer to making platinum
exports," said Dave Meger, a senior metals analyst for Alaron Trading Corp. in
Chicago. "But it's one thing for them to say something and entirely another for
them to do it.
</P>
<P>
	   "Right now the market's extremely oversold," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   March cocoa futures shot up $10 to $841 a ton on New York's Coffee, Sugar &AMP;
Cocoa Exchange on word of fresh tension in Ivory Coast, the world's top cocoa
producer. Reports said army troops were agitated after the formation of a new
government on Wednesday, with shots fired at a barracks and soldiers stationed
outside the state radio station to quell any disturbances.
</P>
<P>
	   Also buoying prices was a report from the Netherlands Cocoa Association, the
world's biggest cocoa processor, that it ground nearly 3 percent fewer beans in
1999. That signals a decline in world demand for chocolate.
</P>
<P>
	   Corn prices went in the opposite direction of other grains and soybeans,
which declined on the Chicago Board of Trade, after Brazil bought 80,000 tons of
corn from the United States instead of neighboring Argentina, its primary
supplier. Traders also cited rumors that Brazil may buy a total of 250,000 tons.
Both Brazil and Argentina have been affected by drought.
</P>
<P>
	   March corn settled up  3/4 cent to $2.03 3/4 a bushel after rising as high
as $2.05 3/4.

<HEADLINE> Squirt Guns Sold for Science Funds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Not many companies encourage their employees to shoot
each other with squirt guns at work. Then again, not many companies have squirt
guns with glow-in-the-dark ammo.
</P>
<P>
	   Prolume does. And its new line of squirt guns is designed to raise money for
deadly serious research.
</P>
<P>
	   The partnership of doctors and scientists is duplicating luminescent genes
from jellyfish and other sea creatures and using them, for now, to fill up
squirt guns. Next up could be glow-in-the-dark soda and beer.
</P>
<P>
	   The idea is to raise enough money from selling novelty items to underwrite
more important pursuits, such as using the glowing genes to identify cancerous
tumors or detect nerve gas.
</P>
<P>
	   The research is enormously expensive, with three days of boat rental for
deep-sea fishing trips costing $35,000, the company says.
</P>
<P>
	   Prolume's catch -- jellyfish, sea pansies, dragon fish, sea worms, squid,
mollusks and other sea creatures -- provides luminescent genes that can be
copied and attached to other genes. Then, they can be made to glow when other
kinds of chemicals are present, creating what the company calls "biosensors."
</P>
<P>
	   The field is "bursting with activity right now," says J. Woodland Hastings,
a researcher of glow-in-the-dark creatures at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
	   To raise money, Prolume last month began selling $4.99 squirt guns loaded
with powdered genes that were replicated from a jellyfish caught off the coast
of Washington state.
</P>
<P>
	   Add some distilled water to the chamber, and fire. As the liquid squirts it
looks just like water. But when it hits something -- anything that contains
calcium, which can be found on people and all kinds of other things -- it lights
up.
</P>
<P>
	   The company maintains the product is safe.
</P>
<P>
	   The first batch of 2,000 squirt guns sold out quickly last month. Now,
Prolume is working on a two-chambered water rifle that is supposed to shoot long
distances. So far, the company has run into some trouble getting it to fire
correctly.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is what happens when you get a surgeon trying to make a squirt gun,"
says Dr. Bruce Bryan, Prolume's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
	   Other possibilities include glow-in-the-dark hair mousse, ink and cake
frosting, but Prolume also recently received a $298,000 grant from the National
Institutes of Health to start putting the genes to work on more serious tasks.
</P>
<P>
	   Sea creatures use light to communicate or to distract attackers or prey.
Bryan, 46, was enchanted by them as a 19-year-old scuba diver off Zuma Beach,
Calif., and wondered about using them as raw material.
</P>
<P>
	   Chris Szent-Gyorgyi, a company vice president, says light-up genes might
someday used in allergy or drug tests or nerve gas detectors. During the 1970s,
the Army used glow-in-the-dark genes to detect explosives.
</P>
<P>
	   One application that Bryan admits is far off is selling surgeons spray
bottles of fluids they could use to identify tumors. In theory, it would work by
having certain genes in a fluid -- which would be swallowed by a patient the day
before surgery -- attach themselves to cancer cells.
</P>
<P>
	   Then, a second fluid containing complementary glow-in-the-dark genes would
be sprayed on an organ or the skin during an operation. When the two genes
combined, they would light up -- showing doctors where to operate.
</P>
<P>
	   The hope is that the tumor would glow when the operating room lights are
switched off. Different colors could indicate different diseases.

<HEADLINE> Web Auction Co. Settles Complaint  </HEADLINE>
   By TED BRIDIS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An online auction company agreed to settle charges by the
Federal Trade Commission that it sent deceptive e-mail to customers of its
Internet auction rival, eBay, federal regulators said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   ReverseAuction.Com was accused of sending unsolicited e-mail warning eBay
customers that their online identities ``will expire soon'' and encouraging them
to visit its own Web site.
</P>
<P>
	   ReverseAuction, which said it now has 35,000 customers, called the FTC's
action ``unprecedented.'' It said that it disagreed with the charges but that it
signed the consent order ``to complete a pending round of financing (and) put
this matter behind it.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``No reasonable person who read our e-mail could have been misled,'' said
Ron Johnston, ReverseAuction's chief executive officer. ``No one could have been
deceived or harmed by our e-mail.''
</P>
<P>
	   In the e-mail, the company said: ``As long as you visit us now and claim
your ID, no one else can get it! Then when you decide to trade on our site, you
will be able to use your carefully built reputation.''
</P>
<P>
	   The FTC's complaint, accepted 5-0 by the commissioners, alleged that
ReverseAuction committed deceptive or unfair acts in violation of federal law
because the company allegedly told customers its actions were authorized by
eBay.
</P>
<P>
	   But the complaint, filed Thursday in federal court, includes a copy of the
e-mails sent by ReverseAuction, which said explicitly: ``eBay is a registered
trademark owned by eBay Inc., which does not authorize or endorse
ReverseAuction.com).''
</P>
<P>
	   The settlement prohibits ReverseAuction from making misrepresentations and
to warn customers who registered with the company as a result of those e-mails
that it knew their eBay identities were not expiring and that it was not acting
on behalf of its competitor.
</P>
<P>
	   Two commissioners, Orson Swindle and Thomas B. Leary, agreed that
ReverseAuction's e-mails were deceptive but disagreed they were unfair. The two
said the actions did not meet the legal standard of causing or likely to cause
``substantial injury to consumers that is not reasonably avoidable by consumers
themselves.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 130; Nasdaq Down 150  </HEADLINE>
    By EILEEN GLANTON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks fell for a third straight session
Thursday as investors shifted money from the pricey shares that dominated
trading in 1999 to blue-chip stalwarts like Caterpillar, 3M and Procter &AMP;
Gamble.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 130.61 to 11,253.26. The Dow's
strongest component was 3M, maker of Post-It notes and Scotch tape; 3M rose 7
1/2 to 100 3/4 during Wall Street's regular session.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq composite index, dominated by technology stocks, fell 150.41 to
3,727.13. It was the second-largest point loss in history for the Nasdaq, which
has tumbled nearly 10 percent since closing at a new record on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader market measures were mixed, with the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
rising 1.34 to 1,403.45.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks continued the reversal of fortunes that has marked Wall Street this
week. Technology stocks, which helped the Nasdaq composite to an unprecedented
86 percent gain in 1999, have plummeted as investors collected profits.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, cyclical companies, which thrive in a booming economy but
languished last year in the frenzy for technology stocks, are soaring.
</P>
<P>
	   "Investors are selling Yahoo! to buy Caterpillar," said Charles Pradilla,
chief investment strategist at SG Cowen Securities in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, Yahoo! was among the Nasdaq's steepest decliners, plummeting 42 5/16
to 368 3/16. Qualcomm, the best-performing stock in the Nasdaq and the Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500 last year, fell 16 3/8 to 140 1/16.
</P>
<P>
	   While analysts again discounted much of the technology selloff as
long-overdue profit-taking, fears of lower earnings for two high-tech firms
depressed the sector. Personal computer maker Gateway warned late Wednesday its
fourth-quarter profits would miss expectations due to a slowdown in sales. The
company blamed Year 2000 computer worries and component supply problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Gateway, which fell steeply in extended-hours trading Wednesday, bounced
back Thursday, ending up 4 11/16 at 59 11/16. But traders said the company's
warning contributed to weakness in other computer makers' share prices. Dell
fell 1 15/16 to 48, and Apple lost 9 to 95.
</P>
<P>
	   MCI WorldCom fell 4 1/16 to 47 3/16 after influential Salomon Smith Barney
analyst Jack Grubman lowered his earnings and revenue estimates for fiscal year
2000.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, most analysts expect the sector to rebound. Selling this week has
been exacerbated by investors' desire to delay capital-gains taxes until 2001.
Once investors find themselves flush with cash, many will return to the sector
that rewarded them so richly in 1999, said Larry Rice, chief investment officer
at Josephthal &AMP; Co. in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   "These stocks will bounce back," he said. "There are too many people who are
still eager to buy. And these companies still hold great potential for making a
lot of money."
</P>
<P>
	   In the meantime, however, cyclical stocks thrived amid growing concerns that
the Federal Reserve will soon raise interest rates in an effort to stave off
inflation. Those stocks are viewed as safe havens that are less prone to
interest rate fluctuations than high-tech stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   Caterpillar rose 2 1/2 to 51 5/8, Procter &AMP; Gamble gained 4 3/4 to 107 7/8,
and Exxon Mobil rose 4 3/16 to 85 3/16. Analysts applauded the move toward those
long-neglected companies.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think the market will broaden, and we will have less of the mono-minded
focus on technology than we did last year," Pradilla said.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology stocks may suffer a difficult start on Friday. Late Thursday
afternoon, Lucent Technologies said it expects first-quarter earnings to come in
well below analysts' forecasts.
</P>
<P>
	   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-3 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange. NYSE composite volume totaled 1.31 billion shares, compared with
1.32 billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 3.49 to 475.34.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas indexes continued to slip amid fears of higher interest rates in
the United States. Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 2.02 percent. Germany's
Xetra DAX index fell 0.4 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 lost 1.4 percent, and
France's CAC-40 fell 0.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Continues Rise Against Yen  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar continued to rise against the yen Thursday, but
Japanese financial authorities remain concerned that their currency is too high.
The pound rose on signs of economic strength in England.
</P>
<P>
	   In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 105.40 Japanese yen, up
from 104.35 yen. The dollar has been rising back against the yen since the Bank
of Japan stepped into currency markets earlier this week to sell yen for
dollars.
</P>
<P>
	   But officials in Tokyo still say they feel their currency is overvalued and
poses a threat to an economic recovery. The high yen hurts Japanese exporting
companies like Sony and Toyota by shrinking the value of earnings they bring
back to Japan from overseas.
</P>
<P>
	   Japan's vice finance minister, Haruhiko Kuroda, told reporters Thursday in
Tokyo that the yen was still too strong. "In terms of fundamentals, it is still
clearly excessive," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dollar-euro trading was quiet. The euro was quoted at $1.0315 in late New
York trading, unchanged from its level late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The British pound rose to $1.6480 from $1.6418 after a report showed a
strong increase in retail sales in Britain last month, the latest sign leading
analysts to expect a rate increase from the Bank of England next week.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar also was quoted at 1.5555 Swiss francs, just above 1.5554 late
Wednesday, and 1.4589 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4485.
</P>
<P>
	   Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no longer
traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. Since the euro was
even with its previous rate against the dollar, the dollar also remained flat
against currencies participating in the euro.
</P>
<P>
	   Based on Thursday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8958 German marks;
6.3586 French francs; and 1,877.07 Italian lire.

<HEADLINE> Breast Implant Ruling Appealed  </HEADLINE>
    By JIM SUHR Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- Dow Corning Corp. and lawyers for women who sued the company
over silicone breast implants appealed Thursday to a federal judge to overturn a
ruling they said could unravel the complicated settlement plan.
</P>
<P>
	   The appeal asks U.S. District Judge Denise Page Hood to throw out federal
Bankruptcy Judge Arthur Spector's Dec. 21 ruling that allows women who voted
against the $3.2 billion settlement to sue Dow Corning's corporate parents.
</P>
<P>
	   The settlement had barred further lawsuits against Dow Chemical and Corning
Corp. over silicone implants. That clause is among keys to the settlement, part
of a $4.5 billion bankruptcy reorganization plan for Dow Corning.
</P>
<P>
	   Dow Corning and the Tort Claimants Committee -- representing thousands of
women with silicone implants the company once made -- had called Spector's
ruling confusing and a potential catalyst for more litigation.
</P>
<P>
	   The company and the claimants committee has called the "third-party release"
clause "fundamental" to the settlement plan overwhelmingly approved after years
of contentious negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   "Without the third-party release, there is no closure of breast implant
litigation against our shareholders or Dow Corning," Gary E. Anderson, Dow
Corning's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Spector ruled last month he lacked the power to release Dow Chemical and
Corning, and that the plan didn't appear designed to grant such a release
anyway. Dow Corning disputed both points.
</P>
<P>
	   Spector's opinion also said women who voted to approve the settlement would
be barred from suing the companies. It's unclear how many women his opinion
might affect; 112,774 women voted on the plan last year, with 94 percent
approving.
</P>
<P>
	   Spector said there was no reason to assume allowing claims from women who
voted against the deal would create an undue burden on the companies. He said
many such claims already have been filed.
</P>
<P>
	   The no-lawsuit release in the settlement had been fought by lawyers for a
group of women in Nevada, where the state's supreme court has upheld damages
against Dow Chemical over silicone breast implants, opening the door for similar
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
	   Dow Corning, which no longer makes silicone breast implants, declared
bankruptcy in 1995 after thousands of women sued over implants. Women have
blamed leaking gel from the implants for lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, body
aches, fatigue, memory loss and hardening of the breasts.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the proposed settlement, women who blame illnesses on Dow Corning
silicone breast implants could get between $12,000 and $300,000 each. Women
could also receive up to $25,000 for ruptured or leaking implants, and up to
$5,000 for implant removal.
</P>
<P>
	   Dow Corning spokesman T. Michael Jackson said Thursday he could not
speculate how soon Hood might take up the appeal. Call's to Hood's office
Thursday afternoon went unanswered.

<HEADLINE> Hastert:Tax Relief Heads GOP Agenda  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans are drawing up plans to eliminate the
portion of the national debt held by the public, now estimated at $3.7 trillion,
House Speaker Dennis Hastert said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Hastert, R-Ill., also said after a GOP leadership conference that tax relief
for married couples and for parents saving for education costs will be among the
first legislative items lawmakers will take up when they return later this
month.
</P>
<P>
	   Hastert's office said it was the first time the speaker publicly committed
to eliminating the debt. With the recent emergence of budget surpluses, the
Clinton administration also is talking about abolishing the public debt by 2015.
</P>
<P>
	   Hastert said his plan, too, would envision an end to the debt in 10 years to
15 years. He declined to provide any specifics on how the GOP planned to
eliminate the debt, saying only that details would follow.
</P>
<P>
	   The last time the debt was eliminated was 1835, when Andrew Jackson was
president. The national debt totals $5.76 trillion, which includes $3.7 trillion
owed the public in treasury bills and savings bonds and $2 trillion the
government owes Social Security and other trust funds. The national debt crossed
the $1 trillion mark in 1983.
</P>
<P>
	   Other GOP priorities announced at a news conference of party leaders include
blocking new Internet taxes, passing other high-tech bills and winning approval
for China's accession to the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
	   Hastert said another early priority will be legislation he proposed with
President Clinton in November that would steer investments to America's neediest
communities. Congress reconvenes on Jan. 24.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We passed an ambitious tax relief package last year which the president
decided to veto,'' Hastert said after two days of House GOP leadership meetings
to discuss this year's agenda. ``This year we will continue to fight for tax
relief for working families.''
</P>
<P>
	   The early-session emphasis on targeted tax relief, a strategy also deployed
by Democrats, did not rule out another try at a comprehensive tax cut package,
Hastert said. ``We may consider a bigger bill at the end'' of the session, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The speaker also noted that presidential politics will come into play this
summer, and congressional Republicans would try to coordinate tax policy with
the GOP presidential nominee. The front-runner, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, has
proposed a five-year, $483 billion tax cut plan.
</P>
<P>
	   Provisions to address the education savings account and the extra tax burden
faced by some married couples who file jointly were both part of the $792
billion, 10-year tax package passed by Congress last year but vetoed by Clinton
as being excessively large.
</P>
<P>
	   Reducing the marriage penalty paid by millions of two-income couples would
have cost an estimated $119 billion, while raising tax-exempt contribution
limits to IRA-like education savings accounts and other steps to promote
education savings were estimated at $15 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The marriage penalty is the additional tax many two-income couples must pay
above what they would owe if they were single. To ease it, last year's GOP tax
bill would have gradually doubled the standard deduction, and increased the
amount of income subject to the lowest, 15 percent tax bracket for couples
filing jointly.
</P>
<P>
	   That tax bill also would have raised to $2,000 the current $500-a-year limit
on families' contributions to education savings accounts. The money which can
now be withdrawn tax-free and used for college expenses, would be usable for
public and private elementary and secondary school costs as well.
</P>
<P>
	   The GOP outline of its goals for the election-year session came a day after
Clinton and Democratic leaders met at the White House and said they would push
legislation to shore up Social Security and to fix the nation's crumbling
schools.
</P>
<P>
	   The Democrats also said they would also seek to pass legislation unfinished
from last year, including gun restrictions, an increase in the minimum wage and
a patient's bill of rights.
</P>
<P>
	   Other tax goals named by the GOP leaders included stopping new taxes from
being imposed on Internet access and giving a tax break to people who adopt a
child with special needs.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., chairman of the House GOP Policy Committee,
said the party also will seek to pass a high-tech agenda, including electronic
signature legislation that stalled last year and a second measure setting
standards for computer encryption.

<HEADLINE> Figure in Kohl Case Wants Money Back  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- A businessman whose cash handover to aides of Helmut Kohl has
embroiled the German ex-chancellor in a political scandal now wants the money
back, a newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Karlheinz Schreiber said the $550,000 he turned over in 1991 at a Swiss
shopping mall wound up with ``individuals'' -- apparently Kohl's aides -- but
never reached the coffers of the conservative party Kohl then led.
</P>
<P>
	   Schreiber, who is fighting extradition from Canada on German charges of tax
evasion, intends to have his German lawyers take legal steps to get the money
back, the Handelsblatt business daily quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
	   The 65-year-old Schreiber, who holds dual German-Canadian citizenship, is
being sought in his native Germany for allegedly failing to pay more than $14
million in taxes on commissions he received for business deals. He denies the
allegations.
</P>
<P>
	   Revelations late last year about the Swiss transaction touched off
investigations into the campaign financing of Germany's Christian Democrats, the
party Kohl chaired for 25 years until his 1998 election defeat.
</P>
<P>
	   It's unclear where the cash came from, but Kohl has since admitted
soliciting up to $1 million in covert campaign funds in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors opened a criminal probe against Kohl this week, and parliament
is investigating whether payoffs influenced decisions during his 16-year
administration -- something Kohl adamantly denies.

<HEADLINE> Nike Investigates Toxic Worries  </HEADLINE>
   By TONY CZUCZKA Associate Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERLIN (AP) -- Nike said Thursday it is investigating whether some of its
products are treated with a toxic anti-bacterial chemical that can cause serious
health problems at high levels in humans.
</P>
<P>
	   The probe by the Oregon-based manufacturer follows a German television
report that the yellow-and-black jerseys Nike made for a popular German soccer
club contained tributyltin, a heavy metal compound used in anti-barnacle paint
for ships.
</P>
<P>
	   Three German department store chains pulled the shirts off their shelves
Wednesday and Thursday as a precaution, and the club whose jerseys were tested
said it had suspended their sale at its official fan store.
</P>
<P>
	   Also used to kill bacteria and quell the smell of sweat, TBT would seem
ideal for sports shirts. But British and Dutch tests have shown the substance to
cause mutations in snails, and the World Wildlife Fund is calling for its global
ban.
</P>
<P>
	   At high levels in humans, TBT is believed to cause neurological problems,
damage the immune system and harm the liver, said Juergen Kundke, a scientist
with a German institute for consumer health.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We don't know how much is in the shirts, so we can't analyze the risks,''
he said. ``We knew that the substance was still used in coatings for ships, but
it shouldn't be in textiles that people wear.''
</P>
<P>
	   Nike's world headquarters in Beaverton, Ore., pledged a quick probe to
determine whether any of its products contain the substance.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're doing independent tests on our end to ensure there is no risk to the
public,'' spokesman Vada Manager said. ``We're obviously going to take the step
of checking on products sold in Germany, but we will check worldwide as well.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``As of right now there's no legitimate reason to believe there's any
risk,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In its Tuesday broadcast, German public television's consumer show
``Plusminus'' said a private lab it commissioned found TBT and similar compounds
in the Nike jerseys and several other products. The items were chosen at random
in German stores, according to the TV report, which provided no figures on the
TBT levels.
</P>
<P>
	   The soccer jerseys caused the biggest storm because the club, 1997 European
champion Borussia Dortmund, has a big national following.

<HEADLINE> Reno Backs Ruling on Cuban Boy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Hundreds of Cuban-Americans chanting ``Liberty! Liberty!''
blocked intersections and cut off access to the Port of Miami on Thursday to
protest the U.S. government's decision to return 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez to
his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Police arrested about 80 people, including two prominent Cuban exile
leaders, for refusing to disperse. One police officer working crowd control
suffered broken bones when he was hit by a motorist trying to get home.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, Attorney General Janet Reno essentially ruled out any chance
she will reverse Wednesday's decision by the Immigration and Naturalization
Service to send the boy back to the communist island.
</P>
<P>
	   For the past six weeks, Elian has been the subject of protests in Florida
and Cuba -- and in the middle of an international debate over where he belongs.
Fidel Castro kept up the pressure with another government-orchestrated
demonstration Thursday in Havana.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy was found Thanksgiving Day clinging to an inner tube at sea after
his mother, stepfather and eight other people drowned while trying to reach
Florida by boat. He has been living in Miami with his paternal great-uncle and
great-aunt.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian, whose whereabouts were kept secret after Wednesday's decision,
arrived back at his relatives' home Thursday afternoon. His great-uncle hoisted
Elian on his shoulders and the boy smiled and waved to cheering supporters
outside the house.
</P>
<P>
	   A source close to the family said Elian's relatives told him he may be
returning to Cuba and he said he did not want to go. Lawyers for the boy's
American relatives asked Reno to reverse the decision and planned to request a
restraining order from a federal judge.
</P>
<P>
	   But Reno said she had consulted with INS Commissioner Doris Meissner and
agreed with the decision. ``Based on all the information we have to date, I see
no basis for reversing,'' Reno said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The INS said the boy must be returned to Cuba by Jan. 14.
</P>
<P>
	   In Miami, several hundred protesters gathered outside a downtown federal
building, pushed back police barricades and marched several blocks to the Port
of Miami, where most of the arrests were made.
</P>
<P>
	   About 50 officers in riot gear guarded the port's entrance in the shadow of
Freedom Tower, a former customs building where many Cubans entered the United
States in the 1960s. About 780,000 Cuban-Americans live in Miami-Dade County,
accounting for 35 percent of its 2.1 million residents.
</P>
<P>
	   Demonstrators shouted ``Clinton! Coward! Miami hates you!'' They carried
posters in English and Spanish and waved U.S. and Cuban flags.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm defending my rights because where the rights of one person end, the
rights of another begin,'' said Meri Pino, 70, who refused to move from the port
entry.
</P>
<P>
	   Police arrested people who sat on the pavement and others who crossed police
lines. Those arrested included Cuban exile leaders Ramon Sanchez, head of the
Democracy Movement, and Jose Basulto, founder of Brothers to the Rescue, an
anti-Castro group.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're not going to let anyone get hurt,'' said police Lt. Bill Schwartz.
``We're not going to let the streets be taken over by a mob.''
</P>
<P>
	   The headquarters of Royal Caribbean International, a leading cruise line, is
on port property, and the demonstration kept employees from leaving for several
hours. No major cruise ships were in port Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Elsewhere, small groups of protesters intermittently blocked intersections.
Gov. Jeb Bush lifted tolls on highways near protests to relieve rush-hour
congestion.
</P>
<P>
	   At least 10 people carrying a large Cuban flag sat down in the middle of a
main downtown street, crippling traffic during a downpour. Motorists honked
their horns in irritation or support.
</P>
<P>
	   During the morning rush-hour, two dump trucks and a pickup truck slowed all
three lanes of downtown-bound traffic to about 20 mph on the major east-west
route in Miami. The Florida Highway Patrol issued several citations and
threatened to arrest drivers slowing traffic.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm Haitian and they send all the Haitians back,'' motorist Fritz Rene,
31, said at one blocked intersection as he was trying to get to work. ``Whenever
anything happens to the Cubans, they go crazy.''
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's cousin Marisleysis Gonzalez said she supported the demonstrators but
asked them to remain peaceful.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are a lot of Cubans here who have suffered and they are willing to
stop this because the laws here are not being fair,'' the boy's cousin said
outside her home. ``They haven't given us the opportunity to speak on behalf of
him.''
</P>
<P>
	   American officials had suggested that Elian's father come to Florida to get
his son. The U.S. National Council of Churches said the boy's relatives in Cuba
want the organization to bring the boy back.

<HEADLINE> Nazi Suspect Leaves Britain  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Rather than face a third deportation, an 86-year-old man
accused of Nazi war crimes fled Britain on Thursday, as Latvia began
investigating allegations of atrocities linked to him during World War II.
</P>
<P>
	   Konrad Kalejs, who had been in London for six months, left rather than
contest the British government's move to deport him. At Heathrow airport, he
boarded a Singapore Airlines flight bound for Singapore, and it was believed he
intended to go on to Melbourne, Australia, the Air News agency reported.
</P>
<P>
	   After his departure, the Latvian Embassy in London announced it had launched
the criminal investigation, and called for international help in gathering
evidence.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If in the result of the investigation, the Latvian general prosecutor's
office will gather enough evidence confirming the guilt of Mr. Kalejs, then
after the court's decision, Latvia will consider requesting the extradition of
Mr. Kalejs,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kalejs, who has held an Australian passport since 1957, was previously
deported from the United States and Canada because of allegations linking him to
a unit that took part in the murder of more than 30,000 people, primarily Jews,
in Latvia.
</P>
<P>
	   Kalejs has denied the allegations, and described his accusers as ``liars and
storytellers.''
</P>
<P>
	   Britain's decision to initiate deportation proceedings rather than detain
Kalejs outraged Jewish activists, but Home Secretary Jack Straw said there was
not enough evidence for a criminal prosecution in Britain.
</P>
<P>
	   The Australian government has said it cannot block Kalejs' return.
</P>
<P>
	   Australian Justice Minister Amanda Vanstone said a special body set up in
Australia to investigate Nazi war crimes had reported in 1992 that there was not
enough evidence to prosecute Kalejs.
</P>
<P>
	   More recently, Australian federal police agents thoroughly reviewed
information on Kalejs, Vanstone said. She did not say if the review included new
information or just the existing file.
</P>
<P>
	   But lawyer Robert Greenwood, who headed the now disbanded War Crimes Special
Investigation Unit, said Kalejs had never been investigated fully by Australian
officials.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We knew a lot about Mr. Kalejs, but we never targeted Mr. Kalejs as a
prime suspect in the real sense with a view to bringing a prosecution,''
Greenwood told the British Broadcasting Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   Vanstone said the Special Investigation Unit's report to Parliament in 1992
said ``all known witnesses'' had been interviewed in relation to Kalejs.

<HEADLINE> Guyana Cuts AT&AMP;T Service  </HEADLINE>
    By BERT WILKINSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) -- Guyana's monopoly phone company announced
Thursday that it has cut off long-distance international service via U.S.
telecommunications giant AT&AMP;T because of a dispute over access fees.
</P>
<P>
	   Guyana Telephone and Telegraph Co. spokesman Lennox Cornette said that AT&AMP;T
circuits had "a continuous busy signal."
</P>
<P>
	   AT&AMP;T rivals Sprint and MCI have continued their international services to
Guyana, the local company said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Guyanese company, owned by Atlantic Tele Network in the U.S. Virgin
Islands, said it refused to accept a reduction in the fee that AT&AMP;T pays for
each call put through on the Guyanese network.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Communications Commission ruled in August 1997 that access rates
should be reduced over several years to more accurately reflect the true costs
of service. In Guyana, the rate is to be cut from 85 U.S. cents per minute per
call to 23 cents, the local company said.
</P>
<P>
	   AT&AMP;T, which is based in New York, said in a written statement Thursday that
it hopes to resolve the dispute and resume service in Guyana.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Bonds Rise on Tech Stock Slump  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices rose Thursday, as investors moved money out of
slumping technology stocks and into less risky investments.
</P>
<P>
	   The price of the 30-year bond rose 13/16 points, or $8.13 per $1,000 in face
value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 6.55 percent
from a two-year high of 6.62 percent reached late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors continued their onslaught on technology stocks Thursday, driving
the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index down 150.41 points. The Nasdaq has fallen
nearly 10 percent since closing at an all-time high on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, government-secured bonds and old-guard stocks benefited from the
flight from technology. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 130.61 to
11,253.26.
</P>
<P>
	   Bond prices have fallen in recent weeks amid concerns that the Federal
Reserve plans to raise interest rates again early this year now that fears of a
Year 2000 computer disaster have dissipated.
</P>
<P>
	   Rising interest rates hurt bonds, which pay a fixed rate of return. The Fed
raised rates three times in 1999 -- in June, August and November -- to slow the
red-hot economy and to keep inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 5.39 percent as the discount fell
0.03 percentage point from Wednesday's 5.27 percent. Six-month yields were 5.67
percent, as the discount fell 0.05 percentage point from Tuesday to 5.43
percent. One-year yields were 6.00 percent as the discount fell 0.02 percentage
point from Wednesday to 5.66 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the discount is the
interest at which they are sold.
</P>
<P>
	   In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities fell 1/16
point to 3/32 point and intermediate maturities fell 9/32 to 7/16 point,
reported Bridge Telerate, a financial information service.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was
5.50 percent, up from 5.38 percent on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer said the new contract for its index
of 40 actively traded municipal bonds rose 1/16 to 91 23/32. The average yield
to maturity was unchanged at 6.27 percent.

<HEADLINE> FAA Computer Glitch Grounds Flights  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Computer problems grounded airplanes Thursday for a second
time this week, frustrating passengers trying to fly in and out of nearly a
dozen cities across the eastern third of the nation, the Federal Aviation
Administration said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds of flights were delayed when a computer at an FAA air traffic
control center in Leesburg, Va., experienced problems transferring data about
6:45 a.m. EST. The computer processes information from radar systems, air
traffic control centers around the East Coast and flight plans filed by airlines
and individual pilots.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Obviously people were inconvenienced, but they were not in danger,'' said
William Shumann, a spokesman at FAA's headquarters in Washington. ``The backup
system is safe, but it's a much slower system with less capacity and so we have
to hold airplanes on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
	   Normal operations resumed at 9:49 a.m., but the delays left passengers
sitting -- up to two hours or more -- aboard planes lined up on runways or
waiting at gates for flights postponed or canceled.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the passengers grounded at Washington Reagan National Airport was Rep.
Edward Pease, R-Ind., a member of the House Transportation Committee's aviation
panel. He was trying to fly to Indianapolis to deliver a speech, but his plane
never took off.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think we had been on the plane for 1 1/2 hours. The flight was
canceled,'' Pease said. ``When we finally turned around and went back to the
gate, there were planes everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
	   Pease said the delay underscores the need for Congress to give the FAA money
to further modernize the air traffic control system, which is currently
undergoing a $13 billion system upgrade. ``There is clearly a need to upgrade
equipment at the FAA and we've known about it for years.''
</P>
<P>
	   David Fuscus, a spokesman for the Air Transport Association of America, the
airlines' trade group, used the outage to call for steady funding from Congress.
``The problem is the system can't handle the traffic,'' he said. ``The system
needs to meet the demand of the American people.''
</P>
<P>
	   FAA spokesman Eliot Brenner said the problem was not with new computer
hardware installed as part of the administration's modernization effort, but
with flight plan software that overloaded the computer system. ``It slowed it
down to a point that it had to be taken off line,'' Brenner said. ``It took a
second restart to clear the problems.''
</P>
<P>
	   Thursday's delays were experienced by passengers traveling to or from Reagan
National, Dulles International and Baltimore-Washington International; John F.
Kennedy, LaGuardia and Newark, N.J. in greater New York; and Teterboro, N.J.,
Boston, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Raleigh-Durham, N.C., the FAA said.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Letzler of Baldwin, N.Y., said in a telephone interview that his wife
called him by cell phone while sitting for two hours in a plane stuck on the
tarmac at LaGuardia.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They were just sitting there. Everyone was antsy, apparently,'' Letzler
said. ``She was a little upset. She just wanted to know if I had heard anything.
The pilot said that apparently there was some sort of radar problem.''
</P>
<P>
	   Other flights affected were those routed through the airspace controlled by
the FAA center in Leesburg, which covers southern New Jersey, Delaware,
Maryland, Washington, Virginia, eastern West Virginia and eastern North
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There may have been some flights from Chicago to the Washington area that
were also delayed, but no West Coast flights were delayed,'' Shumann said.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday night, a computer malfunction at the FAA's center in Nashua, N.H.,
delayed flights at airports in Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York. FAA
officials said a backup computer system was used when the main computer at the
air traffic control center experienced problems for about three hours.
</P>
<P>
	   Shumann said the problems in Leesburg and Nashua do not point to a systemic
problem at air traffic center computers nationwide.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Weather and traffic volume account for 90 percent of all traffic delays,''
he said. ``Air traffic control outages such as what happened here account for
just under 2 percent of all air traffic delays.''
</P>
<P>
	   Kevin Lamberth, president of a local chapter of Professional Airways Systems
Specialists, which represents FAA employees who maintain air traffic control
equipment, said the computer problem at Leesburg involved a system that stores
flight plans.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This was just a glitch, but we're concerned about all our equipment,''
Lamberth said. ``Most of our technicians spend a lot of time putting out fires.
If we had the proper staffing, we could do more preventative maintenance. Now we
have to fix things as they break.''

<HEADLINE> Change Urged for Canada Broadcaster  </HEADLINE>
    By TOM COHEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- A government regulatory commission on Thursday renewed the
license of the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. for seven more years, but demanded
programming changes that will strain the national broadcaster's budget.
</P>
<P>
	   The Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission said the CBC
-- as the national broadcaster -- must "reflect all the communities of the
country" and demanded more regional arts programming, including drama, dance,
documentaries and entertainment magazine programs, during prime time.
</P>
<P>
	   Noting professional sports consume about 25 percent of prime time
programming, the commission said the network must reduce coverage of pro sports
over the next seven years while boosting amateur sports programming.
</P>
<P>
	   The announcement drew an immediate protest from CBC president Robert
Rabinovitch, who said the changes would cost $34 million a year.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is no way the CBC can implement these decisions," said Rabinovitch,
who assumed his position two months ago. "The money just isn't there."
</P>
<P>
	   Francoise Bertrand, the commission chairwoman, acknowledged the changes
would reduce advertising revenue but said it was up to the CBC to make ends
meet.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission suggested the CBC should avoid major innovations to its
programming "in a time of budgetary constraints" by devoting "all available
resources to its existing services in order to reach the most listeners and
viewers possible."
</P>
<P>
	   Considered the major force in linking Canada's diverse communities, the CBC
faces the new demands after a decade of declining budgets and reduced services.
At the same time, competition from private networks and foreign broadcasters
through satellite and cable transmissions has increased.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent years, the amount of government funding for the CBC has dropped by
25 percent to $515 million a year, with the full-time work force shrinking by
more than 20 percent to just over 7,000. The federal government contributes
about two-thirds of the CBC's budget, with ad revenue accounting for most of the
rest.
</P>
<P>
	   To handle previous budget cuts, the CBC reduced its foreign news bureaus and
decreased domestic news programs, including the halt of regional weekend news
broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
	   But the commission said Thursday the regional weekend news programs must be
resumed. It said its demands for more regional programming during prime time,
increased news coverage and reduced professional sports broadcasts were intended
to "give an even greater voice to all our citizens."
</P>
<P>
	   Vince Carlin, a former BBC senior manager who now is chairman of the School
of Journalism at Ryerson Polytechnic University, called many of the commission's
demands useless.
</P>
<P>
	   "It seems like the exercise of power without the responsibility for any of
the effects of it," he said.

<HEADLINE> Guyana Says AT&AMP;T Service Cut  </HEADLINE>
    By BERT WILKINSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) -- Guyana's monopoly phone company said Thursday
that it no longer has long-distance international service via U.S.
telecommunications giant AT&AMP;T because of a dispute over access fees.
</P>
<P>
	   "We knew this might have happened, but we are very unhappy with the way they
did it, by just putting up a continuous busy signal," said Guyana Telephone and
Telegraph Co. spokesman Lennox Cornette.
</P>
<P>
	   Guyana insists that AT&AMP;T cut off service. But AT&AMP;T said in a statement
Thursday that the Guyana company had begun blocking service Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
	   AT&AMP;T rivals Sprint and MCI have continued their international services to
Guyana, the local company said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Guyanese company, owned by Atlantic Tele Network in the U.S. Virgin
Islands, said it refused to accept a reduction in the fee that AT&AMP;T pays for
each call put through on the Guyanese network.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Communications Commission ruled in August 1997 that access rates
should be reduced over several years to more accurately reflect the true costs
of service. In Guyana, the rate is to be cut from 85 U.S. cents per minute per
call to 23 cents, the local company said.
</P>
<P>
	   AT&AMP;T, which is based in New York, said in a written statement Thursday that
it hopes to resolve the dispute and resume service in Guyana.
</P>
<P>
	   "The current accounting rate we have with Guyana Telephone and Telegraph has
remained unchanged for the past 13 years and doesn't reflect today's call
termination costs," AT&AMP;T said.
</P>
<P>
	   The FCC contends that American consumers pay more than they should for
international calls because foreign telephone companies, many of them
monopolies, charge U.S. phone companies an average of 70 percent above cost for
completing calls.

changes, estimating that rate cuts could cost them $250 million a year. Some

<HEADLINE> U.S. Abortions Continue To Decline  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- The number of abortions in the United States fell in 1997 to
the lowest level in two decades, despite new drugs that make it easier to
terminate a pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
	   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Thursday that 20 of
every 1,000 women of reproductive age (15 to 44) had abortions in 1997, the same
rate as the previous two years and the lowest since 1975.
</P>
<P>
	   The number of abortions for every 1,000 live births dropped from 314 in 1996
to 305 in 1997 -- also the lowest since 1975, the CDC said.
</P>
<P>
	   The preliminary estimate of 1,184,758 legal abortions in 1997 was 3 percent
less than the 1,221,585 abortions in 1996 and was the lowest number performed
since 1978.
</P>
<P>
	   The CDC cited several factors for the decline, including reduced access to
abortion, an increased willingness to use contraception and possibly different
attitudes about the moral implications of abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   For the first time, the annual CDC report included a breakdown from some
states of which abortions were performed with surgery and which with drugs.
Previously, states had reported only the total number of abortions.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1997, 16 states reported 2,988 abortions induced by drugs. The Alan
Guttmacher Institute, an abortion rights research organization, estimated there
were 4,300 drug-induced abortions in all of the United States during the first
half of 1997 alone.
</P>
<P>
	   The drug most commonly used in the United States to induce abortion is
methotrexate. Methotrexate is used to treat certain types of gastrointestinal
disorders and cancers, but doctors have been allowed to prescribe it to induce
abortion since the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
	   Another drug, mifepristone, is designed specifically to end pregnancy and is
expected to win approval from the Food and Drug Administration this year. It is
available only through clinical trials. A similar drug used in Europe, RU-486,
remains ensnared in political battles in this country.
</P>
<P>
	   The medications are touted as a way to make the procedure more private and
convenient, without the need for surgery. Women take the medications under a
doctor's supervision during the first 49 days of pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
	   Those on both sides of the debate said the medications are unlikely to
affect the overall numbers of abortions but might shift the method away from
surgery.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think it will have any effect whatsoever on rates of abortion or
rates of unintended pregnancy,'' said Gloria Feldt, president of Planned
Parenthood Federation of America.
</P>
<P>
	   April Thompson, a spokeswoman for the National Right to Life Committee,
said: ``It's just another method of taking the life of an unborn child. It will
not change the debate and it will not change the number of abortions.''
</P>
<P>
	   The CDC said that 52 percent of the women who received an abortion in 1997
were 24 or younger. Most of the women were white and unmarried. Fifty-five
percent of the procedures were done in the first two months of pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
	   Final 1997 figures -- the most recent year for which such numbers are
available -- including the numbers of abortions in each state, will be released
in the summer.

<HEADLINE> Storm Cleanup Kills French Soldiers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NONTRON, France (AP) -- Two French soldiers who were helping restore
storm-damaged electricity services in France were killed in a freak accident
Thursday, Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said.
</P>
<P>
	   The men were asphyxiated by the heating system in the house where they were
staying while they helped state electricity company EDF with its repair work,
Jospin said.
</P>
<P>
	   The prime minister, who was in the southwestern region of Dordogne to see
the damage caused by the gales, did not give any other details of the deaths.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In a way, they paid with their lives for their commitment to their fellow
citizens,'' Jospin said.
</P>
<P>
	   The tragedy brings to 90 the number of deaths related to the devastating
storms that ripped through France on Dec. 26 and Dec. 27, smashing buildings,
tearing up trees and snaring power cables. Six thousand soldiers were deployed
around the country to help with the cleanup.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite a massive repair operation, 170,000 homes across France are still
without electricity and thousands have no phone lines.
</P>
<P>
	   EDF chairman Francois Roussely said Wednesday the storms caused so much
damage it could take three years to fully restore the national electricity
system.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Rejoins Mideast Talks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- President Clinton plunged back into slow-moving
Mideast peace talks Thursday as face-to-face negotiations between Israelis and
Syrians ground to a halt.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. aim is a treaty that would exchange the Golan Heights, a strategic
border territory Israel has held for more than three decades, for diplomatic and
economic relations with Syria.
</P>
<P>
	   Syria began Wednesday to outline its offer in a mixed committee under the
supervision of Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk. A committee on new
border security measures met all day, as well.
</P>
<P>
	   But there were no face-to-face negotiations over Syria's key demand: a
specific timetable for Israel to relinquish the Golan Heights, which Syria lost
in the 1967 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
	   The State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said the talks, in their
fourth day, were still ``chugging along.'' But he said the American hosts were
dissatisfied with the pace and would like to see it accelerated.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's intervention Thursday was his third of the week. On tap were
separate meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian Foreign
Minister Farouk al-Sharaa after conferring with Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright on her own 90-minute meeting with al-Sharaa.
</P>
<P>
	   The president, wearing a leather flight jacket, waved to bystanders as he
alighted from his helicopter and made no statement. Marking the end of Ramadan,
Islam's holiest month, the White House issued a presidential message with a
prayer for peace.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We pray that the new moon will bring a new era of peace between nations --
in the Middle East and all across the world -- so people can emerge from the
shadows of violence and make better lives for their children,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, Clinton's assistant for national security, Sandy Berger, told
reporters to ``not underestimate the degree of difficulty'' in the negotiations
being held near this oldest town in West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These are very difficult issues that divide the parties,'' Berger said.
``They've been at war three times since the 1940s. There are very strong views
on both sides.''
</P>
<P>
	   In contrast to discontent within the Syrian delegation, Barak and his
delegation appeared pleased that the negotiations were focused on peace terms
and security measures, such as installing an early-warning system at the border
and clearing it of troops.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak found time Wednesday to jog and do calisthenics at a gymnasium in the
hotel the two delegations are sharing behind police barricades.
</P>
<P>
	   An Israel source, insisting on anonymity, said the talks were likely to go
into a second week -- after a weekend break -- and that Barak planned to stay
on.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin said that Albright, meanwhile, had directed her assistants to prepare
a ``working document'' detailing negotiations held in 1996 as well as talks last
month in Washington and here this week.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That will enable us at the appropriate time to move forward,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked if Israel could be secure without retaining the Golan Heights, which
overlooks its northeastern towns that were targets of cross-border attacks
before 1967, Rubin said, ``Israel is going to have to make that decision.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We believe that Israel has legitimate security needs and we believe those
needs can be met,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton has assured Israel and Syria he was willing to play a helpful and
consistent role in trying to iron out their differences.
</P>
<P>
	   Although two trips are on his schedule for next week -- to Arizona and Texas
on Monday and Tuesday and to New York on Thursday -- White House press secretary
Joe Lockhart said the peace talks would take precedence.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, the Sadat Peace Foundation called on al-Sharaa to convince
the world and the U.S. Congress that Syria was interested in peace with Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   The private group -- named for the late Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, who
made peace with Israel in 1979 -- said in a statement that Syria's hard-line
position strengthens the Israeli hard-liners and raises questions about Syria's
resolve to seek peace.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Media Encourages Rallies  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Cuba encouraged its citizens Thursday to continue protesting
for a 6-year-old boy's repatriation, warning that exiles in Miami could try to
block the U.S. government's decision to reunite the child with his father on the
island.
</P>
<P>
	   With President Fidel Castro in attendance, media workers rallied Thursday at
Havana's Palace of Conventions to demand Elian Gonzalez's return to Cuba. For
weeks the communist government has held such rallies almost daily.
</P>
<P>
	   Saying ``nothing is certain'' about Elian's return, the government exhorted
citizens to keep rallying, after the boy's relatives in Miami said they would
look for ways to get around Wednesday's ruling by the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service to repatriate the child by Jan. 14.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuban exiles in Miami will now ``proceed with all their resources to impede
or delay'' the ruling, Cuba predicted Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We cannot stop mobilizing! The struggle must not stop for one minute!''
said a message that was read Wednesday night to several thousand rallying Cuban
scientists.
</P>
<P>
	   Rescued on Nov. 25 by fishermen off the Florida coast, Elian has become the
subject of an international custody battle.
</P>
<P>
	   His mother died in a boating accident trying to get Elian and herself to the
United States. The boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, lives in Cuba and wants
Elian back.
</P>
<P>
	   But Elian's relatives in Miami have fought to keep the boy, saying they
could provide him with a better life. Since the INS decision was announced
Wednesday, they have said they will appeal the decision.
</P>
<P>
	   Gonzalez has not appeared publicly since the announcement. Neither he nor
Elian's four grandparents could be located in their hometown of Cardenas, east
of Havana.

from infiltrators.

	   Clinton has frequently expressed concern about the emerging threat that
hackers, thieves and other governments pose to the nation's high-tech
infrastructure. A top adviser Thursday included cyber-terrorism near the top of
a list of threats facing America in the next century.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think there's a whole new realm of threat we're going to be dealing
with,'' National Security Adviser Sandy Berger said in response to a questions
after a National Press Club speech. ``The ability to take weapons of mass
destruction across national borders with relative ease; the ability to attack
our computers that run our infrastructure through cyber-terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
	   Administration officials speaking on condition of anonymity said Clinton's
budget request for 2001 would seek additional funds for monitoring and
protecting government computer systems.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Now that we're past Y2K, we need to continue to insulate and secure our
nation's computers,'' one official said. A specific dollar figure was not
immediately available.
</P>
<P>
	   The new initiative builds on steps the administration announced last year.
It would seek to develop new technologies, increase public and private
cooperation against computer sabotage, improve training for government agents
and boost protection of computer systems.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's creating a number of programs to train, detect and strengthen our
ability to deal with cyber-terrorists,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
	   Last July, the administration announced that it was creating a
government-wide security network to protect against hackers. The plan included
an elaborate network of electronic obstacles, monitors and analyzers to watch
for suspicious activity.
</P>
<P>
	   The first 500 intrusion monitors were to be installed on non-military
government computers early this year, and the full system was to be computed by
May 2003.

<HEADLINE> CDC Warns of Drug-Resistant Bacteria  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- The government is warning hospitals that some strains of
Staph bacteria may be drug-resistant after confirming that a woman died from a
heart valve infection that didn't respond to antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
	   The death in April of the 63-year-old Illinois woman was the first confirmed
U.S. death from a Staph infection that didn't respond to vancomycin, the
antibiotic of last resort for lingering infections, said a report released
Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
	   The CDC warned that some strains of Staphylococcus aureus are showing signs
of resistance to vancomycin.
</P>
<P>
	   The report cited four cases since 1997, including the Illinois woman who
died after vancomycin had no effect on a Staph infection that had entered a
valve in her heart.
</P>
<P>
	   The other patients, all of whom were seriously ill and had been treated with
vancomycin for extended periods, were in Michigan, New Jersey and New York. The
CDC said the Illinois case was the only confirmed fatality.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is another example of why we need to use antibiotics more
judiciously,'' said Dr. Julie Gerberding, the CDC's director of hospital
infections programs. She said the four cases were extremely rare and occurred in
very ill people.
</P>
<P>
	   Staph bacteria are passed by skin-to-skin contact and generally are
harmless. However, the bacteria can enter the body through wounds and cause
serious infections of the skin, tissue, bones and joints. Staph is blamed for
about 13 percent of the nation's 2 million infections at hospitals each year.
</P>
<P>
	   In November, a Hong Kong newspaper reported that three people had died from
an antibiotic-resistant strain of Staph bacteria.
</P>
<P>
	   Researchers working to develop new antibiotics announced in September that
two had proven effective against vancomycin-resistant bacteria in human tests --
Synercid, manufactured by Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, and Zyvox, made by Pharmacia &AMP;
Upjohn.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Rejoins Mideast Talks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- President Clinton plunged back into slow-moving
Mideast peace talks Thursday, meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
after face-to-face negotiations between Israelis and Syrians ground to a halt.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. aim is a treaty that would exchange the Golan Heights, a strategic
border territory Israel has held for more than three decades, for diplomatic and
economic relations with Syria.
</P>
<P>
	   Syria began Wednesday to outline its offer in a mixed committee under the
supervision of Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk. A committee on new
border security measures met all day, as well.
</P>
<P>
	   But there were no face-to-face negotiations over Syria's key demand: a
specific timetable for Israel to relinquish the Golan Heights, which Syria lost
in the 1967 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
	   State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said the talks, in their fourth
day, were still ``chugging along.'' But he said the American hosts were
dissatisfied with the pace and would like to see it accelerated.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's intervention Thursday was his third of the week. On tap after he
saw Barak for a little more than an hour was a session with Syrian Foreign
Minister Farouk al-Sharaa. On his arrival, Clinton conferred with Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright on her own 90-minute meeting with al-Sharaa.
</P>
<P>
	   The president, wearing a leather flight jacket, waved to bystanders as he
alighted from his helicopter and made no statement. Marking the end of Ramadan,
Islam's holiest month, the White House issued a presidential message with a
prayer for peace.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We pray that the new moon will bring a new era of peace between nations --
in the Middle East and all across the world -- so people can emerge from the
shadows of violence and make better lives for their children,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, Clinton's assistant for national security, Sandy Berger, told
reporters to ``not underestimate the degree of difficulty'' in the negotiations
being held near this oldest town in West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These are very difficult issues that divide the parties,'' Berger said.
``They've been at war three times since the 1940s. There are very strong views
on both sides.''
</P>
<P>
	   In contrast to discontent within the Syrian delegation, Barak and his
delegation appeared pleased that the negotiations were focused on peace terms
and security measures, such as installing an early-warning system at the border
and clearing it of troops.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak found time Wednesday to jog and do calisthenics at a gymnasium in the
hotel the two delegations are sharing behind police barricades.
</P>
<P>
	   An Israel source, insisting on anonymity, said the talks were likely to go
into a second week -- after a weekend break -- and that Barak planned to stay
on.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin said that Albright, meanwhile, had directed her assistants to prepare
a ``working document'' detailing negotiations held in 1996 as well as talks last
month in Washington and here this week.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That will enable us at the appropriate time to move forward,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked if Israel could be secure without retaining the Golan Heights, which
overlooks its northeastern towns that were targets of cross-border attacks
before 1967, Rubin said, ``Israel is going to have to make that decision.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We believe that Israel has legitimate security needs and we believe those
needs can be met,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton has assured Israel and Syria he was willing to play a helpful and
consistent role in trying to iron out their differences.
</P>
<P>
	   Although two trips are on his schedule for next week -- to Arizona and Texas
on Monday and Tuesday and to New York on Thursday -- White House press secretary
Joe Lockhart said the peace talks would take precedence.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, the Sadat Peace Foundation called on al-Sharaa to convince
the world and the U.S. Congress that Syria was interested in peace with Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   The private group -- named for the late Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, who
made peace with Israel in 1979 -- said in a statement that Syria's hard-line
position strengthens the Israeli hard-liners and raises questions about Syria's
resolve to seek peace.

<HEADLINE> Reno Backs Ruling on Cuban Boy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Hundreds of Cuban-Americans chanting ``Liberty! Liberty!''
blocked intersections and cut off access to the Port of Miami on Thursday to
protest the U.S. government's decision to return 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez to
his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Police arrested about 100 people, including two prominent Cuban exile
leaders, for refusing to disperse.
</P>
<P>
	   A motorist plowed through a group of protesters blocking an intersection
near Miami International Airport, knocking a man and a woman to the ground.
Their conditions were not immediately known. One police officer working crowd
contol suffered broken bones when he was hit by a motorist trying to get home.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, Attorney General Janet Reno essentially ruled out any chance
she will reverse Wednesday's decision by the Immigration and Naturalization
Service to send the boy back to the communist island.
</P>
<P>
	   For the past six weeks, Elian has been the subject of protests in Florida
and Cuba -- and in the middle of an international debate over where he belongs.
Fidel Castro kept up the pressure with another government-orchestrated
demonstration Thursday in Havana.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy was found Thanksgiving Day clinging to an inner tube at sea after
his mother, stepfather and eight other people drowned while trying to reach
Florida by boat. He has been living in Miami with his paternal great-uncle and
great-aunt.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian, whose whereabouts were kept secret after Wednesday's decision,
arrived back at his relatives' home Thursday afternoon. His great-uncle hoisted
Elian on his shoulders and the boy smiled and waved to cheering supporters
outside the house.
</P>
<P>
	   A source close to the family said Elian's relatives told him he may be
returning to Cuba and he said he did not want to go. Elian's father called the
boy from Cuba Thursday but it wasn't known what they talked about.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for the boy's American relatives asked Reno to reverse the decision
and were still considering whether to pursue legal action in federal or state
court.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It hasn't been decided,'' said Spencer Eig, a lawyer for the relatives.
</P>
<P>
	   But Reno said she had consulted with INS Commissioner Doris Meissner and
agreed with the decision. ``Based on all the information we have to date, I see
no basis for reversing,'' Reno said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The INS said the boy must be returned to Cuba by Jan. 14.
</P>
<P>
	   In Miami, several hundred protesters gathered outside a downtown federal
building, pushed back police barricades and marched several blocks to the Port
of Miami, where most of the arrests were made.
</P>
<P>
	   About 50 officers in riot gear guarded the port's entrance in the shadow of
Freedom Tower, a former customs building where many Cubans entered the United
States in the 1960s. About 780,000 Cuban-Americans live in Miami-Dade County,
accounting for 35 percent of its 2.1 million residents.
</P>
<P>
	   Demonstrators shouted ``Clinton! Coward! Miami hates you!'' They carried
posters in English and Spanish and waved U.S. and Cuban flags.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm defending my rights because where the rights of one person end, the
rights of another begin,'' said Meri Pino, 70, who refused to move from the port
entry.
</P>
<P>
	   Police arrested people who sat on the pavement and others who crossed police
lines. Those arrested included Cuban exile leaders Ramon Sanchez, head of the
Democracy Movement, and Jose Basulto, founder of Brothers to the Rescue, an
anti-Castro group.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is not a typical custody battle between parents in two different
states of the United States,'' Basulto said after he and Sanchez were released
from jail Thursday night. ``This is a country against a family.''
</P>
<P>
	   The headquarters of Royal Caribbean International, a leading cruise line, is
on port property, and the demonstration kept employees from leaving for several
hours. No major cruise ships were in port Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Elsewhere, small groups of protesters intermittently blocked intersections.
Gov. Jeb Bush lifted tolls on highways near protests to relieve rush-hour
congestion.
</P>
<P>
	   At least 10 people carrying a large Cuban flag sat down in the middle of a
main downtown street, crippling traffic during a downpour. Motorists honked
their horns in irritation or support.
</P>
<P>
	   During the morning rush-hour, two dump trucks and a pickup truck slowed all
three lanes of downtown-bound traffic to about 20 mph on the major east-west
route in Miami. The Florida Highway Patrol issued several citations and
threatened to arrest drivers slowing traffic.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm Haitian and they send all the Haitians back,'' motorist Fritz Rene,
31, said at one blocked intersection as he was trying to get to work. ``Whenever
anything happens to the Cubans, they go crazy.''
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's cousin Marisleysis Gonzalez said she supported the demonstrators but
asked them to remain peaceful.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are a lot of Cubans here who have suffered and they are willing to
stop this because the laws here are not being fair,'' the boy's cousin said
outside her home. ``They haven't given us the opportunity to speak on behalf of
him.''
</P>
<P>
	   American officials had suggested that Elian's father come to Florida to get
his son. The U.S. National Council of Churches said the boy's relatives in Cuba
want the organization to bring the boy back.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Deploys Police Amid Protests  </HEADLINE>
   By CARLOS CISTERNAS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Police firing tear gas dispersed about 1,000
demonstrators marching on the presidential palace Thursday to demand President
Jamil Mahuad's resignation, claiming he has mismanaged Ecuador's economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Similar protests over Mahuad were held in Ecuador's largest city, Guayaquil,
as well as the southern city of Cuenca. Defying a countrywide state of
emergency, students tried to block traffic by setting small fires in streets,
but were quickly driven away by police.
</P>
<P>
	   The state of emergency gave the armed forces the power to maintain order and
contain demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
	   In central Quito's center, heavily armed riot police, some in armored
vehicles, formed a cordon around the presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
	   Another attempt by 300 protesters, mainly high school students, to reach the
palace later Thursday also was turned back by police firing tear gas.
</P>
<P>
	   Protest leaders said at least 10 people were hurt in Thursday's clashes with
the police, and more than 20 were detained. Authorities said they had no
information on how many were hurt or arrested.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Red Cross said at least two people had been injured, including a
17-year-old male student who suffered a bullet wound in the neck. It was unclear
who fired the shot, it said.
</P>
<P>
	   In several areas throughout the country, soldiers and police were patrolling
provincial highways and guarding gas stations, state buildings and city streets,
radio reported. Businesses in major cities, though, were operating normally.
</P>
<P>
	   The leftist-led Unified Workers Front, Ecuador's main labor federation with
600,000 workers, organized the protests against Mahuad's government, Congress
and Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
	   The Harvard-educated Mahuad has faced three national strikes since taking
office in August 1998. His critics accuse him of incompetence in resolving
Ecuador's worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1999, inflation topped 60 percent, the economy shrank 7 percent, and the
value of Ecuador's currency plunged 30 percent, from 7,000 sucres to the dollar
last year to 23,000 sucres today.
</P>
<P>
	   Mahuad has said he plans to finish his term, which runs until January 2003.
And the armed forces have expressed their support for him.
</P>
<P>
	   Protest organizers appeared disappointed Thursday with the overall turnout,
which was lower than expected. They said they were hoping for the same massive
response that in February 1997 helped oust former President Abdala Bucaram.
Congress kicked Bucaram out of office for ``mental incompetence'' after at least
two million people took to the streets in major cities throughout the small
Andean country of 12 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Government spokesman Vladimiro Alvarez said authorities were bracing for
violence and had information about where Molotov cocktails and bombs had been
prepared.

<HEADLINE> Probe: Korea Air Instruments Failed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- A Korean Air cockpit crew was warned of the failure of a vital
navigational instrument moments before a fatal crash near London, an interim
accident report said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The attitude director indicator, which provides the angle of the aircraft at
night and in clouds, malfunctioned during a previous flight and was inspected by
a Korean Air ground engineer just before the cargo plane took off Dec. 22,
according to the report by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch.
</P>
<P>
	   Minutes afterward, the crew received warnings that the indicator was not
working, the report said. The recovered ``black box'' flight data recorder
showed that a buzzer sounded repeatedly in the cockpit, indicating the
instrument was showing conflicting readings, it said.
</P>
<P>
	   When the Boeing 747 reached 2,000 feet, it banked to the left and descended
almost vertically. The plane turned into a fireball on impact near Stansted
Airport, killing all four people on board.
</P>
<P>
	   No copy of the technical log was left at Stansted, and the engineer was one
of the four men killed in the crash.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There was no record of what the ground engineer entered in the technical
log to clear the fault and no way of knowing if he briefed the oncoming
commander about the fault,'' the Air Accidents Investigation Branch said.
</P>
<P>
	   The report came to no conclusions about the cause of the crash, and noted
the investigation was continuing.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, an official from the Air Accidents Investigation Branch confirmed
that the plane had been carrying several hundred pounds of depleted uranium,
which had a low level of radioactivity.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our information is that it remained intact after the crash, and that there
is no hazard to those working at the site or people living nearby,'' a spokesman
said, speaking with customary anonymity.

<HEADLINE> Swedish Leader Mulls Nazi Probe  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Succumbing to pressure from politicians and a
Jewish group, the prime minister said he would consider appointing a panel to
investigate Sweden's ties with Nazi Germany, a news agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Swedish parliamentary leaders and the Nazi-hunting Simon Wiesenthal Center
have called on the government to re-examine its World War II relationship with
Germany after a documentary about Swedes who fought for Hitler.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There could be a commission, research project or some other method to find
out exactly what the Swedish Nazis did,'' Persson was quoted as saying in a
Wednesday night interview with Swedish Television.
</P>
<P>
	   Sweden was neutral during the war and traded goods with both sides.
</P>
<P>
	   The Simon Wiesenthal Center, which had also demanded that Swedes who
committed crimes while fighting in German armies be brought to trial, welcomed
Persson's comments while repeating its insistence that war criminals face court
proceedings
</P>
<P>
	   ``Allow me to congratulate you on your wise and courageous decision to call
for an investigation of the Nazi war criminals currently living in Sweden,'' the
center's Israeli director, Dr. Efraim Zuroff, said in a statement. ``The need to
bring those responsible for them to justice remains as strong as ever.''
</P>
<P>
	   The documentary called ``The Swedes who fought for Hitler'', which was
televised earlier this week, showed Swedes who had volunteered for Adolf
Hitler's army and participated in the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
	   Sweden has made a concerted effort to raise public awareness of the
Holocaust after a 1997 survey showed that nearly a third of youths between ages
12 through 18 did not believe the genocide of Jews, Gypsies and other minorities
took place.

in the Middle East and all across the world -- so people can emerge from the
shadows of violence and make better lives for their children,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, Clinton's assistant for national security, Sandy Berger, told
reporters to ``not underestimate the degree of difficulty'' in the negotiations
being held near this oldest town in West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These are very difficult issues that divide the parties,'' Berger said.
``They've been at war three times since the 1940s. There are very strong views
on both sides.''
</P>
<P>
	   In contrast to discontent within the Syrian delegation, Barak and his
delegation appeared pleased that the negotiations were focused on peace terms
and security measures, such as installing an early-warning system at the border
and clearing it of troops.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak found time Wednesday to jog and do calisthenics at a gymnasium in the
hotel the two delegations are sharing behind police barricades.
</P>
<P>
	   An Israel source, insisting on anonymity, said the talks were likely to go
into a second week -- after a weekend break -- and that Barak planned to stay
on.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin said that Albright, meanwhile, had directed her assistants to prepare
a ``working document'' detailing negotiations held in 1996 as well as talks last
month in Washington and here this week.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That will enable us at the appropriate time to move forward,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked if Israel could be secure without retaining the Golan Heights, which
overlooks its northeastern towns that were targets of cross-border attacks
before 1967, Rubin said, ``Israel is going to have to make that decision.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We believe that Israel has legitimate security needs and we believe those
needs can be met,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton has assured Israel and Syria he was willing to play a helpful and
consistent role in trying to iron out their differences.
</P>
<P>
	   Although two trips are on his schedule for next week -- to Arizona and Texas
on Monday and Tuesday and to New York on Thursday -- White House press secretary
Joe Lockhart said the peace talks would take precedence.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, the Sadat Peace Foundation called on al-Sharaa to convince
the world and the U.S. Congress that Syria was interested in peace with Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   The private group -- named for the late Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, who
made peace with Israel in 1979 -- said in a statement that Syria's hard-line
position strengthens the Israeli hard-liners and raises questions about Syria's
resolve to seek peace.

<HEADLINE> Man Jumps To Death From Casino Tower  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- A 24-year-old man scaled two security barriers and jumped
to his death from the observation deck of the 1,149-foot Stratosphere Tower
hotel-casino.
</P>
<P>
	   The jumper, identified as Mitchell M. Mayfield of Tooele, Utah, bounced off
a glass-enclosed observation area that juts out from beneath the deck. His body
landed in bushes about 30 feet from workers in a valet parking area. No one on
the ground was injured.
</P>
<P>
	   The man had to overcome several obstacles to jump off the deck near the
1,100-foot level of the tower late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The first barrier is 5 feet high and the second about 10 feet high. In
addition, an alarm is triggered as soon as the first barrier is cleared. At
least one security guard is always on duty on the observation deck, said Tom
Willer, Stratosphere vice president of marketing.
</P>
<P>
	   Willer doubted the hotel would change its security procedures.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This gentleman was unwavering in his resolve to end his life quickly, he
said. ``And in those cases, no matter where you are, it is very difficult to
prevent somebody from taking their life.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Candidates Debate in N.H.  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DURHAM, N.H. (AP) -- An aggressive George W. Bush pledged in campaign debate
Thursday night to push for ``tax cuts, so help me God'' if elected to the White
House and accused presidential rival John McCain of seeking campaign finance
changes that would hurt the conservative cause.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, his insurgent candidacy at a crossroads in the first-in-the-nation
primary state, used the forum to strongly defend his actions on behalf of a
political donor who was seeking action from the Federal Communications
Commission.
</P>
<P>
	   The tax cut pledge uttered by Bush, the national GOP front-runner, was
all-but-unequivocal: ``If there's a recession it's important to cut taxes to
make sure the economy grows. ... It's also important to cut the taxes where
there's times of plenty. ... It's important to cut the taxes to make sure
Washington, D.C., does not spend the surplus.''
</P>
<P>
	   His questioner asked whether he was saying ``no new taxes, so help me God''
-- a reference to former President George Bush's no-new-taxes pledge that he
broke once he won the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is not only no new taxes. This is tax cuts, so help me God,'' said
Bush, son of the former president.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, McCain and the other GOP contenders, Steve Forbes, Alan Keyes, Gary
Bauer and Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, met on a stage at the University New
Hampshire -- the site of a debate one night earlier of the Democratic
presidential hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
	   The series of debates continues Friday night in South Carolina, where the
GOP contenders will meet once again, and again next week as the opening round of
primaries approaches.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain swiftly parried Bush's attack on the issue of campaign finance and
possible damage to the Republican Party, noting that his proposal includes steps
to limit union political activity.
</P>
<P>
	   And he was unequivocal in defending a letter he wrote to the FCC on behalf
of a political donor. ``My job is to make the bureaucrats work for the people,''
said McCain, who is chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee. ``I would do the
same thing again, almost anytime.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain smiled broadly as he issued his defense -- keeping a widely rumored
temper in check -- although his aides fretted that the issue of the letter could
seriously damage a candidacy based on a pledge of rooting out the influence of
special interests.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, for one, declined to prod McCain on the issue. ``I thought his answer
was fine,'' he said when moderator Tim Russert asked for his opinion.
</P>
<P>
	   The political subtext explained the course of the debate. Bush's tax cut
pledge was designed to strike a chord in a state where residents are fiercely
proud there is no income tax.
</P>
<P>
	   And his criticism of McCain on campaign finance -- his jab that it would
hurt Republicans -- was designed to peel away GOP voters from his closest rival.
</P>
<P>
	   Similarly, McCain's chances for victory in New Hampshire rest with
independents, and his defense of his actions before the FCC seemed an effort to
assure those voters who are attracted to his image as a reformer who will end
politics as usual.
</P>
<P>
	   The 60-minute debate was feisty, and none of the men on stage hesitated to
interrupt.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm going to take some time here,'' Hatch declared at one point, more than
halfway through a confrontation in which he struggled for airtime.
</P>
<P>
	   Bauer underscored his signature issue, saying he would not appoint any
justice to the Supreme Court ``who would sacrifice even one child,'' a pledge he
has uttered often in his effort to show unbreakable opposition to abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes, a wealthy publisher, sharply criticized the Clinton administration's
decision to send a Cuban boy whose mother died escaping Havana back to his
homeland to be reunited with his father. The child is ``Bill Clinton's human
sacrifice to Fidel Castro,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   There was an incendiary exchange over gays in the military that followed the
pledges Wednesday night by both of the Democratic presidential hopefuls that
they would make sure that homosexuals could serve openly.
</P>
<P>
	   Bauer said that Democratic stance would further the ``radical homosexual
agenda,'' and an animated Keyes said, ``I will return to the ban on homosexuals
in the military.''
</P>
<P>
	   Said Bush, ``I'm a don't ask, don't tell man.''
</P>
<P>
	   But the main political dynamic of the evening was the struggle between Bush
and McCain, close rivals in the polls in New Hampshire, which holds the first
primary of the year on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   The two argued over taxes and campaign finance and snapped at each other a
time or two.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said Bush's tax plan would use the entire surplus.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No it doesn't,'' retorted the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Yes it does,'' shot back McCain, standing a few feet away.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush was asked at one point whether his personal religious beliefs would
affect his White House policies. Russert asked whether he would take the popular
Christian expression `What would Jesus do' into the Oval Office, and Bush
replied, ``I would take an expression into the Oval Office: 'Dear God Help
Me.'''
</P>
<P>
	   To which Bauer said, ``So would we.''

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Lower in Early Trading  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar was higher against the yen early Friday in Tokyo,
largely maintaining its strength gained overseas. Japanese stock prices opened
lower.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar bought 105.22 yen, up 0.84 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo but
below its late New York level of 105.40 yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 26.25 points, or 0.14
percent, to 18,142.02 in the first 30 minutes of trading. On Thursday, the
average closed down 374.28 points, or 2.02 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency dealings, the dollar held on to much of its strength in early
Asian trading Friday after hitting a seven-week high against the yen in overseas
markets.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. currency's strength on Thursday came from cross-trading among
European and Asian currencies, traders said.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts say the yen's decline was exacerbated as hedge fund managers
shifted some of their currency holdings from yen to euros and investors
continued to cover dollar-yen and euro-yen short, or oversold, positions.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the yen's weakness, Japan's vice finance minister for international
affairs, Haruhiko Kuroda, said Friday that the currency is still overvalued.
</P>
<P>
	   "The yen is still too strong," Kuroda said. "I think the correction to the
excessively strong yen has started," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The high yen hurts Japanese exporting companies by reducing the value of
dollar earnings they bring back to Japan from overseas.
</P>
<P>
	   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 108.53 yen, up from 107.88 yen
late Thursday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stock market, prices started lower as selling of Japanese technology
stocks continued early Friday following a decline in the Nasdaq Composite Index
on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 130.61 points, or 1.2
percent, to 11,253.26 at Thursday's close. But the Nasdaq, dominated by
technology stocks, fell 150.31, or 3.9 percent, to 3,727.23.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was down 21.92 points, or 1.36 percent, to 1,587.67. The TOPIX closed
down 42.25 points, or 2.56 percent, the day before.
</P>
<P>
	   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond was unquoted in
early trading. On Thursday, it settled at 1.6800 percent and its price stood at
101.87.

<HEADLINE> McCain Doesn't Regret FCC Letter  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Sen. John McCain said Thursday he had no regrets
about writing a federal agency on behalf of a political supporter, even as his
chief presidential rival sought advantage in the controversy and aides scrambled
to minimize damage.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Senator McCain must answer these questions,'' George W. Bush told
reporters asking about McCain's actions. The Texas governor and Republican
presidential front-runner used the incident to cast McCain as a Washington
insider.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain defended his actions Thursday night as he joined Bush and four other
Republican presidential candidates in Durham for their first debate of the new
year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My job, as chairman of the Commerce Committee, as every other major
committee chairman in Washington, is to make the bureaucrats work for the
people,'' McCain said. ``And that has to do with making decisions. I would do
the same thing again, at almost any time.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said that he and other members of Congress have had problems with the
Federal Communications Commission and that, ``I will continue to exercise my
oversight and try to get them to do their job.''
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, as the questioning consumed another day of campaigning, the Arizona
senator said, ``I fully understand that with all of these hundreds of thousands
of millions of dollars washing around Washington, controlled by special
interests, that we're all under suspicion.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has acknowledged that that he sent a letter as chairman of the Senate
Commerce Committee, urging FCC action on a TV license request by Paxson
Communications. The senator has made campaign trips aboard a Paxson plane, and
the company has coordinated political donations to McCain's presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   The senator, who reimbursed Paxson for the trips, did not argue for any
particular decision in his letter. He urged the FCC to resolve the matter one
way or another, after a two-year wait.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked if he regretted the letter, McCain said, ``Of course not. I acted in
order to have bureaucracies that are under my responsibility and oversight in
Congress to act in response to the taxpayers' wishes and needs. I've done that
on many, many occasions,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the FCC, McCain has sent 215 letters to the commission in the
past three years. During the same period, the commission has received 7,000 to
8,000 pieces of correspondence a year from members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   The three-term senator has erased Bush's lead in New Hampshire polls, making
him the main threat to the GOP front-runner and increasing scrutiny of his own
underdog campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   In private, McCain was said to be offended that his character is being
called into question, and suspicious that his political rivals had a hand in
published reports about the letter.
</P>
<P>
	   He was typically upbeat during his public events Thursday, and didn't seem
sensitive to the new scrutiny. Over lunch with Manchester firefighters, he
listened to their pitch for more federal money. ``You'll have my support in
return for this delightful (meal),'' McCain joked. ``Every politician has his
price. Mine is obviously a chili lunch.''
</P>
<P>
	   Afraid that a media frenzy was about to consume the campaign, aides have
spent hours cataloguing thousands of letters McCain has written regulators --
some of them on behalf of donors -- to be prepared if the documents become
public, which advisers expects will happen. They say none of the documents show
McCain in an unethical light.
</P>
<P>
	   Aides hoped the story would run its course by next week, but feared that TV
ads spotlighting the matter could give it longer life. They said they don't
expect any ads to air because Steve Forbes, who can afford the spots, wants
McCain to help weaken the front-running Bush. They are certain, aides said, that
Bush doesn't want to be viewed as a negative campaigner.
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, the Texas governor brushed off attempts by reporters to get him to
comment on the case.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Senator McCain must answer these questions. Senator McCain is chairman of
a very powerful committee in the United States Senate. He's a committee
chairman, he's been there for a period of time to the point where he can earn
this chairmanship,'' Bush said. ``Ask him these questions. I'm a person that
comes from Texas. I'm not a committee chairman. I'm a governor.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rather than demanding McCain answer questions about his actions, aides said
Bush was trying to highlight the contrast between his work outside Washington
and McCain's service in the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
	   In a good sign for McCain, he wasn't asked a single question about the
matter in a town hall with New Hampshire residents. Afterward, some voters
defended McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't see any problem with that part of his job of being senator,'' said
Gary Gordon of Bow, N.H. McCain is required to ``expedite things for his
constituents. Two years seems a long time to be waiting,'' Gordon said. ``Let's
get real.''

<HEADLINE> Florida Approves Lethal Injection  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Florida lawmakers in a special session Thursday
passed a bill to give death row inmates the option of lethal injection rather
than the electric chair, which came under scrutiny because of fiery and bloody
executions in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate passed the bill unanimously, and the House by a vote of 102-5,
sending the measure to Gov. Jeb Bush, who was expected to sign it.
</P>
<P>
	   Still pending final action was a proposal to speed up appeals by death row
inmates. The Republican governor insisted that the measure come with any changes
to the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
	   Florida is one of only four states of the 38 with capital punishment that
require execution by electrocution -- the others are Georgia, Alabama, Nebraska.
Florida has used its electric chair since the early 1920s.
</P>
<P>
	   Flames have erupted during two electrocutions in the last decade, and the
last condemned man, Allen Lee ``Tiny'' Davis, suffered a nosebleed during his
electrocution. Pictures of his bloody body and contorted face were posted on the
Internet and viewed by hundreds of thousands of people after the state Supreme
Court upheld use of the electric chair.
</P>
<P>
	   Executions in Florida came to a halt when the U.S. Supreme Court agreed in
October to review whether the electric chair amounts to cruel and unusual
punishment. Switching to lethal injection would allow Bush to resume signing
death warrants.
</P>
<P>
	   The legislation passed Thursday makes lethal injection Florida's primary
method of execution, but allows condemned inmates to choose electrocution. Some
lawmakers said they approved the bill only because appeals challenging the
electric chair have halted executions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We don't want the courts to be the legislators,'' Republican state Sen.
Ginny Brown-Waite said. ``My constituents want ... the delays stopped. We're
here today to make sure that justice truly is swift.''
</P>
<P>
	   The House voted 75-36 for Bush's appeals-reform package but failed to get
the two-thirds vote needed. Lawmakers planned to return to work on that issue
Friday morning. The Senate passed its version of the appeals bill 30-7, but it
was different than the House version.
</P>
<P>
	   The 44 people executed in Florida in the last 20 years went to the electric
chair more than 10 years after being sentenced. Bush wants that shortened to
five years.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters of the appeals reforms -- mostly Republicans -- said the bill
would stop frivolous appeals and bring legitimate ones before a court more
quickly.
</P>
<P>
	   Opponents -- all Democrats -- argued that lawmakers were overstepping their
authority and usurping a role that belonged to the judiciary. They also
criticized their colleagues for defeating an amendment to allow racial bias to
be considered in appeals.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of the negotiations, Bush appointed a task force Thursday to study
issues of racial discrimination in capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
	   And senators pushing for lethal injection agreed to take up another bill to
ban the execution of mentally retarded people. That measure passed the Senate
unanimously.

<HEADLINE> Orthodox Christmas Celebrated  </HEADLINE>
   By DINA KRAFT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) -- Leaders of the world's 15 Orthodox churches led
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat through a candlelit Christmas Mass in
Bethlehem, the town of Jesus' birth.
</P>
<P>
	   The midnight gathering Thursday marked an extraordinary bid for unity among
the world's sometimes fractious Eastern Orthodox churches, which held their
first synod in 60 years a day earlier in Jerusalem, and their first ever in the
Holy Land.
</P>
<P>
	   As church bells pealed, host Greek Orthodox Patriarch Diodoros I of
Jerusalem led Arafat into the recesses of the Church of the Nativity, a cave
where tradition says Jesus was born. Arafat, a Muslim, lit a candle.
</P>
<P>
	   Due to differences in the calendar, Orthodox Christmas falls on Jan. 7.
Orthodoxy's traditional domain includes more than 200 million worshippers and
encompasses Russia, much of Eastern Europe, the Balkans and some regions around
the Black Sea.
</P>
<P>
	   About half the Palestinian Christians living in the West Bank, Gaza Strip
and Israel celebrate Christmas according to the Eastern calendar.
</P>
<P>
	   This year's Orthodox celebrations were enlivened by visits of Eastern
European heads of state, including Russia's Boris Yeltsin, who stepped down last
week as president.
</P>
<P>
	   The patriarchs led a procession to Bethlehem's Manger Square earlier
Thursday. Greek Orthodox priests wore red cloaks embroidered with gold thread.
Russian Orthodox priests marched in their long black robes and elaborate
headpieces.
</P>
<P>
	   Altar boys in white carried silver candlesticks and struggled to protect the
flames from a biting wind. And Palestinian and Jordanian choirs sang hymns.
</P>
<P>
	   Thousands of spectators, undeterred by the chilly weather, watched the
procession from behind police barricades.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are so many patriarchs and leaders from our country here,'' said
onlooker Natalie Klenova of Moscow, a government worker. ``It gives us so much
pride.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Cairo, thousands of Coptic Christians attended their faith's Christmas
mass, which was overshadowed by the weekend clashes between Muslims and
Christians in southern Egypt.
</P>
<P>
	   Hymns filled Egypt's main cathedral in the mass, led by the head of the
Coptic Orthodox church's Pope Shenouda III.
</P>
<P>
	   Shenouda spoke of the peaceful relations between Muslims and Christians,
though he never referred directly to the Dec. 31-Jan. 2 violence around
el-Kusheh village, which left 20 people dead. Most of the victims were
Christians.
</P>
<P>
	   Shenouda also noted that the Coptic Christmas on Friday comes just a day
before the start of the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr. ``We thank God that these
two feasts come consecutively symbolizing the national unity that we live in,''
he said. Christians form about 10 percent of Egypt's mostly Muslim population.

<HEADLINE> GOP Candidates Deabte in N.H.  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DURHAM, N.H. (AP) -- An aggressive George W. Bush pledged in campaign debate
Thursday night to push for ``tax cuts, so help me God'' if elected to the White
House and accused presidential rival John McCain of seeking campaign finance
changes that would hurt the conservative cause.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, his insurgent candidacy at a crossroads in the first-in-the-nation
primary state, used the forum to strongly defend his actions on behalf of a
political donor who was seeking action from the Federal Communications
Commission.
</P>
<P>
	   The tax cut pledge uttered by Bush, the national GOP front-runner, was
all-but-unequivocal: ``If there's a recession it's important to cut taxes to
make sure the economy grows. ... It's also important to cut the taxes where
there's times of plenty. ... It's important to cut the taxes to make sure
Washington, D.C., does not spend the surplus.''
</P>
<P>
	   His questioner asked whether he was saying ``no new taxes, so help me God''
-- a reference to former President George Bush's no-new-taxes pledge that he
broke once he won the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is not only no new taxes. This is tax cuts, so help me God,'' replied
Bush, Texas governor and son of the former president.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, McCain and the other GOP contenders, Steve Forbes, Alan Keyes, Gary
Bauer and Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, met for 60 animated minutes on a stage at
the University New Hampshire -- the site of a debate one night earlier of the
Democratic presidential hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
	   The series of debates continues Friday night in South Carolina, where the
GOP contenders will meet once again, and again next week as the opening round of
primaries approaches.
</P>
<P>
	   There was an incendiary exchange over gays in the military that followed the
pledges Wednesday night by both of the Democratic presidential hopefuls that
they would make sure that homosexuals could serve openly.
</P>
<P>
	   Bauer said that Democratic stance would further the ``radical homosexual
agenda,'' and an animated Keyes said, ``I will return to the ban on homosexuals
in the military.''
</P>
<P>
	   Said Bush, ``I'm a don't ask, don't tell man.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration's policy, which the president has said has not
worked well, is to allow gay service members if they do not make their sexual
orientation known.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said that policy could be fine-tuned, but he added, ``I cannot change
a policy that's working.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain swiftly parried Bush's attack on the issue of campaign finance and
possible damage to the Republican Party, noting that his proposal includes steps
to limit union political activity.
</P>
<P>
	   And he was unequivocal in defending a letter he wrote to the FCC on behalf
of a political donor. ``My job is to make the bureaucrats work for the people,''
said McCain, who is chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee. ``I would do the
same thing again, almost anytime.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain smiled broadly as he issued his defense -- keeping a widely rumored
temper in check -- although his aides fretted that the issue of the letter could
seriously damage a candidacy based on a pledge of rooting out the influence of
special interests.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, for one, declined to prod McCain on the issue. ``I thought his answer
was fine,'' he said when moderator Tim Russert asked for his opinion.
</P>
<P>
	   The political subtext explained the course of the debate. Bush's tax cut
pledge was designed to strike a chord in a state where residents are fiercely
proud there is no income tax.
</P>
<P>
	   And his criticism of McCain on campaign finance -- his jab that it would
hurt Republicans -- was designed to peel away GOP voters from his closest rival.
</P>
<P>
	   Similarly, McCain's chances for victory in New Hampshire rest with
independents, and his defense of his actions before the FCC seemed an effort to
assure those voters who are attracted to his image as a reformer who will end
politics as usual.
</P>
<P>
	   The 60-minute debate was feisty, and none of the men on stage hesitated to
interrupt.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm going to take some time here,'' Hatch declared at one point, more than
halfway through a confrontation in which he struggled for airtime.
</P>
<P>
	   Bauer underscored his signature issue, saying he would not appoint any
justice to the Supreme Court ``who would sacrifice even one child,'' a pledge he
has uttered often in his effort to show unbreakable opposition to abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes, a wealthy publisher, sharply criticized the Clinton administration's
decision to send a Cuban boy whose mother died escaping Havana back to his
homeland to be reunited with his father. The child is ``Bill Clinton's human
sacrifice to Fidel Castro,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   But the main political dynamic of the evening was the struggle between Bush
and McCain, close rivals in the polls in New Hampshire, which holds the first
primary of the year on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   The two argued over taxes and campaign finance and snapped at each other a
time or two.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said Bush's tax plan would use the entire surplus.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No it doesn't,'' retorted the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Yes it does,'' shot back McCain, standing a few feet away.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush was asked at one point whether his personal religious beliefs would
affect his White House policies. Russert asked whether he would take the popular
Christian expression `What would Jesus do' into the Oval Office, and Bush
replied, ``I would take an expression into the Oval Office: 'Dear God Help
Me.'''
</P>
<P>
	   To which Bauer said, ``So would we.''

<HEADLINE> Bahamas Hangs Convicted Stabber  </HEADLINE>
   By DEBY NASH Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- A man who stabbed a German couple to death was
hanged Thursday, the fourth execution since the Bahamas resumed capital
punishment in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   David Mitchell, 27, was convicted in the stabbing deaths of Horst and Traude
Henning on the island of Abace, where they had lived for many years.
</P>
<P>
	   No motive was ever established for the 1994 killings, which occurred as the
couple was sleeping.
</P>
<P>
	   Three hangings had been scheduled Thursday, but a second person convicted
won a stay of execution and the third, 51-year-old John Higgs, committed suicide
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Higgs apparently slashed his wrists with a razor blade even though there was
a suicide watch and heavy security at Nassau's Fox Hill Prison ahead of the
proposed hangings. A coroner's inquest into Higgs' suicide began Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   A death notice for Mitchell was posted on a wooden board and hung from the
prison's gate.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 300 people turned out for his burial, some crying, some cheering,
as Mitchell's casket was lowered into the ground at a Nassau cemetery.
</P>
<P>
	   Two freshly dug graves on either side, intended for the other men who were
to be executed, stood empty.
</P>
<P>
	   Higgs was convicted of the 1993 murder of his wife, Joan, whose body was
found buried under a staircase in an unfinished apartment building in Nassau.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bahamas executed its first convict in 12 years in 1996, becoming the
first of several Caribbean countries to resume hangings in a bid to deter
increasing and more violent crime.
</P>
<P>
	   Twenty-five inmates remain on death row.

<HEADLINE> Debate Dodged Uncomfortable Issues  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gov. George W. Bush practically swore on a stack of Bibles
to cut taxes as president, but declined to say Thursday in a debate among
Republican candidates what would happen if the economy or national security
comes up against Armageddon.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush went down the same path of certitude that Vice President Al Gore took
when he vowed in a Democratic debate that a Gore administration would produce
budget surpluses -- period.
</P>
<P>
	   But Gore scooted back in a hurry when asked what might happen during a
national crisis, saying ``all bets are off.'' Bush let his pledge hang out there
when pressed, terming developments like wars ``extreme hypotheticals.''
</P>
<P>
	   Such a reluctance to confront uncomfortable possibilities, or even
present-day political realities, was evident throughout the GOP presidential
debate.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Forbes, facing persistent questions on why his campaign seems not to
have caught fire in New Hampshire, cited the example of Pat Buchanan, who pulled
a surprise Republican primary victory in the state in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At this point he was in single digits'' in opinion polls, Forbes said. But
that was a touch melodramatic; Buchanan was at 15 percent in a major poll at the
comparable stage of the 1996 campaign -- about three weeks from the New
Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, Alan Keyes asserted that the Constitution address the separation of
church and state.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the phrase does not appear in the Constitution, the First Amendment
opens, ``Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion'' --
words used to build up a body of law that speaks to just such a separation.

<HEADLINE> Nazi Suspect Leaves Britain  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Rather than face a third deportation, an 86-year-old man
accused of Nazi war crimes fled Britain on Thursday, as Latvia began
investigating allegations of atrocities linked to him during World War II.
</P>
<P>
	   Konrad Kalejs, who had been in London for six months, left rather than
contest the British government's move to deport him. He arrived Friday at
Singapore's Changi airport, where he was escorted off the plane separately from
other passengers.
</P>
<P>
	   It was believed Kalejs intended to go on to Melbourne, Australia, where he
has held citizenship since 1957.
</P>
<P>
	   Kalejs stands accused of being a member of the Arajs Kommando squad
responsible for the deaths of 30,000 people, mostly Jews, in Latvia during World
War II.
</P>
<P>
	   After his departure from London, the Latvian Embassy there announced Latvia
had launched the criminal investigation, and called for international help in
gathering evidence.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If in the result of the investigation, the Latvian general prosecutor's
office will gather enough evidence confirming the guilt of Mr. Kalejs, then
after the court's decision, Latvia will consider requesting the extradition of
Mr. Kalejs,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kalejs was previously deported from the United States and Canada because of
the allegations. He has denied the allegations, and described his accusers as
``liars and storytellers.''
</P>
<P>
	   Britain's decision to initiate deportation proceedings rather than detain
Kalejs outraged Jewish activists, but Home Secretary Jack Straw said there was
not enough evidence for a criminal prosecution in Britain.
</P>
<P>
	   The Australian government has said it cannot block Kalejs' return.
</P>
<P>
	   Australian Justice Minister Amanda Vanstone said a special body set up in
Australia to investigate Nazi war crimes had reported in 1992 that there was not
enough evidence to prosecute Kalejs.
</P>
<P>
	   More recently, Australian federal police agents thoroughly reviewed
information on Kalejs, Vanstone said. She did not say if the review included new
information or just the existing file.
</P>
<P>
	   But lawyer Robert Greenwood, who headed the now disbanded War Crimes Special
Investigation Unit, said Kalejs had never been investigated fully by Australian
officials.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We knew a lot about Mr. Kalejs, but we never targeted Mr. Kalejs as a
prime suspect in the real sense with a view to bringing a prosecution,''
Greenwood told the British Broadcasting Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   Vanstone said the Special Investigation Unit's report to Parliament in 1992
said ``all known witnesses'' had been interviewed in relation to Kalejs.

<HEADLINE> Alaskan Leader Pleads To Charges  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- A man once considered a top contender for governor
pleaded no contest Thursday to two charges stemming from the campaign finance
problems that toppled his run for office.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of a plea agreement, John Lindauer received a one-year suspended
sentence, two years probation, 100 hours of community service and a $15,000
fine.
</P>
<P>
	   He also agreed not to run for public office in Alaska again and to issue a
public apology.
</P>
<P>
	   Lindauer, a former state legislator and chancellor of the University of
Alaska at Anchorage, spent $1.7 million on his campaign for governor in 1998 and
easily won the Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
	   He claimed he was financing his campaign with his own money, but he later
was forced to admit that nearly all the money came from his wealthy second wife,
Dorothy Oremus, heiress to a Chicago concrete business.
</P>
<P>
	   Under state campaign laws, contributions are limited to $500 per individual.
</P>
<P>
	   After the facts about his financing came out, the state Republican Party
withdrew its support and Lindauer's campaign fell apart. He finished third in
the election with 17 percent of the vote, behind Democratic Gov. Tony Knowles
and a Republican write-in candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   Lindauer's lawyer, Peter Gruenstein, said Thursday that Lindauer had made
mistakes while pursuing a ``laudable goal'' of running a campaign that did not
rely on special interest money.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He has paid a very dear political price in respect to those mistakes,''
Gruenstein said. He said Lindauer plans to pursue business interests in Chicago
rather than stay in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
	   Lindauer pleaded no contest to providing false or misleading information to
the Internal Revenue Service and violating the campaign expenditure law.
</P>
<P>
	   He also pleaded no contest to a third charge -- submitting a false
statement, a misdemeanor that was reduced from a felony perjury charge.
</P>
<P>
	   That stemmed from Lindauer's claim that he received a check from the 1997
Alaska Permanent Fund -- money paid to residents who have lived in the state at
least one year and who apply for the dividend. Lindauer had been accused of only
moving back to Alaska from Chicago to run for governor.
</P>
<P>
	   His 1998 Permanent Fund application correctly showed he didn't receive a
1997 check.
</P>
<P>
	   Judge Stephanie Rhoades said Lindauer's actions were a pattern of lies that
had dragged down the political process and added to the public's bad image of
politicians.

<HEADLINE> Britain Probes Torture Allegations  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- British police are investigating torture allegations against a
Briton who formerly headed Bahrain's security services, Home Secretary Jack
Straw said in a television interview.
</P>
<P>
	   Col. Ian Henderson, 71, has been accused of overseeing the torture of
pro-democracy activists in the tiny Gulf state, a former British protectorate
that gained independence in 1971.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I understand that the matters concerned, the allegations, are the subject
of an investigation by the organized crime branch of the Metropolitan Police,''
Straw told Channel 4 News on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   A police spokesman confirmed the organized crime branch has received
documents alleging torture. The spokesman would not elaborate on the allegations
or investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   The Scottish-born Henderson, who retired in 1998 after more than 30 years in
Bahrain, was traveling and not immediately available for comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   But in a previous interview with Channel 4 News, he called the torture
allegations ``laughable'' and said they were invented by Bahrain opposition
groups to attract media attention.
</P>
<P>
	   There has been a growing movement for the restoration of democracy in
Bahrain since the state's rulers abolished the national assembly in 1975. In
addition, simmering resentment by the country's Shiite Muslim community has
periodically exploded into violence.
</P>
<P>
	   Bahrain's ruling family is Sunni Muslim, while most ordinary Bahrainis are
Shiites.
</P>
<P>
	   Opposition leaders have accused the security services of using force, arrest
and torture against political opponents.
</P>
<P>
	   Since Bahrain's longtime ruler died last March, his son who replaced him,
Sheik Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, has shown a willingness to address social and
political issues. He has loosened media restrictions and called for greater
democracy.
</P>
<P>
	   Col. Henderson and his wife Marie reportedly spent the New Year at a house
in Dartmoor, Devon, in southwest England but are believed to have since left the
country.
</P>
<P>
	   Lord Avebury, vice chairman of the parliamentary human rights group, said he
wrote to Straw last week asking for action against Henderson while he was in the
country.
</P>

<HEADLINE> TV Coverage Of SLA Trial Denounced  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Prosecutors argued Thursday that television coverage of
the bombing conspiracy trial of an alleged former member of the Symbionese
Liberation Army would endanger public safety by showing how terrorist groups
make bombs.
</P>
<P>
	   Court TV and Cable News Network have asked to televise the trial of Sara
Jane Olson. Her defense team supported the motion, saying her right to a fair
trial will be enhanced by TV coverage.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors Michael Latin and Eleanor Hunter on Thursday opposed the
request.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Much of the testimony in this case will revolve around the making of
terrorist bombs,'' said their court filing. ``Experts will describe in explicit
detail how terrorist groups, like the SLA, make their bombs, how law enforcement
disarms them, and techniques used by law enforcement in tracking those
responsible for domestic terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Detailed gavel to gavel television coverage will hinder law enforcement
and be detrimental to public safety,'' they said.
</P>
<P>
	   Olson, formerly known as Kathleen Ann Soliah, is accused of planting pipe
bombs under two police cars in 1975 as part of a SLA plot to avenge the killings
of six SLA members in a Los Angeles police shootout. The devices did not
explode.
</P>
<P>
	   Superior Court Judge James Ideman did not immediately rule on the television
issue. So far, he has refused to admit TV cameras to hearings in the case. Trial
is set to begin next month.
</P>
<P>
	   Olson remained a fugitive for more than two decades and led an apparently
crime-free life as a doctor's wife and mother of three children until she was
arrested in June near her home in St. Paul, Minn. She has pleaded innocent and
is free on $1 million bail.

<HEADLINE> Lehman Bros. Earnings Jump 307 Pct.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Fourth-quarter earnings at Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
surged 307 percent to $301 million, well above analysts' predictions.
</P>
<P>
	   Lehman attributed the strong earnings numbers to record profits in the New
York-based company's investment banking and securities trading businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   Lehman earned $2.28 a share, or 31 cents above analysts' expectations of
$1.97 a share, for the three months ended Nov. 30, the company said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   During the fourth quarter of 1998, the firm reported net income of $74
million, or 51 cents a share, as all of Wall Street suffered in the wake of a
global financial crisis brought on by economic strife in Asia and Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   Lehman's shares rose along with most other banking stocks Thursday, rising
$2.93 3/4 to $72.87 1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Net revenues, which exclude interest expenses, totaled $1.4 billion for the
quarter, or more than double the $665 million in the year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
	   "This year's record results reflect how far the firm has come since becoming
a public company five years ago. Underscoring our position as a leading global
investment bank, our earnings in 1999 represent a tenfold increase from our
first year's net income level," Richard S. Fuld Jr., chairman and chief
executive of Lehman, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   For the full fiscal year, profits totaled $1.13 billion, a 54 percent
increase from the $736 million in fiscal 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Full year revenues were $5.3 billion vs. $4.1 billion.

<HEADLINE> Rudy Crew Hired at U. of Washington  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- A day after his job ended as head of the nation's largest
school system, Rudy Crew was hired Thursday to lead a new institute at the
University of Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   Crew will be executive director of the school's fledgling Institute for K-12
Leadership, which has been in development since 1998. The institute aims to
provide training for current and aspiring school leaders. He starts his new
$175,000-a-year job Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   ``With the appointment of Rudy Crew, the UW takes a giant step in bringing
together the necessary resources for making a key contribution to public
education in America,'' said university President Richard McCormick.
</P>
<P>
	   Allen Glenn, dean of the College of Education, told reporters that Crew's
arrival marked the start of ``an exciting roller-coaster ride.''
</P>
<P>
	   Crew replied: ``If it's anything like the one I've been through, I'll
pass.''
</P>
<P>
	   Crew served as chancellor of New York City schools for four years. Last
spring, he clashed with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani over the issue of using
taxpayer-funded vouchers to send public students to private schools. Crew
opposed the idea, which the mayor supported.
</P>
<P>
	   On Christmas Eve, the city's Board of Education voted 4-3 to let him go. New
York schools have 1.1 million students.
</P>
<P>
	   Crew, 49, headed the Tacoma School District for two years before going to
New York. He has two children at the University of Washington and has maintained
a home outside Tacoma.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After a day spent defending his ethics, Sen. John McCain
wasn't expecting an attack on his taste in music.
</P>
<P>
	   During the Republican presidential debate Thursday night in Durham, N.H.,
former U.N. Ambassador Alan Keyes brought up recent comments by McCain on
television that his favorite rock group was Nine Inch Nails. Keyes said the TV
program then displayed some of the group's lyrics, which were laced with
profanities.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Don't you think that as leaders we ought to be a little bit more serious
about the kind of influences that are now destroying the lives of our children,
and before we open our mouths, we ought to know what we're talking about?''
Keyes asked.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain responded like a contestant on ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Can I get a lifeline?'' the Arizona senator quipped. He said he wanted to
confer with his 15-year-old daughter, who recently accompanied him to the MTV
Video Music Awards.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain first said humor was important in politics, but then grew serious.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I agree with you that they're being subjected to terrible influences,''
McCain said. ``Yes, I was trying to be amusing and entertaining, and it was a
poor choice.''

<HEADLINE> Reno Backs Ruling on Cuban Boy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Hundreds of Cuban-Americans chanting ``Liberty! Liberty!''
blocked intersections and cut off access to the Port of Miami on Thursday to
protest the U.S. government's decision to return 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez to
his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Police arrested about 100 people, including two prominent Cuban exile
leaders, for refusing to disperse.
</P>
<P>
	   Roaming groups of protesters disrupted traffic on major streets during
evening rush hour, angering drivers trying to escape the gridlock.
</P>
<P>
	   A motorist plowed through a group of protesters blocking an intersection
near Miami International Airport, knocking a man and a woman to the ground.
Their conditions were not immediately known. One police officer working crowd
contol suffered broken bones when he was hit by a motorist trying to get home.
</P>
<P>
	   The situation was expected to continue Friday. Brothers to the Rescue, a
Miami-based exile group that searches the waters off Florida for Cubans trying
to make it to the United States, called for supporters to drive 15 mph Friday
throughout Miami-Dade County.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, Attorney General Janet Reno essentially ruled out any chance
she will reverse Wednesday's decision by the Immigration and Naturalization
Service to send the boy back to the communist island.
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. Jeb Bush wrote to President Clinton on Thursday seeking a reversal of
the INS decision.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Fidel Castro has made Elian a poster child for his communist dictatorship,
and has turned what should be a determination as to the child's best interest
into a way to advance his own political tyranny,'' Bush wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   For the past six weeks, Elian has been the subject of protests in Florida
and Cuba -- and in the middle of an international debate over where he belongs.
Fidel Castro kept up the pressure with another government-orchestrated
demonstration Thursday in Havana.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy was found Thanksgiving Day clinging to an inner tube at sea after
his mother, stepfather and eight other people drowned while trying to reach
Florida by boat. He has been living in Miami with his paternal great-uncle and
great-aunt.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian, whose whereabouts were kept secret after Wednesday's decision,
arrived back at his relatives' home Thursday afternoon. His great-uncle hoisted
Elian on his shoulders and the boy smiled and waved to cheering supporters
outside the house.
</P>
<P>
	   A source close to the family said Elian's relatives told him he may be
returning to Cuba and he said he did not want to go. Elian's father called the
boy from Cuba Thursday but it wasn't known what they talked about.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for the boy's American relatives asked Reno to reverse the decision
and said they will announce on Friday their plans for legal action.
</P>
<P>
	   But Reno said she had consulted with INS Commissioner Doris Meissner and
agreed with the decision. ``Based on all the information we have to date, I see
no basis for reversing,'' Reno said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The INS said the boy must be returned to Cuba by Jan. 14.
</P>
<P>
	   In Miami, several hundred protesters gathered outside a downtown federal
building, pushed back police barricades and marched several blocks to the Port
of Miami, where most of the arrests were made.
</P>
<P>
	   About 50 officers in riot gear guarded the port's entrance in the shadow of
Freedom Tower, a former customs building where many Cubans entered the United
States in the 1960s. About 780,000 Cuban-Americans live in Miami-Dade County,
accounting for 35 percent of its 2.1 million residents.
</P>
<P>
	   Demonstrators shouted ``Clinton! Coward! Miami hates you!'' They carried
posters in English and Spanish and waved U.S. and Cuban flags.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm defending my rights because where the rights of one person end, the
rights of another begin,'' said Meri Pino, 70, who refused to move from the port
entry.
</P>
<P>
	   Police arrested people who sat on the pavement and others who crossed police
lines. Those arrested included Cuban exile leaders Ramon Sanchez, head of the
Democracy Movement, and Jose Basulto, founder of Brothers to the Rescue, an
anti-Castro group.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is not a typical custody battle between parents in two different
states of the United States,'' Basulto said after he and Sanchez were released
from jail Thursday night. ``This is a country against a family.''
</P>
<P>
	   The headquarters of Royal Caribbean International, a leading cruise line, is
on port property, and the demonstration kept employees from leaving for several
hours. No major cruise ships were in port Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Elsewhere, small groups of protesters intermittently blocked intersections.
Gov. Jeb Bush lifted tolls on highways near protests to relieve rush-hour
congestion.
</P>
<P>
	   At least 10 people carrying a large Cuban flag sat down in the middle of a
main downtown street, crippling traffic during a downpour. Motorists honked
their horns in irritation or support.
</P>
<P>
	   During the morning rush-hour, two dump trucks and a pickup truck slowed all
three lanes of downtown-bound traffic to about 20 mph on the major east-west
route in Miami. The Florida Highway Patrol issued several citations and
threatened to arrest drivers slowing traffic.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm Haitian and they send all the Haitians back,'' motorist Fritz Rene,
31, said at one blocked intersection as he was trying to get to work. ``Whenever
anything happens to the Cubans, they go crazy.''
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's cousin Marisleysis Gonzalez said she supported the demonstrators but
asked them to remain peaceful.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are a lot of Cubans here who have suffered and they are willing to
stop this because the laws here are not being fair,'' the boy's cousin said
outside her home. ``They haven't given us the opportunity to speak on behalf of
him.''
</P>
<P>
	   American officials had suggested that Elian's father come to Florida to get
his son. The U.S. National Council of Churches said the boy's relatives in Cuba
want the organization to bring the boy back.

<HEADLINE> Bush Echos Father in Debate  </HEADLINE>
   By WALTER R. MEARS AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DURHAM, N.H. (AP) -- George W. Bush went his father one better and swore an
oath to cut taxes ``so help me God'' -- a vow that could haunt him should he
follow his father into the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   A no-tax helped President Bush get there, but he broke it and lost the next
election. And keeping a vow to cut taxes would be even more difficult;
presidents can't do that without Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1988 campaign promise of the elder Bush was that he would veto a tax
increase should the Democratic Congress try to impose one. ``Read my lips: No
new taxes,'' he pledged to tell them.
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. Bush's version of the family political pledge, delivered Thursday
night:
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is not only no new taxes, this is tax cuts, so help me God.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush made his vow in debate with his five rivals for the Republican
presidential nomination. He was promoting his $483 billion, five-year tax cut
proposal. ``I'm governor of a state that -- I took the same message to our
people,'' Bush said. ``I've worked with Democrats and Republicans alike to cut
the taxes ... in Texas, twice.''
</P>
<P>
	   But he couldn't get all he proposed in Texas. And his debate rivals said
Bush also proposed increasing sales and other taxes as part of a package with
property tax reductions.
</P>
<P>
	   And no president can guarantee a tax cut. Congress decides that.
</P>
<P>
	   So the Bush line could echo past the campaign for the Republican
presidential nomination. ``If anybody knows the risk of making that pledge,
Governor Bush does,'' said Steve Duprey, the New Hampshire Republican chairman.
</P>
<P>
	   He watched the no-tax pledge boost Bush Sr.'s campaign in 1988. But as
president, Bush reneged. In 1990, he said there would have to be ``tax revenue
increases'' as part of a deal with Congress to reduce the federal budget
deficit.
</P>
<P>
	   Conservatives never let him forget it. During his losing campaign for
reelection, the elder Bush said breaking the tax commitment was his worst
mistake.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush and rival John McCain bickered over their tax plans. McCain said Bush's
proposal would spend the entire surplus.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No it doesn't,'' retorted the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Yes it does,'' shot back McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   On taxes, social security and the rest of the campaign agenda, the latest
GOP debate between Bush, John McCain, Steve Forbes, Gary Bauer, Orrin Hatch and
Alan Keyes was much like the three they'd had before.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush skipped three earlier debates.
</P>
<P>
	   ``George, since you joined us, it's gotten a lot more nasty, I'll tell
you,'' said Hatch.

<HEADLINE> NEngland Ski Areas Lose Out to Golf  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID SHARP Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOCKE MILLS, Maine (AP) -- The snow guns are firing at full capacity on New
England ski slopes, but it's hard for some skiers to get motivated when the golf
courses are still open in January.
</P>
<P>
	   Around New England, the normally frigid temperatures this time of year have
reached the 60s, and snowfall is way below normal, leaving slopes and
cross-country routes spotted with rocks or grass.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I had a customer who was going to come in and buy some skis. Instead, he
went golfing,'' said Chris Perry at Joe Jones Ski &AMP; Sports in South Portland.
</P>
<P>
	   At Mount Abram ski resort, more than half of the 35 trails remain closed for
lack of snow, and the ski area was nearly deserted Thursday, despite a special
promotion: Ski all day for $10.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Last year I was told it was a bad year,'' said owner Randy Dunican, who
bought Mount Abram in 1998, before a season in which many ski resorts nationwide
were hurt by a lack of snow. ``Now I know what a bad year is.''
</P>
<P>
	   The problems are not universal.
</P>
<P>
	   Both snow and bookings are plentiful in Utah after a lag early in the ski
season, and resorts in Colorado are benefiting from recent snowfalls. Some
resorts, like Snowshoe in West Virginia and Jiminy Peak and Brodie Mountain in
Massachusetts, reported strong attendance over the holidays.
</P>
<P>
	   But others said that unless they get some real snow soon, they could be
hurting. Many skiers don't think there is snow at the resorts unless they see
snow in their back yards.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If we don't have snow by February, that's going to be a really serious
situation for us, because February makes or breaks the winter season,'' said
Robert Uguccioni, executive director of the Pocono Mountains Vacation Bureau in
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
	   The lack of snow is most acute in New England.
</P>
<P>
	   In Maine, for example, Portland is experiencing the longest stretch of
snowless days since records were first kept in 1881-82.
</P>
<P>
	   The last time the city saw measurable snowfall was March 16. ``That was 296
days ago, and we're still counting,'' Augie Sardinha, a National Weather Service
meteorologist, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The lack of snow has put Portland almost 2 feet behind schedule for a
typical winter, in which 6 feet of snow fall. To make matters worse,
temperatures climbed to record highs in the 60s across New England on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   On a typical Thursday, Mount Abram should see about 1,000 skiers. But
Dunican said he would be lucky to get 400, and that included high school ski
team members paying only $5 a head.
</P>
<P>
	   Moreover, the machine-made snow that people were gliding over Thursday
doesn't come cheap. Mount Abram's snow-making system costs $6,000 to $9,000 a
day to operate, Dunican said.
</P>
<P>
	   Shawnee Peak in Bridgton was experiencing the same troubles even though 23
of 38 trails and glades were open.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're feeling an impact. It's difficult when there are news stories about
golf courses still being open. It's difficult to compete with that,'' said
spokeswoman Carisa Flood.
</P>
<P>
	   Even worse off were cross-country ski areas, which depend entirely on
natural snow for business.
</P>
<P>
	   In Oxford, only a few patches of snow lay on the 15 miles of grassy trails
at Carter's Cross County Ski Area. It has yet to open, and the lack of snow has
hurt sales of ski gear as well, said Anne Carter, a co-owner.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You just hope and pray that the weather will change,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Since Monday, the weather has turned colder across New England. But there
are no plans to close the Nonesuch River Golf Club in Scarborough.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're going until the snow flies,'' said Larry Chapman, manager of the pro
shop. ``We're taking tee times for Saturday and Sunday. We'll probably be mobbed
both days.''

<HEADLINE> LA Councilman Pleads Innocent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A former sheriff's sergeant who now serves on the
Palmdale city council pleaded innocent Thursday to numerous counts of child
molestation.
</P>
<P>
	   Kevin Carney turned himself in a day after he was charged with 17 felony
counts of child molestation involving four girls, and one misdemeanor charge of
possessing child pornography.
</P>
<P>
	   Carney was jailed on $2 million bond. He faces life in prison if convicted.
</P>
<P>
	   His attorney, Milton Grimes, said Thursday there was nothing to the charges
involving the girls. Carney declined to comment to reporters at the hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   Voters in Palmdale, about 50 miles north of Los Angeles, elected Carney to
the council in November, shortly after he was arrested for investigation of lewd
conduct with a 14-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
	   He denied the charges, calling them part of a dirty smear campaign from his
opponent, and was freed on bail.
</P>
<P>
	   Carney, a 23-year sheriff's department veteran, retired a month after his
arrest in October. At one time, he was a leading sex abuse investigator,
supervising cases involving children.
</P>
<P>
	   He was removed from that detail in 1997 after being accused of
inappropriately touching two 9-year-olds. While charges were not filed at the
time, six of the counts filed Wednesday involve that case.

<HEADLINE> Women Off Welfare Lacking Insurance  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A study of mothers leaving welfare found that one-third of
those who took jobs weren't covered by health insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   The number lacking health insurance was even higher among women who left
welfare but didn't work, even though many of them should be eligible for
Medicaid. Nearly half of these unemployed women didn't have insurance a year or
more after leaving welfare, according to the study to be published Monday in the
journal Health Affairs.
</P>
<P>
	   Children previously receiving welfare fared better when it comes to keeping
insurance, the study showed. Forty-seven percent were covered by Medicaid and 29
percent were covered by private insurance. The rest were uninsured.
</P>
<P>
	   Families that leave welfare can still keep Medicaid if they meet certain
income or medical needs. The study says that many lose their Medicaid coverage
because eligibility rules are more complex and some caseworkers and welfare
recipients don't understand them.
</P>
<P>
	   The study didn't examine the reasons why women who get jobs after leaving
welfare don't have health insurance through their employers. The study's authors
said that other research shows that ex-welfare recipients have low-wage jobs
that don't offer insurance or, if insurance is offered, don't pay enough for
them to afford premiums.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Finding work does not guarantee that a former welfare recipient will also
obtain health care coverage,'' said author Bowen Garrett, a research associate
at the Urban Institute, one of the sponsors of the study of 1,004 women and
1,662 children who left welfare between 1995 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   The research was part of a project funded by several organizations,
including the Henry J. Kaiser Family.
</P>
<P>
	   The study is the latest evidence that low-income families leaving welfare
are losing insurance coverage.
</P>
<P>
	   Auditors at the Health Care Financing Administration, which runs Medicaid,
found that some states are illegally denying benefits to poor families dropped
from the welfare rolls.
</P>
<P>
	   People were losing Medicaid coverage because they were not told they were
eligible, were automatically dropped from computerized Medicaid files when they
got off welfare, or were improperly harassed by caseworkers when they applied
for coverage, auditors said.
</P>
<P>
	   A study last year by Families USA, a liberal consumer group, estimated that
675,000 people lost Medicaid coverage and had no other health insurance in 1997
due to strict new welfare rules.
</P>
<P>
	   Judy Waxman, director of government affairs at the group, said families who
lose insurance are at risk of returning to welfare because parents with sick
children will have to stay home.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If their kids get sick, they can't afford a doctor and the kids get sicker
-- then the parents have to leave work,'' said Waxman.

<HEADLINE> Hunters Take Bomb as Keepsake  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OCALA, Fla. (AP) -- Two hunters found a rusty World War II-era bomb in Ocala
National Forest, heaved it into a pickup and toted it back to their hunting
camp, prompting an evacuation of about 50 people and a hurried response from
bomb experts.
</P>
<P>
	   Another hunter reported it Wednesday, sending Lake County sheriff's deputies
scrambling to evacuate a residential area in the national forest and prompting a
military bomb squad to haul away the device.
</P>
<P>
	   The bomb likely came from the nearby Pinecastle Electronic Warfare Range,
which has been used by the Navy for more than 50 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Greg Pruitt, 23, said he and his buddies wanted the bomb as a keepsake. When
he saw the furor the bomb caused, he came forward.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Looking back, common sense should have kicked in a little better,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Pruitt said the hunters joked about the bomb detonating but figured it
wouldn't because it was so rusted and dented. But a munitions expert said age
does not keep a bomb from exploding.

<HEADLINE> FCC To Push for Interactive TV  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- The chairman of the Federal Communications Commission plans
to deliver an ultimatum to broadcasters and manufacturers struggling to deliver
interactive digital television to consumers: Come up with a solution by April or
face regulation.
</P>
<P>
	   FCC Chairman William Kennard, in his clearest statement to date on the
government's role in guiding the future of digital television, chided the
industry for creating bottlenecks that have slowed the rollout of crystal-clear
television for five years.
</P>
<P>
	   In prepared remarks for a speech Friday at the giant Consumer Electronics
Show, Kennard noted that many companies were showcasing models of
high-definition television -- some at prices analysts say will prove attractive
this year to consumers -- with the promise of delivering not only programming
but exchanging data through Internet connections and home networks.
</P>
<P>
	   But none of those televisions can be plugged into cable -- the medium
through which most Americans still get their programming -- because of wrangling
over technology compatability standards for the various equipment and piracy
issues, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Your time and our patience are running out,'' Kennard said. ``The
Commission has tried to let you solve this problem. We have been goading and
nagging. But so far you have not finished the job.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The American public will not let the Commission wait much longer for you
to agree on standards, and the law gives the Commission clear responsibility to
act if you do not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The first high-definition televisions began selling in late 1998, and more
than 100 stations reaching 50 percent of the American people now offer the
option of receiving high-quality digital TV signals. But the pictures are eroded
through cable converters to quality not much better than traditional analog TVs,
Kennard said.
</P>
<P>
	   To address the problem, the chairman said he had directed to FCC to draft
proposed rules on compatibility standards and would move toward making those
rules law if interactive digital television is not moving forward by April.
</P>
<P>
	   Digital technology lets broadcasters squeeze more video and data into
existing channel space, giving them numerous options. They could use it to
provide high definition TV, which offers sharper pictures then standard digital.
They could also offer additional TV channels for sports or movies, or stock
quotes and other data transmitted to home computers -- or a combination.
</P>
<P>
	   The technology, for example, could let people watching a favorite show click
an icon on digital TV sets and obtain information on the actors, writers and
past episodes.
</P>
<P>
	   And, it offers new opportunities to make money. For instance, a viewer
watching a music video could click on an on-screen icon and buy the CD. Stations
would get a piece of the money from these sales, experts say. Or stations could
share the revenues from ads that accompany online services.
</P>
<P>
	   But many industries involved in the interactive television effort have been
more concerned about losing money, Kennard said.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead of working to solve the problem quickly, cable operators are
battling with other media providers over standards that would unleash the full
promise of interactive TV because of concern about the loss of market share and
programming control, Kennard said.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, the motion picture and recording industries have expressed concern
about piracy of movies presented over digital TV. Both industries are struggling
to come up with protections against digital piracy because copies could be made
again and again without degrading the quality from the original.
</P>
<P>
	   ``To make (interactive TV) a reality, these broadcasters will have to stop
looking in their rear-view mirrors, pay less attention to protecting what they
have, and look ahead and forge new ground,'' Kennard said

<HEADLINE> 33 Journalists Said Killed in 1999  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- From Sierra Leone to Yugoslavia, journalism was an often
dangerous profession to practice in 1999, with 33 journalists in 10 countries
losing their lives because of their work, a press freedom group said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The number of deaths increased from the year before, when 24 journalists
were killed in 17 countries, the Committee to Protect Journalists said.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1999, the African nation of Sierra Leone was the most dangerous place for
journalists, with 10 killed there, including Associated Press Television News
producer Myles Tierney.
</P>
<P>
	   Tierney and Ian Stewart, AP's bureau chief from Abidjan, Ivory Coast, were
among a group of journalists traveling -- with military escort -- through
downtown Freetown when they came under attack last January. A rebel opened fire
on the AP car; Tierney died instantly, and Stewart suffered a serious head
wound.
</P>
<P>
	   Yugoslavia had the second-highest number of deaths, with six. Other
countries where journalists were killed included Colombia, East Timor,
Argentina, Lebanon, Nigeria, Russia, Sri Lanka, and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
	   All 33 journalists were killed either while on assignment or as a direct
result of their work, according to researchers at CPJ.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, the French media watchdog group Reporters Without Borders
reported that 36 journalists had been killed worldwide in 1999. The discrepancy
between that number and the one released by CPJ was not immediately explained,
but CPJ is still investigating the deaths of 19 other journalists that may have
been related to their professions.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of those killed were targeted by warring factions within the various
countries, CPJ said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We see a clear policy, particularly in Sierra Leone, Colombia, and East
Timor, of armed factions seeking to banish or even exterminate journalists in
order to hide the truth,'' CPJ executive director Ann Cooper said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Whether it's the Indonesian army or Sierra Leonean rebels, the goal is
obvious: get rid of the witnesses whose reporting can inform the world about
atrocities, corruption, or killings.''

<HEADLINE> Women Off Welfare Lacking Insurance  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A study of mothers leaving welfare found that one-third of
those who took jobs weren't covered by health insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   The number lacking health insurance was even higher among women who left
welfare but didn't work, even though many of them should be eligible for
Medicaid. Nearly half of these unemployed women didn't have insurance a year or
more after leaving welfare, according to the study to be published Monday in the
journal Health Affairs.
</P>
<P>
	   Children previously receiving welfare fared better when it comes to keeping
insurance, the study showed. Forty-seven percent were covered by Medicaid and 29
percent were covered by private insurance after one year. But 29 percent were
uninsured. The numbers add up to more than 100 percent because some children had
multiple sources of health insurance coverage.
</P>
<P>
	   Families that leave welfare can still keep Medicaid if they meet certain
income or medical needs. The study says that many lose their Medicaid coverage
because eligibility rules are more complex and some caseworkers and welfare
recipients don't understand them.

welfare don't have health insurance through their employers. The study's authors

them to afford premiums.

<HEADLINE> Ventura Quiet About Trump Meeting  </HEADLINE>
   By ROCHELLE OLSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Gov. Jesse Ventura refused to talk Thursday about
any political motives behind his high-profile Twin Cities events with New York
developer and potential Reform Party presidential candidate Donald Trump.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's coming to town,'' Ventura said tersely. ``I'll enjoy lunch with him
(Friday).''
</P>
<P>
	   Ventura has said he won't support Reform Party presidential candidate Pat
Buchanan, but he wouldn't say Thursday whether he would back Trump if he runs
for president.
</P>
<P>
	   In advance of Trump's visit Friday for a Chamber of Commerce luncheon
speech, news conference and Ventura campaign fund-raiser, the governor's aides
repeatedly warned against reading too much into the trip.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This indicates a desire for alternatives,'' Minnesota Planning director
Dean Barkley said of Ventura's meetings with Trump.
</P>
<P>
	   Trump's public events will be in Brooklyn Park, where Ventura served as
mayor. In contrast, when Buchanan visited the state in October, he and Ventura
did not meet or even speak on the phone.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor and other Minnesota Reform Party leaders have been critical of
Buchanan's conservative positions on social issues and opposition to free trade.
In addition, the Minnesota leaders are openly recruiting other candidates to
take on Buchanan, who is well-organized and has support from loyalists to party
founder Ross Perot.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the topic of Friday's joint news conference with Ventura and
Trump will be inclusion in presidential debates. Rules announced Thursday by the
nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates could make it difficult for any
candidate who didn't have at least 15 percent support in national polls to
participate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As Governor Ventura has shown, third party candidates when they're in the
debates can win and can govern exceptionally well. And they can get elected on
platforms that the other two parties do not otherwise make available,'' said
Phil Madsen, who runs Ventura's political Web site.

<HEADLINE> Attorneys Argue For Homeless Couple  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WORCESTER, Mass. (AP) -- A homeless couple accused of accidentally starting a
warehouse blaze that led to the deaths of six firefighters were not obligated to
report the fire, their attorneys said Thursday in arguing for their release from
jail.
</P>
<P>
	   At a bail hearing, lawyers for Thomas Levesque, 37, and Julie Barnes, 19,
also argued that prosecutors had not shown the firefighters' deaths could have
been prevented if Barnes and Levesque reported the fire.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no affirmative duty that required her to report the fire,'' said
Barnes' attorney, Michael Wilcox.
</P>
<P>
	   Barnes and Levesque have pleaded innocent to six counts of involuntary
manslaughter in connection with the Dec. 3 warehouse fire at the Worcester Cold
Storage and Warehouse Co. where they had been living. Firefighters had been told
the couple lived in the building and entered the building, in part, to find
them.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, prosecutors portrayed Levesque as a man who felt no regret
about the fire.
</P>
<P>
	   Assistant District Attorney Lawrence Murphy said that after kicking over a
candle during an argument with Barnes, Levesque told Barnes, ``I don't give a
(expletive),'' before heading to an arcade with her to listen to music.
</P>
<P>
	   Levesque's attorney argued that the comment was made in reference to clothes
burned in the fire and said Levesque was deeply saddened by the firefighters'
deaths.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He is overwhelmed by remorse,'' said Ryan. ``Mr. Levesque is like a child.
... He is scared to death.''
</P>
<P>
	   Judge Elliot Zide rejected motions to release the defendants on personal
recognizance, despite lawyers' arguments that Barnes is four months pregnant and
that Levesque is mildly retarded.
</P>
<P>
	   Zide reduced Levesque's bail to $250,000 and Barnes' to $75,000; both had
been held on $1 million bail. They did not post the new bond amounts Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Zide also deemed Levesque mentally competent to stand trial and set a
conference date for Feb. 21.

<HEADLINE> Breast Implant Ruling Appealed  </HEADLINE>
    By JIM SUHR Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- Dow Corning Corp. and lawyers for women who sued the company
over silicone breast implants appealed Thursday to a federal judge to overturn a
ruling they said could unravel the complicated settlement plan.
</P>
<P>
	   The appeal asks U.S. District Judge Denise Page Hood to throw out federal
Bankruptcy Judge Arthur Spector's Dec. 21 ruling that allows women who voted
against the $3.2 billion settlement to sue Dow Corning's corporate parents.
</P>
<P>
	   The settlement had barred further lawsuits against Dow Chemical and Corning
Corp. over silicone implants. That clause is among keys to the settlement, part
of a $4.5 billion bankruptcy reorganization plan for Dow Corning.
</P>
<P>
	   Dow Corning and the Tort Claimants Committee -- representing thousands of
women with silicone implants the company once made -- had called Spector's
ruling confusing and a potential catalyst for more litigation.
</P>
<P>
	   The company and the claimants committee has called the "third-party release"
clause "fundamental" to the settlement plan overwhelmingly approved after years
of contentious negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   Spector's opinion also said women who voted to approve the settlement would
be barred from suing the companies. It's unclear how many women his opinion
might affect; 112,774 women voted on the plan last year, with 94 percent
approving.
</P>
<P>
	   Spector said there was no reason to assume allowing claims from women who
voted against the deal would create an undue burden on the companies. He said
many such claims already have been filed.
</P>
<P>
	   The no-lawsuit release in the settlement had been fought by lawyers for a
group of women in Nevada, where the state's supreme court has upheld damages
against Dow Chemical over silicone breast implants, opening the door for similar
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
	   Geoffrey White, a lawyer representing the Nevada women, said he will try to
have the appeal dismissed.
</P>
<P>
	   "He gave them everything they wanted -- hook, line and sinker, except for 1
percent," White said of Spector's ruling. "Nearly every concession that Dow
Corning asked for they got, including Dow Chemical's release from liability for
94 percent of the whole world."
</P>
<P>
	   To bar further lawsuits "would be patently unfair, absurd and unjust," White
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dow Corning, which no longer makes silicone breast implants, declared
bankruptcy in 1995 after thousands of women sued over implants. Women have
blamed leaking gel from the implants for lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, body
aches, fatigue, memory loss and hardening of the breasts.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the proposed settlement, women who blame illnesses on Dow Corning
silicone breast implants could get between $12,000 and $300,000 each. Women
could also receive up to $25,000 for ruptured or leaking implants, and up to
$5,000 for implant removal.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Official Defends Expulsions  </HEADLINE>
   By MARK STEVENSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A top Mexican official on Thursday defended the
expulsion of 12 U.S. citizens for attending a rebel-sponsored New Year
celebration in troubled-plagued Chiapas state.
</P>
<P>
	   The expulsions came amid complaints by human rights groups of strict limits
on foreign travel to Chiapas, where the leftist Zapatista rebels staged a brief
armed uprising six years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Alejandro Carrillo, the country's top immigration official, said the
expulsions were legal and justified.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Foreigners are not prohibited from attending local celebrations, but if
the celebrations have a political connection, that's interference'' in domestic
politics and grounds for expulsion under Mexican law, Carrillo told a Mexico
City news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   The government has frequently banned foreigners it accuses of being
sympathizers of the Chiapas-based Zapatistas. But human rights group charge that
independent observers have also been the focus of a campaign that has resulted
in hundreds of expulsions in 1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the 12 was Kerry Appel, a Denver man who built a business buying
coffee direct from Mexican farmers. They were detained at a government
checkpoint after attending the party. Mexico said their presence violated terms
of their visas by becoming involved in domestic political issues.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a tough decision, because I've had very good relations with the
Mexicans over the last 30 years,'' Appel, an outspoken rebel supporter, said in
San Cristobal, Chiapas. ``It appears there is a campaign to get all the
foreigners out of Indian villages'' in Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
	   The Zapatista uprising was aimed at demanding greater democracy for Mexico's
Indians. Peace talks between the government and rebels have been held
intermittently and a truce remains in effect.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Rejoins Mideast Talks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- President Clinton plunged back into slow-moving
Mideast peace talks Thursday, meeting with Israel's prime minister and the
Syrian foreign minister after face-to-face negotiations between the two sides
ground to a halt.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. aim is a treaty that would exchange the Golan Heights, a strategic
border territory Israel has held for more than three decades, for diplomatic and
economic relations with Syria.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton met separately for an hour each with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa. He then flew back to
Washington by helicopter.
</P>
<P>
	   A State Department spokesman, Philip Reeker, said Clinton would return
Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's spokesman, Joe Lockhart, called the meetings constructive and
``obviously susbtantive,'' but did not say whether the president made any
headway.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Both the prime minister and the foreign minister are quite engaged,'' he
said. ``There are a lot of things that have to be worked through and it's going
to take more than one afternoon to work on these issues.''
</P>
<P>
	   There was no word on whether the president was able to set up a three-way
meeting or had resolved any of the knotty problems that must be overcome if
Israel is to swap territory for a peace treaty with Syria.
</P>
<P>
	   Syria began Wednesday to outline its offer in a mixed committee under the
supervision of Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk. A committee on new
border security measures met all day, as well.
</P>
<P>
	   But there were no face-to-face negotiations over Syria's key demand: a
specific timetable for Israel to relinquish the Golan Heights, which Syria lost
in the 1967 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
	   State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said the talks, in their fourth
day, were still ``chugging along.'' But he said the American hosts were
dissatisfied with the pace and would like to see it accelerated.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton and Barak, along with their advisers, met for about 45 minutes, then
the two leaders spent an additional 20 minutes alone, said Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Sufficiently good and constructive'' was the way Rubin described the
meetings held by Clinton and Albright. Rubin said, however, U.S. officials were
not putting ``a lot of energy'' into getting the committees back together yet.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's intervention Thursday was his third of the week. On his arrival,
Clinton conferred with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on her own
90-minute meeting with al-Sharaa.
</P>
<P>
	   The president, wearing a leather flight jacket, waved to bystanders as he
alighted from his helicopter and made no statement. Marking the end of Ramadan,
Islam's holiest month, the White House issued a presidential message with a
prayer for peace.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We pray that the new moon will bring a new era of peace between nations --
in the Middle East and all across the world -- so people can emerge from the
shadows of violence and make better lives for their children,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, Clinton's assistant for national security, Sandy Berger, told
reporters to ``not underestimate the degree of difficulty'' in the negotiations
being held near this oldest town in West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These are very difficult issues that divide the parties,'' Berger said.
``They've been at war three times since the 1940s. There are very strong views
on both sides.''
</P>
<P>
	   In contrast to discontent within the Syrian delegation, Barak and his
delegation appeared pleased that the negotiations were focused on peace terms
and security measures, such as installing an early-warning system at the border
and clearing it of troops.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak found time Wednesday to jog and do calisthenics at a gymnasium in the
hotel the two delegations are sharing behind police barricades.
</P>
<P>
	   An Israel source, insisting on anonymity, said the talks were likely to go
into a second week -- after a weekend break -- and that Barak planned to stay
on.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin said that Albright, meanwhile, had directed her assistants to prepare
a ``working document'' detailing negotiations held in 1996 as well as talks last
month in Washington and here this week.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That will enable us at the appropriate time to move forward,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked if Israel could be secure without retaining the Golan Heights, which
overlooks its northeastern towns that were targets of cross-border attacks
before 1967, Rubin said, ``Israel is going to have to make that decision.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We believe that Israel has legitimate security needs and we believe those
needs can be met,'' he added.

<HEADLINE> Norway Train Crash Prompts Boycott  </HEADLINE>
   By NILS MYKLBOST Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RENA, Norway (AP) -- Train engineers vowed to boycott a Norwegian rail line
until safety improves on Thursday, two days after passengers trains hit head-on
in a fiery crash that killed at least 17 people.
</P>
<P>
	   The confirmed death toll rose Thursday when searchers pulled five more
bodies from the scorched wreckage. But three more people were missing and
authorities said they expected the toll to hit at least 20.
</P>
<P>
	   The trains collided Tuesday about 110 miles north of Oslo. A raging fire
prevented rescuers from reaching some of the broken, twisted cars until hours
after the crash.
</P>
<P>
	   It was one of the worst train disasters in Norwegian history. The trains
were traveling at about 55 mph around a corner, and the engineers had no chance
to stop, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Railroad Engineer's Union said the Scandiavian country's 1,100
railroad engineers would boycott that line until safety measures were improved.
</P>
<P>
	   They also demanded that closed stations reopen and restore their staff
instead of relying solely on traffic controllers working from another site.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Station staff offer extra security because they call and ask the next
station whether the track is clear before a train can leave the station,'' Leiv
Helge Olsen, of the union, told newspapers.
</P>
<P>
	   The cause of the wreck was under investigation. But it appears so far that
one of the trains might have run a red stop signal, since no technical faults
had been found on the line.
</P>
<P>
	   The TV-2 television network reported that the train managers monitoring
traffic remotely may not have been able to warn the engineers because of a
mix-up over cellular telephone numbers.
</P>
<P>
	   The trains burned for about six hours, making the rescue effort a nightmare
of intense heat amid the bitter cold of Norwegian winter. Some victims burned
alive, just out of reach of rescuers.
</P>
<P>
	   Though the weather improved Thursday, with temperatures rising above
freezing, work was still difficult because bodies had to be cut from the twisted
hulk of melted metal.
</P>
<P>
	   Rescuer Trond Simarud said a major worry was a 100-ton locomotive that was
overturned and feared highly unstable. It was being held in place by a military
tank, a backhoe and wire. The teams hoped to lift the engine out with the crane,
but it was not clear when that job would begin.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the 30 passengers and crew known to have been injured, only three
remained hospitalized late Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Colleges Get Racist Letter Threats  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (AP) -- Predominately black colleges in Alabama and
Tennessee have received letters threatening the ``total destruction of your
race'' and bearing the image of the Confederate flag.
</P>
<P>
	   Letters postmarked Fayetteville, N.C., were sent to Oakwood College in
Huntsville, Alabama A&AMP;M University in Huntsville, Alabama State University in
Montgomery, and Stillman College in Tuscaloosa. They were also received by Fisk
University and Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was terribly distasteful and a racist type of letter,'' said Alabama
State spokeswoman Julie Debardelaben.
</P>
<P>
	   The anonymous messages said, ``Eventually, we'll get rid of you. The year
2000, the war escalates. ... We promise.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The total destruction of your race is our mission in life,'' they said.
</P>
<P>
	   The letters were sent in late December, but some were not received until
this week because of the holidays.
</P>
<P>
	   Security has been tightened at the two Tennessee schools, but not at the
Alabama schools, and police have alerted the FBI. FBI officials would not
comment on whether they were investigating the matter.

<HEADLINE> Missing Girl's Body Believed Found  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SILVER SPRING, Md. (AP) -- Police acting on a tip uncovered remains Thursday
believed to be that of a 6-year-old girl who vanished more than 13 years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The remains were found buried in park about five miles from the home of
Michelle Dorr, who over the years has been the subject of searches as far away
as Massachusetts and Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
	   Montgomery County Police Chief Charles Moose told reporters at the scene
that investigators had ``a lot of strong indicators'' they had found Michelle's
remains.
</P>
<P>
	   The clothing the girl was believed to have been wearing when she disappeared
was recovered from the site in North Paint Branch Stream Valley Park, Moose
said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is a situation that for us brings some closure,'' said Moose, adding
that the girl's family had been notified.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, police said they were led to the scene by confidential information,
but would not confirm whether Hadden Clark, 47, who was convicted in October of
killing the girl, tipped police.
</P>
<P>
	   Police spokesman Lt. Mike Garvey said police dogs searched a one-mile area
for two days and gave officers an ``alert'' at a site, where police began
digging Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The remains were buried no more than 18 inches deep on a ridge.
</P>
<P>
	   The medical examiner's office will remove the remains and they will be taken
to Baltimore for positive identification based on dental records. The medical
examiner's office will also attempt to determine a cause of death, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Michelle was last seen playing in the backyard of her father's home in the
Washington suburb of Silver Spring on May 31, 1986.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors said the girl went to the home of a playmate, a niece of Clark's
who lived near her, but the only one at the home at the time was Clark.
Prosecutors said Clark stabbed her to death, cleaned up as much of the blood as
he could and then disposed of her body.
</P>
<P>
	   Clark was sentenced to 30 years in prison for Michelle's death. He will not
begin serving that sentence until he completes two other sentences, totaling 40
years, for a theft charge and for the 1992 murder of Laura Houghteling, 23.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Bomber's Parents Arrested  </HEADLINE>
   By DILIP GANGULY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- The parents and sister of a suicide bomber who
killed 13 people were among more than 700 Tamils detained in a two-day roundup
by Sri Lankan police, officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   All were arrested in the capital, Colombo, and will be questioned about
their possible involvement in Wednesday's bombing outside the prime minister's
office, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   The sweep began Thursday, with 200 people arrested, and continued Friday
with 500 more detentions.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities also planned to question the suspects, almost all from the
island's Tamil minority, about possible links with the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam, a separatist group blamed for engineering three suicide attacks in
the past three weeks. The three attacks killed 50 people.
</P>
<P>
	   About 4,500 armed policemen fanned out across Colombo on Thursday and Friday
to look for rebels or their sympathizers, a top police official said on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   Citing national security concerns, police prohibited people from leaving or
entering Colombo, Dehiwalla or Mount Lavinia until Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   Colombo was similarly sealed off about two years ago to allow door-to-door
searches for Tamil guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
	   The streets of Colombo were empty Friday, as residents huddled at home in
front of televisions to see what was happening in the city.
</P>
<P>
	   Emergency rule allows the armed forces to search houses or detain anyone on
suspicion of involvement with the rebels. It has been in force for more than two
years across Sri Lanka, but Parliament must reapprove it every month.
</P>
<P>
	   Wednesday's suicide bomber, who died in the blast, was traced to a village
in eastern Batticaloa district, state-run Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corp. radio
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The bomber blew herself up as police tried to question her outside the
office of Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike, who was not in the building at
the time.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said the bomber was a member of the Black Tigers, the suicide squad
of the Tamil Tigers. The police arrested her parents and a sister, but did not
disclose the charges, the radio reported.
</P>
<P>
	   It wasn't clear whether the bomber wanted to attack the 82-year-old prime
minister, who works mostly from home because of poor health.
</P>
<P>
	   Three weeks ago, a woman bomber blew herself up at an election rally for
President Chandrika Kumaratunga -- who is the prime minister's daughter.
Kumaratunga suffered a serious eye injury.
</P>
<P>
	   The guerrillas have been fighting security forces for 17 years to carve a
homeland in Eelam, where they say Sri Lanka's 3.2 million minority Tamils will
not be discriminated against by the majority Sinhalese.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sinhalese comprise 14 million of the country's 18.6 million people.

<HEADLINE> Two Officers Shot at Detroit House  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- A man suspected of shooting three police officers and killing
a man at a house early Thursday was arrested trying to sneak out after a
45-minute standoff, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   One man was found dead inside the house and another was injured.
</P>
<P>
	   Two officers responding to the scene were shot in the face, and a third,
wearing a bulletproof vest, was shot in the chest.
</P>
<P>
	   Police had approached the house because there were children inside, said
Officer Claude Fox. When they heard yelling and screaming, the three retreated
to retrieve shotguns, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They were getting their shotguns out of the trunk of their car when the
suspect came from the house and opened fire, Fox said.
</P>
<P>
	   Police Chief Benny Napoleon said he didn't know why the gunman began firing.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the officers were conscious when they were taken from the scene. A
male officer who sustained shotgun wounds in the face was treated and released.
A female officer, also shot in the face, was in good condition, said hospital
spokeswoman Meredith Meyer. The third officer was treated and released.
</P>
<P>
	   The injured man found at the home, Robert Martin, 50, was in fair condition
after surgery, Ms. Meyer said. He had gunshot wounds to the chest and stomach,
Fox said.
</P>
<P>
	   Napoleon said the man believed to be the shooter was captured early Thursday
as he tried to sneak out the back of the house, which was surrounded by police.
No charges had been filed by Thursday night.

<HEADLINE> Panic Spreads Through Ivory Coast  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -- Rumors of gunfire spread panic through Ivory
Coast's commercial capital Thursday, less than two weeks after a former army
chief seized power in a largely bloodless coup.
</P>
<P>
	   Stores closed down, and residents fled the central business district as
rumors spread of gunshots in several in other areas. By late afternoon, however,
calm had been restored.
</P>
<P>
	   Western diplomats and military officials confirmed there were gunshots
Wednesday night at one of the main military bases.
</P>
<P>
	   It was unclear, though, what had provoked the shooting, or if there was more
gunfire Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Junta leader Gen. Robert Guei visited a number of bases Thursday to reassure
troops he was committed to addressing their grievances over pay and benefits.
Later, he issued a statement on national radio denying there was any unrest in
the country.
</P>
<P>
	   The military seized power Christmas Eve amid an economic decline in West
African country, which has been one of region's most stable and prosperous
countries.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, Guei named himself president and defense minister in an interim
coalition Cabinet, which will govern until democracy is restored.

<HEADLINE> Missing Girl's Body Believed Found  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SILVER SPRING, Md. (AP) -- Police acting on a tip Thursday uncovered remains
believed to be that of a 6-year-old girl who vanished more than 13 years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The remains were found buried in park about five miles from the home of
Michele Dorr, who over the years has been the subject of searches as far away as
Massachusetts and Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
	   Montgomery County Police Chief Charles Moose told reporters at the scene
that investigators had ``a lot of strong indicators'' they had found Michele's
remains.
</P>
<P>
	   The clothing the girl was believed to have been wearing when she disappeared
was recovered from the site in North Paint Branch Stream Valley Park, Moose
said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is a situation that for us brings some closure,'' said Moose, adding
that the girl's family had been notified.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, police said they were led to the scene by confidential information,
but would not confirm whether Hadden Clark, 47, who was convicted in October of
killing the girl, tipped police.
</P>
<P>
	   Police spokesman Lt. Mike Garvey said police dogs searched a one-mile area
for two days and gave officers an ``alert'' at a site, where police began
digging Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The remains were buried no more than 18 inches deep on a ridge.
</P>
<P>
	   The medical examiner's office will remove the remains and they will be taken
to Baltimore for positive identification based on dental records. The medical
examiner's office will also attempt to determine a cause of death, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Michele was last seen playing in the backyard of her father's home in the
Washington suburb of Silver Spring on May 31, 1986.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors said the girl went to the home of a playmate, a niece of Clark's
who lived near her, but the only one at the home at the time was Clark.
Prosecutors said Clark stabbed her to death, cleaned up as much of the blood as
he could and then disposed of her body.
</P>
<P>
	   Clark was sentenced to 30 years in prison for Michele's death. He will not
begin serving that sentence until he completes two other sentences, totaling 40
years, for a theft charge and for the 1992 murder of Laura Houghteling, 23.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Abortions Continue To Decline  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- The number of abortions in the United States fell in 1997 to
the lowest level in two decades, despite new drugs that make it easier to
terminate a pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
	   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Thursday that 20 of
every 1,000 women of reproductive age (15 to 44) had abortions in 1997, the same
rate as the previous two years and the lowest since 1975.
</P>
<P>
	   The number of abortions for every 1,000 live births dropped from 314 in 1996
to 305 in 1997 -- also the lowest since 1975, the CDC said.
</P>
<P>
	   The preliminary estimate of 1,184,758 legal abortions in 1997 was 3 percent
less than the 1,221,585 abortions in 1996 and was the lowest number performed
since 1978.
</P>
<P>
	   The CDC cited several factors for the decline, including reduced access to
abortion, an increased willingness to use contraception and possibly different
attitudes about the moral implications of abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   For the first time, the annual CDC report included a breakdown from some
states showing the number of abortions performed through surgery and the number
via drugs. Previously, states had reported only the total number of abortions.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1997, 16 states reported 2,988 abortions induced by drugs. The Alan
Guttmacher Institute, an abortion rights research organization, estimated there
were 4,300 drug-induced abortions in all of the United States during the first
half of 1997 alone.
</P>
<P>
	   The drug most commonly used in the United States to induce abortion is
methotrexate. Methotrexate is used to treat certain types of gastrointestinal
disorders and cancers, but doctors have been allowed to prescribe it to induce
abortion since the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
	   Another drug, mifepristone, is designed specifically to end pregnancy and is
expected to win approval from the Food and Drug Administration this year. It is
available only through clinical trials. A similar drug used in Europe, RU-486,
remains ensnared in political battles in this country.
</P>
<P>
	   The medications are touted as a way to make the procedure more private and
convenient, without the need for surgery. Women take the medications under a
doctor's supervision during the first 49 days of pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
	   Those on both sides of the debate said the medications are unlikely to
affect the overall numbers of abortions but might shift the method away from
surgery.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think it will have any effect whatsoever on rates of abortion or
rates of unintended pregnancy,'' said Gloria Feldt, president of Planned
Parenthood Federation of America.
</P>
<P>
	   April Thompson, a spokeswoman for the National Right to Life Committee,
said: ``It's just another method of taking the life of an unborn child. It will
not change the debate and it will not change the number of abortions.''
</P>
<P>
	   The CDC said that 52 percent of the women who received an abortion in 1997
were 24 or younger. Most of the women were white and unmarried. Fifty-five
percent of the procedures were done in the first two months of pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
	   Final 1997 figures -- the most recent year for which such numbers are
available -- including the numbers of abortions in each state, will be released
in the summer.

<P>
    CHAMPAIGN, Ill (AP) -- Freshman Frank Williams hit a 3-pointer at the buzzer
Thursday night and No. 19 Illinois survived a frantic comeback by No. 13 Ohio
State, beating the Buckeyes 80-77 in the Big Ten opener for both schools.
</P>
<P>
	   Ohio State, trailing most of the game and down 10 points in the second half,
tied the game with five seconds left on a tip-in by Ken Johnson.
</P>
<P>
	   Williams took the inbounds pass, drove to the middle and put up his
3-pointer from above the key. It swished through just as the buzzer sounded,
setting off a wild celebration at midcourt.
</P>
<P>
	   Illinois (9-3) got 20 points from Cory Bradford, 17 from Cleotis Brown and
13 from Williams.
</P>
<P>
	   George Reese scored a career-high 24 points, including 18 in the second
half, for Ohio State (8-3), while Scoonie Penn had 16 and Michael Redd 15.
</P>
<P>
	   The Buckeyes were hurt by 12 missed free throws in their second loss this
season on a shot at the buzzer. That is how they lost to Notre Dame in the
season opener.
</P>
<P>
	   Reese tipped in a missed free throw by Johnson to bring the Buckeyes within
77-75 with 1:23 left.
</P>
<P>
	   Illinois missed a shot and Ohio State rebounded, but the Buckeyes lost
possession with 50 seconds remaining. Marcus Griffin then fumbled Bradford's
pass under the basket with 22 seconds to go and Ohio State had a final chance.
</P>
<P>
	   The Buckeyes took a timeout with 19 seconds left and Johnson tipped in
Reese's miss for the final tie.
</P>
<P>
	   The Buckeyes were able to stay in the game behind the second half play of
Reese. Redd's dunk, his 3-pointer from the baseline and a follow shot by Brian
Brown cut the Illini lead to two with 8:05 left.
</P>
<P>
	   But Bradford connected on his fourth 3-pointer to make it 66-61, made a
cross-court pass to Brown for another 3-pointer and then hit two free throws and
the lead was back to 10 with 6:44 to go.
</P>
<P>
	   Reese then scored seven straight points and Ohio State's final run cut it to
74-70 with 3:18 left.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradford's third 3-pointer of the first half and five straight points from
Brown helped the Illini build a 12-point lead. Ohio State cut it to 42-35 at
halftime when Reese hit one basket and then seconds later got free for a dunk
just before the buzzer.

<HEADLINE> Amtrak Train Derails in Montana  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ESSEX, Mont. (AP) -- A locomotive and four cars of a Seattle-to-Chicago
Amtrak train derailed Thursday as the train prepared to stop at this
northwestern Montana settlement. No one was injured.
</P>
<P>
	   About 200 passengers remained aboard the idle train hours after the
derailment, but were later taken to a local inn. The train, which derailed at
9:05 a.m., was still stationary 12 hours later.
</P>
<P>
	   Amtrak spokesman Kevin Johnson described the derailment of the Empire
Builder train as minor.
</P>
<P>
	   There had been plans to transport the passengers aboard cars that remained
on the tracks, but that plan was delayed because of the time necessary for
Burlington Northern Santa Fe to investigate the derailment, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``BNSF is investigating it and they won't let us go until they're done,'' he
said. ``If it goes on much longer, we may have to make alternate transportation
plans for our riders. But that call hasn't been made yet.''
</P>
<P>
	   The derailed cars included the diner, a baggage car, a crew sleeper and a
passenger sleeper, Johnson said. The train consisted of three locomotives and 11
cars.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Higher  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- The Tokyo stock market's main index posted a slight rise
Friday morning after opening the session lower. The dollar moved higher against
the yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 26.82 points, or 0.15
percent, to 18,195.09 at the end of the morning session. On Thursday, the
average closed down 374.28 points, or 2.02 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar bought 105.41 yen at late morning, up 1.03 yen from late Thursday
in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 105.40 yen.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stock market, prices opened lower as selling of Japanese technology
stocks continued early Friday following another decline in the Nasdaq Composite
Index on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Nikkei moved into positive territory toward the morning close on
buying of major auto issues, banks and some electronics stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   The rise Friday morning came after two sessions of sharp declines in the
Nikkei. On top of Thursday's fall, the index fell 460.31 points Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   But Japan's top government spokesman, Mikio Aoki, said Friday that the
recent slide in share prices was not that big a concern. Speaking at a regular
news conference, Aoki said the declines were "not having a large effect on the
economy."
</P>
<P>
	   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 130.61 points, or 1.2
percent, to 11,253.26 at Thursday's close. But the Nasdaq, dominated by
technology stocks, fell 150.31, or 3.9 percent, to 3,727.23.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was down 9.79 points, or 0.61 percent, to 1,599.80. The TOPIX closed
down 42.25 points, or 2.56 percent, the day before.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency dealings, the dollar held on to much of its strength in early
Asian trading Friday after hitting a seven-week high against the yen in overseas
markets.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. currency's strength on Thursday came from cross-trading among
European and Asian currencies, traders said.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts say the yen's decline was exacerbated as hedge fund managers
shifted some of their currency holdings from yen to euros and investors
continued to cover dollar-yen and euro-yen short, or oversold, positions.
</P>
<P>
	   Also supporting the dollar was a potential drop in Japanese high-technology
stocks on the back of the Nasdaq's sharp decline, traders said.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the yen's weakness, Japan's vice finance minister for international
affairs, Haruhiko Kuroda, said Friday that the currency is still overvalued.
</P>
<P>
	   "The yen is still too strong," Kuroda said. But he added: "I think the
correction to the excessively strong yen has started."
</P>
<P>
	   The strong yen hurts Japanese exporting companies by reducing the value of
dollar earnings they bring back to Japan from overseas.
</P>
<P>
	   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 108.62 yen, up from 107.88 yen
late Thursday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond was unquoted at
late morning. On Thursday, it settled at 1.6800 percent and its price stood at
101.87.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Presses for Boy's Repatriation  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Cuba encouraged its citizens Thursday to continue protesting
for a 6-year-old boy's repatriation, warning that exiles in Miami could try to
block the U.S. government's decision to reunite the child with his father on the
island.
</P>
<P>
	   With President Fidel Castro in attendance, media workers rallied Thursday at
Havana's Palace of Conventions to demand Elian Gonzalez's return to Cuba. For
weeks the communist government has held such rallies almost daily.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The case of Elian is for today's youth what 40 years of the blockade,
armed invasions, sabotage and attempts to kill President Fidel Castro were for
earlier generations,'' said Cuban journalist Luis Baez, who has written several
books about Cuban emigration to the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   In an unusual move after the rally, state television showed images of Cuban
exiles in Miami protesting the U.S. decision to return Elian to the communist
island. The footage showed exiles with signs demanding ``Freedom for Elian'' --
the same battle cry regularly chanted during rallies on this side of the Florida
Straits.
</P>
<P>
	   With a voiceover that called the exiles ``criminals'' and ``mafia members,''
the unusual airing of anti-Castro protests in Miami appeared aimed at showing
citizens the broad opposition to the decision among South Florida exiles.
</P>
<P>
	   Saying ``nothing is certain'' about Elian's return, the government exhorted
citizens to keep rallying, after the boy's relatives in Miami said they would
look for ways to get around Wednesday's ruling by the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service to repatriate the child by Jan. 14.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuban exiles in Miami will now ``proceed with all their resources to impede
or delay'' the ruling, Cuba predicted Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We cannot stop mobilizing! The struggle must not stop for one minute!''
said a message that was read Wednesday night to several thousand rallying Cuban
scientists.
</P>
<P>
	   Rescued on Nov. 25 by fishermen off the Florida coast, Elian has become the
subject of an international custody battle.
</P>
<P>
	   His mother died in a boating accident trying to get Elian and herself to the
United States. The boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, lives in Cuba and wants
Elian back.
</P>
<P>
	   But Elian's relatives in Miami have fought to keep the boy, saying they
could provide him with a better life. Since the INS decision was announced
Wednesday, they have said they will appeal the decision.
</P>
<P>
	   Gonzalez has not appeared publicly since the announcement. Neither he nor
Elian's four grandparents could be located in their hometown of Cardenas, east
of Havana.

Protests Continue Over Cuban Boy
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- Hundreds of Cuban-Americans chanting "Liberty! Liberty!"
blocked intersections and cut off access to the Port of Miami on Thursday to
protest the U.S. government's decision to return 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez to
his father in Cuba. Police arrested about 100 people, including two prominent
Cuban exile leaders, for refusing to disperse. Roaming groups of protesters
disrupted traffic on major streets during evening rush hour, angering drivers
trying to escape the gridlock. The situation was expected to continue Friday.
Brothers to the Rescue, a Miami-based exile group that searches the waters off
Florida for Cubans trying to make it to the United States, called for supporters
to drive 15 mph Friday throughout Miami-Dade County.

Bush Pledges Tax Cuts If Elected

	   DURHAM, N.H. (AP) -- An aggressive George W. Bush pledged in campaign debate
Thursday night to push for "tax cuts, so help me God" if elected to the White
House and accused presidential rival John McCain of seeking campaign finance
changes that would hurt the conservative cause. McCain used the forum to
strongly defend his actions on behalf of a political donor who was seeking
action from the Federal Communications Commission. The tax cut pledge uttered by
Bush, the national GOP front-runner, was all-but-unequivocal: "If there's a
recession it's important to cut taxes to make sure the economy grows. ... It's
also important to cut the taxes where there's times of plenty. ... It's
important to cut the taxes to make sure Washington, D.C., does not spend the
surplus."

Heights, a strategic border territory Israel has held for more than three
decades, for diplomatic and economic relations with Syria. Clinton met
separately for an hour each with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian
Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa.
