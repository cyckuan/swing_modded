<HEADLINE>   Willis Wants NBA Vote in Secret </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Kevin Willis, Toronto
Raptors forward, wants his NBA peers to be their own men and make
up their own minds on ending the lockout.
</P>
<P>
To that end, Willis defied union leadership Tuesday and called
for players to vote by secret ballot on the owners' latest offer
in hopes of salvaging the season.
</P>
<P>
"The majority would vote for the owners' latest proposal, jut
to start playing ball again," Willis said, referring to the deal
presented last week by NBA Commissioner David Stern.
</P>
<P>
While Willis and his agent, Steve Woods, see secret balloting
as a way of ending the lockout, union spokesman Dan Wasserman
disagreed, saying players still were willing to await the
negotiating committee's recommendation.
</P>
<P>
The union held a confereence call Monday with about 125
players,who voiced support for the players' association and chief
Billy Hunter.
</P>
<P>
Agent Jerome Stanley also criticized Woods, who has had a
chilly relatonship with the union.
</P>
<P>
"Tell him to get a life," Stanley said. "Don't harm the body
of players in an attempt to enhance yourself."

<HEADLINE> Chief Executive Promises More Help for Sports in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive Tung Chee
Hwa of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) promised
here on Wednesday that the SAR government would provide more
backing to sports development in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive made the promise at a celebration
reception held Wednesday evening by the Amateur Sports Federation
and Olympic Committee (ASF&AMP;OC) of Hong Kong, China, for the Hong
Kong SAR delegation at the 13th Asian Games, which closed on
Sunday in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
Competing in the Asian Games in the name of "Hong Kong, China"
for the first time after Hong Kong's handover, Hong Kong SAR
athletes won five gold, six silver and six bronze medals, the
best ever achievement by Hong Kong at any of the regional Games.
</P>
<P>
Tung recalled that the Hong Kong SAR government had attached
importance to its sports policy, which is to ensure that all
promising athletes are given proper funding to fully develop
their talents. "I fully support sports development and will make
sure that resources are allocated to meet various needs and
facilities are provided to promote sports development," he said.
</P>
<P>
The HKSAR government has increased the subsidies for sports
development from 78 million HK dollars (10 million U.S. dollars)
in 1996/97, to 200 million HK dollars (25.6 million U.S. dollars)
this year, of which 60 million HK dollars (7.7 million U.S.
dollars) was earmarked for elite training, according to Tung.
</P>
<P>
Provisions had been made for the athletes preparing for the
1998 Asian Games and additional subsidies had also been given to
physically handicapped athletes.
</P>
<P>
But Tung admitted that the government could still do better.
Upon her return from Bangkok days ago, Olympic and Asian Games
champion windsurfer Lee Lai-shan talked about the second career
of athletes as well as their opportunities of further studies
after they retire. That "really inspired strong feelings in me,"
Tung said.
</P>
<P>
And he agreed to the idea of professionalization of sports,
raised by ASF&AMP;OC President Timothy Fok at the reception. "This is
also a good direction we should look into," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
Tung expressed his belief that the success achieved in Bangkok
would urge the government and the entire community to play a more
active role in promoting sports development.
</P>
<P>
"Here I make a pledge to all athletes of Hong Kong that we
will definitely attach great importance to your concerns," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Grand Celebrations in HK for Success at Asiad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Grand celebrations were
staged here Wednesday evening for the historic victories of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) delegation at the
13th Asian Games and Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa called on Hong
Kong residents to take a more active approach toward sports.
</P>
<P>
The celebrations included a cocktail reception at the Hong
Kong Cultural Center by the Amateur Sports Federation and Olympic
Committee (ASF&AMP;OC) of Hong Kong, China, for the delegation, a
five double-deckers float parade in Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon, to
pay tribute to the athletes and a variety show in the Urban
Council Centenary Garden, Tsim Sha Tsui East.
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive Tung praised the medal winners from the SAR
for their efforts, which made Hong Kong people see with pride the
Hong Kong SAR flag raised at the games in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
All Hong Kong delegates had earned the acclaim of the entire
community by their efforts to reach for a higher goal at the
games and to challenge themselves as well as the Asian and world
records with their fighting spirit in the competitions, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive paid tribute to ASF&AMP;OC for "its unsparing
efforts and tremendous contribution made toward the promotion of
the sports development of Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
Participating in the Asian Games in the name of "Hong Kong,
China" for the first time, SAR athletes won five gold, six silver
and six bronze medals, which represented the best ever
achievement by any Hong Kong delegation at the regional games.
With the historic breakthrough, Hong Kong SAR athletes had not
only established their status in the international sports arena
but have also greatly helped promote sports development in the
SAR, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
Tung also praised the athletes for their pain and sweat in
making all this possible. "The regional flag rising to our
national anthem at the games is a symbol of recognition of your
hard work and to all of us in Hong Kong, that is a great honor
too," he continued.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive called on Hong Kong residents to learn
from the athletes and take a more active part in sports
activities.
</P>
<P>
Sports development and sports competition are growing forces
that unite people and draw them closer to one another, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped that athletes would keep moving ahead for
greater achievements for Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
When speaking at the variety show Wednesday evening,
Administrative Secretary Anson Chan said that, by making
painstaking efforts to challenge themselves and heights at the
Bangkok games, Hong Kong SAR athletes displayed the same working
style of aiming high and braving difficulties of the Hong Kong
people.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of local residents greeted the Asian Games delegates
along the routes of the parade and at the variety show Wednesday
evening.

<HEADLINE> Ivanov Vows to Solve Problems With Azerbaijan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov said Wednesday that unsolved problems exist in relations
with Azerbaijan, and that "some of them are serious."
</P>
<P>
He said that Moscow will do its utmost "to resolve these
problems," Ivanov said after his talks with visiting Azeri Foreign
Minister Tofik Zulfagarov.
</P>
<P>
Zulfagarov, who arrived here Tuesday on a working visit, called
for "mutual understanding" in tackling such differences as in
determining the legal status of the Caspian Sea.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed concern over Russia's perceived expansion of
military and technical ties with Armenia.
</P>
<P>
Azerbaijan and Armenia have been at odds over Nagorno-Karabakh,
an enclave in Azerbaijan populated mainly by ethnic Azeris, who
declared independence in 1991. Subsequent violence and war claimed
about 15,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said the Russian-Armenian cooperation is based on
international law and "is not aimed against Azerbaijan."
</P>
<P>
Despite the differences, the two ministers agreed that their
positions "on a number of issues" had been brought closer during
the talks.
</P>
<P>
"Compromise is possible where our views differ," Zulfagarov
said.

WASHINGTON, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The spacecraft, known as
Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous, is sending data back to scientists
on Earth after a 27-hour blackout, but its mission to orbit the
asteroid will be postponed, said the Washington Post Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Currently scientists at the Johns Hopkins University are trying
to determine why and how they lost radio contact with the
spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
According to previous plan, the space probe will enter the
asteroid's orbit in Jan. 1999, now the orbiting mission will be
delayed until later next year or in early 2000.
</P>
<P>
U.S. scientists said that the spacecraft is expected to fly by
asteroid Eros shortly before 2 p.m. Wednesday, and take a series
of photographs from about 2480 miles away.
</P>
<P>
NEAR is one of the first NASA robot crafts and launched into
space in 1996. With the spacecraft's help, scientists want to
know the chemical structure, mass and density of the asteroid so
as to avoid any future possible asteroid heading with Earth.

<HEADLINE> Separatist Threat to Canada Never Go Away: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Canadians will have to deal
with the threat of Quebec's succession as long as Canada exists,
Prime Minister Jean Chretien warned.
</P>
<P>
In year-end TV interviews to be broadcast over the Christmas
season, Chretien dismissed suggestions that separatism is fading
because of last month election in Quebec, in which the separatist
Parti Quebecois (PQ) got fewer votes than last time.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Chretien said he does not expect to fight a third
referendum on separation "in the short term."
</P>
<P>
But "the problem is that there will always be some people who
will promote independence. It's been like that since the battle
on the Plains of Abraham."
</P>
<P>
"It will always be there," Chretien was quoted as saying by
the National Post newspaper Thursday.
</P>
<P>
On November's election in Quebec, the prime minister said that
he was happy at its results, though he said he would have
preferred a victory by the Liberal Party.
</P>
<P>
Quebecers voted in a "clever" manner by returning the PQ to
power without giving the separatist party the mandate to hold
another referendum on Quebec's future within Canada, Chretien
noted.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Though winning most medals at
the just-ended Bangkok Asian Games, regional sports giant China
said it has learned lessons from the tournaments which served as
the "mid-term exam" for the country's 2000 Sydney Olympics aim.
</P>
<P>
"Generally speaking, it was a satisfaction for our results in
Bangkok and our athletes could scored 80 from a possible 100
marks," said Yuang Weiming, cheif-de-mission of the Chinese
delegation for the 15-day Asian Games, at a delegation's
summing-up meeting on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
China won 129 gold medals during the regional Olympic-style
meets, compared with South Korea's 65 and Japan's 52.
</P>
<P>
"However, in terms of every sporting event, there were
different stories," Yuang said. "In our victories at the Games,
only 31 events reach at the world first three standards, in which
mainly focused on table tennis, badminton, gymnastics, diving,
shooting, weightlifting and several events from swimming,
athletics and women's judo."
</P>
<P>
China captured less gold medals in track and field as well as
swimming than last Games in Hiroshima, Japan. Yuang noticed and
said: "We had only a few of stars in these fields. And although
our rowers, fencers and cyclists won a plenty of golds, there was
still nothing to break as to Olympic stardards."
</P>
<P>
There were 35 gold medals offered in wresting, boxing and
men's judo at the Asian Games but China took nothing home in them.
</P>
<P>
"All those are Olympic sports but we are still in the backward
situation even in Asia. It's our shame," Yuang added.
</P>
<P>
The summing-up meeting also marks a beginning of China's
preparation for the 2000 Olympic Games. Wu Shaozu, President of
the Chinese Olympic Committee (COC), gave a mobilization talk to
the athletes, most of them to be surely the participants in the
Olympics. Enditme

<HEADLINE> Zhu Rongji Urges Hainan to Greater Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji has
urged officials in China's southernmost island province of Hainan
to make greater efforts in the reform and opening-up drive.
</P>
<P>
On a tour of the tropical island, Zhu emphasised that there was
huge potential if the provincial government took advantage of the
guidelines laid down for building a special economic zone.
</P>
<P>
Referring to agricultural and tourism development, he stressed
that as Hainan is abundant with fine, natural resources which can
boost agriculture, it is very important for them stimulate the
local economy by taking advantage of those resources.
</P>
<P>
And its unique tropical landscape is a boon for the tourist
industry, with both sectors useful for attracting and developing
high-tech industries, the premier added.
</P>
<P>
He said that Hainan must make full use of the preferential
policies offered by the central government, and that the
authorities in the Yangpu Economic Development Zone should improve
the investment environment, thus providing better services to
overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
During his four-day tour, which ended on December 22, Zhu
inspected production centers for winter vegetables, tropical
fruits, and marine products in the cities of Sanya and
Haikou as well as visiting the Yangpu Economic Development Zone.
</P>
<P>
He also inspected a number of state-owned enterprises, sewage
treatment works in Haikou and a railway project linking Hainan and
its adjacent Guangdong province. He spoke highly of Hainan's
achievements in economic and social progress.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about further expansion of Hainan, Zhu said past
experiences should remind the local government of the importance
of avoiding the 'bubble' economy and carry out construction
sensibly in relation to economic growth.
</P>
<P>
As an example he cited the real estate fever which occurred in
Hainan and other places in the country some years ago and pointed
to the huge financial losses because of a lack of planning,.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that the Hainan provincial government must make an
overall plan scientifically, taking into account the need for
infrastructure construction including roads, railways and
communications.
</P>
<P>
Zhu also asked the local government to take effective measures
to handle the aftermath of the real estate collapse, and urged
them to construct no more residential and office buildings before
the existing vacant ones are sold.
</P>
<P>
And he warned that banks will not be allowed to provide loans
for new construction projects for commercial building unless those
criteria are met.

<HEADLINE> China Develops First IC-Card Chip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The first integrated circuit
that China developed for making telephone IC-card passed official
appraisal by the Ministry of Information Industry (MII) here today.
</P>
<P>
Developers told a press conference this evening that the
integrated circuit chip is priced at two-thirds of that of
imported counterparts.
</P>
<P>
China has produced more than 100 million IC-cards since it
first introduced IC-card telephone in 1995. All these cards were
made with chips from overseas, mainly from Germany and France.
</P>
<P>
MII forecasts that in 2000, Chinese people will buy more than
250 million IC-cards as 700,000 intelligent public telephones are
installed throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
IC-card uses an integrated circuit, or a computer chip, to
store the value of money. It is more reliable and secure than
magnetic telephone cards. China is to stop using the existing
60,000 magnetic card public telephones in three to four years.
</P>
<P>
The new IC-card chip was jointly developed by Datang Telecom
Technology Co., LTD and Qinghua University in Beijing. The chip
will be manufactured by Shanghai Advanced Semi-Conductor
Manufacturing Company, a joint venture with Philips of the
Netherlands and Nortel Networks of Canada.
</P>
<P>
The chip has already been tested in China Telecom's public
telephone networks in five locations in China and will be put into
mass production in February, 1999. Production capacity of the chip
will reach 450,000 to 500,000 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
MII official Zheng Minzheng hopes that the new chip will give
rise to a local IC-card industry in a few years.
</P>
<P>
China's integrated circuit market reached 6.5 billion yuan this
year, with 2.5 billion items of integrated circuit sold. Most of
them were from international companies.

<HEADLINE> Draft Securities Law Sparks Heated Debates (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Heated debates have taken place
between members of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress over the draft securities law aimed at keeping control over
the flotation and listing of companies.
</P>
<P>
Many law-makers described the revised draft which insists on
a check and approval system rather than a mere go-ahead as making
great progress in preventing abuses of the system.
</P>
<P>
It means that the China Securities Regulatory Commission will
be responsible for checking company documents and once these are
proved accurate and reliable, it can give permission for the
company to go public.
</P>
<P>
"The measure will help prevent the CSRC from abusing its power
while increasing transparency in stock issuing," said Jiang
Shushen, a Standing Committee member.
</P>
<P>
"The old practice of the CSRC having the overall right to
approval has given tangible benefits to certain people at the cost
of the investors' interests," he added.
</P>
<P>
The law-makers differed, however, on what a role the government
should play in the market place and to what extent it should
interfere.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zhenghua, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee, said,
"The government should leave many issues relating to securities
companies' internal management to be regulated and settled by
market forces in the long run. Therefore the present law need not
be so specific about these issues."
</P>
<P>
Yet another member, Huang Yuzhang, argued that as the stock
market is highly risky, relaxed government administration would
probably lead to chaos, or social unrest.
</P>
<P>
Standing Committee's vice-chairman Cheng Siwei and two
other members questioned a provision in the revised draft law
which suggests that issuing stock premiums should be approved by
the CSRC .
</P>
<P>
"Does the measure comply to the law of the market place? What
responsibility will the CSRC have if the approved premium is
found unreasonable?" they asked.

<HEADLINE> Draft Securities Law Sparks Heated Debates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many law-makers said that it is necessary for the law to have
some provisions to limit the power of government administrations in
charge of securities market management and supervision.
</P>
<P>
They suggested setting up a special committee to keep a check
on the CSRC.
</P>
<P>
Standing Committee member Yu Xinrong pointed out that the
draft law contains articles confirming the rights of a stock
market supervision body as well as one for the stock exchanges,
but no articles covering their obligations.
</P>
<P>
The draft law bans state-owned firms from getting involved in
stock trading. Some members said this provision does not treat
firms of different ownership as equals in market competition and
so it should be removed.
</P>
<P>
The draft should instead stipulate that state firms must not
use bank loans to carry out stock trading, said Chi Haibin who is
a former vice-minister finance.
</P>
<P>
To best protect investors, an association to look after their
interests should be established, suggested senior economist Li
Yining. "Investors can turn to the association for help if they
feel cheated by false financial reports provided by certain
companies. The association can also bring cases to the courts on
behalf of investors."
</P>
<P>
Many law-makers said the revised law should include harsher
punishments for irregularities or violations and the majority of
them called for it to have an early passage.

<P>
Even wedding registrations and staying in a hotel needed
letters of introduction and approval from the unit.
</P>
<P>
The differential household register system divided all the
social members into urban and rural inhabitants, enjoying
different welfare benefits. And urban people were also divided
into workers and cadres.
</P>
<P>
In recent two decades, many self-employed persons or those
working in family businesses belong to no organization or unit and
have released themselves from the unit system.
</P>
<P>
Farmers and self-employed persons now account for 54.1 percent
of the total 696 million working people in the country while unit
members make up only 15.9 percent, according to latest statistics.
</P>
<P>
Indeed the Chinese government endorsed a policy of encouraging
farmers to be engaged in business or factory work in towns and
cities and then further loosened the control on township household
registers. As a result, at least 60 million farmers flooded into
towns and cities to find jobs.
</P>
<P>
"Changes in the basic structure of daily life have, though,
brought about conflicts and friction with the old systematic
structure," said Li, pointing out that the old ways are losing
their hold and have been amended in many ways.
</P>
<P>
"The diversity and complexity of modern society have made it
impossible for a highly-centralized organizational administration
to cover every aspect of life," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the face of great changes taking place in the social
structure, policy-makers can no longer solely rely on information
from organizational channels but now need to analyze other sources
to help them.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Concerned over India-Russia Military Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan expressed "grave
concern and dismay" on Thursday over the decade-long agreement on
technical military cooperation signed by India and Russia this
week.
</P>
<P>
"We are gravely concerned and dismayed that at the turn of the
millennium, when promotion of peace and economic development are
the focus of endeavors in other regions, South Asia must bear the
burden of a massive new weapons program for the fulfillment of
India's hegemonistic goals," Foreign Office spokesman Tariq Altaf
said at a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
According to the press here, the agreement is wide ranging and
provides for massive purchases of arms by India while involving
the transfer of high technology and sophisticated weapons from
Russia worth 16 billion U.S. dollars over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
The Indian purchases would mean the acquisition of
sophisticated new weapon systems in the region such as airborne
early warning systems, new generation tanks, SU-30 aircraft and
nuclear powered submarines, Altaf said.
</P>
<P>
He added that "the acquisition of sophisticated weapons would
destroy the balance of power in an already precarious and highly
volatile security environment."
</P>
<P>
Altaf said that South Asia as a region cannot afford an arms
race and a further diversion of a huge amount of funds which will
consequently be spent in the purchase of latest weaponry.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan will also be forced to augment its defense
capabilities through all available means," he added.
</P>
<P>
Altaf said, "The Indian focus on further accumulation of
military power will reinforce its intransigence toward the
resolution of disputes and the reduction of tensions in our
region."
</P>
<P>
These developments would provide a negative impact on
Pakistan's efforts to promote restraint regime in a nuclear South
Asia, he said, adding that the bilateral dialogue process between
Pakistan and India will be immeasurably affected.
</P>
<P>
The Spokesman called upon the international community,
particularly the major powers and the U.N., to take note of this
dangerous development which threatens the peace and security of
the region.
</P>
<P>
"Consequently, at a larger level, this constitutes a challenge
to global security and peace," he added.

GUANGZHOU, December 24 (Xinhua) -- An exhibition on the 20
years of opening-up in Guangzhou, capital of south China's
Guangdong Province, opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Figures from the exhibition showed that from 1978 to 1997, the

funds, with an yearly rise of 37.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
From January to November this year, the city had used a total

southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou's export volume of this year may reach 8 billion
U.S. dollars, up 6.5 percent than last year.
</P>
<P>
At present the number of overseas-funded enterprises in

<HEADLINE> Top Chinese Scientist Calls for Caution on Information Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- One of China's top scientists
has warned that the information industry will not be the world's
panacea as many predict and that agriculture and basic production
skills are still the essential foundations for the society.
</P>
<P>
Song Jian, president of the Chinese Academy of Engineering
(CAE) made his remarks in an article in a recent issue of the
China Science News where he warned that over emphasising
the importance of the so-called information industry could lead
developing countries to disaster.
</P>
<P>
"It is a somewhat deceitful perception that the next century
will be a society totally focussed on the information industry,"
Song added.
</P>
<P>
"But while I don't deny the important role it will play in the
next century's economic development, I believe that the production
of material goods, food and daily necessities will forever be the
foundation of human existence and development," he wrote.
</P>
<P>
Song was the Minister of China's former State Commission of
Science and Technology (now the Ministry of Science and
Technology) before he was elected president of the CAE earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
Song's views are readily accepted by some senior Chinese
scientists and Zhang Guangdou, an academician with the Chinese
Academy of Sciences, said that the article was very accurate and
timely.

<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
said on Thursday that he will guarantee protection for the mass
media as a fourth power of the law enforcement bodies.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting in the Kremlin with the heads of the
country's three major television channels, Yeltsin called for "a
mutually acceptable form of cooperation" and "a new
understanding," the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
This form should include "guarantees for you on many issues,
including financial ones," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no censorship, no blackmail and, God forbid,
no persecution for criticism" of the state, Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
"The Constitution firmly and precisely stipulates freedom of
speech and press, and as the guarantor of the constitution, I
must ensure it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Oleg Dobrodeyev, director General of the NTV Independent
Television company, attended the Kremlin meeting. He said Yeltsin
was in better shape than he was two years ago.
</P>
<P>
"Those who have dropped Yeltsin's name from political lists
have jumped the gun," Dobrodeyev said.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Yeltsin also talked about parliamentary
elections next year.
</P>
<P>
He said the elections were expected to be "quite tranquil"
and to advance an informal leader, "which may tell the outcome of
the presidential elections (in 2000)."

Healthy development of a country's financial system is vital to
a country's economic security, she said, adding that though the
financial order and the quality of credit are good in the area, we

<HEADLINE> Hopeful Opposition Party Emerges in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 24 (Xinhua) -- A new opposition party, the
United Party for National Development (UPND), has emerged on the
Zambian political arena and it offers a charming future to the
Zambian people.
</P>
<P>
Officially launching the UPND here Thursday, the party's
interim president Anderson Mazoka said his party has come into
being against the background that there is no effective
opposition to the ruling Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD)
and that no party can offer viable political, economic and social
alternatives to those of the MMD.
</P>
<P>
He told hundreds of jubilant party cadres that the UPND is
determined to take power in the country's next presidential
elections to be held in 2001.
</P>
<P>
Mazoka, out-going chief executive for east and central Africa
of Anglo-American Corporation, a trans-national company, lashed
out at the ruling MMD government for its serious deficiency in
leadership skills, poor governance and mismanagement of the
country's economic affairs.
</P>
<P>
The presidential aspirant offered a "bright" future for the
Zambian people by listing his party's main principles concerning
the areas of agriculture, social welfare, health and poverty
reducing.
</P>
<P>
Mazoka, a newly-emerging political star, said that when
forming the next government, his party will give agriculture
first priority, in which lies the future of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
"We realize that the future of our country and its prosperity
will only be possible if we reorganize, invest and support the
agricultural sector," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Mazoka also promised that his party will institute poverty
alleviation measures that will improve incomes, create assets and
improve social welfare of the people in both urban and rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
He said the UPND aims to reduce poverty to below 20 percent of
the population instead of the proposed 50 percent that the MMD
has undertaken to the donor community in the next few years in
the country where over 70 percent are living in poverty.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Mazoka also announced the formation of the
UPND's executive organization, the Interim National Management
Committee (NMC).
</P>
<P>
A prominent Zambian lawyer, John Mwila, became one of the
party's two vice-presidents and Standwell Mapara is the national
chairman.
</P>
<P>
According to UPND press officer, Sialumba Caesar, the new
opposition party is attracting several hundred new members and
more every day since it came into being last month.

<HEADLINE> Chinese People Shaking Off Restrictions on Free Movement (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) - China's old systematic social
order is fading away to be replaced with a new policy which suits
the general public interest, leading sociologist Li Peilin has said.
</P>
<P>
"The positive change affecting the social structure has further
strengthened the direction of social policy," added Li, a research
fellow of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences' Institute of
Sociology.
</P>
<P>
"The old, somewhat ailing system is now in conflict with new
efficiency led strategic objectives," he said.
</P>
<P>
China has used the unit system, differential household
registration system and administrative rank system since the
1950s, established to give priority to the deployment of defense
and heavy industry.
</P>
<P>
"But China is undergoing economic institutional transition and
social structural transformation," the senior expert said.
</P>
<P>
Although these two changes seem to be part of the same process,
with China's overall reform in the past two decades and its
economic reform program being the direct cause of the accelerated
transformation of the social structure, ultimately the latter
involves a more lasting and fundamental change compared to the
more transitory economic changes which are affected by market
forces, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Under the old planned economy, the Chinese government mobilized
all resources in order to catch up with other countries in terms
of the defense and heavy industries. It obtained the information it
needed to formulate social policy through strict organizational
channels. Therefore, the state placed every individual under
organizational administration and extended such methods of
administration, supervision and control into every corner of
society.
</P>
<P>
This meant that the Chinese people used to be extremely
dependent on their work units. A person's identity, social
position, treatment and prestige were closely related to the
attributes of the unit he belonged to.

BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- China's shipbuilding industry
is facing great challenges, as Japan and the Republic of Korea
(ROK), hit by the Asian financial crisis, have been lowering the
cost of vessels in a bid to win more market shares.
</P>
<P>
Japan and the ROK received 1.79 million tons, equivalent to
1.25 billion U.S. dollars, of orders from Chinese shipping
companies in the first nine months of this year alone, double
1997's figure.
</P>
<P>
The figures were released by the China State Shipbuilding
Corporation (CSSC) which added that imported vessels now account
for 80 percent of the country's fleet.
</P>
<P>
In recent years Chinese shipbuilders secured more than one
million tons of orders annually in the world market, but this year
the figure is much lower.
</P>
<P>
The State Council and the Ministry of Communications have
ordered shipping companies to purchase domestically-built
vessels. Leading ship owners have expressed sympathy for the
problems facing the industry and promised to buy China-made
vessels.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Financial Crisis Offers Challenge for China's Shipbuilding Business (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In fact, no big changes have been noticed in the global demand
for new ships. Global sales volume is expected to reach 45 million
tons, still higher than the annual average between 1993 and 1996,
though lower than the record of 58.3 million tons in 1997, said
Cao Yousheng, an expert from the Ministry of Communications.
</P>
<P>
The CSSC predicts that the demand for new vessels will still be
at a high level with China adding a further 120 vessels to its
overall fleet in the next four years; with a total five million
tonnage at an estimated value of 1.8 billion U.S. dollars. In
particular large bulk carriers are most urgently needed.
</P>
<P>
With problems afflicting the exchange rates of the Japanese and
ROK's currencies, the two countries' shipbuilders will have no
choice but to end their low price tactics which will hike up the
cost of shipbuilding globally. As a result China should be able to
regain its competitive stance in the world's shipping market.
</P>
<P>
But for the present, China should try and prevent any
excessive losses of domestic orders, said Xu Penghang, general
manager of the CSSC.
</P>
<P>
"Efforts should also be made to improve basic shipbuilding
facilities and further modernize the industry, to prepare for
another possible shipbuilding peak following the ending of the
financial crisis," he added.
</P>
<P>
China's shipbuilding capacity now ranks 3rd in the world, but
lags too far behind Japan and the ROK. However, the country built
2.29 million tons of vessels last year, up 20.5 percent from the
previous year.

<HEADLINE> Israeli General Leaves Army to Run for PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Israel's former chief of
general staff Lt.-Gen. Amnon Lipkin-Shahak was officially
discharged from the army Thursday and decided to run in the
upcoming general elections.
</P>
<P>
Shahak left his official post in July and under the army
regualtions, he has 100 days on leave. During this period, he
could not engage in any political activities as stipulated by
law.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the discharge, Shahak went directly from Tel
Aviv to Jerusalem to call on President Ezer Weizman as a
civilian. During the meeting, the two discussed Shahak's political
future and issues concerning the upcoming elections in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the opposition Labor Party has tried to ask Shahak to
join the Labor, but the attempt failed.
</P>
<P>
Shahak intents to set up a centrist party together with former
Tel Aviv mayor Roni Milo and Dan Meridor, parliament member from
the Likud Party. Meridor left the Likud on Wednesday. Milo and
Meridor met in Jerusalem Wednesday to discuss the merger with
Shahak, but nothing has been finalized.
</P>
<P>
Shahak said Wednesday night that he will do everything
possible to topple Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the most
effective way to do so is by establishing a center party.
</P>
<P>
The Left cannot win the elections for prime minister, and
therefore a center party, which will include representatives of
broad segments of the public, has to be created, he said.
</P>
<P>
The political restructure has began in Israel shortly after
the parliament passed on Monday its first reading of the bill
calling for early elections.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Likud Party is facing a split as several key
members are trying to replace Netanyahu as the party leader.
</P>
<P>
The Likud's Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert, supported by key
Likud members Uzi Landau and Communication Minister Limor Livnat,
decided on Wednesday to oust Netanyahu from the party's
leadership.
</P>
<P>
Olmert met with Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai Thursday
morning to decide who will come out to contest Natanyahu.
Mordechai will announce soon whether he will leave
Likud or cooperate with Olmert.

<HEADLINE> Former Tehran Mayor's Sentence Reduced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 24 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian appeals court has
reduced the prison sentence of former Tehran Mayor Gholamhussein
Karbaschi from five years to two years, a judicial statement
announced on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The court also reduced the period Karbaschi was banned from
taking public office from 20 years to 10 years, and his lashing
sentence was replaced with a cash fine of 10 million rials (about
1,600 U.S. dollars), the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi received five years in prison, a 20-year ban from
holding government posts, 60 lashes of the whip and a fine of one
billion rials (about 1.6 million dollars) when he was publicly
tried on charges of graft in July.
</P>
<P>
The judicial statement said that Karbaschi's fine of one
billion rials remained intact and he was also ordered to return
600 million rials (about 100,000 dollars) to the public coffers.
</P>
<P>
The mayor, a well-known reformist and a key ally of moderate
President Mohammad Khatami, had been a target of hard-line
political rivals who control the country's judiciary.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi was temporally jailed in April, but was released
under an order from supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei after
political disturbance occurred in the country following his
arrest.
</P>
<P>
So far Karbaschi made no comments on the verdict by the
appeals court.

<HEADLINE> China to Use Intelligence Expert System for Raising Crop Yield </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- China plans to build 10
large intelligence agro-expert system demonstration zones to
teach vast farmers how to increase their crop yield with their
specific conditions.
</P>
<P>
Han Deqian, Vice-Minister of Science and Technology, said here
today at a national conference on agricultural information network
building, that the application of information technology and
biological engineering technology in crop growth are of great
importance to modernizing China's farming.
</P>
<P>
He said China has already built four intelligence agro-expert
system demonstration zones in Beijing, as well as provinces of
Yunnan, Jilin and Anhui, respectively.
</P>
<P>
In the past three years, China has applied the system in
guiding farmers' crop growth of 400,000 hectares of farmland in
the past three years, and only Beijing demonstration zone
witnessed a total output value increase of 150 million yuan (about
19 million U.S. dollars) during the period.
</P>
<P>
In Yunnan's demonstration zone, the per hectare output of maize
and rice witnessed an increase between seven percent to at least
11 percent last year.

The agro-expert system chooses rice, wheat, maize and cotton as
the major demonstration crops and tells the farmers via computers
how to choose seeds, to apply fertilizer rationally, water-saving
irrigation technique and the prevention and treatment of crop
diseases after receiving specific consultations.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Gunmen Still Havoc Security in Somali Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Freelance gunmen keep
posing havoc for both the ordinary civilians and the aid agencies
in Mogadishu as the insecurity further worsens in the Somali
capital.
</P>
<P>
A group of 15 heavily armed men have stormed into a large
vehicle workshop owned by the Somali Red Crescent Society (SRCS)
in Towfiq area controlled by faction leader Hussein Mohamed Aidid
Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
According to neighbors from the area, a quarrel between former
SRCS workers in the workshop and some of their clan relative
gunmen had resulted the total capture of the workshop by gunmen
from the Sarur subclan of Habar Gidir loyal to Hussein Aidid.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen have threatened they will peel off the roofs of the
whole workshop if their demands for unspecified amount of money
is not met.
</P>
<P>
Elders from the area supported by officials from the Islamic
courts of Shirole and lfka Halan have tried to mediate the issue,
however the gunmen have fired several shots to warn the Sheikhs
not to get any closer.
</P>
<P>
The shooting against the Sheikhs bad angered the militia
officials of their respective courts who in return have launched
a joint attack using three battle wagons and more than 50 heavily
armed gunmen against the gunmen in the workshop.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, at least one gunman was killed and another one
wounded as the two sides have exchanged heavy gunfire in and
around the workshop.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic militiamen have taken the upper hand as the gunmen
in the workshop had apparently ran out of ammunition. The Islamic
courts militiamen had then stormed into the premises and managed
to apprehend eight of the culprits while five more have escaped
for their lives.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic judges in those courts who still maintain the
facility of the Somali Red Crescent Society in Towfiq area of
South Mogadishu said the gunmen will be tried according to the
Islamic Sharia laws.
</P>
<P>
According to one of the local employees of the agency, the
workshop was looted early in the beginning of the civil war, but
the building itself remained intact guarded by former employees
for the Red Crescent.
</P>
<P>
The workshop was used for maintaining the vehicles of the
international agencies during the late regime.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, two men were killed by unidentified gunmen near Al-
Baraka junction of South Mogadishu Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
The deceased belonging to the Suleman subclan of Habar Gidir
loyal to Hussein Aidid were running their own business working in
an elementary shop.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the killing is not known, however people from
the area attributed the killing to a retaliation against the
Suleman men who two days ago killed a fellow man of the
assailants belonging to the Dudubleh subclan also supporting
Hussein Aidid in South Mogadishu.

Abdul Hadi Majali, speaker of Jordan's House of Representatives

<HEADLINE> Primakov Pressures Duma to Approve 1999 Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Do you think the country can live without a budget in such a
setting? Of course not. The budget must be approved," Primakov
told reporters before delivering a speech at the Duma.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister earlier told President Boris Yeltsin in the
Kremlin that the government "will not stay" in office if the p
arliament does not approve the draft budget.
</P>
<P>
The State Duma was due to consider the budget in the first
reading on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The draft is intended to restore confidence among creditors
that Russia is worth investing in. While analysts have noted that
rigor, many have questioned whether the targets and assumptions
are realistic.
</P>
<P>
Primakov's threat came after the Federation Council, or upper
house of parliament comprising influential regional bosses, on
Wednesday asked the Duma to postpone budget debates until more
consultations were taken, casting a shadow over prospects of the
program's smooth passage.
</P>
<P>
The regional chiefs were unhappy that under the draft budget,
more tax money would be moved from the regions to federal coffers.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party, the largest faction in the Duma, and Our
Home is Russia, another major player, have indicated their
support for postponing the vote until next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The draft puts spending at 575.04 billion rubles, revenues at
473.67 billion rubles and the maximum budget deficit at 101.37
billion rubles or 2.54 percent of the GDP. It also envisions a
GDP of 4 trillion rubles and 30 percent inflation by the end of
the year.

<HEADLINE> Bank of China Ready for Euro Launch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- China's leading foreign
currency bank, the Bank of China (BOC), says it is fully prepared
for the launch of the Euro on New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
Wang Bo, a member of BOC's Euro Working Group, said that its
overseas branches, all departments in its headquarters and
domestic branches are now ready for Euro business to begin on
January 4.
</P>
<P>
The BOC's branches in Paris, Frankfurt, Luxemburg and Milan
have all adjusted their computer systems in terms of settlements,
accounting, credits, clearing, retailing and operating, he added.
</P>
<P>
All settlements in the four branches will be carried out in
Euros instead of German marks, French francs or other European
currencies after final adjustments around December 31.
</P>
<P>
In addition, all its computers in its headquarters and
domestic branches have been adjusted. The bank has also begun a
series of seminars to teach employees about the new currency, and
printed 200,000 information pamphlets about the Euro.
</P>
<P>
Staff at the BOC are also prepared to work extra hours on the
New Year's Day to adjust computers after the European Central Bank
announces the fixed exchange rate between the Euro and other
currencies within the Euro zone.
</P>
<P>
"We aim to provide a synchronized Euro service in China with
the European banks when the business day begins on January 4,"
Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Services with other current currencies within the Euro zone
will continue in the transitional period before July 1, 2002.

<HEADLINE> World's Leading Investment Banks Confident in China's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- China's economy, though
expected to face increasing external pressure with the global
economy full of uncertainties next year, still has the confidence
of the world's leading investment banks.
</P>
<P>
Goldman Sachs (China) L.L.C. recommends an overweight position
in Chinese equities, pointing to the belief that China will reach
its target of eight percent in economic growth this year and many
favorable factors next year.
</P>
<P>
"China's policy makers have demonstrated ability to offset
weaker exports by spurring domestic demand through infrastructure
investment, and their commitment not to devalue the Chinese
currency is credible," said Ziwang Xu, managing director with the
Goldman Sachs.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that the rebound in rural consumption in
October could serve as a buffer to overall consumer demand, and
subdued inflation also provides more room for interest rate cut in
1999.
</P>
<P>
As a major booster of the economy, fixed asset investment in
China surged 28 percent year-on-year in October. Meanwhile, retail
sales rose 8.4 percent in rural areas, where 80 percent of the
Chinese population live.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China's economy, after hitting the bottom
in the second quarter this year with a growth of 6.8 percent, has
started to pick up in the third quarter as a result of the
government's stimulus package, and the growth is expected to speed
up in the last three months.
</P>
<P>
Analysts with the Merrill Lynch are even more upbeat about the
China economy. They said they expect it to become a leader in
Asian economies in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
"Domestic demand is the key to the China economy, and China has
enough such demand potential to explore until the year of 2000,"
an analyst with the Merrill Lynch said, adding that "if the
housing market in the nation could be nurtured and mature in the
coming years, China may replace Japan to become the future driving
force of the Asian economy."

<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The editors-in-chief of 12
major Beijing-based publications and one news agency today
selected China's Top 10 News Events in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The following is the list of the events:
</P>
<P>
1. The First Session of the Ninth National People's Congress
(NPC), held in Beijing from March 5-19, elected Jiang Zemin as
president, Li Peng as chairman of the NPC Standing Committee and
Zhu Rongji as premier of the State Council. Deputies attending the
session also approved the State Council's plan to streamline
institutions by reducing the number of ministries and departments
from 40 to 29 and reducing the number of staffers by 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
2. The 20th Anniversary of the Third Plenary Session of the
11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) was
commemorated at a gathering on December 18. Jiang Zemin, who
serves concurrently as Chinese president and general secretary of
the CPC Central Committee, noted that the meeting held 20 years
ago raised the curtain on reform and opening-up efforts which were
led by Deng Xiaoping and which have significantly improved living
conditions for a quarter of the world's population.
</P>
<P>
3. Following President Jiang Zemin's successful visit to the
United States in October 1997, U.S. President Bill Clinton made a
state visit to China between June 25 and July 3. Clinton's visit
was the first visit by a U.S. president in nearly 10 years. The
two leaders participated in a televised news conference during
which Clinton reaffirmed U.S. adherence to the "Three No's"
principles on Taiwan (the United States does not support
independence for Taiwan, or "one China, one Taiwan," or "two
Chinas," or its membership in any international bodies whose
members are sovereign states).
</P>
<P>
4. The 15th CPC Central Committee held its third plenary
session between October 12 and 14, at which it passed the
"Decisions on Major Issues Concerning Agriculture and Rural Work",
thereby extending the contract land-use term for 30 more years.
</P>
<P>
5. Heavy summer flooding swept through the Yangtze River valley
in south China, and Songhua and Nenjiang river valleys in
north. Several million civilians and soldiers waged a courageous
and victorious battle against floods which killed 3,656 people and
destroyed property valued at over 264 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
6. The State Council announced an August decision to issue
another 100 billion yuan in treasury bonds to fund infrastructure
construction, which has helped reduce impact of the Asian
financial crisis, expand domestic demand and stimulate economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
7. The Party Central Committee issued a July directive ordering
the People's Liberation Army (PLA), armed police force and
law enforcement departments to discontinue business activities and
relinquish control of subsidiary companies to local governments by
the year end.
</P>
<P>
8. A national anti-smuggling work conference was sponsored by
the Party Central Committee and the State Council between July 13
and 15. It released a decision to form a national anti-smuggling
police force under the joint administration of customs and public
security departments to intensify the nation's campaign against
rampant smuggling.
</P>
<P>
9. A delegation from the Taiwan Straits Exchange Foundation
(SEF), led by foundation Chairman Koo Chen-fu, arrived in Shanghai
on October 14 to begin a six-day tour of the mainland. Meetings
between Koo and Wang Daohan, president of the Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), yielded a consensus on
holding cross-Straits meetings, improving mutual communications
and a Taiwan visit by the latter at an appropriate time.
</P>
<P>
10. China intensified its anticorruption campaign, with former
Beijing Mayor Chen Xitong sentenced to a 16-year prison term on
July 31 on charges of corruption and dereliction of duty. Various
other high-ranking Party and government officials were also
punished because of violations of the discipline and law.
</P>
<P>
The Xinhua News Agency's Domestic News for Overseas Service

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Labor Congress Issues Ultimatum over Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The Nigeria Labor Congress
(NLC) has issued a 12-day ultimatum to the government to reverse
the recent pump price increase of petroleum products or face the
wrath of workers nationwide.
</P>
<P>
In a communique issued at the end of an emergency meeting to
discuss the oil price increase, the NLC said Wednesday that if
the situation is not reversed by January 4, 1999, "congress will
not be in a position to guarantee Nigerian workers' reaction
thereafter", the Post Express reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Following last week's proposed deregulation of the price of
petroleum products by the Nigerian government, petroleum products
marketers increased at the weekend the official pump price of
petroleum from 11 Naira (about 0.13 U.S. Dollar) to 24 Naira per
liter.
</P>
<P>
The decision to increase oil price, the NLC noted, portends a
"hidden agenda and a deliberate attempt by the government to
create the objective conditions for perpetuation of this regime
or another military intervention in the event of mass protests
against the increase."
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government relied on the economically irrational
arguments of the need to stem smuggling and prevent scarcity of
oil supply over the past two years by increasing price, the NLC
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
However, the congress explained that the recent price increase
would not end scarcity and smuggling but would only enrich a few
Nigerians.

<HEADLINE> Pak Calls for Complete End to Foreign Interference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan believes that the
main pre-requisite for the formation of a multi-ethnic government
in Afghanistan is "complete stoppage of outside interference."
</P>
<P>
The view was expressed Thursday by Foreign Office Spokesman
Tariq Altaf at the weekly press briefing Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Spokesman said that the ground situation in Afghanistan
presents a unique opportunity to achieve durable peace through the
formation of a multi-ethnic government in that war-battered
country.
</P>
<P>
"However, the main pre-requisite for that is complete stoppage
of outside interference," he added.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan stands by its principled position of seeking durable
peace in Afghanistan far from being isolated, and continues to
play a pivotal role in this regard, Altaf said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, he noted, also remains in constant contact with all
Afghan parties, and Pakistan's Minister of State for Foreign
Affairs Siddique Khan Kanju has visited four Central Asian
Republics in August and November this year in efforts to achieve a
durable peace in the war-torn Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the on-going visit here by Tajik Foreign Minister
Talbak Nazarov, the Spokesman said Nazarov's visit is part of the
extensive exchanges of views that Pakistan is having with
countries interested in the Afghan issue.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Pakistan has recently held discussions with the
U.S., Japan, China, Russia and other countries on the afghan
issue.

LUSAKA, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Five officials from three
opposition parties in Zambia have resigned to join the
newly-formed United Party for National Development (UPND) led by
presidential aspirant Anderson Mazoka, Times of Zambia reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Lima Party (LP) chairman for information and publicity
Stanford Hlazo, Lusaka province chairman Stanley Ngwenya and
secretary Lewis Kayokolo have joined the UPND formed last month,
said the daily newspaper.

Charles Chibanda, former central committee member of the

secretary general of the Zambia Democratic Congress (ZDC), also
joined the UPND.
</P>
<P>
The five announced their resignations here on Wednesday and
were officially welcomed by UPND provincial chairman Joseph
Chilengi.
</P>
<P>
Hlazo, who was also former parliament member of the country's
ruling party, said he has decided to join the UPND because the LP
is elitist and has failed to penetrate the grassroots.
</P>
<P>
Chibanda urged other UNIP members to join the UPND as the
current leadership under former president Kenneth Kaunda has
nothing to offer.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Plans Nine Percent Growth Rate for 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Beijing plans to score a nine
percent growth in the gross domestic product for 1999, according
to vice-mayor Liu Qi.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate will be two percentage points higher than the
country's projected rate for 1999, he said, adding that the new
target is not only necessary but also attainable.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's growth rate for this year is expected to reach 9.5
percent, exceeding the projected target by 0.5 percentage
point.
</P>
<P>
He said without a relatively high growth rate, the city will
have difficulty creating more jobs, increasing revenues and
further improving people's living standard.
</P>
<P>
Beijing will host a series major events in 1999, including
activities to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the founding of
New China and Macao's return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Liu pointed out that such activities require a good economic
environment but at the same time will create business
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
He cited some other positive factors that can sustain the

<HEADLINE> Nepal's Special Parliament Session Ends Quickly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The special parliament
session of Nepal which convened Thursday lasted less than one hour
since the no-confidence motion for which it was called had lost
its target.
</P>
<P>
Speaker Ram Chandra Poudel told the Lower House session that
"after the resignation of Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala,
there is no meaning of the special session."
</P>
<P>
Rajendra Pandey from the Communist Party of Nepal (United
Marxism-Leninism, CPN-UML), Koirala's new ally, agreed. He also
said that the Communist Party of Nepal (Marxism-Leninism, CPN-ML)
cannot claim itself as the opposition leader in parliament.
</P>
<P>
Speaker Poudel said that the CPN-ML, the third largest with 40
seats in the 205-member house, can be the opposition party because
they were also elected from the people.
</P>
<P>
Bam Dev Gautam, general secretary of the CPN-ML which led in
moving the censure motion Sunday against Prime Minister Koirala,
acknowledged that the role of the special session was limited due
to the resignation of Koirala.
</P>
<P>
But he claimed that Koirala resigned under the pressure of the
no-confidence motion.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement reached Sunday with the Communist Party of
Nepal (United Marxism-Leninism, CPN-UML), Koirala resigned Monday
to pave the way for the formation of a new coalition government
under his leadership to conduct general elections by March/April
1999.
</P>
<P>
He was reappointed prime minister Wednesday by King Birendra
and administered oath of office Thursday by the king.
</P>
<P>
On December 11, Koirala recommended to the Royal Palace to
dissolve parliament for fresh polls on March 31, 1999 following
the withdrawal of the CPN-ML from his coalition the day before.
</P>
<P>
But 62 lawmakers from the CPN-ML and its supporters made a
submission the same day calling for a special session of
parliament to discuss their planned no-confidence motion against
the NC minority government.
</P>
<P>
King Birendra accepted the submission and called the special
session Thursday.

JINAN, December 24 (Xinhua) -- China's Shandong Province
recently opened a high-tech "belt" across the Shandong peninsula
in the middle and southern part of the province.
</P>
<P>
A provincial government official says that the "belt" has over
1,200 high-tech enterprises and is expected to get 50 billion yuan
from technology developments, manufacturing, and trade, and to pay
over 5 billion yuan in taxes, in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The province has state-level high-tech zones in Jinan, Qingdao,
Weihai, Weifang, and Zibo, and provincial-level zones like
Zaozhuang, Yantai, Jining, Tai'an, and Linyi. By the end of last
year, these ten zones had spent nearly 30 billion yuan on
infrastructure and had nearly 10,000 enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The official says that the Shandong government had new
regulations and allocated 520 million yuan in special funds last
year to encourage high-tech industries.
</P>
<P>
High-tech zones have stimulated development of
township-enterprises and small enterprises. Added value products
of high-tech industries in Shandong now account for 10 percent of
total industrial output.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan to Cut Wheat Import by Half Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan is planing to cut
the size of wheat import in the 1998-99 fiscal year almost by
half, from the previous year's 4.10 million tons to 2.2 million
tons, officials has said.
</P>
<P>
The decrease in the amount of imported wheat, stemming from a
bumper production of wheat this year in the country, is estimated
to save it a huge foreign exchange of 350 million U.S. dollars,
the officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
During the 1997-98 fiscal year (July 1,1997 to June 30,1998),
the country spent 712 million dollars on importing 4.10 million
tons of wheat.
</P>
<P>
The country has spent a total amount of 2.52 billion dollars on
 the import of 14.46 million tons of wheat in the past six fiscal
years.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government has adopted such incentives as support
price, subsidy on fertilizers, seeds and electricity to farmers to
boost wheat production in the country.
</P>
<P>
This year the government launched a 40-billion-rupees credit
(about 870 million dollars) for farmers, 30 billion rupees (652.5
million dollars) out of which will come from the Agricultural
Development Bank of Pakistan and 10 billion rupees (217.5 million
dollars) from other domestic commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's total wheat production this year is estimated at 20
million tons.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The China National
Petrochemical Corp (Sinopec) will generate 26.5 billion yuan in
profits and taxes this year despite unfavorable factors.
</P>
<P>
According to Sinopec president Li Yizhong, China's
petrochemical industry has been seriously affected by the Asian
financial crisis and the glut oil markets worldwide.
</P>
<P>
To make it worse, the domestic demand for crude oil and
refined oil products was sluggish and smuggling rampant.
</P>
<P>
In view of this, China has reduced imports of crude oil and
related products, increased the domestic supply for foreign-funded
enterprises and severely cracked down on oil smuggling,
effectively reducing the effects of falling oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The official said that China has also tightened macro-control
over crude oil and related products markets and promoted the
rational distribution of the crude oil and related products.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China has accelerated reform of the oil circulation
and pricing systems and reorganized the China National Petroleum
Corp (CNPC) and the China National Petrochemical Corp (Sinopec).
</P>
<P>
Under the new oil system, China has combined upstream and
downstream production, in addition to integrating internal and
external trade.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, through technological advances and the transformation
of the operational mechanisms, Sinopec has effectively enhanced
its economic efficiency and reduced production costs.

<HEADLINE> Profile: Nepali PM Girija Prasad Koirala </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Girija Prasad Koirala, who
was reappointed prime minister of Nepal Wednesday by King
Birendra, was administered oath of office Thursday by King
Birendra.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement reached Sunday with the Communist Party of
Nepal (United Marxism-Leninism, CPN-UML), Koirala will form a
coalition government to conduct free, fair and impartial elections
by March/April 1999.
</P>
<P>
He resigned Monday as prime minister of a minority government
to make way for such a coalition government, but he regained the
premiership as he won the support of 135 members in the 205-seat
Lower House of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
This is the third time for 73-year-old Koirala to serve as
prime minister of the Himalayan kingdom.
</P>
<P>
He first took office in May 1991 as the kingdom's first
popularly elected prime minister in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
In March 1994, he resigned and recommended mid-term polls after
losing a key vote in parliament. The polls in November 1994
produced a hung parliament where no single party held a majority,
which, in turn led to the emergence of coalition politics in the
country.
</P>
<P>
But Koirala was reelected member of the Lower House. In May
1996, he was elected president of the Nepali Congress (NC) at the
party's 9th general convention.
</P>
<P>
Now he is also the parliamentary leader of the NC, the single
largest party in parliament.
</P>
<P>
In April this year, he became prime minister of a minority
government, which turned a majority in August with the induction
of the Communist Party of Nepal (Marxism-Leninism, CPN-ML).
</P>
<P>
However, the CPN-ML pulled out on December 10, alleging that
Koirala had failed to abide by the agreements reached with it and
other left parties in August.
</P>
<P>
Koirala succeeded in finding new partners and regained the
premiership.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Cyprus
has revoked the license of the Russian-financed Inkombank and
obtained a court order to liquidate its international banking unit
in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus Mail newspaper reported Thursday that the move was taken
after Inkombank failed to meet its obligations.
</P>
<P>
A Central Bank statement said the decision to revoke the
license, granted in July 1993, was made on November 18.
</P>
<P>
"The bank has not been able to meet its obligations and
liabilities," said Andreas Philippou, the Central Bank's chief
senior manager.
</P>
<P>
Inkombank was one of five Russian banks operating in Cyprus,
which include one that is fully owned by the Russian Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
Inkombank was heavily involved in retail banking before
Russia's financial crisis erupted last August.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, it significantly raised its profile in
Cyprus by launching an advertising campaign in the local media on
its high interest rates on fixed-time, dollar-denominated deposits.
</P>
<P>
Philippou said that operations of the four other Russian banks
in Cyprus were proceeding normally.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Reiterates Support for Libya on Lockerbie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has reiterated support for
Libya's stance on and initiatives for settling the Lockerbie
issue, the Egyptian Gazette newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued here Wednesday after a meeting of the two
countries' coordination committee said that Egypt backs Tripoli's
demand for guarantees that two Libyans suspected of blowing up a
Pan Am flight will get a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Libya wrapped up Wednesday the two-day fourth session
of the Policy Coordination and Advisory Committee, co-chaired by
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa and his Libyan counterpart
Omar Mustafa al-Montassir.
</P>
<P>
The committee is a forum for the two sides to coordinate
stances on international and regional issues.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that Cairo and Tripoli called for
intensified efforts to resolve the Lockerbie issue so as to ensure
the lifting of international sanctions on Libya.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain have accused two Libyans of
blasting the Pan Am flight 103 in 1988 over Lockerbie, Scotland,
which killed 270 people.
</P>
<P>
Washington and London succeeded in pressing the United Nations
Security Council in 1992 to impose an air and arms embargo against
Libya for its refusing to hand over the two suspects to either the
U.S. or Britain for a trial.
</P>
<P>
A compromise has been reached that the two western allies agree
on a trial of the two suspects in the Netherlands as a neutral
site and under Scottish laws.
</P>
<P>
Tripoli, meanwhile, is seeking guarantees that the suspects
will not be extradited to the U.S. or Britain and wants them to be
imprisoned in Libya if convicted.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the two foreign ministers also exchanged
views on the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks, U.S. military
strikes against Iraq and other issues in the Middle East.

KUALA LUMPUR, December 24 (Xinhua) -- An information technology
(IT) consultant has suggested that Malaysia form a vigilant group
known as "Cybercop" as an alternative method to counter negative
elements including rumor-mongering through the internet.
</P>
<P>
Making the suggestion Thursday, the Association of Computer
Industry Malaysia Chairman Shaifubahrim Saleh said Cybercops
should consist of people who are computer wizards who know how to
patrol into the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Cybercops who could come directly under the Home Ministry or
the police, would be technically-sound to detect any illegal usage
of the Internet, Shaifubahrim said, adding "If people know that
there are these intelligent undercover cybercops, they would be
more cautious in what they do."
</P>
<P>
"Forming Cybercops would be more effective than registering
customers who wanted to use the Internet in cybercafes," he told
the Malaysian national news agency Bernama in an interview.
</P>
<P>
The suggestion came after an official announcement early this
month compelling cybercafes to register their customers in order
to keep tabs on cyber rumor-mongering, a move which was considered
to be counter-productive to the government's own effort to develop
an IT-literate society.
</P>
<P>
Shaifubahrim was of the view that registering customers would
discourage honest users from using the Internet as people from all
age-group used the facility regularly at cybercafes.
</P>
<P>
He said rumors could still be spread by other ways such as
writing a poison-pen letter as there are computer whiz kids who
know how to use other people's computer ID and hide their own
identity.

<HEADLINE> Two Million Cranes Visit China Each Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Between two and three million
cranes migrate to China each year for breeding and to spend the
winter, thanks to improved environmental conditions.
</P>
<P>
Most of those cranes spend their winter in northeastern China,
or along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River or on
the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau in southwestern China, according to
specialists attending an international forum on environment.
</P>
<P>
China has established 50 nature reserves primarily for cranes
and has research programs to study their migration routes and
habitats.
</P>
<P>
China is home to nine of world's 15 crane species.

<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, December 24 (Xinhua) -- China's finless black porpoise
is in urgent need of protection, according to a group of
scientists who have done research on the white-flag dolphins and
finless black porpoise.
</P>
<P>
The research covered five provinces and one municipality along
the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and confirmed
the existence of 1,465 finless black porpoises.
</P>
<P>
Scientists say that a large bridge built on Poyang Lake,
China's largest fresh-water lake, disturbed the normal patterns of
the porpoise and kept them from entering the lake.
</P>
<P>
They have asked government departments to improve the ecology
on the middle and lower reaches of the river to protect the animal
from extinction.

GUIYANG, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Guizhou
Province recently published a pamphlet which urges local
residents, especially children living around the Caohai Nature
Reserve, to practice environmental protection.

WUHAN, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Timely and effective
reconstruction efforts have provided victims in seven regions hit
by heavy summer flooding with warm housing to pass the winter.
</P>
<P>
About 70 percent of flood victims in Heilongjiang and Jilin
province and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in the north and
northeast, as well as Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi and Anhui provinces in
the south are scheduled to have new houses prior to the
traditional Spring Festival which falls on February 16.
</P>
<P>
The State Development Planning Commission recently reported
that related regions have built more than 570,000 new
dwellings. The figure accounts for over 50 percent of total
reconstruction project.
</P>
<P>
Reconstruction has been carried in line with a comprehensive
plan which combines the construction of new dwellings with major
improvements in water conservancy facilities and small
townships. Comprehensive reconstruction plans have also been
formulated for over 2,500 villages.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Chinese Sends Open Letter to "Dissidents" in China (7) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some so-called "democratic activists" in China fled overseas
and launched worldwide campaigns against the Chinese government,
with speeches and articles claiming that China would be in chaos
in three months.
</P>
<P>
The failure of their original predictions was followed by yet
another claim that chaos would rock the country within 10
years. They colluded with splittists in Taiwan and Tibet,
inherited the anti-Communist and anti-China sentiment of some
members in the international community, and attempted to create
obstacles in order to sabotage the republic's efforts to perfect
democracy.
</P>
<P>
They responded to rebukes by patriotic overseas Chinese and
defended themselves as patriots. They claimed that not loving the
People's Republic of China led by the Communist Party in no way
diminished their love for the nation. However, the motherland they
claim to love is simply an abstract China, or the "one China"
claimed by the Taiwan authorities.
</P>
<P>
Facts clearly demonstrate that freedom and democracy in China
are unlikely to result from any action on the part of the United
States. Relations between countries have historically centered on
resorting to sheer strength to suppress the weak and using other
nations in pursuit of personal interests. It is no easy job for
countries to seek mutual benefits, not to speak of unselfish
assistance with one another.
</P>
<P>
China's democratic system relies on the efforts of citizens to
gradually complete through political and economic reforms in
peaceful environment. Chinese citizens will enjoy more freedom
and democracy along with continued economic growth in a stable
environment.

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, December 24 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand, one of the
biggest wool producers in the world, exported 180,000 tons of wool
in the year to October, roughly equal to the amount for the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest issue of Wool Market published by the
New Zealand Wool Group, in the four months to October, exports of
wool were down only two percent in volume to 56,030 tons, compared
with the same period of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The annual total of new season wool sales in the year to
October was 195,381 tons, down five percent from the previous
year. Total new season wool sales in the period from July to
October amounted to 48,442 tons, down eight percent on last
season's 52,566 tons for the same period.
</P>
<P>
Sales for the year to June 1999 are expected to be down four
percent to 188,300 tons, the Wool Market said.
</P>
<P>
According to local media, over the past 12 months fine wool
prices have fallen by between 20 and 30 percent, while stronger
crossbred wool prices have risen by one to three percent.
</P>
<P>
Peter Crone, president of the New Zealand Wool Exporters
Council, was quoted as saying that New Zealand crossbred farmers
"are reaping the benefit of strong forward sales contracts made
with European and United States mills during the past 12 months."
</P>
<P>
Local media also reported that demand for coarser crossbred
wool is being maintained because of Chinese mills' Buying.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Lower on Eve of Christmas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The bearish commodity price
outlook and an illiquid market conspired to push the Australian
currency lower Thursday.
</P>
<P>
After dipping to a two-and-a-half month low in offshore
overnight trade the Australian dollar closed at 61.03 U.S. cents,
still weaker than Wednesday night's close of 61.39 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
Paul Macarounas, senior foreign exchange manager of Rothschild
&AMP; Sons, said the Christmas Eve market conditions are very illiquid
and thin.
</P>
<P>
Macarounas said the fact that the Australian dollar broke 61.00
U.S. cents and traded at 60.90 U.S. cents and then didn't continue
to fall intrigued him a little.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed at 70.52 Japanese yen from 71.41
yen and 1.0228 German marks from 1.0249 marks.
</P>
<P>
Strength in the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar offered
the local currency some support.
</P>
<P>
Macarounas said the Australian dollar was characterized by the
continuing story of softer metals, especially gold.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian army is
undertaking a restructuring exercise to improve its fire-power and
assault capabilities, the Malaysian national news agency Bernama
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The exercise would entail downsizing unit strength,
organizational restructuring and acquisition of additional
equipment, Bernama quoted Army Chief Gen. Ahmad Zahidi Zainudin
as saying Thursday in Alor Setar, some 460 kilometers north from
here.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-three army battalions -- 17 Royal Malay Regiment (RMR)
and six Royal Ranger Regiment (RRR) battalions -- will be modified
into standard infantry battalions in the restructuring exercise,
the army chief told reporters after inaugurating the restructuring
of the 6th Battalion RMR into a standard battalion, Bernama said.
</P>
<P>
The modified battalions would be equipped with ultra-modern
weaponry, transportation and upgraded communication systems, Ahmad
Zahidi said.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Zahidi said new equipment to be acquired includes
anti-tank missiles, light anti-tank weapons, heavy machine-guns,
grenade and mortar launchers.
</P>
<P>
After the RMR and the RRR, other corps, para infantry
battalion, the mechanical battalion and the ceremonial infantry
battalion will also be modified into standard battalions, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's largest
port, has increased tea exports this year in line with continuing
improvements in the market since 1997.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Port exported 89,800 tons of tea worth 146 million US
dollars during the January-November period, a year-on-year rise of
15.3 percent and 17 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
China is the world's second tea producer in the world after
India and exports 160,000 tons of tea annually. Last year's
recovery in the global tea market sparked a dramatic rise in
prices and exports, particularly for Shanghai, the country's
largest commercial center.
</P>
<P>
Tea exports to Africa hit 40,000 tons for the first 11 months
of the year, up 15.3 percent on the 1997 period, exports to Europe
jumped 37.2 percent to 22,900 tons.
</P>
<P>
The worldwide tea output has grown steadily in recent
years. Industry analysts suggest that tea processing enterprises
should make greater efforts to develop instant tea and cultivate
name-brand products in order to increase their share of the
international market.

<HEADLINE> New Plant Nutrient Expected To Stop Excessive Use of Fertilizer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- A new plant nutrient will be
applied on farmland in China because of its ability to increase
agricultural production without the excessive use of fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
The new "Plant Power 2003" was used in trials on about a
million ha. of rice, maize and wheat and resulted in an average
increase of 10 percent in yields.
</P>
<P>
The nutrient was introduced from Germany in 1995 by Shi
Zhanxiong, a Hong Kong member on the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.
</P>
<P>
Agronomists point out that the new plant nutrient is a good
substitute for fertilizers that are harmful to the environment and
to the health of human beings.
</P>
<P>
A meeting was held earlier this month for officials of the
State Council's Development Research Center, the Ministry of
Agriculture, and the Ministry of Science and Technology to promote
the use of the product.

<P>
HANOI, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's unemployment is
growing because of the regional financial and economic crisis,
Vietnam's English daily "The Saigon Times Daily" reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The daily said that many regional economies have been hard hit
by the financial and economic crisis, leaving large numbers of
people jobless, and Vietnam has not been spared.
</P>
<P>
Urban unemployment is now growing throughout the country. A
recent survey by Vietnam's Central Steering Committee for
Employment shows that in urban areas, unemployment has reached
6.85 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Red River Delta in northern Vietnam has the highest
unemployment of 8.25 percent, followed by the northern part of
central Vietnam (7.26 percent), the central coastal region (6.67
percent), the eastern part of southern Vietnam (6.44 percent) and
the Mekong Delta (6.44 percent).
</P>
<P>
In up to 31 of the total 61 cities and provinces in Vietnam,
the proportion of employed who actually work full-time is under 70
percent.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment will continue to increase next year, said Tran Huu
Trung, head of Vietnam's national job creation program.
</P>
<P>
To ease the pressure, he said, stronger action should be taken
to create new jobs.

<HEADLINE> Imported Tanks Okay: Ugandan Commander </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 24 (Xinhua) -- A senior army commander of
Uganda has said that the newly imported tanks from Ukraine are
operationally effective and useful.
</P>
<P>
Jeje Odongo, a major general and Uganda armed forces
commander, made the remarks at a seminar in Jinja, 80 km east of
Kampala, Wednesday, the New Vision paper said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said this in response to numerous press reports that few of
the 62 imported tanks are operational and combat-worthy.
</P>
<P>
However, an officer in the Defense Minister's office, who
prefers to be unnamed, told Xinhua Thursday morning in a
telephone interview that there is not yet any official report on
the mechanic conditions of the equipment.
</P>
<P>
Odongo was quoted as saying that the tanks can serve defense
purposes and that anybody doubting the effectiveness of the tanks
can go to him for proof.
</P>
<P>
Previous reports said that the tanks are 30 years old,
overpriced and not operational. A member of parliament even said
they are a big piece of junk.
</P>
<P>
The reports also said that there are fears that the tanks' gun
barrels rotate through 180 degrees instead of 360 degrees and
that some tanks failed to reach their destination on their
"maiden journeys."
</P>
<P>
The general said that although freedom of speech is a right
and a point which led to the liberation of Uganda, it should not
be used to insult or provoke others.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Ports Authority to Renegotiate Delay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Kenya Ports Authority (KPA)
and shipping lines in the Far East trade are set for major
negotiations mid-next month over the Vessel Delay Surcharge (VDS)
at the Indian Ocean port of Mombasa.
</P>
<P>
The round table negotiations will be held in Mombasa under the
auspices of the Inter-Governmental Standing Committee on Shipping
(ISCOS), which is an inter-state advisory body on shipping
business in Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
KPA faces an uphill task during the forum to contest the
decision of the lines to extend the VDS at the port of Mombasa,
the East African Standard newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The VDS is annually passed on by KPA to port users who have
continued to raise protests since the VDS was imposed about a
year ago. The lines want to continue to recover costs of being
delayed at the berths by KPA.
</P>
<P>
A senior shipping source was quoted as saying that KPA faces
the complaint of having failed to achieve the minimum 200 moves
per 24 hours recommended internationally.
</P>
<P>
However, "KPA is aware of the international regulations which
allow shipping lines to impose VDS if it cannot achieve the
minimum time to work on ships at berth," the source said.
</P>
<P>
KPA is also being pushed to seriously address the purchase of
modern and appropriate equipment especially at the container
terminal to reduce delay for the lines to lift the controversial
VDS.
</P>
<P>
Recently, KPA launched an equipment modernization program and
purchased four front loaders worth 164 million Shillings (2.73
million U.S. Dollars) and pledged to buy more facilities,
according to the press report.

LUSAKA, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Zambian government has
released 4.5 billion Kwacha (about 2.2 million U.S. Dollars) for
the Constituency Development Fund (CDF), bringing the total
released this year alone to nine billion Kwacha.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia Thursday quoted Local Government and Housing
Minister Bennie Mwiinga as saying his ministry began Wednesday
transferring 30 million Kwacha to each of the 150 constituencies
through the CDF bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
"This means that this year alone, CDF committee will have
received 60 million Kwacha each for disbursement to various
constituency development projects. This obviously puts us up to
date with the disbursement of these funds to constituencies in
the last two financial years," he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged all CDF committees to speedily meet and approve
development projects in their constituencies so that funding
could be made as the money would be available before Christmas
day.
</P>
<P>
The government released the other 4.5 billion Kwacha in April
this year.
</P>
<P>
Mwiinga said some constituencies have already started funding
projects from the initial 4.5 billion kwacha and urged the
committees that have not yet been constituted to do so quickly.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Uganda and Nigeria signed
bilateral initiatives here Wednesday to control the flow of
illicit drug trafficking and to clamp down on related
international money laundering, Uganda News Agency reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the co-operation agreement follows
intensification of illicit drug traffickers using Uganda as
transit point for smuggling narcotic drugs to Europe and north
America.
</P>
<P>
At the signing ceremony, William Omaria, state minister of
internal affairs, said between 1988 and 1998, 20 Nigerians and 28
Ugandans attempted to smuggle 30 kg of heroin, eight kg of
cocaine, 781,000 tablets of mandrax and 35 kg of cannabis resin
through Uganda.
</P>
<P>
During the last 10 years or so, drug traffickers have also
engaged in graduating some big Ugandan towns into consumption
centers for these drugs, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian High Commissioner to Uganda Maman Daura said Africa
should cooperate in eradicating this crime and not create an
environment where people bring drugs in their countries.

<HEADLINE> S. African Car Industry Suffering Worst Year in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 24 (Xinhua) -- South African car-makers
are suffering their worst year in more than a decade, and is
likely to face more difficulties in the coming 1999.
</P>
<P>
"The year 1998 has been the worst year of domestic sales
performance since 1985, when sales collapsed by 25 percent,"
Standard Bank Economics Division said in its latest review of the
automobile industry, according to daily newspaper the Citizen
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
New car sales have been going down in the last two years, and
the pace accelerated in 1998 as official interest rates were
hoisted to a decade high during a five month currency crisis,
pinching sales and threatening jobs.
</P>
<P>
New vehicle sales in 1998 tumbled 16.2 percent to 13,884 unit
in November, slipping back to 1994 levels.
</P>
<P>
Car sales could continue to shrink, car analysts were quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Standard Bank said although the National Association of
Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa was upbeat about
domestic sales next year, it doubted their optimism and warned
the recession would continue for a period of time.

<HEADLINE> Interest Rates Decline Sharply in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The interest rates in Kenya's
money market have drastically declined with the lowest level
recorded in the last quarter of this year, according to the
Central Bank of Kenya (CBK).
</P>
<P>
In its weekly update on economic indicators available here
Thursday, the CBK said the 91-day treasury bill rate continued to
drop with the average rate reaching 11.88 percent in the auction
early this week compared with 12.96 percent in the previous
auction.
</P>
<P>
The CBK also reported that average commercial bank base
lending has fallen to 25.78 percent from 25.86 percent for the
previous week. The major banks are leading with the lowest base
lending rates ranging between 17 and 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Liquidity in the interbank market tightened in the week to
December 18 leading to an increase of interbank average borrowing
rate for the week to 9.26 percent from 4.76 percent for the
previous week, the CBK noted.
</P>
<P>
Analysts have attributed the sharp increase in the interbank
borrowing rate to rising demand for money by customers for
spending during the Christmas holidays.
</P>
<P>
In the exchange rate, the average exchange rate for the week
were 104.38 Shillings and 62.32 Shillings for the sterling pound
and U.S. Dollar respectively compared with 103.92 Shillings and
62.23 Shillings recorded in the previous week, according to the

<HEADLINE> Central China to Shut Down 2,000 Coal Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Henan
Province, China's second largest coal producer, will
shut down more than 2,000 small coal mines as part of the
nationwide effort to curb the over-production of coal resources.
</P>
<P>
Li Jiucheng, deputy director of the Henan Provincial Coal
Department, said Henan will reduce its annual coal output by 20
million tons through these shutdowns.
</P>
<P>
These small mines, which have neither mining permits nor
required safety standards, have hampered the development of large
state-owned mines, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Henan is rich in coal resources, but excessive mining would
be sure to bring serious problems, he added.
</P>
<P>
Many coal mines, small private ones in particular, have sprung
up over the last two decades since China launched the campaign of
reform and opening up to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
However, negative consequences such as resource waste,
environmental pollution and accidents have also occurred because
of ill-considered and random mining.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the blind development of small mines aggravates
an already oversupplied coal market, he noted.

SHENYANG, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Siemens will
continue its investment in China, according to Ernst Behrens,
Siemens (China) chairman.
</P>
<P>
Although some European and American companies are unsure about
investment in Asia because of the financial crisis, Siemens will

billion Deutsche marks and that it did 4 billion marks worth of
business in a 12-month period ending October this year.

<HEADLINE> Vegetable Oil Consumption Demand Grows Steadily in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Economists predict that
China's demand for vegetable oil will continue to grow next year,
indicating a further increase in imports.
</P>
<P>
Demand is slated to reach 11.69 million tons next year, while
the country's output is expected to drop to 7.38 million tons,
leaving a shortfall of 4.31 million tons to be met by imports.
</P>
<P>
With the improvement of people's living standards, the
consumption of vegetable oil in China has grown steadily since
1992, and the figure hit 11.3 million tons last year, up 5.55
million tons over 1992.
</P>
<P>
However, there is a widening gap between vegetable oil demand
and supply in the domestic market. Although output of vegetable
oil increased 2.65 million tons over the past five years, it still
cannot meet half of the domestic consumer demand.
</P>
<P>
China is now one of the world's largest vegetable oil importers
and its import is mainly focused on soya-bean oil, palm oil and
rapeseed oil in a proportion of 50 percent, 37.5 percent and 10
percent, respectively.

JINAN, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Some 2,000-year-old tombs with
jade carvings and bronze mirrors have been discovered in east
China's Shandong province.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists report that two tomb groups have been discovered
at construction sites and they later decided that they contained
the remains of people from the Han Dynasty (206 BC-220 AD).
</P>
<P>
They were found in two villages in the city of Tengzhou, which
are being used to supply stones and earth for the construction of
an expressway between Beijing and Fuzhou.
</P>
<P>
To save the cultural relics in a short period of time, hundreds
of local farmers are excavating the tombs under the guidance of
archeologists. They discovered more than 300 tombs in a
30,000-sq.m. area near the village of Dongzhengzhuang village,
where they unearthed a large amount of of pottery, jade carvings,
bronze swords, and coins.
</P>
<P>
Another 500 tombs were found near the village of Dongxiaogong
on a 100,000-sq.m. area. Archeologists have opened more than 100
tombs and have found tripods, pots, iron swords, iron knives, and
bronze mirrors.
</P>
<P>
The tombs were mostly built in a simple style and archeologists
have concluded that their occupants might have been ordinary
people and they say that the new discoveries will provide more
materials for the study of the culture and traditions of the
region.

<HEADLINE> Experts Urge Caution When Opening Euro Accounts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese financial experts
have urged people with foreign currency accounts to "proceed
cautiously" when changing European currencies into the Euro, or
opening Euro accounts.
</P>
<P>
Individuals should base related decisions on actual need in
order to avoid risk, especially during the transition period, said
experts of the Bank of China's Euro Work Group (EWG).
</P>
<P>
European companies based in China and Chinese foreign trade
companies will be able to open Euro accounts next year to
facilitate business transactions, said EWG Director Wang Bo,
adding that related trade companies should proceed with care.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua News Agency, Wang said that several
European companies have opened Euro accounts with the Bank of
China, with reports indicating that even more plan to do so in the
near future.
</P>
<P>
"Most Chinese trade companies settle accounts with European
companies in the U.S. dollar instead of European currencies,"
according to Wang. "Euro-U.S. dollar exchanges will involve some
risk if the companies decide to shift settlements to the Euro."
</P>
<P>
Zhao Ruwei, an EWG colleague of Wang, advised Chinese holding
foreign exchange to adopt a "wait and see attitude."
</P>
<P>
"Individuals planning to study in the United States should keep
their dollars," according to Zhao. "Those planning to invest in
the foreign exchange market should diversify their currencies in
order to avoid risk."
</P>
<P>
An constantly increasing number of Chinese citizens have opened
foreign currency accounts over the past decade, with some voicing
concern about what to do with foreign money following the January
1 launch of the Euro.

Liao said, "I have benefited a lot from the new location

The municipal government plans to spend 200 million yuan over 3
years building 1,700 km of roads for these migrant people, and has
paved 300 km of roads around which 2,000 of them live.
</P>
<P>
The new methods have been welcomed by these migrant people
because they now have access to commerce and industry, according
to Wang Xingyu, an official in charge of Chongqing's relocation
program.
</P>
<P>
But, what counts more is that the move benefits the environment
of the region, which suffered from serious soil erosion, and it is
now easier to get farmers to use more scientific methods instead
of the the conventional farming methods that did a great deal of
harm to the environment.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government plans to further tap Chongqing's
tourist resources. Tourist resorts will be opened, where some
10,000 of these migrant people can get jobs.

<HEADLINE> Low Price Level Expected to Continue in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese economic analysts
expect low prices to continue and discount any threat from
inflation at the domestic market next year.
</P>
<P>
Liang Youcai, an analyst of the State Development Planning
Commission, predicts the retail price index will remain between
1.5 and two percent, with the consumer price index ranging from
three to 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Liang's predictions are based on the respective 1.5 and
one percent index levels for 1998.
</P>
<P>
His estimates coincide with those of the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences which projected the 1999 retail price index
will range between 1.5 to 1.7 percent, along with a somewhat
higher consumer price index.
</P>
<P>
China has recorded negative price growth for 11 types of
commodities and five types of consumer goods since October 1997.
</P>
<P>
By the end of October this year, the retail price index had
fell by 2.5 percent on a year-on-year basis, and the consumer
price index went down by 0.7 percent. The figures represented
China's first substantial long-term price drop.

<HEADLINE> China's Securities Market Has Great Potential, Says Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 24 (Xinhua) -- China's securities market has
great potential and is an important component of the country's
market economy, according to the General Manager of the Shanghai
Stock Exchange, Tu Shaoguang.
</P>
<P>
"As the securities market has expanded and matured in recent
years, it has become a true parameter of the national economy," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese securities market was established eight years ago
when the Shanghai bourse, the country's first, was set up.
</P>
<P>
Tu explained that the Chinese securities market was able to
continue to grow steadily this year because of China's sustained
economic growth and the increasing expertise of businesses
involved in resisting financial risks.
</P>
<P>
Another reason for the relative insulation of the China market
from financial turbulence in other parts of Asia and the world is
that China's financial market continues to be only partially open.
</P>
<P>
"The functions of the securities market have now extended
beyond simply fund raising, as corporate restructuring and listing
have helped to transform the operations of China's large and
medium-sized state-owned enterprises," Tu said.
</P>
<P>
As more companies from various sectors have been listed, the
market's interaction with the national economy has increased.
</P>
<P>
At the end of November official statistics show that 430
companies were listed on the Shanghai bourse, with the market
capitalization of stocks issued totaling 1.14 trillion yuan. Some
19.9 million investors have opened trading accounts on the
Shanghai Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
"And as China's measures to spur domestic demand are expected
to take effect and the economy is seen likely to continue to grow
rapidly, there will be an even better environment for the
securities market next year," Tu added.
</P>
<P>
"Taking a long-term perspective, continued reform and sustained
economic growth will enable our securities market to have
potentially broad prospects," he said.
</P>
<P>
Besides the Shanghai bourse, China has another stock exchange
in the southern special economic zone of Shenzhen. Altogether
China currently has around 850 listed companies and more than 38
million stock investors.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Goods Market Enters Low Profit Period </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- China's consumer goods market
has entered into a sluggish period featuring low profits,
according to experts from the State Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The bureau reported a 2.5-percent negative growth in the retail
price index for the first 11 months of this year, with retail
sales of consumer goods hitting 2.6 trillion yuan (313.51 billion
U.S. dollars), a year-on-year rise of 6.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Large and medium-sized department stores recorded a 4.2-percent
decline in sales for the first 10 months of the year, with pretax
profits falling by 17.2 percent. The average profit margin for
stores in Shanghai was below one percent for the first half, while
more than two-thirds of the 132 large and medium-sized department
stores nationwide recorded losses.
</P>
<P>
The State Administration of Internal Trade also provided
similar reports.
</P>
<P>
According to the administration, the nation has 249 large
department stores each with a floor space of above 10,000 square
meters and annual sales exceeding 100 million yuan. But for the
first 11 months of the year, only 90-odd stores recorded a slight
increase and the remaining 150 reported negative growth in sales.
</P>
<P>
The weak performance has, at least in part, been attributed to
the fact that stores cut prices in an effort to reduce stocks and
increase sales.
</P>
<P>
Experts also pointed that the current price war is not based on
reduced production costs and will thus inevitably have an effect
on economic returns.

<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The Xi'an-Ankang Railway, which
traverses the Qinling Range, is expected to fulfill the dreams of
generations of local people and to promote economic development
along the route.
</P>
<P>
Counties along the line have suffered from dire poverty due to
poor transportation infrastructure, with the annual income per
capita in Zhashui and Zhen'an remaining below 500 yuan (about 60
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The local economy has witnessed rapid development since
construction of the railway began in 1995, especially in the
fields building materials, service trade, and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The number of private businesses in Zhen'an County has jumped
dramatcally to over 1,300, and the annual turnover of four new
free markets has soared to 15 million yuan. The county's tax
revenues have jumped by more than five million yuan annually.
</P>
<P>
Xunyang County Magistrate Wang Anli said the railway provides
work for some 30,000 local farmers each year. The farmers not only
earn incomes, but also have access to new concepts and technical
training which is crucial for ensuring continued economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Wang added that representatives from a number of domestic and
foreign enterprises have expressed interest in establishing joint
ventures to mine mercury and an antimony in Xunyang, which ranks
second in the nation in the reserves of the two minerals.
</P>
<P>
So far 36 minerals have been discovered along the railway, with
the iron ore reserves in Zhashui accounting for over half of the
total in Shaanxi Province. Proven reserves carry an estimated
value of 8.8 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Tourism resources along the line remain virtually untapped,
with counties located along he Qinling Range offering abundant
scenic areas and natural resources.
</P>
<P>
One senior Shaanxi official pointed out that it is only a matter
of time before poor counties along the railway escape poverty.
</P>
<P>
The Xi'an-Ankang Railway run southward from the capital of
northwest China's Shaanxi Province and passes through the Qinling
Range and Zhashui, Zhen'an and Xunyang counties before reaching
Ankang in the southern part of the province.
</P>
<P>
The 268-km new line, which links Lanzhou-Lianyungang Railway in
the north with the Xiangfan-Chongqing Railway in the south, is
scheduled for completion on October 1, 2000.

electrical products with higher technological content and
value-added.
</P>

</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when commenting an annual survey of
corporate leadership by the Far Eastern Economic Review.
</P>

to basics, getting rid of new subsidiaries and concentrating on
the production and export of chicken, shrimps and fish, he said.

90 companies from outside Asia that do business in the region as
well as 10 companies from 11 countries in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Thai Farmers Bank is ranked second and Bangkok Bank third in
the country. Both of them are in the process of massive,
government-prompted recapitalization.
</P>
<P>
Thai Airways International and The Nation Multimedia Group are
the two new companies which enter the top 10, with the former
taking the ninth place and the latter the tenth.
</P>
<P>
In five leadership categories, Dusit Thani stayed first for the
sixth consecutive year for high-quality services and products.
Grammy Entertainment retained the top spot for innovative
responses to customer needs. CP Group stayed number one for the
sixth consecutive year for having a management with long-term
vision.

<P>
Bangkok Bank stayed first for financial soundness for the sixth
year in a row, while CP Group retained its number one position as

BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese enterprises has
carried out contracts in over 180 nations and regions, according
to Shi Guangsheng, Chinese minister of foreign trade and economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises had signed foreign contracts valued at 71.69

labor service projects overseas in the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Shi said Chinese enterprises are currently carrying out
contracts and providing labor services throughout Asia, Africa,
Europe, the Americas and Oceania.
</P>

Business activities have been expanded to additional
technological areas and related enterprises are also exhibiting
greater competability.

<HEADLINE> Some 800 Thai Officials Involved in Drug Trade: Press </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 24 (Xinhua) -- More than 800 government
officials in Thailand have been involved in narcotics trading, the
English newspaper Bangkok Post said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Minister of Prime Minister's Office Jurin
Laksanavisit as saying that the officials include state enterprise
employees, kamnans (district administrators) and village chiefs
who have been under watch.
</P>
<P>
The minister declined to give further details of the officials
on the blacklist, the Bangkok Post said.
</P>
<P>
A ministerial regulation to forbid civil servants from getting
involved in the drugs trade has been issued after information
compiled by concerned agencies detailed the extent of government
officials' involvement in the illicit business, Jurin was quoted
as saying Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The ministerial regulation aims to make civil servants aware of
their honor and prestige as well as the punishment if caught being
involved in narcotics activities, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the Office of the Narcotics Control Board
(ONCB) has opened a post box to enable the public to provide
information on suspected involvement in narcotics by state
officials.
</P>
<P>
Jurin, who oversees the ONCB, said the opening of the post box
is supplementary to the ministerial regulation approved by the
cabinet two weeks ago.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Eradicate Illiteracy by Year 2002 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh is expected to get
rid of the curse of illiteracy by the year 2002, The Independent
daily newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"There is a fair chance that the country will be
illiteracy-free by December 31, 2002," Saadat Hussain, secretary
of the Primary and Mass Education Division of the Education
Ministry, was quoted as saying here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Four out of the country's 64 districts had already been
declared illiteracy-free, and some 10 more districts were expected
to get rid of illiteracy by next year, Hussain told a discussion
meeting, organized by the Bangladesh Literacy Society (BLS).
</P>
<P>
About 4 million people were getting education throughout the
country under the ongoing non-formal education project involving
10 non-governmental organizations, he said.
</P>
<P>
The present literacy in the country was 51 percent, which
"means that the majority of the people of the country are
literate," he added.
</P>
<P>
Syed Alamgir Faruk, chief adviser of the BLS, said although the
government was trying hard to eradicate illiteracy, but the
population was growing faster. The population of Bangladesh, with
an area of about 144,000 square kilometers, rose to about 127
million early this year.
</P>
<P>
The participants called for a united effort of the government
and the people of all sections to make the country free from the
curse of illiteracy.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Olympic Consultant Defends Himself </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Mahmoud El-Farnawani, a
former Egyptian national volleyball coach, was paid $58,000 as a
consultant for the Salt Lake bid committe in 1994-95, but he said
he only offered information, not votes, to Utah Olympic bidders.
</P>
<P>
According to the Salt Lake Tribune, he did not attempt to buy
votes of International Olympic Committee members in behalf of
Salt Lake's successful bid for the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
El-Farnawani said he was quite familiar with nearly three
dozen IOC members during his coaching career.
</P>
<P>
"I made introductions, gave Salt Lake City all knowledge about
this person or that family, what he likes, however many children
he has, what his history is and son on, so they know something
about about him, like what he eats," he told The Tribune.
</P>
<P>
"Some people from my group don't eat pork or ham, or don't
want to have alcohol on the table. It all helps to make the IOC
member feel he is taken care of and to feel they respect his
background and religion," he said.
</P>
<P>
EL-Farnawani said he "assure" the IOC's Arab vote for Salt
Lake City.
</P>
<P>
"I offered my service to Quebec," another of the four cities
that sought the 2002 Games, El-Farnawani was quoted then as
saying. "But they didn't want anybody from outside Quebec. So I
signed a contract with Salt Lake City and assured them of all the
Arab votes."
</P>
<P>
El-Farnawani declined to say which IOC members he contacted.
"If you trust me to work with people, I won't expose who I
contacted," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Salt Lake did not need bribes. They knew they were going to
win. Linking me to (bribery allegations) has to come from someone
who is jealous or envied my success," El-Farnawani told The
Tribune.
</P>
<P>
El-Farnawani said he had been unaware of the scholarships for
IOC relatives.
</P>
<P>
The SLOC hired the international law firm Latham &AMP; Watkins to
represent it in whatever issues may arise with the U.S. Justice
Department.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department was reported to be conducting a
preliminary inquiry, with help of the FBI, to probe whether or
ganizers may have engaged in fraud.

WASHINGTON, December 23 (Xinhua) -- NBA players have been able
to catch up on many things during the lockout, and Cleveland
Cavaliers forward Shawn Kemp has used his free time to distribute
Christmas toys and shoes to children.
</P>
<P>
When he played "Santa Kemp" today for 500 children at two
Cleveland-area community centers, Kemp discovered a perspective
that was overlooked during his active years.
</P>
<P>
"During the season, I would have had this event finalized
before training camp," Kemp said. "This year, I was working on it
up until the last minute, which gave me time to think about it,
put more time into it and gain more understanding of what it
means to the kids."
</P>
<P>
Kemp began the giveaway five years ago while playing with the
Seattle SuperSonics, continuing it after coming to the Cleveland
Cavaliers last season.
</P>
<P>
The lockout actually made him more determined to follow
through on the project this year. "I'll do it until I can't fit
in the Santa suit," Kemp said.

WASHINGTON, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Justice
Department and the FBI formally opened an investigation today
into alleged bribery of Salt Lake City's successful bid for the
2002 Olympic Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
"We've opened an investigation into allegations of
improprieties in connection with the Salt Lake City Olympics
bid," the department spokewman Myron Marlin said in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Marlin declined to tell what possible charges or areas of
investigation would be carried out.
</P>
<P>
A Justice Department official met with FBI and other law
enforcement officials in Salt Lake City today, probing into the
accusations that the Utah bid committee offered scholarships and
other favors to buy the votes of International Olympic Committee
members.
</P>
<P>
It was said the preliminary review had focused on possible
extortion and tax and wire fraud.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Olympic Committee appointed a five-member panel led
by George Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
"I believe the Olympic movement holds a special place in the
hearts and minds of Americans and people around the world,"
Mitchell said. "We intend to investigate what happend in the past
and make recommendation to assure that the selection of U.S.
candidate cities for further Olympics is fair and above reproach."
</P>
<P>
Mitchell said his panel would cooperate with the other
investigations and would turn over any evidence of criminal
wrongdoings to prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
The USOC said that American cities bidding for future Olympics
and Pan American Games must abide by a 25-page set of ethics
guidelines "that say what you can and what you cannot do."

<HEADLINE> Bangkok Faces Water Crisis Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 24 (Xinhua) -- A tapwater crisis is looming
large for half a million residents in Bangkok, a city sheltering
about six million people.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Metropolitan Waterworks Authority (MWA)
said Thursday that raw water supplies from the Bhumibol and
Sirikit dams, the main sources, would drop from four million cubic
meters to 3.6 million from January to July next year.
</P>
<P>
The MWA expects some 140,000 families or about 500,000 people
in Bangkok and neighboring Samut Prakan to be affected, with the
hardest-hit likely to be those residing near where water mains
end.
</P>
<P>
The MWA called on families living closer to the beginning of a
water main to economize so there would be enough left for those
down the line.
</P>
<P>
A substantial decrease in rainfalls in the North and the
Northeast, particularly in water catchment areas, have caused
reservoir water at several dams to subside considerably.
</P>
<P>
The government has warned of a water crisis since last month
after finding a drop of up to 60 percent in the volume of
reservoir water at the country's major dams.
</P>
<P>
A save-water campaign will be launched in Bangkok during
January 10-16, the official said.

<TEXT>

WASHINGTON, December 23 (Xinhua) -- NBA commissioner David
Stern will recommend canceling the 1998-99 season if no agreement
is reached before January 7, according to a press report here
today.
</P>
<P>
That means NBA owners and players have just two weeks left to
save their season. It is also the "drop-dead date" issued by the
league following six month-long lockout.
</P>
<P>
It would be the first time that a major professional sports
league in North America lost an entire season of competition for
any reason.
</P>
<P>
Deputy commissioner Russ Granik said the labor relations
committee would make a report to the Board of Governors of NBA on
January 7.
</P>
<P>
"If we do not have a collective bargaining agreement by that
date, then David and I will have to recommend to the board that
the 1998-99 season be canceled," Granik said.
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate reaction from the National Basketball
Players Association.
</P>
<P>
"It's my view that if the owners are unwilling to move from
their current proposal, the season will then be canceled," agent
Arn Tellem said. "I believe that ultimately when the players
analyze this, there is no way they will ever take the deal on the
table."

Over 800 women responded to advertisements calling for trainee

<HEADLINE> Overseas Chinese Sends Open Letter to "Dissidents" in China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Editor's Note: Some members of
the media and people in the United States and other western
nations have frequently used the word "dissidents" when referring
to anti-government individuals intent on harming state
security. They have also attacked China's lawful punishment of
criminals as infringements on human rights. "An Open Letter
to 'Dissidents' in China" written by Liu Jiahua, a Chinese
national now residing in the United States, uses both theories and
facts to analyze the western concept of so-called "Chinese
dissidents". Liu points out that the western concept does not
refer to Chinese people holding different political opinions, but
instead to anti-government personages engaged in subversive
activities against the legitimate government of China. He also
points out that anyone engaged in anti-government activities in any
country is subject to punishment according to law. Following is
the full text of Liu's letter:

"Dissidents" in China,
</P>
<P>
First I should explain that I believe it's somewhat
inappropriate to call you "dissidents" because the word "dissident,"
which derives from the English word "dissent," originally referred
to people who refused to believe in the state religion of their
country. As since there is no state religion in China, there shouldn't
be any "dissidents" either. So I believe that "Chinese dissidents"
is a slanderous term used by the Western media.
</P>
<P>
It's better to call you "anti-government personages" because in
your eyes the existing Chinese government is against freedom,
democracy and human rights and should be opposed, while the United
States gives its people freedom and democracy and pays respect to
human rights. So what you're pursuing is to reform China in the
American way, just as some rightists in the U.S. government
claim: the democratic system of the U.S. should be promoted in
every corner of the world to enable people of all countries to
enjoy the magnificent life of capitalism.

<P>
In my opinion, however, democracy, freedom and human rights are
nothing but slogans used in political struggles. There is neither
true and absolute freedom and democracy in the world nor freedom
and democracy for everyone. In fact, all political powers in the
world obtain their power by claiming that they will seek
democratic rights and freedom for the people. But in the first
years after the founding of the political power, it usually fails
to provide freedom and democracy for its people. Only when it has
been consolidated will this political power make gradual efforts
to expand democracy and freedom. Naturally, it will turn back and
confine the people's democracy and freedom when in a crisis. The
situation is the same all over the world, and I hereby take the
United States as an example.
</P>
<P>
When the United States was founded in 1776, it had a population
of only about three million, and one-fifth of them were slaves
with no freedom at all. Only 31 years later, in 1807, did the
U.S. Congress pass a law forbidding the trade in Negro slaves. But
the black people had to wait for another 100 years and more before
they were granted the right to vote. And American women didn't
acquire their right to participate in elections until as late as
1920, 144 years after the founding of the United States.

In the early years after its founding, the United States paid
no respect to human rights, and the expansion of its territory was
basically accomplished by means of slaughtering, persecuting,
dividing and demoralizing the native Indians. As a result, the
population of the minority nationality plunged from an original
1.8 million to fewer than 300,000 at present.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the United States has a wartime president law, which
gives the president the power to impose limits on some aspects of
the people's freedom and democratic rights when the country is in
a state of war or facing other emergencies. In line with the
law, according to some recent local newspaper reports in the
United States, the United States secretly detained a few dozen
lawful Middle East immigrants, who were either deported or jailed
for a long time.
</P>
<P>
The examples listed above shows the relativity of freedom and
democracy, as well as its vulnerability to the influence of time
and space. We can also discover from these examples that only when
a country enjoys a peaceful environment can its people win some
freedom and democratic rights, and that a society suffering from
constant wars and turbulence and frequent changes of government
will bring nothing but disaster to their people. In such a
society, only a few political figures have freedom and democracy,
while the common people lack even adequate food and clothing and
barely survive, let alone pursue freedom and democratic rights.

It is unrealistic to expect that New China would be able to
perfect a democratic system in the short 50 years since its
founding.
</P>
<P>
Western countries immediately imposed sanctions against China
in 1989 following events in the Tian'anmen Square. How did the
United States avoid similar action in November that year when its
military forces invaded Panama, arested the country's president
and killed 400 innocent people?
</P>
<P>
There is no fair truth amongst nations. Power, in fact, creates
truth. Those who talk about human rights are simply hypocritical.
They lack concern about democracy in China, but instead simply
question the reasons why China has failed to collapse like the
former Soviet Union. Related individuals hope to see Tibet and
Xinjiang Uygur autonomous regions, as well as Taiwan Province,
split from China. They quite frankly want China to become nothing
more than a "nation of Han."
</P>
<P>
Are the chief plotters in some foreign "human rights
organizations" truly concerned with human rights in China? Why
did their ancestors refrain from talking about human rights when the
Eight-Power Allied Forces killed Chinese people and looted the
nation in 1900?
</P>
<P>
Why did the United States avoid the human rights issue when it
provided arms and ammunition to support the Kuomintang in a civil
war that killed hundreds of thousands of Chinese soldiers?
</P>
<P>
The aforementioned facts show that the United States fails to
offer a good example of freedom of democracy. In addition, its
record reveals it is far from a good teacher when it comes to the
human rights issue.

United States being no exception.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide protests against the war in Viet Nam and
demonstrations calling for freedom and equal rights for black
people hit some 70 U.S. cities and rocked college campuses during
the 1960s and early 1970s. President Lyndon Baines Johnson decided
to put down the anti-war movement which he described as
anti-government.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of people, including students, were
arrested, injured or killed during related actions. No specific
statistics were reported. Here are only two examples, 38 people
were killed in July 1967 during four days of rioting in
Detroit. The Chicago police department employed fascist tactics
and injured over 700 people and arrested over 650 others on August
29, 1968, during attempts to quell the anti-war movement.
</P>
<P>
The aforementioned example clearly show how the U.S. government
deals with anti-government acts.
</P>
<P>
You might refute: "We are neither subversives nor
anti-government. We are, however, fighting for the freedom of
democracy within a legitimate range." Therefore, you should be
addressed as "different political viewers" (DPV).
</P>
<P>
Why does the government of the United States refer to members
of opposition parties in other countries as dissidents, but
refrain from doing so in the U.S. itself? We should not accept the
"dissident" title.

<P>
All countries have dissidents. Differing political viewpoints
are common not only between political parties, but also between
fathers and sons, mothers and daughters, as well as husbands and
wives.
</P>
<P>
The Republican and Democratic parties in the United States hold
quite different political points of view and often engage in
heated debates which sometimes include abusive language.
</P>
<P>
However, they agree on points of national interests which
outweigh the interests of political parties.
</P>
<P>
Blacks and students who suffered from suppression at the hands
of the U.S. government refrained from seeking foreign support. The
two groups also refrained from colluding with foreign forces to
subvert the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
All people seeking citizenship in the United States must pledge
loyalty to the government. They are fully aware that activities
related to democracy, freedom and equality must be free of threat
to the U.S. government, and understand that fleeing overseas to
continue anti-government activities represents a breach of national
law.

<P>
Some so-called "democratic activists" in China fled overseas
and launched worldwide campaigns against the Chinese government,
with speeches and articles claiming that China would be in chaos
in three months.
</P>
<P>
The failure of their original predictions was followed by yet
another claim that chaos would rock the country within 10
years. They colluded with splittists in Taiwan and Tibet,
inherited the anti-Communist and anti-China sentiment of some
members in the international community, and attempted to create
obstacles in order to sabotage the republic's efforts to perfect
democracy.
</P>
<P>
They responded to rebukes by patriotic overseas Chinese and
defended themselves as patriots. They claimed that not loving the
People's Republic of China led by the Communist Party in no way
diminished their love for the nation. However, the motherland they
claim to love is simply an abstract China, or the "one China"
claimed by the Taiwan authorities.
</P>
<P>
Facts clearly demonstrate that freedom and democracy in China
are unlikely to result from any action on the part of the United
States. Relations between countries have historically centered on
resorting to sheer strength to suppress the weak and using other
nations in pursuit of personal interests. It is no each job for
countries to seek mutual benefits, not to speak unselfish
assistance with one another.
</P>
<P>
China's democratic system relies on the efforts of citizens to
gradually complete through political and economic reforms in
peaceful environment. Chinese citizens will enjoy more freedom
and democracy along with continued economic growth in a stable
environment.

<HEADLINE> Township Enterprises Contribute to Poverty Relief Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, December 24 (Xinhua) -- An increasing number of
people have come to see the importance of township enterprises in
helping eliminate poverty in China.
</P>
<P>
An Agriculture Ministry official says that the central
government will try everything to develop township enterprises to
help the economy in western parts of the country and has added
about a billion yuan in low-interest loans and other favorable
funding policies. The government will also train all township
enterprise workers and technicians in a year or two.
</P>
<P>
Township enterprises contribute a third of the country's GDP,
but in central and western parts of China, where two-thirds of the
people live, they produce considerable less.
</P>
<P>
Township enterprises in developed coastal areas provide 80
percent of farmers' income, while those in central and western
regions provide less than eight percent. And, the majority of
China's 50 million impoverished people live in these regions.
</P>
<P>
Local governments have put the development of township
enterprise high on their agenda. Gansu Province has listed
township enterprises as its top development priority.
</P>
<P>
To make the most of the resources in the west and the
technology in the east coastal region, pilot projects were
launched in 1995 to faciliate the growth of townships in the
western region and this has called for a total investment of 75
billion yuan, 40 billion yuan injected from the East, in more than
40,000 cooperative projects.
</P>
<P>
But these measures are still not enough, insiders say, so banks
have intervened, and township enterprises are looking forward to
more loans. The central and local governments are also taking
steps to improve infrastructure, provide more preferential
policies, and set up various training centers.

<HEADLINE> Ukrainian Parliament Adopts Crimea's Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The Ukrainian parliament
Wednesday approved the Constitution of the Autonomous Republic of
Crimea, the first one since Ukraine became independent from the
former Soviet Union seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
 Under the constitution, Crimea will be a part of Ukraine,
with the Supreme Soviet being its highest political organ and the
Council of Ministers its supreme executive organ.
</P>
<P>
 Crimea will have the right to draw up, ratify and implement
its budgets, while its autonomous status will ensure its
independence in the fields of justice,organization, finance,
property and natural resources.
</P>
<P>
 The constitution allows Crimea to have its own national
emblem, flag and anthem. In addition to the Ukrainian language,
the constitution will guarantee the use and development of
Russian, Crimean Tartar and the languages of ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
However, the constitution makes it clear that the laws and
decrees passed by Crimea's Supreme Soviet and Council of
Ministers will be invalid if they contravene the Constitution and
laws of Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
 With an area of 2.61 square kilometers and a population of
2.15 million, Crimea is the sole autonomous republic in Ukraine.
From 1992 to 1995, Crimea's parliament submitted four draft
constitutions to the Ukrainian parliament for approval, but they
were either voted down or only ratified partly.

<HEADLINE> Italian Prime Minister Says Ocalan May Leave Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an end-of-year press conference, D'Alema said that Italy
was not negotiating with any other country to take Ocalan in.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema said even though the head of the Kurdish Worker's
Party (PKK) is still under surveillance in Italy, he is free to
go wherever he wants under Italian laws.
</P>
<P>
"At this point, the most likely outcome is that Ocalan will
leave our country," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ocalan's lawyer said Wednesday that Ocalan could
remain in Italy, either to face a trial by international court or
wait for the granting of political asylum from other country.
</P>
<P>
The Rome Appeals Court lifted on December 16 travel
restrictions on Ocalan, who had been arrested in Rome on November
12.
</P>
<P>
The restrictions, forbidding Ocalan from leaving the Rome
metropolitan area, had in fact been based on international
warrant issued by Germany.
</P>
<P>
But Germany said that it will not seek to extradite Ocalan to
Germany, for fear of sparking unrest between its own Kurdish and
Turkish immigrants.
</P>
<P>
Italy has rejected Turkey's extradition request because
Italian law bars extradition to countries where defendants could
face a death penalty.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The Agriculture Ministry of
Sri Lanka has warned farmers to protect their crops from the paddy
bug, a familiar pest which could damage young crops this season,
the official Daily News reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The pest has already ruined crops in several parts of the
country, specially in Eastern Province, a ministry spokesman was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Paddy bugs live in nearby bushes and undergrowth and the female
insect returns to young paddy plants to lay eggs, said the
spokesman, adding it sucks juice from paddy plants and later from
the pods and seeds thereby destroying the entire cultivation.
</P>
<P>
The pest, which belongs to the bug species, is light green and
brown, stinking and easy to identify, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Farmers have been urged to identify places where the bugs dwell
and destroy them by spraying various chemicals, the reports added.

<HEADLINE> From Poverty to Well-to-Do: An Account of A Farmer's Family (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Zhang Guilian is up already at
4:00 a.m., feeding her pigs and then working on her contract land,
in hopes of giving her children a better chance, especially in
education.
</P>
<P>
The 45-year-old woman had a miserable childhood. She was born
to a poor family in the village of Wenfeng in Northwest China's
Gansu Province, an area long known for its abject
poverty. Droughts, water shortages, bad transportation, and a
scarcity of arable land greatly affected development.
</P>
<P>
"My parents were struggling to make a living for the family,"
she explains, "and they could not even afford a schoolbag for me,"
but her younger brothers got a chance to go to school as the
family's living conditions improved.
</P>
<P>
Changes began to take place in 1978 when China, after a long
period of twists and turns, adopted its reform and opening-up
policy, and, in rural areas, a household contract responsibility
system.
</P>
<P>
Some policies have been working in remote villages. Zhang's
family now earns 7,000 yuan annually, and this year she managed to
build a six-room house.
</P>
<P>
Every child in the village now has been recruited in a new
primary school. In the early 1980s, some 20 percent of the pupils
dropped out because of financial problems, but not a single one
leaves school now for that reason.
</P>
<P>
Talking about her younger son, Zhang says, "I will do my best
to send him to college," and she sold four pigs without a moment's
hesitation, to get 3,000 yuan when her elder son expressed a
desire to learn how to drive and needed money for fees.
</P>
<P>
The headmaster of the village's primary school says that the
village's 700 people had never produced a college student before
1995, but recently, 6 students have gone to two-year colleges or
vocational schools.

<P>
BOGOTA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- A Colombian leftist rebel
group on Wednesday rejected a Christmas truce, accusing the army
and pro-government paramilitary group of not joining the
ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
 The National Liberation Army, or ELN, Colombia's second l
argest guerrilla group, said in a statement that there were "no
conditions" for the truce since "the ceasefire should include all
the players."
</P>
<P>
 On the eve of peace talks with the country's major rebel
groups, President Andres Pastrana's government had called for an
end-of-the-year ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
 The country's largest rebel movement, the Revolutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and a smaller group, the People's
Liberation Army (EPL) had accepted the truce.
</P>
<P>
 Colombia's United Self-Defense forces, an umbrella
organization for paramilitary groups, announced in recent weeks
it would stop fighting between December 20 and the first week of
January.

which is meant to replace the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act,
1973.
</P>

earlier than its normal schedule to pass the Patents Bill which
has already been passed by the Upper House of Parliament.

The village, had only a small spring in the mountains to
provide water three years ago, but the water-shortage problem
changed when a 27,000-yuan water conservancy project started in
1995. Villagers now have easy access to tap water, and it provides
water for villages nearby.
</P>
<P>
Looking for jobs in other counties or provinces is another
major way of getting out of poverty. A decade ago, however, 80
percent of the villagers never went outside the county and some
older people had never seen a train.
</P>
<P>
Economic development has aroused villagers' awareness of the
democratic process. Like many other villages in China, Wenfeng has
an open account system and its leaders are chosen by all eligible
village voters. In June, a 16-member village council was elected
as a decision-making body.
</P>
<P>
"In the past, the village cadres had the final say on issues,"
says one member of the first village council, "but that is now
reversed." He says, for example, that the local government
recently allocated a certain amount of money for a poverty relief
loan and the council decided, after discussing the matter, to
provide the loan to the most needy. And no one complained.
</P>
<P>
Wenfeng's per capita income is expected to reach 900 yuan this
year, and per capita grain production, 400 kilograms. The figure
is much lower than the national average of 2,090 yuan, but well
above the poverty line of 500 yuan.
</P>
<P>
In China, the county was synonomous with poverty, but, if it
can solve the food and clothing problem, there is no doubt that
the rest of the country can do it too, some analysts say.

</P>
<P>
As the league filed for bankruptcy, ABL franchises canceled

</P>
<P>
The ABL had teams in Chicago, Columbus, Ohio, Denver,
Hartford,Nashville, Philadelphia, San Jose, California, Seattle

"I'm a litttle surprised about the timing of it," Columbus

Nashville Guard Michelle Marciniak said. "I have a calendar

Player, some of whom chose the ABL because it offered higher
salaries than the WNBA, were informed of the shutdown when they
called the league office.
</P>
<P>
"We have closed our entire operation," said a recorded
message. "The league is currently working on a plan to ensure
that you'll be paid as much of your salary as possible for the
month of December. This plan is subject to court approval."

TIRANA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Albania Wednesday denied it
was considering granting political asylum to Abdullah Ocalan, the
Kurdish rebel leader being held in Italy despite an extradition
request from Turkey.
</P>
<P>
"The Albanian government has not talked and has no intention
of talking with anyone about an issue which has nothing to do
with it," a Foreign Ministry spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Italy and Turkey have been wrangling over the future of Ocalan
who was detained on international warrant in Rome on November
12. Turkey wants Ocalan on treason charges for leading a 14-year
armed struggle for an independent Kurdish state in southeast
Turkey but Italy has rejected the extradition demand because
Italian law forbids extradition in cases where the defendant
could face the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
Several news reports have speculated on the possible
deportation of Ocalan to Albania, a country to which both Italy
and Turkey have no objection.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian Foreign Ministry affirmed that Tirana would not
grant asylum to Ocalan if Italy and Turkey have chosen another
country to solve their own diplomatic crisis.

<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The sharp increase in foreign
toursists visiting east China's Shandong Province during November
reversed the stagnant situation during the first ten months of the
year.
</P>
<P>
Shandong hosted 50,534 foreign tourists during November, up
26.3 percent on previous year's period.
</P>
<P>
Due to the adverse impacts of the Asian financial crisis, the
number of tourists visiting its port cities dropped last year and
remained low for several months this year due to the negative
impact of the Asian financial crisis.

Shandong has attempted to overcome the impact of the crisis by
opening new air routes, including a route from the port city of
Qingdao to Tokyo and Fukuoka, as well as a route from Yantai to
Seoul.
</P>
<P>
Local tourism officials attribute the positive change to
upgraded port facilities and improved services.

<HEADLINE> Analysts: China's Economy Unlikely to Improve Great Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The economic situation in
China is unlikely to improve significantly next year due to the
changes in both domestic and international markets, some analysts
have said.
</P>
<P>
The analysts came to the conclusion at a recent forum on the
Chinese economy organized by the State Council's Development
Research Center and the China Economic Reform Research Foundation.
</P>
<P>
According to Fan Gang, a noted economist with the China Academy
of Social Sciences, the increase in investment will continue to be
counter-balanced by unfavorable factors like reduced exports,
lower incomes for farmers and high prices.
</P>
<P>
The forecast of a possible economic revitalization in Southeast
Asia is not good news for China, Fan said, adding that it will not
increase the demand but competitiveness of the region.
</P>
<P>
But he said that government investment this year is expected to
have an effect on the economy in the first half of next year,
since only 30 percent of the funds were utilized in projects this
year. However, if government funds are not able to stimulate more
investment from business, then overall growth will very likely
drop.
</P>
<P>
According to Yu Yongding, director of the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences' Research Institute of World Economy and Politics,
economic growth rate in 1999 will do well to stay between 7.5 and
eight percent.
</P>
<P>
The economic target set by the central government for this year
is eight percent. The State Economic and Trade Commission expects
China to basically meet this goal or to get close.
</P>
<P>
Economic objectives for 1999 should be regarded as a guidance
and not be expected to be guaranteed, according to Wu Shiguo,
director of the Commission's Economic Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
Economic growth everywhere in China was pretty bad in the first
half of this year, but most places are reporting eight-nine
percent for the second half, he said, adding that there must be
some exaggeration or inaccuracy in these figures.
</P>
<P>
To maintain economic development, the experts agreed that
efforts should be continued to expand domestic demand in such
measures as stepping up construction of small towns and developing
the urban housing market.

<HEADLINE> Private Entrepreneur Pulls State Businesses out of Difficulty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Gao Zhankui, the owner of a
small shop with registered capital worth 200,000 yuan nine years
ago, now runs an enterprise group which has 120 million yuan of
assets.
</P>
<P>
"It is the restructuring of the state-owned enterprises that
has provided me opportunities,"the 33-year-old man said, who is
chairman of the board of directors of the private Tianma
Enterprise Group in Chaoyang city, northeast China's Liaoning
Province.
</P>
<P>
He began to be involved in the industrial business until
1995. Before that, he was doing domestic and foreign trade
business, including with Russia.
</P>
<P>
"I have not invested in any new projects in the past three
years, instead, I have devoted all efforts to helping restructure
state-owned enterprises,"Gao said.
</P>
<P>
He has since brought five money-losing or otherwise bankrupt
state businesses out of difficulties by way of share-controlling
and cooperation. Among the five enterprises, he owns one and
co-manages the other four with local government.
</P>
<P>
"Government involvement not only puts the staff workers at ease
but also offers favorable policies,"the businessman said, adding
that the wholly private ownership is perhaps not the best choice
under present circumstances in China.
</P>
<P>
He has been making the most of the successful regulations and
training managers in the state enterprises. He has even gone so
far as to hire one of the former directors to serve as general
manager of his enterprise group.
</P>
<P>
"They are not burdens as widely thought, the question is how
you are going to bring their initiative into full play," the young
man said.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, he offered 38 percent of his own shares to 24 senior
managers in his group. He holds the belief that every enterprise
or entrepreneur should do something for the society, and that they
can be private but shouldn't be selfish.
</P>
<P>
The local government would not intervene so long as enterprises
are doing well, said Ao Jinshi, director of the city's economic
and trade commission.
</P>
<P>
China has planned to bring its debt-ridden state sector out of
difficulty within three years, and therefore every possible means
in this effort is allowed to try.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Records Surging Software Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing Customs Office
statistics show a dramatic increase in its software imports in
recent years, accountig for 67.4 percent of the nation's total, in
first 11 months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has accounted for over half of China's total software
imports since 1993, with the total volume for related products
imported between January and November this year rising 2.4-fold to
59.33 million US dollars on 1997's level.
</P>
<P>
A customs official attributed the increased volume to the
surging imports of telecommunications software and increased
imports by joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
He noted that imports from Finland and Sweden accounted for the
bulk of total imports during the first 11 months, with the total
volume from the former hitting 26 million US dollars and the
latter 14 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that software imports are closely related to the
development of domestic economy. Imports during 1997 mainly went
to the national defence, energy and information processing
sectors. This year, mobile telecommunications software accounts
for the bulk of the imports.

JAKARTA, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The Badminton Association of
Indonesia (PBSI) plans to reshuffle its national players as it
prepares to win gold medals at the 2000 Olympics Games in Sydney,
PBSI secretary general Leo Chandra Wiranata said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Wiranata said the badminton body would decide after the first
two world grand prix tournaments of the season.
</P>
<P>
"Players who fail to perform commendably during the two
outings will have to leave the training center. We will then
bring in new talent from the provinces to take their places,"
Wiranata was quoted by the Jakarta Post Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said underachieving coaches would also receive their
marching orders.
</P>
<P>
Wiranata said PBSI would consult coaches and provincial
officials during the reshuffle. "They are expected to advise us
which shuttlers are still prospects," he said.
</P>
<P>
The training center currently trains 60 men and women players,
but Wiranata said that the PBSI wished to train younger players
and keep only those shuttlers with a good chance to qualify for
the Olympics.

Women's singles player Susi Susanti and men's singles player
Alan Budikusuma lifted Indonesia two gold medals when badminton
made its Olympic debut in Barcelona in 1992. Four years later in
Atlanta, Indonesia managed only a gold medal in men's doubles
from Ricky Subagja and his partner Rexy Mainaky.

ROME, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Italy cut its
discount rate to three percent on Wednesday, bringing it in line
with the rates in the other 10 European Union (EU) countries
adopting the euro on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
 The decision, which will go into effect on December 28,
takes the interest rate to its lowest level since the foundation
of the Italian republic in 1947.
</P>
<P>
 The move came just one week before the end-of-year deadline
for interest rate convergence.
</P>
<P>
 On December 3, Bank of Italy governor Antonio Fazio became
the only one of the Euro-11 central bankers not to drop his
country's rate to three percent. He held back for fear that too
much liquidity would be dangerous at a time when Italy's
political situation appears unstable.
</P>
<P>
But with the approval of the 1999 budget and a 1.5 percent
inflation forecast for this month, the market expected the Bank
of Italy to announce the cut immediately.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Medium, Small Businesses Think Short-term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Most of China's medium-sized
and small businesses follow the twists and turns of the market,
without having any long-term strategy, according to a recent
survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey of 301 leading medium-sized and small businesses
shows that only 17.1 percent of them draft long-term
strategies. Of those without long-term plans, 38.3 percent make
annual budget and marketing plans, 21.5 percent plan their annual
revenue and expenditure only, and 22.8 percent make no plans at
all.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of these businesses are sensitive to market changes,
and consider market research, internal company problems and
customers their top three concerns.
</P>
<P>
They also tend to play down the influence of their competitors
and the national environment, according to the survey.

<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The meteorology department of
Tibet has used remoting sensing technology to monitor disasters
and the environment to help avoid heavy losses.
</P>
<P>
According to a meteorology department official, technicians can
monitor forest fires and predict the scale of fires.
</P>
<P>
Tibet, which is on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, has constant
problems with natural disasters, but the department has been
successful in forecasting large snow disasters and heavy floods,
and the remote sensing information and weather forecasts have
become important in policy decisions.
</P>
<P>
The remote sensing technology can be used for monitoring the
growth of forage grass as well and the region has established a
research center for further application of the technology.

<HEADLINE> One Million More Northwest Farmers Rise above Poverty Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Over a million poor farmers in
northwest China's Gansu Province have got rid of poverty during
1998.
</P>
<P>
The figure represents approximately 12 percent of the total
number of people rose above the national poverty line during the
year.
</P>
<P>
Some 1.84 million Gansu residents still live below the poverty
line, down substantially from 12 million who suffered from
inadequate food and clothing prior to introduction of the poverty
relief campaign in 1983.
</P>
<P>
Provincial officials attribute the decline to successful
efforts to ease water shortages and soil erosion.
</P>
<P>
The province has increased the coverage of terraced fields to
over 1.4 million ha, controlled soil erosion on over 60,000 sq.m.,
and solved drinking water shortages for some 2.5 million people
and over 2.8 million head of livestock.
</P>
<P>
Flexible bank credit policies have also contributed to the
poverty relief achievements.

<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Customs officials in Jinan,
capital of China's Shandong province, has dealt with 17 smuggling
cases this year and confiscated 10.7 million yuan worth of goods.
</P>
<P>
Jinan has done better in its fight against smuggling, with the
help of public security, business people, and the tax bureau.
</P>
<P>
In January, customs officers handled the biggest gold smuggling
case since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949,
involving 128 kilograms of gold, valued at more than 11 million
yuan.
</P>
<P>
The anti-smuggling campaign is focused on transport channels.
Imported emulsion paint and medical equipment worth 4.5 million
yuan have been confiscated.
</P>
<P>
The Internet has improved efficiency a great deal, with about
40 percent of the smuggling cases solved through information
provided over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The public also played an important role. Customs officers
received 27 tips by August on automobiles, equipment, and
textiles, seven of which were worth 3.7 million yuan.

<HEADLINE> English League Agrees Pay-per-View Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The English Football League is
to conduct a pay-per-view television experiment in the New Year.
</P>
<P>
The League has reached agreement with Sky Sports for six or
seven games to be screened on a pay-per-view basis between Jan
uary 1 and the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
"These are additional matches the Sky Sports viewers will have
the option of buying should they wish to do so. There's no
obligation," said League spokesman Chris Hull.
</P>
<P>
"But this is an opportunity for us to gather information and
research into the pay-per-view concept. This is not a
money-making exercise."
</P>
<P>
Details of the matches chosen for the experiment will be
announced in about two weeks, but the League plans to target
fixtures which are likely to attract a sell-out crowd, leaving
many fans unable to get in to see them live.
</P>
<P>
Two games believed to have already been pencilled in are
Oxford vs Sunderland on February 27 and Grimsby vs Wolves on
March 27.
</P>
<P>
"The main thing is that pay-per-view will be benficial to the
Football League come the next round of TV deal negotiations,
whenever they will be.
</P>
<P>
"We will be in possession of more details regarding
pay-per-view which will form a significant part of broadcasting
in the 21st century," Hull added.
</P>
<P>
Sky Sports already shows around 60 Football League games per
season as part of their normal subscription service.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: U.N. Faces Grave Challenge in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council Wednesday issued a presidential statement, repeating the
accusation that "the primary responsibility for the failure to
achieve peace in Angola clearly lies with the leadership" of the
rebel UNITA, namely the National Union for the Total Independence
of Angola.
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued as fighting is raging on in the
battle-scarred southwest African country, which created 26 deaths
and two dozen injuries in central Angola Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"There is a war," U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said on
December 14, referring to the rapidly escalating bloodshed in the
nation. Against such a backdrop, Annan wondered aloud that whether
the U.N. efforts to foster peace had come to an unsuccessful end.
"The (Security) Council soon will be obliged to decide whether the
U.N. has a role or not," he said.
</P>
<P>
In response to Annan's latest report of grim assessment, the
15-member Security Council decided to extend the mandate of the
United Nations Observer Mission in Angola (MONUA) until February
26, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The peace treaty that gave Angola, a country rich in diamond
and oil deposits, its longest cease-fire in 30 years is in ruins.
Since June the UNITA rebel forces have retaken more than half the
countryside, engaging the Angolan Army in hundreds of places and
flushing more than 200,000 Angolans from their villages.
</P>
<P>
The most recent peace effort in Angola, the second attempt in
this decade to bring an end to a long and brutal war, has already
cost the United Nations more than 1 billion U.S. dollars, most of
it in maintaining peacekeeping troops in the country.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, many thought it was almost complete and the
United Nations was scaling down its presence in the African
country. However, grave challenges are still in store for the
world body.
</P>
<P>
First, at present, there is little the MONUA can do to save the
long-stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
In the report to the Security Council, Annan said, "The overall
political, military and security situation in the country has
further deteriorated. The dialogue between the Government and Mr.
(Jonas) Savimbi (the UNITA leader) and his movement has ceased."
</P>
<P>
The report said, "preparations for a military showdown
continue. As a result, MONUA is, in fact, unable to carry out most
of its mandated tasks and the prospects for reactivating the peace
process look bleak."
</P>
<P>
Secondly, although the United Nations has a new representative
in place, Issa Diallo, it is unclear whether the peace effort can
be put back together again.
</P>
<P>
In September, the Angolan Government cut off all negotiations
with Savimbi, and it has refused to let Diallo meet with him. In
this way, the U.N. representative, who resumed office in August,
found it hard to kick off his mission in the country.
</P>
<P>
However, Diallo has said that there is hope because neither
side has completely rejected the Lusaka Protocol, signed in 1994
to restore peace in the war-torn country. Currently, he does not
give up his hope and efforts to begin talks with all parties
concerned. In fact, he is trying hard to win the chance on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, the Joint Commission failed to hold talks on the
current situation in Angola.
</P>
<P>
"The joint mechanisms, including the Joint Commission, are not
functioning," Annan said. The Joint Commission groups the United
Nations, the Angolan Government, UNITA, the observer states of the
Angolan peace process -- Portugal, Russia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Annan, the first U.N. chief from the sub-Saharan Africa,
attaches great importance to all kinds of efforts to end conflicts
on the continent, home to a large number of the least developed
countries.
</P>
<P>
However, the international community, including the United
Nations, the Organization of African Unity and other regional
groups, have never lost the hope in promoting the stalled peace
process in the country, all singing in one voice that only
political settlement, achieved on the basis of the various peace
accords and relevant U.N. resolutions, can help introduce lasting
peace into the country.
</P>
<P>
All these exterior assistance is necessary, of course. But one
of the key elements lies in painstaking efforts to enable the
Angolan Government and UNITA to put aside their differences in the
national interest, thus giving peace a chance.

<P>
LONDON, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Formula One newcomers, British
American Racing (BAR), are to mount a legal challenge to the
sport's governing body over a ruling that teams cannot run two
cars in substantially different liveries.
</P>
<P>
BAR want to field cars in colours representing different
cigarette brands and claim the International Automobile
Federation's regulation restricts commercial freedom when dealing
with potential sponsors.
</P>
<P>
The team, which includes former world champion Jacques
Villeneuve, has been testing its new car at the Montmelo circuit
near Barcelona this week.
</P>
<P>
Managing director Craig Pollock said: "We have tried to
explore every possible avenue to resolve the matter and avoid
taking this course of action.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, the FIA did not give us any other option and
we have therefore initiated formal legal proceedings," he said.
</P>
<P>
BAR has a multi-million pound agreement with chief sponsors
British American Tobacco and wants to run cars in colours
representing different brands of cigarette.
</P>
<P>
The new rule was introduced after the team's decision to enter
Formula One in the 1999 season, which gets under way at the
Australian Grand Prix in less than three months.
</P>
<P>
"We have already demonstrated that we will do everything
possible to be a serious contender in Formula One and therefore
have no choice but to take all legal steps available to protect
our interests and those of our sponsors," Pollock added.

<HEADLINE> Footballers Hit back at Elton John </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The Professional Footballers'
Association has hit back at Elton John's claims that Premiership
players are lazy and overpaid.
</P>
<P>
The PFA chief executive, Gordon Taylor, said the millionaire
popstar and chairman of First Division Watford "should know that
the football game is the same as the pop game - it's about supply
and demand.
</P>
<P>
"Footballers do not put the transfer fees on their heads and
neither do they force the clubs to pay such wages.
</P>
<P>
"Some people may feel the ticket prices for Elton John
concerts are too dear.
</P>
<P>
"Attendances in the Premier League and the Football League are
rising so some of the players must be getting it right.
</P>
<P>
"People would vote their feet if they didn't think that the
players were worth paying to see," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier the Premier League also joined condemnation of John's
remarks.
</P>
<P>
Its spokesman Mike Lee said: "No-one is suggesting that the
Premiership is perfect, but there is much to be proud of and many
countries around the world look at the Premier League with
admiration and envy.
</P>
<P>
"English football in general is in a very healthy state and
those who simply knock it seem to be missing the point.
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure Sir Elton would love to see Watford as a member of
the Premier League, " he added.
</P>
<P>
John made a wide-ranging attack on the standard of play and
the spiralling cost of transfers and wages in the Premiership.
</P>
<P>
"There are a few players worth 10 million pounds like Michael
Owen or David Beckham but the whole thing has got to stop. It is
a joke that very mediocre players are now going for two million
or three million," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We want to seize the opportunity to bring Premiership
football to Watford but we are not in a position to pay six
million or seven million for players, nor do we want to.
</P>
<P>
"I'm a very well-paid entertainer but when I see figures
bandied around like 18 million for Alan Shearer it makes me
laugh. No disrespect to him but he has failed to find his form
since returning from injury, including the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
"It is absolutely ridiculous and money for old rope. Then you
see the players' attitudes - they are paid so much money and they
are just strolling around the pitch," he added.
</P>
<P>
The pop singer also accused England coach Glenn Hoddle of
allowing petty jealousy to influence his handling of David
Beckham.
</P>
<P>
He claimed Hoddle's envy lay behind his treatment of the
Manchester United star at the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
The Mirror quoted the rock star as saying: "Maybe there's a
bit of resentment on Glenn Hoddle's part that David has a great
career ahead of him. Hoddle was a great player, but didn't have a
great England career.
</P>
<P>
"Beckham has a very famous, lovely girlfriend. Maybe Hoddle
resents that too."
</P>
<P>
But he adds: "David has to learn about discipline on the field
and he has got to try and rein that in. Maybe Hoddle got that one
right."

<P>
JINAN, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The gross domestic product (GDP)
of Shandong, a well-developed coastal province in east China, is
expected to reach 710 billion yuan, provincial governor Li
Chunting said here today.
</P>
<P>
This will enable the province to reach its goal of an 11
percent growth rate for the year.
</P>
<P>
The growth of agriculture will go up by six percent, industry
by 12 percent and service trades by 12 percent. The grain output
of Shandong has climbed to 43 billion kilos, the second best year
in its history, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Investment in fixed assets also is expected to be increased by
15 percent to 207 billion yuan this year. Of the total investment,
119 billion yuan went into the state-owned sector, and 43 billion
yuan were used for infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
Shandong's exports should top 13 billion U.S. dollars, roughly
the same as last year's figure, while overseas investment in
Shandong will be 3.8 billion U.S. dollars, up five percent over
last year.
</P>
<P>
The commodities retail price index will be lowered by two
percent, as per capita disposable income among urban residents
soars to 5,360 yuan, 169 yuan more than last year. The per capita
net income of rural residents averaged 2,450 yuan this year, a
rise of 158 yuan over 1997.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Ruud Gullit has hit back at
criticism of his commitment to Newcastle and has reaffirmed his
loyalty to the club.
</P>
<P>
The Magpies manager came in for unfavourable press coverage
after it emerged he had embarked on a week's break in the
Netherlands and would not be returning until just before the
match against Leeds on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
At Newcastle's annual meeting on Monday, one shareholder also
claimed Gullit spent as much time in Amsterdam as he does on
Tyneside.
</P>
<P>
But in a statement on Wednesday, Gullit said: "I was very
sorry to read the stories concerning my visit to Amsterdam on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"It is true that up until now, my family has remained in
Amsterdam and as a father, I fell it only natural for me to spend
a few days at this important time.
</P>
<P>
"However, I want to assure all Newcastle United supporters
that my commitment to the club, its players and of course the
fans remains 100% at all times. I am totally dedicated to the
success of Newcastle."
</P>
<P>
Gullit's reign at St James' Park has not been the instant
success that many predicted when he joined in August following
Kenny Dalglish's departure .
</P>
<P>
The former Dutch international has found it difficult to
recruit the right players and has been unable to field his dream
front pair of Alan Shearer and sole signing Duncan Ferguson.
</P>
<P>
However, Gullit remains upbeat: "I believe I have chosen
excellent backroom staff, which enables me to spend a reasonable
amount of time searching for new talent to bring to St James'
Park."
</P>
<P>
"In fact, in the last 72 hours in particular, I have been in
further meetings in Europe with players who we are currently
targeting as potential new signings to bolster the squad and
mount a serious challenge for honours in the not too distant
future."
</P>
<P>
At Monday's meeting, chief executive Freddie Fletcher - in his
role as acting chairman of the club's plc - defended Gullit,
insisting: "He works very hard for the club. He is committed to
making Newcastle a successful team."
</P>
<P>
The Newcastle United Independent Supporters' Association
secretary, John Regan has also given his full backing to Gullit.
</P>
<P>
"Kenny Dalglish moved lock, stock and barrel to Newcastle and
still ruined the club, so just because the man lives on Tyneside
doesn't mean to say he is good for Newcastle," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I think Ruud Gullit is proving to be a very good manager for
Newcastle.
</P>
<P>
"As the board quite rightly said, it's only a short flight
from Amsterdam and Gullit is one of those people who has family
commitments and that has to be applauded, " he said.

CANBERRA, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Australian newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald:
</P>
<P>
-- The chairman of the Constitutional Convention, Ian Sinclair,
put himself at odds with the prime minister Wednesday over support
for a republic, saying it was time older Australians listened to
the nation's youth.
</P>
<P>
The Age:
</P>
<P>
-- Esso's gas plant at Longford lacked an automatic safety
feature that might have prevented September's disastrous
explosion. An internal company report on the incident found that
extremely cold temperatures in a metal heat exchanger had caused
it to become brittle and fracture, releasing a cloud of gas which
then ignited.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review:
</P>
<P>
-- Business has stepped up its push for the federal government
to abandon its proposal to tax trusts, warning that it could place
Australia at a competitive disadvantage and harm the nation's
savings industry.

LONDON, December 23 (Xinhua) -- European leading shares closed
at their highest point for five months after a positive session on
Wall Street gave rise to last minute dash before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 index of leading shares ended up 65.5 points
at 5,908.8 thanks to the prospect of further interest rate cuts
and a strong start on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
There are growing hopes for another imminent cut in interest
rates after minutes from the Bank of England's Monetary Policy
Committee showed members had voted eight-to-one in favor of a 0.5
percent rate cut at its December meeting.
</P>
<P>
"The MPC minutes suggest rates will be cut by three quarters of
a point or a point in the first quarter of next year," said a
trader in the City.
</P>
<P>
Frankfurt's Xetra Dax closed at 4,978.62, up 99.15 or 2.03
percent from Tuesday's close, while the floor Dax closed up 126.39
at 4,951.77.
</P>
<P>
The rally lifted traders' hopes for an end of the year boost to
take the blue-chip Dax above the 5,000-point level. "I think we
could see 5,200 to 5,250 next week," one trader said.
</P>
<P>
Paris blue-chip Cac-40 index closed up 51.95 points or 1.36
percent at 3,872.42 in a swing amplified by the thin pre-holiday
volume totaling 6.8 billion French francs (1.2 billion U.S.
dollars).

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The United States said
Wednesday that several violent incidents in Kosovo over the last
week have increased tension and threaten to reignite hostilities.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department renewed an appeal for restraint on
both sides.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin cited indications that
some Serb security personnel withdrawn in October have returned to
the embattled Serbian province and military and police units that
are supposed to be in garrison are deployed in the field.
</P>
<P>
The United States has strongly condemned violent actions linked
to ethnic Albanian militants belonging to the Kosovar Liberation
Army.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Rubin said the United States also is worried about
the "disproportionate and heavy-handed response" of the Serb
security forces.
</P>
<P>
"A large-scale crackdown against the civilian population of
Kosovo would do nothing to improve the security situation and
could spark a cycle of violence that would seriously undermine the
cease-fire agreement," he said.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Criticizes U.N. Resolutions on Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Turkey and Turkish
Cypriots-controlled northern Cyprus Wednesday criticized the
U.N. Security Council resolutions 1217 and 1218 adopted on Tuesday
regarding the efforts to solve Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
In the resolutions, the Security Council expressed deep concern
over the continuing militarization efforts in Cyprus and asserted
that the ultimate solution for the long-divided island should be a
single independent state based on the political equality of the
two communities.
</P>
<P>
The resolutions did not mention the planned deployment of
Russian-made S-300 missiles by Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, the Turkish Foreign Ministry said
the resolutions failed to mention the confederation proposal
put forward by Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
The statement stressed that a final solution to the Cyprus
issue could not be achieved on a bi-communal basis, but only on a
state-to-state basis.
</P>
<P>
"The acknowledgement of two separate sovereign and equal
states is a precondition for the resolution of an array of
problems in Cyprus," it said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Denktash said the resolutions favored Greek
Cypriots and encouraged them in their intransigent stance,
saying that "as long as the international community continues to
recognize Greek Cyprus as 'the Cyprus government', the only
thing we can do is to resist and not bow to pressure."
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared the founding of "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus" in 1983 which is only recognized
by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus was divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south and
the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkish
troops took over the northern third of the island in response
to a pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Tension between the governments of Turkey and Cyprus has
grown noticeably since Cyprus announced that she was purchasing
S-300 ground-to-air missiles from Moscow. Turkey has threatened to
take out the missiles if they are deployed on the island.

<HEADLINE> Orders for Durable Goods Increase 1 Percent in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 23 (Xinhua) -- New orders for costly
durable goods like new cars and industrial machinery climbed in
November by only 1 percent to a seasonally adjusted 190.7 billion
U.S. dollars, partly erasing a 2.1 percent decline in October,
said a report of the U.S. Commerce Department Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Economists said the rise in orders for big-ticket items last
month showed the U.S. economy's underlying durability entering
1999. They said the manufacturing sector had been lagging due to
weak exports, but the orders rise showed enough demand to
forestall more interest-rate reductions by the Federal Reserve
well into next year.
</P>
<P>
"Weak export markets and sagging corporate profits mean less
capital spending, which in turn demonstrates the need for tax
reductions to stimulate higher growth,"said Dave Huether, National
Association of Manufacturers director of economic analysis. The
Commerce Depertment's report of durable goods orders showed that
manufacturing was likely to continue to slow in coming months, he
added.

WASHINGTON, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank Wednesday
announced the approval of 65 million U.S. dollars equivalent for
the Third Structural Adjustment Credit to Armenia.
</P>
<P>
The Bank decided to increase the originally planned amount of
the credit by additional 15 million dollars equivalent to help the
Armenian Government accommodate the impact of the crisis in Russia
and thus to ease the social costs of economic adjustment.
</P>
<P>
The interest-free credit will support the government's program
to consolidate macroeconomic stability and to lay the foundations
for sustained private-sector led economic growth over the medium
term.
</P>
<P>
The credit will be utilized to support the government's efforts
to accelerate reforms in key sectors such as public sector
management, private sector development, and energy and social
protection, and will improve financing mechanisms in both health
and education. The credit will be provided by the International
Development Association (IDA), the World Bank's concessionary
lending wing for developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Since joining the World Bank in 1992 and the IDA in 1993, IDA
commitments to the country total some 428.4 million dollars for 18
projects.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Orders Three Cuban Diplomats Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The United States ordered
three U.N.-based Cuban diplomats to leave the country "for
activities incompatible with their diplomatic status."
</P>
<P>
One was accused of spying in an investigation last September
and two other Cubans who were alleged to have engaged in similar
activities voluntarily left the country several weeks ago, said
officials.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin said the Cuban mission
was informed the three were being expelled "for activities
incompatible with their diplomatic status."
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the decision to expel the three was made as a result
of evidence developed in an "exhaustive investigation by the FBI."
</P>
<P>
They were given until next Tuesday to leave. Their identities
were not disclosed, but one was said to be a mid- to senior-level
official for Cuban President Fidel Castro's government, the other
two lower level.
</P>
<P>
Ten people arrested in Miami last September were charged with
trying to penetrate U.S. military bases, infiltrate anti-Castro
exile groups and manipulate U.S. media and political
organizations.
</P>
<P>
At the time, prosecutors said it was the biggest Cuban spy ring
discovered in the United States since Castro took power in 1959.
No U.S. secrets were obtained by the group, the Pentagon said.
</P>
<P>
The department gave the Cuban mission 24 hours to argue against
the expulsions, the official said, but it received no response
before the deadline.
</P>
<P>
Officials said about 10 Cuban diplomats have been expelled by
the United States since the early 1980s.

Informatio~ister Julius Spencer said in a radio
broadcast Wednesday that the shelling was a preemptive
measure by the west African peacekeeping force ECOMOG, said
reports reaching here from Freetown, capital of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
"Everything is under control and there is no danger to the
capital," Spencer said.
</P>
<P>
The gunfire began around 4:30 a.m. and
was interrupted by an interval of around 30 minutes, before
falling silent at daybreak, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an ECOMOG officer said Wednesday that more than
1,000 Nigerian troops arrived in Freetown Tuesday as a
reinforcement to the sub-regional peacekeeping force there.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said more troops from Nigeria landed at dawn
Wednesday at Freetown's Lungi International Airport.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG forces have tightened the security on the main approach
road into the city from the east, checking frightened residents
of outlying areas who were trying to seek shelter in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Most of the shops and businesses in Freetown were reportedly
closed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chased out of Freetown by ECOMOG last February, rebels of the
deposed military junta of Major Paul Johnny Koromah have resorted
to guerrilla warfare in the north and east parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
They have also joined the rebel forces of the Revolutionary
United Front, who have been against successive Sierra Leonean
governments since early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, the rebels have pushed their activities to
areas within a radius of 60 kilometers to the capital.
</P>
<P>
Reports quoted the rebels as saying that their latest
offensive is aimed at forcing the government to the negotiating
table, but the government said it would only talk to the rebels
after they lay down their arms.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Independent Lawmaker Authorized to Form </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel Wednesday appointed an independent lawmaker to form a new
government as a previously-assigned party leader failed to get
enough support in parliament.
</P>
<P>
Demirel picked up independent Yalim Erez, the industry and
trade minister, after Bulent Ecevit, leader of the Democratic Left
Party, failed to secure a majority in parliament.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Ecevit returned the mandate to form a new government
to the president.
</P>
<P>
Demirel said he believed an independent lawmaker can obtain
wide support from Turkey's bickering political parties.
</P>
<P>
The government led by Mesut Yilmaz, who is now acting Prime
Minister, collapsed last month in a no-confidence vote growing out
of his corruption scandals.
</P>
<P>
Demirel did not appoint the leader of the largest party to form
a cabinet as such an appointment will bring the pro-Islamic Virtue
Party to power, infuriating pro-secular military.
</P>
<P>
Erez, a businessman-turned-politician, was chosen partly
because he sided with the pro-secular establishment.
</P>
<P>
Erez resigned as Industry and Trade Minister in a earlier
coalition between the center-right True Path Party led by former
Prime Minister Tansu Ciller and the pro-Islamic Welfare Party in
April 1997, two months after the military warned the government to
strictly act on the secular constitution.
</P>
<P>
After a brief meeting with Demirel, Erez said that "I am in
equal distance with all the parties in search for a new
government. I will look for compromise and dialog and will meet
with the leaders of all political parties in the parliament."
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the government I will form will win the vote
of confidence in the parliament," he added.
</P>
<P>
Erez, 54, will first face a vote of no-confidence in parliament
to determine if he can muster a majority of votes to form a
government.
</P>
<P>
Erez also said "I am conscious of the responsibility of the
assignment which the president gave me in a very period when our
country faces with very important internal and external problems."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister designate said that he will form a
"broad-based compromise government." "I believe that I will agree
with Ciller," who had said she was unhappy with Erez.

massive financial resources, which consequently leads to
budgetary constraints.

The national census had been put off previously due to El Nino
floods which have destroyed roads extensively in the country.

<HEADLINE> Weizman Calls for Negotiated Israel's Pullout From </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer
Weizman has asked Lebanon to conduct peaceful negotiations with
Israel on Israel's troop withdrawal from South Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Weizman made this call Wednesday afternoon during his
inspection tour of the areas in northern Israel that were hit
buy Katyusha rockets earlier in the day, according to Israel
Radio.
</P>
<P>
Israeli army said that a total of 20 to 30 Katyusha
rockets fired by Lebanese Hezbollah landed at Israel's northern
border town of Kiryat Shemona and the areas west of Galilee.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese Hezbollah fired the rockets into Israel in
retaliation for an Israeli air strike in Lebanon the day before
that killed a Lebanese mother and her six children, aged between
one and 16.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's katyusha attack injured 14 Israelis and caused
heavy property damage in Kiryat Shemona and other northern areas
of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel has to find some way out to end such shellings and the
best way is to conduct negotiations with the Lebanese government
over the issue of Israel's troop pullout from South Lebanon,
Weizman said.
</P>
<P>
Local residents of Kiryat Shemona told the radio that the town
was badly hit. The cultural center, the central bus station and
many houses were destroyed by the rockets.
</P>
<P>
"Many parents have kept their children at home Wednesday as
asked by the school authorities, otherwise, terrible things could
happen to the children if they and their schools were hit buy
rockets," one woman told the radio.
</P>
<P>
To prepare for the retaliation, Israel army has asked tens
of thousands of local residents in the north to stay home on
Wednesday. Residents of northern boder towns and villages were
instructed to stay in bomb shelters Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called an urgent meeting of
his security cabinet to discuss the attack, then flew to the
north to inspect the areas that were hit during the attack.
</P>
<P>
He urged the local residents to remain calm and promised
that the government will do everything possible to protect their
safety.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government and army have expressed their regret
over the Tuesday killing of the Lebanese civilians, particularly
the children.
</P>
<P>
Knesset (parliament) Speaker Dan Tichon even sent a condolence
massage to the Lebanese family, expressing his sorry for the loss
of lives of the family.
</P>
<P>
But Netanyahu's communication advisor David Bar-Illan called
the Hezbollah attack, the heavest one in three years, "totally
unwarranted" and warned it could lead to an escalation of war in
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Following the incident, Yossi Beilin, Knesset member from the
Labor party, renewed his call for unilateral withdrawal of the
Israeli troops out from the security zone in South Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Four Mothers, an Israeli peace group supports Israel's
pullout from South lebanon, also urged the army to withdraw
from the security zone.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up in 1985 a so-called security zone in South
lebanon. since then, local resistance groups such as Hezbollah
had been engaging in a guerrilla war against the Israeli
occupation.

<P>
HARARE, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Deputy Commissioner of the
Zimbabwean Republic Police, George Kundeya wednesday said 44
people had been killed and 85 others injured in road accidents so
far this month mostly due to speeding and negligent driving.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference, Kundeya said the Zimbabwe
Transport Organisation should encourage bus operators to be
strict on unruly drivers.
</P>
<P>
"Drivers are advised to show courtesy no matter whether one is
in a hurry to get to a particular destination, there is still
need to observe road rules," he said.
</P>
<P>
Previous calls by police for road users to exercise extreme
caution on the roads had not been heeded, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Kundeya said the highway patrol had been deployed in full
force on the country's roads as motorists often started speeding
and disregarding road rules.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to bus operators to take stern measures against
drivers who violate road rules.

<HEADLINE> Nigerians Asked to Brace up for Difficult </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's economy faces a
"bleak" future following the crash at the international oil
market, the counry's Minister of State for Finance Wilson
Etuk-Udo warned Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Federal Accounts Allocation Committee (FAAC)
meeting in capital Abuja, the minister described the revenue
prospects for next year as "hazy" because the price of crude oil
is unpredictable at present.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting which is part of the on-going meeting of the
Federal Executive Council (FEC), he said next year's budget would
focus on priority programs and projects as well as on-going
projects, especially those in the final stages of completion.
</P>
<P>
Etuk-Udo stressed the need for fiscal discipline in consonance
with the dwindling national revenue with the federation account
receiving 30 billion Naira (86 Naira equal to one U.S. Dollar),
less than the 284 billion Naira projected.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is the sixth largest oil producing country in the
world with a daily export of about two million barrels of crude
oil and some 90 percent of its foreign exchange earnings depends
on oil export.
</P>
<P>
The country's 1998 budget is based on 17 U.S. Dollars per
barrel of crude oil but the actual price declined to less than 12
Dollars per barrel for the past 11 months.
</P>
<P>
The effect of the reduced resource to the federation account
which provides the funding for the three tiers of governments in
the country are that allocations have been drastically cut in
line with revenue, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The federal government received only 126 billion Naira for
1998 instead of 138 billion Naira while the 36 states and capital
Abuja received about 66 billion Naira instead of 68 billion Naira
for the year.
</P>
<P>
Local government councils received about 5 billion Naira less
than the 56 billion Naira projected for the year of 1998, the
minister told the meeting.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the only good news is the inflation rate
which stands at 6.6 percent instead of nine percent projected for
the year while interest rate remains stable throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
At the two-day FEC meeting expected to end Wednesday,
ministers and senior government officials discussed next year's
budget, the privatization of some government-owned companies, the
dual exchange rate and Monday's price increase of petroleum
products.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Criticizes U.N. Resolutions on Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Turkey and Turkish
Cypriots-controlled northern Cyprus Wednesday criticized the
U.N. Security Council resolutions 1217 and 1218 adopted on Tuesday
regarding the efforts to solve Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
In the resolutions, the Security Council expressed deep concern
over the continuing militarization efforts in Cyprus and asserted
that the ultimate solution for the long-divided island should be a
single independent state based on the political equality of the
two communities.
</P>
<P>
The resolutions did not mention the planned deployment of
Russian-made S-300 missiles by Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, the Turkish Foreign Ministry said
the resolutions failed to mention the confederation proposal
put forward by Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
The statement stressed that a final solution to the Cyprus
issue could not be achieved on a bi-communal basis, but only on a
state-to-state basis.
</P>
<P>
"The acknowledgement of two separate sovereign and equal
states is a precondition for the resolution of an array of
problems in Cyprus," it said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Denktash said the resolutions favored Greek
Cypriots and encouraged them in their intransigent stance,
saying that "as long as the international community continues to
recognize Greek Cyprus as 'the Cyprus government', the only
thing we can do is to resist and not bow to pressure."
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared the founding of "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus" in 1983 which is only recognized
by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus was divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south and
the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkish
troops took over the northern third of the island in response
to a pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Tension between the governments of Turkey and Cyprus has
grown noticeably since Cyprus announced that she was purchasing
S-300 ground-to-air missiles from Moscow. Turkey has threatened to
take out the missiles if they are deployed on the island.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Slams Israeli Attack on Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 23 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has
condemned Israel's air strike on Lebanon Tuesday, saying that
such act endangered lives of innocent civilians and would
perpetuate the cycle of violence in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released Wednesday, the South African Foreign
Ministry called on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
government to stop air raids against population centers in
Lebanon, South African Press Association reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
South Africa called on Israel to honor the spirit of
peace-making in the Middle East which was recently reinforced
with the signing of the Wye River memorandum, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli air force attacked the Bekaa valley in eastern
Lebanon Tuesday, killing seven civilians.
</P>
<P>
South Africa regarded the attack as yet another in a litany of
such incidents, including the inexcusable massacre of more than
one hundred Lebanese civilians at Qana in 1996, said the
statement. Similar attacks in recent years have led to the
deaths of large numbers of innocent civilians in Lebanon, it
added.
</P>
<P>
The ministry voiced its concern that violence might escalate
as Hizbollah in Lebanon has indicated that it intends to take its
revenge.
</P>
<P>
"This will once again perpetuate the cycle of violence in the
region and lead to further hostility in southern Lebanon and on
the northern border of Israel," it said.

<HEADLINE> Willy Claes Found Guilty of Passive Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Ex-NATO Secretary General
Willy Claes has been found guilty of passive corruption and
sentenced to a reprived prison term on Wednesday by the Belgian
Appeal Court.
</P>
<P>
The final verdict from the trial, nicknamed "the trial of the
century", found all 12 defendants guilty and sentenced them all to
reprived imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
The former NATO chief was sentenced to three years in prison
with a reprive of five years.
</P>
<P>
Claes was forced to resign from the top NATO post in October
1995 when allegations rose that the former Belgian economy
minister, responsible for comparing rival bids from helicopter
manufacturers, received bribery from the Italian company of
Agusta.
</P>
<P>
Guy Coeme, former defense minister of Belgium, and Guy
Spitaels, former chairman of the Belgian Socialist Party, were
both sentenced to two years of imprisonment with reprive.
</P>
<P>
The lightest punishment was handed to Francois Pirot who got
three months of imprisonment with a reprive of three years.
</P>
<P>
The trial, that lasted more than two months, investigated into
the cash gifts allegedly given by the Italian helicopter company
Agusta and the French electronics company Dassault in the late
1980s after they won multi-million franc contracts to supply
Belgium with 46 A-106 helicopters and to refit the electronic
systems of the country's F-16 fighter planes.
</P>
<P>
Total bribery was alleged to be 140 million Belgian francs (3.8
million U.S. dollars) but all the 12 defendants pleaded not
guilty.
</P>
<P>
The death of Socialist Party politician Andre Cools in 1991 led
to the discovery of irregularities in party funds that in turn led
to a report alleging that the granting of the 1988 contract to
Agusta was tainted with illegal acts.
</P>
<P>
The report also suggested that technical evaluations of the
rival bids were handled by Belgian cabinet members to make
Agusta's and Dassault's bids more favorable.
</P>
<P>
The trial finally got underway on September 2 this year after a
hiatus of a decade but was interrupted when the defendants asked
to check up the legal procedures. It was resumed on September 16.

<HEADLINE> Greece Welcomes U.N. Resolutions on Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Greece on Wednesday hailed the
two resolutions on Cyprus adopted unanimously by the U.N. Security
Council, saying that the U.N. move showed the international
community's strong interest in the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The simultaneous adoption of the two resolutions showed both
the strong interest of the international community in the Cyprus
problem and the Security Council's realization of the dangers
entailed by any further prolongation of the problem, Greece's
Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos said while commenting on the
two resolutions adopted by the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The first resolution allows the renewal of the U.N.
peacekeeping force in Cyprus for another six months while the
second calling on the Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots to
respond positively to efforts by U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan's deputy special representative for Cyprus, Ann Hercus, to
secure agreement on measures to reduce tension and build
confidence between the two communities.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos said that it was indeed the first time that the
Security Council, with new, very strong expressions and specific
instructions and directions, appeared determined to make efforts
not only for a short-term reduction of tension, but to tackle in
substance the crucial problem of security and at the same time
moved decisively to resolve the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
He added that the resolutions clearly described the main
parameters for resolving the Cyprus problem and in so doing,
stated in the most responsible, official and categorical way that
any other proposals raised by the Turkish side were not being
considered by the international community and were regarded as
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed that there was only one state and only
one legitimate government in Cyprus and the only solution to the
Cyprus problem was a federation.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
For years, the U.N.-sponsored negotiations between the two
communities for peacefully resolving the Cyprus problem have made
no progress due to the differences of their stances towards
settling the division problem.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the situation in the divided island has remained
tense since Cyprus decided last year to purchase and install the
Russian-made S-300 anti-aircraft missiles, with Turkey openly
threatening to use force to prevent the missile deployment.

<HEADLINE> U.S. GDP Grows at 3.7 Percent in Third Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economy expanded
less strongly during the July-September quarter than previously
estimated because of a slightly worse trade performance, the
Commerce Department said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The nation's gross domestic product (GDP) grew at a 3.7 percent
annual rate during the third quarter instead of the 3.9 percent
forecasted a month ago, the Department said, but still more than
twice the second quarter's 1.8 percent rate of advance. Price
rises remained muted, suggesting little or no inflation pressure.
</P>
<P>
It reported that the trade problems linked to the world
economic slump was largely responsible for the modest downward
revision in overall GDP growth.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time in 40 years that the U.S. export sales
fell for a third consecutive quarter. They were down at a 2.8
percent annual rate over the July-September period, while imports
from abroad rose at a 2.3 percent rate.
</P>
<P>
U.S. corporations are being squeezed by the loss of sales
abroad and their inability to raise prices at home. After-tax
profits fell 1 percent in the third quarter, the third decline in
the past four quarters.
</P>
<P>
However,during the third quarter, consumer spending advanced at
a rapid 4.1 percent annual rate and housing construction soared at
a 9.9 percent annual rate. That helped offset the deteriorating
trade deficit and a drop in business investment in new equipment
at a 1 percent annual rate, the first decline since 1991.
</P>
<P>
Economists said that growth is expected to remain brisk during
the fourth quarter, mainly because of strong consumer spending, but
slow next year as weak sales to overseas markets.

<HEADLINE> South Africa's Producer Inflation Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 23 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's
annualized producer inflation rose to 4.8 percent in November
from 4.2 percent in October, according to latest figures from
Statistics South Africa.
</P>
<P>
South African Press Association Thursday quoted the
organization as saying that the domestic month-on-month producer
production index (PPI) rose 0.5 percent during the month, while
the year-on-year increase was 4.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The imported year-on-year PPI rose by 8.1 percent, up from 7.8
percent in October, said the organization.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the higher-than-expected producer inflation
had been caused in part by a rise in imported oil prices.
However, these were expected to fall soon sharply.
</P>
<P>
Some economists predicted an average annual producer inflation
of 3.5 percent in 1998 and 5.7 percent for 1999.

<HEADLINE> UK Court Rules Pinochet May Travel to Doctor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 23 (Xinhua) -- A British court ruled on
Wednesday that former Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet could leave
his residence where he is under house arrest, if he needed to see
a doctor.
</P>
<P>
The court said it would be up to the senior police officer
guarding Pinochet to decide how many people could accompany him to
a hospital or clinic, or visit him there, if such a situation
arose.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet's lawyer said a dentist has visited the mansion in
south of London, where Pinochet is staying, to give him treatment.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet was arrested at the request of a Spnish court on
October 16 at a London hospital where he was recovering from a
back surgery.
</P>
<P>
A Spanish judge accused the 83-year-old general of
responsibility for the deaths and disappearances of 3,000 people
during his 1973-1990 rule in Chile, and wanted him to be
extradited to Spain to face charges.
</P>
<P>
The court on Wednesday also set February 1, 1999 for the next
hearing on Pinochet's extradition to Spain.
</P>
<P>
The extradition hearing had originally been set for January 18,
but Britain's House of Lords last week decided to re-hear the
question of whether Pinochet is immune from prosecution in Britain
on that same date.
</P>
<P>
There was no point in having an extradition hearing before the
Lords had made their decision, the court ruled.

<HEADLINE> Some U.N. Relief Workers Return to Baghdad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Some U.N. relief workers
evacuated to Jordan in the U.S.-British bombardment against Iraq
last week returned to Baghdad Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
But the number of the returned relief workers is not
immediately known.
</P>
<P>
U.N. sources here told Xinhua that more U.N. humanitarian
staff will come back in the coming few days.
</P>
<P>
There were around 200 U.N. relief workers in Baghdad before
the U.S. and Britain air raids, which lasted four days with a
declared aim to retaliate Iraq's defiance of U.N. weapons
inspections.
</P>
<P>
The weapons inspections, which began in 1991 after the Gulf War
sparked by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990, have repeatedly run
into problems due to the disputes between Baghdad and the
U.N. Special Commission on disarming Iraq.
</P>
<P>
About 240 U.N. humanitarian staff are now working in northern
Iraq's three Kurdish autonomous governorates. They stayed there
during the bombing and continued their mission.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Officials here warned that damage caused by the air
strikes will make the U.N. humanitarian work in Iraq even tougher.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's Special Envoy to Iraq
Prakash Shah said earlier that there might be a need for
emergency aid as a result of the U.S. bombing.

<HEADLINE> Russia Satisfied with U.N. Resolutions on Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian ambassador to Cyprus
Georgi Mouradov Wednesday described two U.N. resolutions on Cyprus
as satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
Mouradov expressed the hope that these resolutions, adopted
Tuesday by the U.N. Security Council, will give a positive push to
the settlement of the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
The Russian ambassador was speaking after a meeting with
Cyprus Under-Secretary to the President Pantelis Kouros with whom
he exchanged views on the resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The first resolution extends the mandate of the
U.N. Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus for a further six-month period,
until June next year. It expresses grave concern with the
"excessive levels of military forces and armaments" in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The second resolution urges Secretary-General Kofi Annan to
pursue mediation efforts between the two communities and to
secure a "staged process" of reduction of troops and armaments
on Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Mouradov said that Moscow "remains steadfast in its positions
on all substantial issues for a settlement in Cyprus".
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since Turkey landed
its troops and took over the northern third of the island in 1974
following a failed pro-Athens coup. Turkey now has a military
force of more than 35,000 to protect the break-away Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus which is only recognized by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Asked where the Russian-made S-300 missiles ordered by Cyprus
will be deployed, the ambassador said this issue was not discussed
at his meeting with Kouros.
</P>
<P>
Nicosia government has said it would reconsider the deployment
of the missiles if substantial talks for a Cyprus settlement begin
or if negotiation for the reduction of arms and troops leading to
demilitarization get underway.

<HEADLINE> German Inflation Lowest Since '87 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 23 (Xinhua) --The inflation rate for this year
for all of Germany was 0.9 per cent, just half of the 1.8 per cent
recorded in 1997 and the lowest for western Germany since 1987,
the German Federal Statistics Office announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The annual rate is the lowest ever for unified Germany since
statistics for the former West and East were combined in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Inflation dropped to 0.4 per cent in western Germany for the
month of December, contributing to the lowest annual rate in
eleven years, the office said.
</P>
<P>
The December figure of 0.4 per cent is an estimate based on
statistics from four states in western Germany and is considered
reliable.
</P>
<P>
Declining prices for energy, raw materials and other imported
goods contributed significantly to the low inflation rate,
according to the office. enditem

<HEADLINE> Israeli Allied Militiaman Killed in S. Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 23 (Xinhua) -- A member of Israeli allied
South Lebanon Army (SLA) was killed on Wednesday in south Lebanon
by a roadside bomb, the Orient radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Security sources said that the militiaman was killed when he
was walking near his house in Anan village inside Jezzine, an area
policed by SLA just outside the Israeli occupied border enclave in
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, later claimed
the responsibility for the attack.
</P>
<P>
The incident came one day after eight Lebanese civilians,
including a monther and her six children, were killed by Israeli
air raids on east Lebanon's Baalbek city.
</P>
<P>
Early this morning, Hezbollah fired more than 30 Katyusha
rockets at northern Israel in retaliation, wounding at least 13
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a self-declared security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Spearheaded by Hezbollah, Lebanon's resistance movement has
been fighting against Israeli occupying forces and its proxy SLA.
</P>
<P>
Since the start of this year, 23 Israeli soldiers and 33 SLA
militiamen have been killed in conflicts with Lebanese guerrillas
in the border zone.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Receives Nothing Through Port Sudan: Spokesperson </HEADLINE>

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian government
Spokesperson Selome Taddesse said Wednesday that "Ethiopia has
not received a single imported item -- not even a single pencil
or food supplies -- let alone arms through Port Sudan."
</P>
<P>
The spokesperson made the statement following the Eritrean
Foreign Minister said Tuesday that Sudan and Djibouti have
provided military or logistical aid to Ethiopia in its conflicts
with Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued here by the Office of the Ethiopian
Government Spokesperson said the accusation against Djibouti and
Sudan is "baseless fabrications."
</P>
<P>
"This new Eritrean baseless accusation is evidence of the
continuation of Asmara's policy of accusing all neighbors in a
vain attempt to confuse the issue and camouflage its aggression,"
said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The office also said the accusation against Djibouti is not
new and that it has resulted in the decision of Djibouti to
severe diplomatic relations with Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Peace and Reconciliation Council of Ethiopian
Elders and Religious Leaders Wednesday once again called on
Ethiopia and Eritrea to exert maximum restraint.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Uganda Refutes Reports on Electro-Magnetic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The management of Uganda
Electricity Board (UEB) has refuted media reports that exposure
to low-frequency electro-magnetic fields can cause cancer,
leukemia and brain tumor in people, including unborn babies.
</P>
<P>
They dismissed the reports in a press release issued Wednesday
as unfounded.
</P>
<P>
Alex Mugoya, UEB's acting managing director, said information
available to the Board shows that there is so far inadequate
evidence to prove these claims.
</P>
<P>
Research by the Institute of Electrical Engineers had
concluded that there is no firm evidence of low-frequency
electro-magnetic fields having any biological effects, and
neither is there any mechanism which could produce such effects,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Mugoya advised that all matters concerning environmental and
health hazards related to high-voltage electricity transmission
lines should be referred to relevant professional and specialized
bodies.
</P>
<P>
Previously, some newspaper reports said that exposure to the
above-mentioned environment would lead to serious health
problems, making the public worry about their living environment
and incurring strong demands for movement to other areas.

<HEADLINE> 1998 to Be Record Tourism Year for Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- With only a few days left this
year, about 2.23 million tourists are forecast to have visited
Cyprus, hitting a record high, local newspapers reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A report by Cyprus Finance Ministry's Department of Statistics
and Research was quoted by the papers as saying that the number of
tourists to Cyprus in the first 11 months of this year rose by 6.8
percent to 2.13 million, compared with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the tourist boom to the strong sterling
and the sustained love by British tourists for Cyprus, where they
can enjoy right-hand side driving, bilingual services and
English-style pubs and eateries.
</P>
<P>
The British arrivals rose by 20.6 percent in the
January-November period this year as against the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
The report also shows that 81.1 percent of the tourists were
from western European states. Britain took the lead with 47.3
percent, followed by Germany, Russia, Greece and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
The performance of Cyprus' tourism sector in 1998 is
particularly impressive given the 10.7 percent fall in the
arrivals of tourists from east European states resulting from the
Russia's economic meltdown.
</P>
<P>
Tourism earnings account for nearly 20 percent of Cyprus' gross
domestic product and is the biggest employer of the country.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary figures from Britain indicate that there will be
an increase of about 25 percent in bookings next year, but exact
number will be expected early next year.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Considers U.N. Resolutions Positive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The government of Cyprus views
as positive U.N. Security Council resolutions 1217 and 1218
concerning efforts to solve disputes between Turkish and Greek
Cypriots on the island, Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides said
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In its late Tuesday session, the U.N. Security Council passed
resolution 1217 renewing the madate of the UN Peacekeeping force
in Cyprus and resolution 1218 prolonging U.N Secretary General
Kofi Annan's good offices mission in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides told reporters the government stance is based on its
belief that the resolutions have created some hopeful prospects
regarding efforts to open the road on the core issues of the
Cyprus problem, especially the reduction of all armaments with an
aim to the demilitarization of the island.
</P>
<P>
On U.N. Resolution 1217, Kasoulides welcomed the reaffirmation
that "a Cyprus settlement must be based on a single citizenship,
with its independence and territorial integrity safeguarded and
comprising two politically equal communities as described in the
relevant Security Council resolutions, in a bicommunal and bizonal
federation".
</P>
<P>
Regarding the Resolution 1218, Kasoulides noted that the
Security Council requests the U.N. chief to work intensively with
the two sides for a settlement in Cyprus and the reduction of arms.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since Turkey
landed its troops and took over the northern third of the island
in 1974 following a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Efforts to settle the Cyprus issue reached a stalemate after
the Turkish Cypriot side demanded recognition of "the Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus", unilaterally declared in 1983 and
recognized only by Ankara.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time in many years that the Security Council
demands compliance with its previous resolutions on Cyprus,
particularly with regard to refraining from the threat or the use
of force, and on the reduction of troops and armaments, "
Kasoulides said.
</P>
<P>
On a statement by U.S. President Bill Clinton in support of the
resolutions, Kasoulides said "it creates some new hopes for 1999".
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides did not comment on the issue of the S-300 missiles,
saying it will be discussed Thursday at a meeting of the National
Council, the top advisory body to the President on the Cyprus
issue.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus signed a deal with Russia in January 1997 to buy S-300
anti-aircraft missiles in a bid to booster its defense, a move
rejected by Turkey which has threatened to launch preemptive
strike on the missiles if they are deployed.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus government has said it would reconsider its
decision to deploy the missiles if substantive negotiations on
the Cyprus issue get underway or if talks on the reduction of
tension and arms, leading to demilitarization, are on track.

<HEADLINE> E.U. to Provide Mozambique With $30M for Next </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The European Union has decided
to provide Mozambique with 2,500 ECU (some 30 million U.S. Dollars)
for next year's general election in the country.
</P>
<P>
E.U. representative to Mozambique, Javier Pinuela made the
announcement in a press conference here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The E.U. assistance will account for about two-thirds of the
fund needed by the elections.
</P>
<P>
The E.U. made the decision after the Mozambican Parliament
unanimously adopted the new Election Law and the law for the
establishment of a National Electoral Commission, said Pinuela.
</P>
<P>
The new laws set rules for the presidential and parliamentary
elections and for the composition of the National Electoral
Commission in particular.
</P>
<P>
According to the new law, the number of the electoral
commission will increase from currently nine to 17.
</P>
<P>
The accord concerning the financial assistance will be signed
by the E.U. and the Mozambican government in February next year.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the E.U. member states will sign
bilateral agreements respectively with the Mozambican government
on financial assistance to the elections.
</P>
<P>
The E.U. provided some 14 million Dollars to Mozambique last
year so as to help with the local elections in 33 cities and
towns across the country in June.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Discusses U.N. Role in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council on Wednesday put the issue of Angola on the agenda in a
bid to see what role the world body is going to play in the
war-torn southwest African country.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council decided to take up the Angolan issue after
its closed-door consultations on Iraq, U.N. spokesman Manoel de
Almeida e Silva said.
</P>
<P>
The decision came as fresh fighting was raging on in the
country, killing 26 people and wounding two dozen others in
central Angola.
</P>
<P>
"There is a war," U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said on
December 14, referring to the rapidly escalating bloodshed in this
battle-scarred country. Against such a backdrop, Annan woundered
aloud whether the U.N. efforts to foster peace had come to an
unsuccessful end. "The (Security) Council soon will be obliged to
decide whether the U.N. has a role or not," he said.
</P>
<P>
Annan made the grim assessment after months of gradually
escalating fighting between the Angolan government and the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), the
two sides that have been at war for most of the part 23 years
since the nation's independence.
</P>
<P>
The two sides signed a much-vaunted peace accord in 1994, but
UNITA violated its terms by rearming its forces and retaking
territory it had ceded to government control. The rebel group
financed its operations by mining and illicit marketing of
diamonds, despite several international trade and arms embargoes
against the rebels, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Since the start of the government's offensive in early December
the fighting has centered on Bie province where UNITA has its key
bases in the towns of Bailundo and Andulo.

<HEADLINE> Annan: It's Time for Critical Thinking About Iraq Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 23 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said here on Thursday that time has come for critical
thinking about Iraq crisis.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters upon arrival to the U.N. Headquarters,
Annan said "We need to be creative, and we need to find a way
forward."
</P>
<P>
"I would hope that the divisions within the Council would be
bridged, because it is essential that we all come together and
forge the way ahead, " the U.N. chief said.
</P>
<P>
"To do that, in my judgement, will require flexibility,
compromise, and a willingness to really think creatively," he
added.
</P>
<P>
On the proposals to lift the sanctions against Iraq, Annan said
many options were coming forward. "I would hope that we are all
going to use this holiday period as a moment of reflection, to
think deeply and sincerely about what needs to be done, and that
when we come back in January, we will be coming back with fresh
ideas," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council of the United Nations began its
consultations on Iraq crisis on Monday after the end of the
U.S.-led military strikes against Iraq. The consultations focus on
U.N. sanctions against Iraq, U.N. arms inspections and the
"oil-for-food" program. Due to the sharp differences among the
Council members, no consensus is expected to be reached by the end
of this year.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Official Denies Responsibility in Valley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- A senior Ugandan official has
denied responsibility in the award of the fraudulent contract
which caused the loss of over three billion Shillings (3 million
U.S. Dollars) meant for valley dams and valley tanks in
the southwestern region.
</P>
<P>
Kezimbira Miyingo, State Minister for Agriculture in charge of
Animal Industry, made the denial at parliament Wednesday, Radio
Uganda reported in the evening.
</P>
<P>
Before the Parliamentary Committee on Agriculture which is
probing the misuse of the fund, Miyingo said his advice and
attempt to withhold the contract was overlooked by technocrats in
the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Anthony Kanyike, chairman of the committee, said
that parliament is under obligation to find out why and who was
responsible for the loss of the funds in the Ministry of
Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Previously, there were reports that millions of Dollars meant
for building valley dams and tanks in the region disappeared from
the ministry.
</P>
<P>
At present a select committee is conducting investigation into
the issue. Vice-President Specioza Kazibwe, who is also the
Minister of Agriculture, is reportedly responsible for the loss
of the money.
</P>
<P>
The valley dam scandal, coupled with the Uganda Commercial
Bank scandal, tainted the image of the ruling National Resistance
Movement and there is an increasing public outcry for checking
the rampant corruption among senior government officials.

Informatio~ister Julius Spencer said in a radio
broadcast Wednesday that the shelling was a preemptive
measure by the west African peacekeeping force ECOMOG, said
reports reaching here from Freetown, capital of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
"Everything is under control and there is no danger to the
capital," Spencer said.
</P>
<P>
The gunfire began around 4:30 a.m. and
was interrupted by an interval of around 30 minutes, before
falling silent at daybreak, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an ECOMOG officer said Wednesday that more than
1,000 Nigerian troops arrived in Freetown Tuesday as a
reinforcement to the sub-regional peacekeeping force there.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said more troops from Nigeria landed at dawn
Wednesday at Freetown's Lungi International Airport.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG forces have tightened the security on the main approach
road into the city from the east, checking frightened residents
of outlying areas who were trying to seek shelter in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Most of the shops and businesses in Freetown were reportedly
closed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chased out of Freetown by ECOMOG last February, rebels of the
deposed military junta of Major Paul Johnny Koromah have resorted
to guerrilla warfare in the north and east parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
They have also joined the rebel forces of the Revolutionary
United Front, who have been against successive Sierra Leonean
governments since early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, the rebels have pushed their activities to
areas within a radius of 60 kilometers to the capital.
</P>
<P>
Reports quoted the rebels as saying that their latest
offensive is aimed at forcing the government to the negotiating
table, but the government said it would only talk to the rebels
after they lay down their arms.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Independent Lawmaker Authorized to Form </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel Wednesday appointed an independent lawmaker to form a new
government as a previously-assigned party leader failed to get
enough support in parliament.
</P>
<P>
Demirel picked up independent Yalim Erez, the industry and
trade minister, after Bulent Ecevit, leader of the Democratic Left
Party, failed to secure a majority in parliament.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Ecevit returned the mandate to form a new government
to the president.
</P>
<P>
Demirel said he believed an independent lawmaker can obtain
wide support from Turkey's bickering political parties.
</P>
<P>
The government led by Mesut Yilmaz, who is now acting Prime
Minister, collapsed last month in a no-confidence vote growing out
of his corruption scandals.
</P>
<P>
Demirel did not appoint the leader of the largest party to form
a cabinet as such an appointment will bring the pro-Islamic Virtue
Party to power, infuriating pro-secular military.
</P>
<P>
Erez, a businessman-turned-politician, was chosen partly
because he sided with the pro-secular establishment.
</P>
<P>
Erez resigned as Industry and Trade Minister in a earlier
coalition between the center-right True Path Party led by former
Prime Minister Tansu Ciller and the pro-Islamic Welfare Party in
April 1997, two months after the military warned the government to
strictly act on the secular constitution.
</P>
<P>
After a brief meeting with Demirel, Erez said that "I am in
equal distance with all the parties in search for a new
government. I will look for compromise and dialog and will meet
with the leaders of all political parties in the parliament."
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the government I will form will win the vote
of confidence in the parliament," he added.
</P>
<P>
Erez, 54, will first face a vote of no-confidence in parliament
to determine if he can muster a majority of votes to form a
government.
</P>
<P>
Erez also said "I am conscious of the responsibility of the
assignment which the president gave me in a very period when our
country faces with very important internal and external problems."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister designate said that he will form a
"broad-based compromise government." "I believe that I will agree
with Ciller," who had said she was unhappy with Erez.

<HEADLINE> Weizman Calls for Negotiated Israel's Pullout From </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer
Weizman has asked Lebanon to conduct peaceful negotiations with
Israel on Israel's troop withdrawal from South Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Weizman made this call Wednesday afternoon during his
inspection tour of the areas in northern Israel that were hit
buy Katyusha rockets earlier in the day, according to Israel
Radio.
</P>
<P>
Israeli army said that a total of 20 to 30 Katyusha
rockets fired by Lebanese Hezbollah landed at Israel's northern
border town of Kiryat Shemona and the areas west of Galilee.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese Hezbollah fired the rockets into Israel in
retaliation for an Israeli air strike in Lebanon the day before
that killed a Lebanese mother and her six children, aged between
one and 16.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's katyusha attack injured 14 Israelis and caused
heavy property damage in Kiryat Shemona and other northern areas
of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel has to find some way out to end such shellings and the
best way is to conduct negotiations with the Lebanese government
over the issue of Israel's troop pullout from South Lebanon,
Weizman said.
</P>
<P>
Local residents of Kiryat Shemona told the radio that the town
was badly hit. The cultural center, the central bus station and
many houses were destroyed by the rockets.
</P>
<P>
"Many parents have kept their children at home Wednesday as
asked by the school authorities, otherwise, terrible things could
happen to the children if they and their schools were hit buy
rockets," one woman told the radio.
</P>
<P>
To prepare for the retaliation, Israel army has asked tens
of thousands of local residents in the north to stay home on
Wednesday. Residents of northern boder towns and villages were
instructed to stay in bomb shelters Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called an urgent meeting of
his security cabinet to discuss the attack, then flew to the
north to inspect the areas that were hit during the attack.
</P>
<P>
He urged the local residents to remain calm and promised
that the government will do everything possible to protect their
safety.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government and army have expressed their regret
over the Tuesday killing of the Lebanese civilians, particularly
the children.
</P>
<P>
Knesset (parliament) Speaker Dan Tichon even sent a condolence
massage to the Lebanese family, expressing his sorry for the loss
of lives of the family.
</P>
<P>
But Netanyahu's communication advisor David Bar-Illan called
the Hezbollah attack, the heavest one in three years, "totally
unwarranted" and warned it could lead to an escalation of war in
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Following the incident, Yossi Beilin, Knesset member from the
Labor party, renewed his call for unilateral withdrawal of the
Israeli troops out from the security zone in South Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Four Mothers, an Israeli peace group supports Israel's
pullout from South lebanon, also urged the army to withdraw
from the security zone.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up in 1985 a so-called security zone in South
lebanon. since then, local resistance groups such as Hezbollah
had been engaging in a guerrilla war against the Israeli
occupation.

LUSAKA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba Wednesday called for joint training among forces in
Africa to solve common defense problems, the Zambia National
Broadcasting Corporation (ZNBC) reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the graduation ceremony of 53 senior defense
officers at the Defense Commander Staff College, Chiluba said
joint defense training among African forces is an "ultimate"
solution to conflicts which hinder the region's economic
development.
</P>

Although the Cold War between the West and the East has ended
for many years, conflicts in the African continent seem to be
endless since new conflicts such as the escalating hostilities in
the Democratic Republic of Congo have emerged and the old ones
remain to be resolved.
</P>
<P>
"As soon as this position is taken, the lesser will be the
destruction of life and property," noted the Zambian leader.
</P>
<P>
"We must continously cooperate in joint training among our
defense forces in order to achieve common approach to common
defense problems of our region," he added.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba observed that the forces of the 14-member Southern
African Development Community (SADC) must interact more and more
in various fields of training "to enhance common knowledge and
remove areas of misunderstanding."
</P>
<P>
He also called on defense personnel to unite and cooperate so
that they can achieve stability and economic development in the
region.

<HEADLINE> Iran Passes Law to Guarantee Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Majlis (parliament)
Wednesday passed a law providing guarantees to foreign investment
in a bid to revive the ailing economy badly hit by oil prices
slump.
</P>
<P>
Under the law, the Iranian government will guarantee foreign
investments in the free industrial and trade zones against state
takeover or even in case of a nationalization drive, the
state-run television reported.
</P>
<P>
The law helps to assure foreign investors of investment
security in Iran, Secretary General of High Council of Free
Industrial and Trade Zones Morteza Alviri told the television.
</P>
<P>
Before this, he said, the Free Trade Zone Organization (FTZO)
shelters foreign investments up to a certain ceiling.
</P>
<P>
However, Alviri said in October, it is up to the government to
provide guarantees to huge foreign investments in free trade zones.
</P>
<P>
Some investors had expressed their readiness to invest over one
billion U.S. dollars in the zones, he said, meanwhile they seek
legal guarantees to their investments.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to boost the country's non-oil sectors, Iran set
up three free trade zones on the Gulf islands of Qeshm and Kish
and the port city of Chahbahar on the Gulf of Oman.
</P>
<P>
So far they failed to attract foreign investments as foreign
investors claimed they saw no guarantees for their investments in
the country.
</P>
<P>
The new law also allows operation of foreign banks and
insurance companies and permits free foreign exchange dealings
under market rates in the zones.
</P>
<P>
Iran banned foreign exchange dealings outside state banks in
1995 after the United States imposed economic sanctions on
it.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Economy Poses Challenge to Government: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe Wednesday presented the state of the nation address in
parliament, saying that the economy had posed the major challenge
to the government.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe, who presented a 19-page report outlining problems and
achievements of the ending year, told the legislators that poor
economic performance was due to low export volumes, depressed
international prices for Zimbabwe's minerals and agricultural
produce and the uncompetitiveness of locally expected to grow by 3.2 percent. T
he
sector's performance was affected by El Nino-induced drought,
which saw significant reduction in acreage under crop, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the mining sector, the value of mineral production as at
the end of August 1998 was 284 million U.S. Dollars compared to
317 million Dollars for the same period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Tourism, whose estimated contribution to GDP is eight percent,
is set to become Zimbabwe's top foreign currency earner.
</P>
<P>
Referring to foreign relations, Mugabe said the Zimbabwean
government made continued efforts to contribute vigorously to
regional and international peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
"We have supported efforts to establish a strong mechanism for
regional defense and security," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said 1998 has been a difficult year which presented
many challenges both to the government and the general populace.
However, he said, "My government is convinced that the future
holds better prospects for the nation."

measure by the west African peacekeeping force ECOMOG, said

United Front, who have been against successive Sierra Leonean
governments since early 1990s.

areas within a radius of 60 kilometers to the capital.

<HEADLINE> Turkmenistan to Resume Gas Supply to Ukraine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Turkmenistan on Wednesday
agreed to resume gas supplies to Ukraine after the two countries
reached a compromise on payment.
</P>
<P>
Turkmen President Saparmurad Niyazov announced that the supply
will start Thursday, after his meeting in Ashgabat with visiting
Ukrainian President Kuchma, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
The two heads of state signed an agreement on the supply of 20
billion cubic meters of Turkmen gas to Ukraine in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Interfax quoted Turkmen Deputy Prime Minister Batyr Sardzhayev
as saying that under a 720 million U.S. dollar contract between
the Ukrainian oil and gas company and the Turkmenistan state trade
corporation, 40 percent of the gas will be paid in hard currency
and 60 percent in goods and services.
</P>
<P>
Ashgabat had hoped to pay 50 percent of the gas in hard
currency.
</P>
<P>
"Ukraine may count on Turkmen gas supplies in the next 350
years," Niyazov told Kuchma.
</P>
<P>
He said that the explored resources of gas in Turkmenistan are
estimated at 23 trillion cubic meters. In 1999 Turkmenistan plans
to export 31 billion cubic meters of gas, of which 20 billion
cubic meters will go to Ukraine and 11 billion cubic meters to
Iran.
</P>
<P>
Another accord, on gas transit with the Russian gas giant
Gazprom, is expected to be signed in Moscow at the end of the
week, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma expressed the hope that no problems would arise in
dealing with Gazprom as Russia will only benefit from the
resumption of Turkmen gas supplies.
</P>
<P>
According to the World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund, Russia has lost 750 million dollars and Turkmenistan 1.8
billion dollars since gas supplies to Ukraine were terminated in
March 1997, Interfax said.

<HEADLINE> Top Aide: Yeltsin to Have Busy Schedule Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
plans to work very intensively next year, his chief of staff
Nikolai Bordyuzha said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Bordyuzha, head of the presidential administration and
secretary of the Security Council, said Yeltsin's doctors have
lifted all restrictions, including on foreign trips, on the
president, who have recovered from the recent bout of pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, poor health forced Yeltsin to cut short a trip to the
Central Asia and cancel visits to Austria and India.
</P>
<P>
Bordyuzha said Yeltsin would meet with the leaders of political
factions and parties, and of Russia's constituent republics.
</P>
<P>
The schedule of Yeltsin's foreign trips is being drafted, but
Yeltsin has already promised a number of foreign leaders he will
pay official visits to their countries, Bordyuzha said.
</P>
<P>
He also announced that his predecessor, Valentin Yumashev, who
was sacked by Yeltsin early December, had been appointed the
president's advisor.
</P>
<P>
"For me it's very important to discuss things with Yumashev,
given his experience and lengthy work with the president,"
Interfax quoted Bordyuzha as saying.

<HEADLINE> Nigerians Asked to Brace up for Difficult </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's economy faces a
"bleak" future following the crash at the international oil
market, the counry's Minister of State for Finance Wilson
Etuk-Udo warned Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Federal Accounts Allocation Committee (FAAC)
meeting in capital Abuja, the minister described the revenue
prospects for next year as "hazy" because the price of crude oil
is unpredictable at present.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting which is part of the on-going meeting of the
Federal Executive Council (FEC), he said next year's budget would
focus on priority programs and projects as well as on-going
projects, especially those in the final stages of completion.
</P>
<P>
Etuk-Udo stressed the need for fiscal discipline in consonance
with the dwindling national revenue with the federation account
receiving 30 billion Naira (86 Naira equal to one U.S. Dollar),
less than the 284 billion Naira projected.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is the sixth largest oil producing country in the
world with a daily export of about two million barrels of crude
oil and some 90 percent of its foreign exchange earnings depends
on oil export.
</P>
<P>
The country's 1998 budget is based on 17 U.S. Dollars per
barrel of crude oil but the actual price declined to less than 12
Dollars per barrel for the past 11 months.
</P>
<P>
The effect of the reduced resource to the federation account
which provides the funding for the three tiers of governments in
the country are that allocations have been drastically cut in
line with revenue, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The federal government received only 126 billion Naira for
1998 instead of 138 billion Naira while the 36 states and capital
Abuja received about 66 billion Naira instead of 68 billion Naira
for the year.
</P>
<P>
Local government councils received about 5 billion Naira less
than the 56 billion Naira projected for the year of 1998, the
minister told the meeting.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the only good news is the inflation rate
which stands at 6.6 percent instead of nine percent projected for
the year while interest rate remains stable throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
At the two-day FEC meeting expected to end Wednesday,
ministers and senior government officials discussed next year's
budget, the privatization of some government-owned companies, the
dual exchange rate and Monday's price increase of petroleum
products.

<HEADLINE> Four European Satellite Makers to Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Four European groups which
produce satellites, the GEC of Britain, the Lagardere of France,
DASA of Germany and Alenia of Italy, signed an agreement on
allying their satellite making activities on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The merger will create an 18 billion franc (3.1 billion U.S.
dollars) group, which will be Europe's largest and the world's
third largest in satellite industry.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the agreement, which was announced in October,
was delayed by hesitation of GEC over the strategy of the alliance
in the past several weeks.
</P>
<P>
GEC holds 49 percent of the stocks of Matra Haute Technologies
company, which is under the Matra Marconi Space (MMC) of the
Lagardere group.
</P>
<P>
The MMC had negotiated with DASA, which is owned by
Daimler-Chrysler, and Alenia, which is affiliate to the Italian
public group Finmeccanica, on a rapprochement of their space
industry activities.
</P>
<P>
The four groups said in a common communique that the merger
will be carried out in 1999 when a final agreement will be signed
and the European Union will give its approval to the merger.
</P>
<P>
The agreement signed on Wednesday covers the conditions and
terms for the merger under the reservation of future approval on
social terms and corresponding rules for the future group.

<HEADLINE> Mergers Announced on Road to Pan-European Aerospace Giant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Daimler-Chrysler
Aerospace AG (Dasa), Britain's GEC, France's Lagardere and Italy's
Finmeccanica Wednesday announced plans to merge their aerospace
sectors on the road to a pan-European aerospace giant.
</P>
<P>
The companies involved signed agreements in principle cementing
the plans at their respective headquarters Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"This will be the first truly multinational, European concern
in this area," but no agreement has been reached on a name or on
where it will have its headquarters, according to a Dasa spokesman
in Munich.
</P>
<P>
The activities of the new concern would be in the areas of
satellite production, global observation, telecommunications,
navigation systems, multi-media launch systems, rockets and space
technology.
</P>
<P>
This would put it in third place worldwide behind U.S.
aerospace rivals Lockheed Martin and Boeing-Rockwell. It would
take second place in satellite technology.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Calls for End to Hostilities in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council Wednesday issued a presidential statement, calling for "an
immediate cessation of hostilities," and urging the rebel UNITA to
"comply immediately and without conditions with its obligations"
to save the long-stalled peace process in the African country.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council deplores the serious deterioration of the
situation in Angola and calls for an immediate cessation of
hostilities," the presidential statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council demands that UNITA comply immediately and
without conditions with its obligations and reiterates that only a
political settlement, on the basis of the relevant agreements and
resolutions, will bring a lasting peace on Angola," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the statement urged the Government of Angola and
UNITA to cooperate with the special representative of the U.N.
Secretary-General, Issa Diallo, including by facilitating his
contacts with all those key to reviving the stalled peace process
and to implementing the Lusaka Protocol, signed in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The statement stressed that "the primary responsibility for
the failure to achieve peace in Angola clearly lies with the
leadership" of UNITA, short form for the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council issued the presidential statement
shortly after fresh fighting was raging on in central Angola,
killing 26 people and wounding two dozens others.
</P>
<P>
Two sides signed a much-vaunted peace accord in 1994, but
UNITA violated its terms by rearming its forces and retaking
territory it had ceded to government control. The rebel group
financed its operations by mining and illicit marketing of
diamonds, despite several international trade and arms embargoes
against the rebels, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Since the start of the government's offensive in early
December, the fighting has centered on Bie province where UNITA
has its key bases in the towns of Bailundo and Andulo.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan Government and UNITA have been at war for most of
the past 23 years since the nation's independence in 1975.
