<P>
ANKARA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel Wednesday heaped praises on the great achievements China
has made since it carried out its economic reform and open-door
policy in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Demirel made the remarks in his meeting with Chinese Defense
Minister Chi Haotian, who arrived here on Tuesday for a six-day
friendly and official visit to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
He said China is attracting the great attention of the world,

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Queen Visits Lebanon on Anti-mine Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's Queen Noor arrived
here Wednesday to start her first official visit to Lebanon on a
global anti-landmine mission.
</P>
<P>
Noor, the widow of Jordan's late King Hussein, held talks with
Lebanese President Emile Lahoud on bilateral ties which have
soured due to Amman's signing of a peace treaty with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon is officially at war with Israel, which set up a
self-declared security zone in south Lebanon to allegedly protect
its north from Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries began to improve after
Lahoud and Jordan's new King Abdullah exchanged visits in May
and last month respectively.
</P>
<P>
During her two-day visit, the queen will witness the defusing
of land mines in Lebanon's mountainous area Souk Gharb, one of
the bloodiest fronts in the country's 1975-1990 civil war.
</P>
<P>
The American-born Noor, who is visiting Lebanon as her
capacity as patron of the Washington-based Landmine Survivors
Network, took over the post after the death of Diana, British
Princess of Wales.
</P>
<P>
She will also accompany Lebanese First Lady Andre Lahoud at
the inauguration of a fair at the American of University of
Beirut.

<HEADLINE> COMESA Members Urged to Increase Efficiency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- There is need for Common Market
for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) member states to increase
efficiency and diversify export bases if they are to survive and
grow, COMESA Secretary-General Erastus Mwencha said.
</P>
<P>
Inefficiency fuelled by heavy external borrowing has led to
negative growth and deteriorating current accounts in many
developing countries, Mwencha said at the official opening of the
conference on "COMESA Toward 2000 -- Regional Integration in
Africa: Business and Industry Interface" in Lusaka on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general said that many firms face a severe test
in the new environment of liberalization and globalization.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the declining importance of primary
commodities worldwide which are the main source of export revenue
has also continued to worsen the terms of trade.
</P>
<P>
Mwencha urged all member states take advantage of a COMESA free
trade area to enhance competition and efficiency in the allocation
of resources through the market mechanism.
</P>
<P>
He said the COMESA free trade area, scheduled for October 31,
2000, which is a gateway to integrating small markets into the
competitive global economy would create a unified economic space
enabling gains in efficiency.
</P>
<P>
The free trade area would also act as an engine of growth
through increased investment from both within and outside the
region.
</P>
<P>
Mwencha observed that the rapid use of the internet in business
is on the increase and is also a challenge to the entire region.
</P>
<P>
Electronic commerce is now 112 billion U.S. dollars per annum
worldwide, he noted.
</P>
<P>
It is forecast that by the year 2002 the value of electronic
commerce will have grown by 200 to 350 percent to 350-500 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mwencha also bemoaned the issue of taxation, saying
that it must ensure neutrality between electronic and traditional
forms of commerce.
</P>
<P>
The rules should be certain and transparent in respect of
electronic commerce so that the business community can anticipate
the tax consequences of their electronic transactions.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Fund Mozambican Private Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican private companies may
get 100 to 200 million U.S. dollars from the U.S. Export-Import
Bank, the chairman of the bank said in Maputo Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the bank's board of directors, James Harmon, said
that the U. S. government is granting loans for Mozambican private
companies to buy from the United States such goods as raw
materials, services and other essentials they need in their
business.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that during this first stage, all funding is
going to the private sector and his bank's main support will go to
small- and medium- size private companies.
</P>
<P>
But later, depending on the final outcome of negotiations with
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to write off the total
Mozambican foreign debt, the U.S. bank may also fund the public
sector, Harmon added.
</P>
<P>
Export-Import Bank is a U.S. government agency created to help
finance exports of U.S. goods and services to developing countries
around the world.
</P>
<P>
For the coming year, the bank is to grant about one billion
dollars for support to companies in sub-Saharan Africa, the
Mozambique News Agency quoted the banker as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique is the last stop of Harmon's 12-day tour of four
African countries, which also took him to Ghana, Nigeria and South
Africa.

<HEADLINE> British PM Says Ban On French Meat "Illegal" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- UK Prime Minister Tony Blair
said Wednesday a ban on French produce would be "illegal and
stupid" as Britain did 320 million pounds worth of business with
Europe every day.
</P>
<P>
Blair told members of parliament that the UK did not want a
"tit for tat war" with France over beef as it would hit trade.
</P>
<P>
Conservative leader William Hague challenged Blair to stick up
for British interests by banning French meat in response to
reports that French animals had been fed on sewage sludge.
</P>
<P>
Hague said the government was not working in the interests of
the British public and knew of animal feed contamination early in
June.
</P>
<P>
Blair said the dispute should be solved in a mature way and a
trade war with France would be "suicidal" for British interests.

<HEADLINE> Annan Outlines Measures to Help Guinea-Bissau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 27 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Wednesday put forward several measures aimed at
promoting the peace process in Guinea-Bissau and neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
In his new letter to the president of the U.N. Security
Council, Annan reported on the results of a recent mission to
Guinea-Bissau which determined that the situation along its
borders with Guinea and Senegal is tenuous.
</P>
<P>
The mission recommended the deployment of approximately 200
military observers to these border areas, a U.N. spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Annan said he is keeping this option under review, and in the
meantime, he outlines a number of steps geared towards sending a
signal that the international community will be closely watching
Guinea-Bissau's electoral process, set to culminate with
legislative and presidential elections on November 28.
</P>
<P>
The measures include having his special representative visit
Senegal and Guinea to encourage them to set up joint monitoring
mechanisms with Guinea-Bissau along their common borders.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief will also request the U.N. Peace-Building
Support Office in Guinea-Bissau to facilitate visits by diplomats
and U.N. officials throughout the country in advance of the
elections, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
After reviewing these interim measures, Annan will revert to
the Security Council on the proposed military observers if
necessary, the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Late Ugandan Leader Hailed As Liberation Fighter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni hailed late vice-president Samson Kisekka as a great
liberation fighter of the National Resistance Movement.
</P>
<P>
The president made the comments while signing a condolence book
here Wednesday, Radio Uganda reported.
</P>
<P>
As the external coordinator of the National Resistance Movement
in the early 1980s, Kisekka contributed tremendously to the
liberation struggle of the movement and his death is regarded as a
great loss to the ruling party, Museveni said.
</P>
<P>
Kisekka was also a dedicated member of the movement who worked
tirelessly for the Ugandan people. He would be remembered by all
the people in the country, the president added.
</P>
<P>
Kisekka died of pneumonia and heart attack in a London hospital
Monday morning. His body would be flown home Friday and the
government is arranging a state funeral for the later
vice-president.
</P>
<P>
Uganda declared a period of national mourning and all flags fly
at half- mast until his burial. Kisekka, aged 87, used to be
Uganda's prime minister (1986-1989), vice-president (1991-1994)
and he was later appointed senior presidential adviser, a post he
held until his death.
</P>
<P>
Kisekka was survived by his wife Mary Kisekka and 15 children.

<HEADLINE> Annan Lauds UNFPA for Great Achievement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 27 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Wednesday said that the United Nations Population Fund
(UNFPA) has built its success on three pillars: good information,
good program and good understanding.
</P>
<P>
The statement came in Annan's remarks to the General Assembly
on the occasion of the commemoration of the 30th anniversary of
the UNFPA. The remarks were delivered on Annan's behalf by UNFPA
Executive Director Nafis Sadik.
</P>
<P>
"Thirty years have also brought a long record of achievement,"
he said. "The success has been built on three pillars: good
information, good program and good understanding."
</P>
<P>
When the UNFPA started work, most developing countries had only
rudimentary systems for collecting and analyzing population data
as a basis for policy. The UNFPA has worked with the Population
Division and the Statistical Unit of the United Nations to build a
national statistical office, take censuses, make projections and
disseminate reliable data, he said.
</P>
<P>
"This has meant significant increases in national capacities to
plan ahead, to incorporate population policies into development
planning and to take sound economic and social decisions," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The UNFPA has also been a close partner in helping
developing countries put in place effective programs for
voluntary family planning and integrated reproductive health
programs," he said.
</P>
<P>
The UNFPA success "has meant better care for children, more
choices for women, decreased pressure on the environment, slower,
more balanced population growth and better living standards in
general," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The success of UNFPA is also a success for United Nations
process: the painstaking work of debating proposals, airing
differences and, finally, achieving political consensus," he said.
"This is the harmonizing role of the United Nations as envisaged
in its founding Charter."
</P>
<P>
"All member states, and all parts of the United Nations
systems, have contributed," he said. "The UNFPA has been very
effective in forming alliances within better use of resources."
</P>
<P>
Established in 1969, the UNFPA is the largest multilateral
source of population assistance to developing countries.

ANKARA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit said here on Wednesday that Turkey attaches great
importance to developing friendly and cooperative ties in all
fields with China.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with visiting Chinese Defense Minister Chi
Haotian, Ecevit said Turkey respects the independence, sovereignty
and territorial integrity of China, and opposes any separatist and
terrorist activities.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral ties, he said Turkey and China enjoy good
relations in the political, economic, trade, cultural and defense
fields.

The Turkish prime minister also said the friendly and
cooperative ties not only accord with the basic interests of the
two peoples, but also benefit the common development of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Chi said that since the establishment of
diplomatic ties in 1971, the two countries have developed friendly
and cooperative relations in a stable way, adding Beijing and
Ankara have made great achievements in political, economic and
cultural fields.
</P>
<P>
He added that friendly cooperation of the two peoples have not
only brought about a lot of interests to the two sides, but also
played a positive role in establishing peace and stability in Asia

<HEADLINE> Sudanese Opposition Leader Praises Egyptian-Libyan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 27 (mena) -- A visiting Sudanese opposition
leader on Wednesday praised the Egyptian-Libyan peace initiative
as a framework for the realization of peace in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian-Libyan peace plan is "the only comprehensive
framework designed to help end the civil strife in Sudan," said Al
Sadeq al Mahdi, a leading member of the National Democratic
Alliance (NDA).
</P>
<P>
The NDA is the umbrella group of the northern Muslim opposition
parties and the southern rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army
(SPLA).
</P>
<P>
The northern political parties want to share power with Sudan's
Islamic government while the SPLA has been fighting since 1983 for
greater autonomy for the mostly Christian south, Egypt's Middle
East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The 16-year-old civil war and the ensuing famine have claimed
nearly 2 million lives in the poor African state.
</P>
<P>
Egypt that lies on the lower reaches of the Nile River has been
making efforts to help achieve national reconciliation in Sudan
because it fears the war in the state that is located on the upper
reaches can block the smooth flow of the water.
</P>
<P>
"What is important about the initiative is that it has placed
the future of rule in Sudan on the agenda of discussions," said al
Mahdi.
</P>
<P>
In August, Egypt and Libya initiated a five-point peace plan,
including calls for a permanent cease-fire and a preparatory
meeting on a comprehensive peace conference for Sudan. The
Sudanese government and the Muslim opposition parties have
accepted the initiative.
</P>
<P>
But the SPLA rejected the plan, saying that it favored the role
played by the Eastern African Inter-Governmental Authority on
Development in mediating a solution to its war with the government.
</P>
<P>
Al Mahdi defended SPLA leader John Garang as pro-unity, saying
that "some of his supporters are not so."
</P>
<P>
The SPLA is believed to be keen on safeguarding the unity of
Sudan, he said.

<HEADLINE> ELN Kidnaps Reuters Photographer in Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Photographer Henry
Romero of Reuters has been kidnapped by the National Liberation
Army (ELN) of Colombia, said a spokesman from the rebel group
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The photographer was captured Tuesday, when he met with a group
of parents of 28 people kidnapped by the ELN after they were taken
from a church in Cali.
</P>
<P>
The families attended a meeting with the commanders of the Jose
Maria Becerra front of the ELN, responsible for the kidnapping in
May, of over 160 worshippers from the La Maria church, the
majority of whom were released.
</P>
<P>
Commandant Carlos told a local radio station that the
photographer is "retained indefinitely" and that his liberation
depends on the measure in which some information is cleared up.
</P>
<P>
It seems that the cause of the kidnapping is related to
photographs taken by the photographer of a group of 34 kidnapped
people, from the aforementioned church, only a few days after the
kidnapping took place. The face of Jose Maria Becerra, one of the
rebel leaders, appeared in the photoes.
</P>
<P>
ELN is the second largest rebel group in Colombia.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Turkey will sign an agreement
for emergency aid within the framework of the Black Sea Economic
Cooperation (BSEC), Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Cem made the statement at a joint press conference after the
first BSEC council foreign ministers' meeting in the northern
Greek city of Thessaloniki, the Macedonian Press Agency (MPA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
He voiced satisfaction for the help offered to Turkey after the
earthquake last August and the sensitivity displayed by the BSEC
countries.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed the importance and the contribution of
the BSEC activities toward safeguarding stability in the Balkan
region, adding that from this point of view Turkey supports the
goals of the stability pact.
</P>
<P>
Cem said that the strengthening of BSEC will contribute to the
safeguarding of stability in the region of Eurasia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou Wednesday
stated that Greece's BSEC presidency is a quality step forward
that will strengthen the organization's international presence.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the organization's present operation must be
safeguarded as it offers the opportunity for communication and
cooperation to the countries, which under different circumstances
will not have that chance.
</P>
<P>
As for the new members of the organization, Papandreou said
that BSEC's Moldovan presidency will start preparatory talks with
Macedonia, Uzbekistan and Iran for their membership, but
Yugoslavia's prospect of its accession lays in the future like its
entry into the European Union.

<HEADLINE> AL Reiterates Call for Halt to U.S. Attack on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General
Esmat Abdel-Meguid on Wednesday reiterated a call on both Britain
and the United States to stop air strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The British and U.S. attacks on Iraqi sites "obviously violate
the international law and tamper with the sovereignty" of the
country, Abdel-Meguid said after meeting with the "Mariam Convoy"
for solidarity with the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
The "Mariam Convoy," led by George Gallowy, deputy chairman of
the Foreign Affairs Committee of the British House of Commons
(lower house), arrived in Cairo on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It was named after an Iraqi girl, who developed cancer after
ingesting the air polluted with advanced weapons used by the
U.S.-led coalition forces in the 1991 Gulf War against Iraqi
occupation of Kuwait in 1990. Iraq has since been under crippling
U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid said the attacks will torpedo the efforts being
exerted at the U.N. Security Council to hammer out a proper
formula on the resumption of cooperation between Iraq and the U.N.
</P>
<P>
He called on the Security Council's permanent members to
undertake their responsibilities towards Iraq, urging them to
reiterate their commitment to maintaining the sovereignty and
security of the Iraqi territories.
</P>
<P>
Since last December's four-night air strikes, the U.S. and
British warplanes enforing the no-fly zones over northern and
southern Iraq have been bombing Iraqi military and civilian
targets, causing heavy casualties and property losses.
</P>
<P>
The "Mariam Convoy" has visited France, Spain, Morocco,
Tunisia, Libya, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates and Iraq ends the
tour.

<P>
MOSCOW, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Russia failed to launch a
communication satellite Wednesday, reported Russian media.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Proton booster-rocket with the communication
satellite Express-A1 went out of the control of ground command and
measuring systems when it was moving to the working orbit, said
the telemetric information monitoring division of the Khrunichev
space center.
</P>
<P>
The satellite Express-A1 was launched from Kazakhstan's
Baikonur space center at 8:16 p.m. Moscow time (1616 GMT) aboard
the Proton-K booster rocket, said the press service of the Russian
Strategic Missile Force.
</P>
<P>
None of the three stages of the booster-rocket had been worked
out. The space test and control center of the Defense Ministry has
set up a commission to analyze the situation. No technical causes
of the emergency have been named so far.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The 49th annual Miss Universe
pageant will take place in Cyprus on May 19 next year, Cyprus
Commerce, Industry and Tourism Minister Nicos Rolandis announced
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Rolandis said the cost of the
event is estimated at nearly 2.5 million Cyprus pounds (5 million
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
He said the hosting of the event is like a "homecoming of
mythology, legend and history", since the goddess of beauty
Aphrodite was born off Cyprus' shores, according to the legend.
</P>
<P>
Aphrodite, the goddess of love and beauty, is said to
have been born near Paphos, on the western coast of Cyprus,
and was famous for her many love affairs with the gods and
the mortals.
</P>
<P>
According to Rolandis, the winner of Miss Universe pageant
will be given a golden apple which symbolizes the ultimate
beauty.
</P>
<P>
The contest will take place at 04:00 a.m. local time at a
sports center in Nicosia and will be broadcast live by the
American TV network CBS to more than 100 countries with an
estimated audience of 300 million.
</P>
<P>
Rolandis said during their three-week stay in Cyprus, 85
representatives from an equal number of participating countries
will have the chance to attend a variety of functions relating to
the history and culture of this Eastern Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
The minister said Miss Turkey has also been invited to
participate.

<HEADLINE> Lithuania's Government Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Lithuania's Prime Minister
Rolandas Paksas and his Cabinet resigned Wednesday over a dispute
about a planned deal to put a U.S. company in control of the
Baltic country's oil sector.
</P>
<P>
President Valdas Adamkus, who had shortened a visit to Canada
because of the dispute and supports the privatization, immediately
accepted the resignation of Paksas, who had been arguing that the
terms run against national interests and refused to sign the
projected agreement. Thus, Paksas's six-month-old government left
office automatically.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Adamkus appointed Labor and Social Welfare
Minister Irena Degutiene as acting premier until a new government
is formed, probably without having to resort to new elections.
</P>
<P>
Under the planned deal which had been approved by the
parliamentary majority and most of the government ministers, U.S.
Williams International Company (WIC) would own 51 percent of
stakes in the Mazeikiai Oil Refinery and its subsidiaries, the
largest oil enterprise of Lithuania.
</P>
<P>
WIC would receive 650 million U.S. dollars as loans and has
been demanding that Lithuania put 350 million dollars into the
refinery's circulating capital.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, LUKOIL, the largest Russian oil company, had offered
Lithuania guarantees for the delivery of 6 million tons of oil a
year on condition that the Russian company would be an equal
partner with Lithuania in running the Mazeikiu refinery.
</P>
<P>
When Vilnius did not respond to Moscow's proposal and legalized
the transfer of a 51 percent share package to WIC, LUKOIL withdrew
its offer.
</P>
<P>
On October 19, President Valdas Adamkus accepted the
resignation of Economics Minister Eugenijus Maldeikis and Finance
Minister Jonas Lionginas, who voted along with Prime Minister
Rolandas Paksas against signing the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Paksas had been expected to resign since his surprise
announcement last week that he opposed the controversial sale of
state-owned oil concern Mazheikiu Nafta to U.S. energy group
Williams, saying it would place too great a financial burden on
the small Baltic nation and endanger a new agreement with the
International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
This put him into direct conflict with Adamkus and Paksas's own
Conservatives, both supporting the sale.
</P>
<P>
"I disapprove of the contract and the terms of the deal as it
is now. I do not want and cannot be responsible for the
consequences of this decision," Paksas told a news conference
after his resignation.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the documents on the deal, which has been over
18 months in the making, were ready to be signed in final.
</P>
<P>
Paksas, 42, a former mayor of Vilnius, was appointed to head
the government in May after his predecessor Gediminas Vagnorius
resigned amid waning public support for the Williams deal and a
largely personal row with the president.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Paksas's resignation would not necessarily mean
the end of the Williams deal, despite fierce criticism in the
press, since it still has strong political support.

<HEADLINE> Greek, Turkish Foreign Ministers Meet in Thessaloniki </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The foreign ministers of Greece
and Turkey Wednesday voiced their satisfaction with the progress
made in the talks between senior foreign ministry officials of the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting on the sidelines of a Black Sea Economic
Cooperation pact foreign ministers conference in the northern
Greek city of Thessaloniki, Greek Foreign Minister George
Papandreou and his Turkish counterpart, Ismail Cem, agreed that
positive steps have been made and the two sides appear determined
to advance the process of Greek-Turkish dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou said both he and Cem are satisfied with the course
of these discussions and this is an indication that there are many
sectors of common interest which could conclude in agreements.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both NATO members, have nearly gone to war
three times in the past 25 years because of their disputes in the
eastern Aegean Sea and on the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, the two neighboring countries have taken some
steps to improve their strained relations.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials of the two foreign ministries ended a third
round of talks in Athens Tuesday night during which they exchanged
draft agreements that will be finalized in November in Ankara and
Athens.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Cem said that Turkey has not received
any proposal for a meeting of its Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit
with his Greek counterpart, Costas Simitis, to be held in the
presence of U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
On Turkey's European Union (EU) membership, the minister said
that his country is aware that as soon as it acquires the EU
candidate state status, it should follow the necessary procedures.
</P>
<P>
Greece, along with some EU members, says that Turkey cannot
join the EU before it improves its human rights record and
relations with Athens.

<TEXT>
<P>
There were conflicting reports about the state of Sarkisian.
While the independent TV company A1Plus said he was killed in the
shoot-out in the parliament building, however the Armenian embassy
in Moscow said the prime minister was only wounded and being
treated at hospital, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin called for "resolutely fighting all manifestations of
terrorism anywhere in the world and emphasized Russia's
preparedness to cooperate closely with all interested parties in
this fight," his deputy chief of staff Sergei Prikhodko said.
</P>
<P>
In Tbilisi, President Edward Sheverdnadze of neighboring
Georgia expressed grave concern over the shoot-out earlier
Wednesday, saying he is confident that Armenian people would be
able to maintain their country's stability.
</P>
<P>
Several people died in the attack, believed to be staged by
three to four gunmen, Interfax said, quoting Armenian law
enforcement sources.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen are reportedly keeping about 150 people, including
the lawmakers, hostage.
</P>
<P>
The parliament building has been sealed off and army units are
moving toward Yerevan, Interfax said, citing sources.

<HEADLINE> Depreciation Risk Falls In Emerging Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- An "index of vulnerability"
developed to help identify the emerging market currencies
vulnerable to devaluation suggests that the depreciation risk has
fallen significantly since late 1997.
</P>
<P>
The devaluation risk is lower because economic policies have
improved, external positions are stronger and there is less
dependence on volatile short-term debt, London-based American
Express Bank said.
</P>
<P>
According to its Economics for Investment, the economics and
finance publication released Wednesday, of major currencies, the
most vulnerable are the Argentine peso, the South African rand,
the Brazilian real, and the Egyptian pound.
</P>
<P>
The vulnerability scores in Asia have improved the most because
low inflation has ensured that significant competitive gains have
been retained following the currency declines in 1997/98, it said.
</P>
<P>
Latin America is more vulnerable than Asia because the
dependence of foreign capital is much greater, and it is more
difficult to push through fiscal and structural reforms, it added.
</P>
<P>
The bank also said in Economics for Investment that fixed
exchange rates and poor liquidity in Africa, Eastern Europe and
Middle East increase vulnerability.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Returns to Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia is expected to have
a 4-percent real GDP growth in 1999, after declining to 1 percent
in 1997 and 1998, according to a government report on fiscal
reforms for the quarterly monitoring meeting of the donor
countries.
</P>
<P>
"1999 is the year of a return to economic growth and
macroeconomic stability," the report of the Ministry of Economy
and Finance said.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Hun Sen also said in his closing address at a
Donor Monitoring Meeting Wednesday that "in economic and fiscal
reforms, we have made steps forward to remove impediments and
difficulties, which hinder this intertwined reform process."
</P>
<P>
"Having implemented these programs and based on the
macroeconomic performance in the first nine months of 1999, we are
confident that the Cambodian economy has rebounded and real GDP
growth would be at least 4 percent as forecast," he added.
</P>
<P>
The real GDP growth is based on several factors, such as
agriculture which is forecast to grow 3.8 percent, manufacturing
which is expected to increase 3.7 percent and services which will
climb 4.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
During the first nine months of 1999, visitor arrivals
increased by 26 percent over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The inflation is expected to decline from 12.6 percent in 1998
to 6 percent or even lower in 1999. The three-month moving
average inflation rate dropped from 11 percent in January to 2
percent in September 1999.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate will be stabilized within the range of 3,800
to 3,850 riels per U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months of 1999, revenue from the value-added
tax (VAT) represented 96 percent of the budgetary targets. It
accounted for 62 percent of the total domestic tax revenue
collected in the first nine months of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, timber royalties increased by 7 percent compared with
the same period of last year, which reflected the efficacy and the
soundness of the government forest policy, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report, however, put forward three vital conditions to
ensure the success and maintain the momentum of the reforms: hard
work and discipline, sustainable actions and good governance.

deadline before deciding on the FA Cup draw format.
</P>
<P>
Manchester United have until Saturday evening's second round
draw to decide on their participation in this season's competition.
</P>
<P>
And the FA will then select one of several options to allow the
Cup to continue without interruption.
</P>
<P>
"We have a number of options in mind as to how the draw will
take place depending on whether Manchester United are in the FA
Cup this year or not," FA spokesman Adrian Bevington said.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, we have set a deadline of this weekend and we will
await a final decision before announcing the plans."
</P>
<P>
But Minister of Sport, Kate Hoey, has denied any involvement in
a negotiated deal to bring United back into the competition.
</P>
<P>
"We haven't been involved with any negotiations since the offer
was made by the FA," a spokesman for the Minister for Sport said.
</P>
<P>
"It remains our position that we would like to see Manchester
United compete in the FA Cup but we have not been directly
involved.We will leave the FA and United to sort it out.
</P>
<P>
"From (Prime Minister) Tony Blair to (Secretary of State for

said we would love to see United play in the FA Cup. But it is up
to United and the FA to find a solution.
</P>
<P>
"We have not been in direct contact with United for some time.
The last time was probably the Charity Shield when Kate sat next

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- John Gregory has accused
referees of acting "almost like policemen" and fourth officials of
being "jobsworths" after losing his appeal against a Football
Association fine.
</P>
<P>
Aston Villa boss Gregory was hoping a three-man FA disciplinary
commission would overturn a 2,000 pounds fine handed out after
fourth official Jeff Winter had reported him for comments aimed at
referee Uriah Rennie at Newcastle in August. But they threw out
his appeal after a 50-minute hearing at St Andrews and also
ordered Gregory to pay the costs.
</P>
<P>
It left the Villa chief, who admitted to calling Rennie an"
idiot", feeling disappointed but unrepentant. He said: "The fine
was totally unjust and excessive because every manager in the
country utters words which are directed at referees every week."

<HEADLINE> Countries Give Due Priority to Reproductive Health Care, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The president of the
54th General Assembly (GA) session, Theo-Ben Gurirab, Wednesday
said that countries can now give due priority to reproductive
health care, including family planning, as part of an integrated
health care system.
</P>
<P>
Gurirab made the statement at the General Assembly on the
occasion of the commemoration of the 30th anniversary of the
operations of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA).
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the work by the UNFPA over the past three decades,
"today, it is possible to acknowledge population growth as a
factor influencing development," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Moreover, countries can deal with population increase together
with emerging demographic issues, such as migration and ageing, as
part of an integrated population policy," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Countries can now give due priority to reproductive health
care, including family planning, as part of an integrated health
care systems; to education for women and girls as part of an
integrated education service; and to gender issues in all aspects
of development policy," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Today, countries can allocate the needed resources to these
and other aspects of social development, without risking public
criticism for misappropriating funds and resources," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Today, we have a clear idea of what our social development
goals are, and what it will take in the form of national and
international resources to achieve them," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the question of resources, he said, "It is important to
recognize those private foundations, which have given so
generously to promote international population and development
goals."
</P>
<P>
He also spokely highly of the performance of Dr. Nafis Sadik,
executive director of the UNFPA, saying she "has earned a global
reputation as an untiring crusader for international understanding
and support for population, particularly as regards gender
equality."
</P>
<P>
"She is known for her strong views and her forthright way of
expressing them," he said. "At the same time, she has earned
respect and admiration as a diplomat and consensus-builder."
</P>
<P>
"The historic 1994 Cairo International Conference on Population
and Development was a watershed and pathfinder for a new
approach," he said. "The gathering itself was unprecedented, while
the decisions and final Program of Action opened up new
opportunities for integrated strategies for Governments and
citizens of the world."
</P>
<P>
Established in 1969 at the initiative of the General Assembly,
the UNFPA is the largest multilateral source of population
assistance to developing countries.

<HEADLINE> Israeli State Budget Passes First Reading in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli government's
state budget for the year 2000 passed its first reading in the
Knesset (parliament) Wednesday afternoon with a vote of 54 pros
and 33 cons.
</P>
<P>
The budget, together with the budget proposals, was presented
to the Knesset on Tuesday by Finance Minister Avraham Shochat.
</P>
<P>
During the two day debate, Knesset members from the opposition
parties such as Likud attacked the government's economic policy,
saying the budget allocations are not reasonable, which could not
help solve the country's economic problems.
</P>
<P>
The coalition partner Shas, which has 17 Knesset members and
threatened to vote against the budget, changed its mind during the
voting.
</P>
<P>
"We are not totally satisfied with the budget allocations,
particularly that to the welfare sector, but the party decided to
support it because some changes could be made in the budget before
the second and the third readings," Shas's Labor and Social
Affairs Minister Eli Yishai said before voting.
</P>
<P>
The new budget, totalling 227.426 billion shekels (about
54.149 billion U.S. dollars), calls for reduced unemployment
benefits, higher national health insurance premiums and national
insurance payments for the rich and more tax collection.
</P>
<P>
On the bright side, the government plans to increase
expenditure on infrastructure to 190.47 million U.S. dollars in
2000 from this year's 119 million.
</P>
<P>
Transfer payments, which include welfare and other benefits,
constitute 30.7 percent of the budget, debt servicing accounts
for 28.8 percent, security for 17.9 percent, civil expenditure
16.2 percent and investment 6.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The budget shortfall for 2000 is projected at 2.476 billion
dollars, which is slated to be made up from the sale of government
companies and banks, loans and capital to be raised abroad and
other loans from the Israeli public.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry will amend some allocations after
consultations with different ministries before the second and
third readings.

<HEADLINE> World's Top Two Female Runners to Meet in London Marathon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Believe it or not, the London
Marathon will make a stir next year when it hosts one of the most
anticipated head to head clashes between the world's current top
two female marathoners -- Joyce Chepchumba and Tegla Loroupe.
</P>
<P>
Chepchumba, the current London Marathon champion, is the holder
of the marathon women-only world best and Loroupe is the fastest
woman ever over the marathon distance in a mixed race.
</P>
<P>
Chepchumba's winning time of two hours 23 minutes and 22
seconds in London this year set a new women-only world best on an
approved course. Loroupe, on the other hand, has run the fastest
ever time by a woman of 2:20:43 in a mixed race with the
assistance of male pacemakers.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan pair have an enormous amount of experience of big
city marathon racing and winning, but they have never run against
each other in London, the only city that men's and women's runners
are not competed in mixed race.
</P>
<P>
Chepchumba said at a press conference here Wednesday afternoon:
"Loroupe and I are good friends, we trained together and we are
happy to run together in London."
</P>
<P>
Chepchumba, fresh from a gusty victory in Chicago on Sunday
when she came back from a nasty fall to win by just one second in
two hours 25 minutes and 59 seconds, noted that her experience in
London would not give her any advantage over Loroupe.
</P>
<P>
However, Loroupe joked that Chepchumba might know the shortcuts
in London streets to win next year.
</P>
<P>
No matter who wins, the organiser sand marathon fans would have
a high time on April 16.
</P>
<P>
"Without any doubt, having both Joyce and Tegla running London
next April is a major coup for our race. They currently top every
marathon's list of most sought after athletes and we are delighted
they have chosen to run here," said Dave Bedford, international
race director and head of marketing for the London Marathon.
</P>
<P>
"We also believe that a true competitive race without the
assistance of male pacemakers will settle the question as to which
athlete can run the fastest time relying on their own skills alone,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
The London Marathon is actively supporting a worldwide drive to
get the world athletics governing body IAAF to recognise marathon
world bests as world records.
</P>
<P>
In line with this proposal, it is also supporting that one of
the established standards would be that: for a time to be eligible
for world record status, elite women should start a minimum of 15
minutes before the men. This would keep the races separate and
would prevent men from pacing and assisting women, keeping the
marathon in line with trace races and major championship marathons.
</P>
<P>
It has been reported that the IAAF Road Racing and Women's
Committee are strongly supporting the proposals and they will go
forward to the next IAAF Congress for consideration.
</P>
<P>
The 2000 London Marathon, the 20th of the race, takes place on
Sunday April 16 with around 30,000 runners participating.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Claims Success of Repelling Eritrean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia said on Wednesday
it has successfully repelled a military offensive launched by
Eritrea, with more than 335 Eritrean soldiers killed or wounded.
</P>
<P>
The Government Spokesperson Office said in a press release that
the Eritrean troops launched the attack between Sunday night and
early Monday morning at the left wing of the Badme front in the
general vicinity of the Jerbet River.
</P>
<P>
A lot of Eritrean military supplies were also captured in the
battle, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the attack on Sunday, Eritrea also launched a small
offensive in the Zalambessa region on September 1, the release
said.
</P>
<P>
Zalambessa, a border town of Ethiopia, is situated in the mid
way of the 950 kilometer-long Ethiopia-Eritrean war front.
</P>
<P>
The war between the two Horn of Africa countries broke out on
May 6, 1998 over a disputed stretch of border area.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea announced in early August that it would cooperate with
the the Organization of African Unity and the United Nations in
implementing three agreements -- the Framework Agreement, the
Modalities and Technical Arrangements on ending the Ethio-Eritrean
War.
</P>
<P>
So far, Ethiopia has not agreed to accept the Technical
Arrangement, saying the arrangements do not guarantee Ethiopia the
return of the status quo before the war.

<HEADLINE> Europe Drinks Less Beer In Next Century: RI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Ireland and Russia are amongst
the few countries where beer sales and consumption are predicted
to increase, according to The European Beer Market 2000-2005, a
new report published by Retail Intelligence (RI).
</P>
<P>
In 1999 beer sales in Western Europe are forecast to fall by
just under 1 percent to 296 million hectroliters; by the year 2010
the majority of Norther European markets are expected to have
declined by 14-18 percent.
</P>
<P>
Beer consumption in Germany, the largest single market, is
predicted to fall by an even greater 20 percent over the period
with the closure of 300 breweries.
</P>
<P>
Germany and other traditional beer-drinking nations such as the
UK and Denmark are experiencing the Western European shift towards
wine consumption, RI said.
</P>
<P>
Conversely, Mediterranean countries have recently experienced a
shift in the opposite direction. The Greek and Italian markets
both increased by around 6 percent between 1997 and 1998, but the
region is not expected to make any strong advances during the next
decade.
</P>
<P>
Ireland has so far avoided a similar long-term decline, the
report said. Per capita consumption is at its highest for over 20
years and this has been attributed to a young population profile
combined with the economic boom of the nineties.
</P>
<P>
Retail Intelligence estimates that Russia beer sales will
increase by over 140 percent, whilst Romanian, Bulgarian and
Polish growth is expected to be in the 50-60 percent bracket in
this period.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Parliamentary Delegation Visits Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- A parliamentary delegation from
Switzerland is in Iran for its first visit since 1979 to
revitalize political, economic and cultural relations between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
During their visit starting Wednesday, the six-member
delegation, headed by the president of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, Christine Beerli, will meet parliamentarians,
government officials and representatives from various sectors of
the Iranian society, according to Swiss Radio International.
</P>
<P>
The delegation will try to build on talks by a Swiss trade
delegation, which visited Iran last year to assess investment
possibilities. Cultural exchanges have also taken place recently,
including Iranian films shown at the Locarno film festival and
concerts by Swiss musicians in Iran.
</P>
<P>
"We come to talk and to listen and I hope that we can build
relations that can be developed in the future," said delegation
member Rosmarie Simmen. She said she also hoped that an Iranian
parliamentary delegation would visit Switzerland soon.
</P>
<P>
"Cultural issues are always a good issue to start with," Simmen
commented on the main thrust of the talks. "Economic issues should
also play a prominent role and, of course, human rights."
</P>
<P>
It is the first visit by a Swiss parliamentary delegation since
1979, when the pro-United States shah of Iran was ousted in an
Islamic revolution. The U.S. and Iran subsequently severed
diplomatic relations and Switzerland has represented Washington's
interests in Tehran since then.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Elections shadowed by Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO,October 27 (Xinhua) -- Violent incidents broke out in
the southern Mozambican province of Gaza on Tuesday, leading to
several injuries and damage to property, Mozambique Agency News
(AIM) reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This took place when Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the main
opposition party and the former rebel movement, Resistencia
Nacional of Mozambique (Renamo), arrived in the town of Chokwe on
a presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
The violence started when supporters of the ruling Frelimo
(Mozambique Liberation Front) Party, travelling in motorcycles,
cars and other vehicles, blocked all access to the town.
</P>
<P>
When Dhlakama's motorcade arrived, his bodyguards decided to
clear a path through. They attacked everyone in their way
indiscriminately, which led to violent reaction on the part of the
Frelimo sympathizers.
</P>
<P>
This skirmish resulted in injuries to several people, including
a photographer from the journal Noticias, Felisberto Laice. Many
vehicles were damaged, mainly through broken windscreens and
windows.
</P>
<P>
However, the most serious violence occurred at the end of the
day when Dhlakama and his followers were preparing to leave the
town.
</P>
<P>
Two vehicles, including a minibus full of Frelimo sympathizers,
tried once again to block the road. Again the Renamo bodyguards
fought to secure a way through.
</P>
<P>
But this time, the minibus ran over one of Dhlakama's guards,
breaking his leg.
</P>
<P>
In fury, Dhlakama's bodyguards pursued the minibus driver and
started firing into the air.
</P>
<P>
It was only then that the police, who had been passively
watching the violence, intervened to stop and detain the man
responsible for running over the Renamo guard.
</P>
<P>
However, Dhlakama said at the end of his Chokwe rally that he
would not respond to provocations by Frelimo members, otherwise
the ensuing violence might jeopardize the forthcoming polls
scheduled for December 3-4.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to call upon Renamo members and sympathizers not
to respond to this kind of situation," he said.
</P>
<P>
He warned that if he were to respond in like measures, then in
northern Mozambique, his rival, President Joaquim Chissano,
"wouldn't even be able to leave his plane."
</P>
<P>
Chissano also has called on his supporters to avoid disorder
and provocation.
</P>
<P>
The election campaign, which started on October 19, is
scheduled to end on November 30. The presidential and
parliamentary polls are to be held during December 3-4 with 13
parties and party-coalitions to take part in the race.

<HEADLINE> Four Seeds Exit of Stuttcard Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Four seeds including world
number two Yevgeny Kafelnikov and Tim Henman, Cedric Pioline and
Karol Kucera crashed out Wednesday of the Stuttcart Open.
</P>
<P>
Karelnikov lost in straight sets to Mariano Zabaleta in 6-3, 6-
3 that earned Zabaleta a place in the third round of the event.
</P>
<P>
Daniel Vacek, No. 54. in the world, upset the 10th-ranked
Henman 6-3, 6-1, while another Czech, Jiri Novak, ousted the 14th-
seeded Pioline 6-4, 3-6, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
Schalken, No. 55, defeated the 15th-seeded Kucera 7-5, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
Kafelnikov, the Australian Open champion, has been playing for
12 straight weeks and he looked anything but fresh in his quick
defeat against Zabaleta, an Argentine ranked No. 27 in the world.
</P>
<P>
Along with top-ranked Andre Agassi, Kafelnikov is the only
other player to have already clinched a place in the eight-man,
season-ending ATP Tour World Championship in Hanover, Germany, in
one month's time.
</P>
<P>
For Henman, Wednesday's defeat could prove costly in his
attempt to qualify for Hanover. The Briton entered the tournament
in ninth place, just outside the cut, and 64-minute defeat against
Vacek will not help.
</P>
<P>
Poline's chances of reaching Hanover already were distant, with
the Frenchman in 13th place before being beaten by the 33rd-ranked
Novak.
</P>
<P>
Three other seeded players in early action Wednesday advanced
to the third round with relative ease.
</P>
<P>
Third-seeded Todd Martin ousted Fabrice Santoro 6-4, 6-2 and No.
11 Tommy Haas beat Wayne Ferreira 6-2, 7-6 (7-2).
</P>
<P>
But Nicolas Lapenti, seeded 12th, needed three sets to overcome
Dominik Hrbaty, prevailing 3-6, 6-4, 6-3.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: U.S. Sees Renewed Interest in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 28 (Xinhua) -- There have been signs that
Africa is again drawing the attention of the United States, which
sees the continent as a source of drugs, terrorism, disease and
violent conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Export-Import Bank turned up the heat on its
competitors in Africa when it announced on Tuesday that it would
now guarantee rand- denominated loans in South Africa and its
neighboring states.
</P>
<P>
James Harmon, president of the agency, said the bank has now
opened doors in 32 African countries compared with 13 when Harmon
took over the job two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Harmon, a long-time investment banker, also said that he was
hoping to do business worth more than 1 billion U.S. dollars in
Africa next year. The current figure is 600 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Harmon was bullish on prospects in the continent, saying more
business opportunities exist in telecommunications,
infrastructure, technology and tourism.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the prospect for the U.S. to reduce tariffs on
African textiles, clothing and other products became brighter this
week when the Senate voted 90 to eight to take up a package of
long-stalled trade measures, including the African Growth and
Opportunity Act. The House of Representatives passed the bill
earlier.
</P>
<P>
The bill will dramatically expand the range of duty removals on
exports from African countries, judged to be undertaking
market-friendly economic and political reforms.
</P>
<P>
The American Textile Manufacturer Institute, previously
vehemently against the Africa bill, came out in favor after
deciding that the removal would benefit its members as well.
</P>
<P>
These latest developments added to a momentum to boost U.S.
interests in the continent after Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright visited six African states last week.
</P>
<P>
"The United States is moving to fight American isolationists
who see few U.S. interests in the continent," an African diplomat
based in Pretoria said.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton Administration now begins to see Africa not only
as a source of troubles, but also as a source of business
opportunities for U.S. companies, he said, requiring anonymity.
</P>
<P>
The two recurrent themes in the United States at the moment are
that the country has a national interest in stability and good
governance in Africa and Africa must be part of the global economy
and international system.
</P>
<P>
It is also the beliefs of U.S. officials that African
governments can help the United States deal with narcotics, AIDS
and cross-border crime.
</P>
<P>
Africa, on the other hand, also badly needs America's help,
according to Albright. "Our role in Africa is much desired by the
Africans, and needed," she said.
</P>
<P>
But ironically, the U.S. government wants to make a big
difference in Africa without inviting vast amounts of money from
U.S. taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton last week vetoed a foreign
operations bill that cuts more than 2 billion U.S. dollars from
the State Department budget, about 12 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
After seeing children mutilated in the civil war in Sierra
Leone and poverty in Mali and the northern Nigerian city of Kano,
Albright promised to go back to Washington with "renewed vigor" to
fight for a bigger foreign assistance budget.
</P>
<P>
She said it was difficult to explain to Africans why the aid
budget is shrinking when the U.S. economy is booming.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. national interests in Africa required more money for
Africa, Albright said.

<HEADLINE> Pakistani Chief Executive Ends Gulf Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Chief Executive
General Pervez Musharraf Wednesday wrapped up a one-day visit to
the United Arab Emirates (UAE), describing his two-state Gulf tour
as fruitful.
</P>
<P>
"The outcome of my visit to Saudi Arabia and the UAE was beyond
my expectations," the military ruler said during a meeting with
members of the Pakistani community in the UAE before flying back
home.
</P>
<P>
"I am glad to say that I felt understanding in all places I
visited and I was assured of full support by President Sheikh
Zayed Bin Sultan Al-Nahyan and by the Saudi leadership," added
Musharraf, who is also chief of staff of the Pakistani armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
The general declared himself Chief Executive of Pakistan on
October 15 after dismissing Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's
government through a military coup on October 12.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the Pakistani military set up a six-member National
Security Council and a cabinet headed by Musharraf to run the
post-coup administration.
</P>
<P>
Ending his first foreign trip since coming to power, Musharraf
said the priorities of his new government would include reviving
the economy and enhancing the federation.
</P>
<P>
"We will develop investors' confidence whether inside Pakistan
or abroad and then we will make sure that provincial harmony is
achieved," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he was going to hold a referendum to avoid possible
boycott by the West, he said he would do what is needed by
Pakistan, not by the West.
</P>
<P>
On relations with neighboring India, Musharraf said he would
not visit India until the pending issues between the two countries
were resolved.
</P>
<P>
"We need to be at peace with India but a peace that is linked
to dignity and not conditional. And above all, we have to discuss
the main issue between us and India, which is the Kashmir
problem," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, a latest clash broke out between Indian and
Pakistani troops near the disputed Kashmir region. Four Pakistani
soldiers were reportedly killed.

<HEADLINE> WB Official Lauds Uganda's Economic Performance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KAMPALA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank Country
Representative in Uganda James Adams has highly praised Uganda's
economic performance in the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a press conference at the end of a
two-day conference on comprehensive development framework here
Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
"Uganda's economic performance in the last decade, especially
in the last three years, is among the top three in Africa and
among the top 10 in the whole world. It is the government's
policies that have kept Uganda developing so fast and the
inflation rate so low in the period," he said.
</P>
<P>
"An annual growth rate of seven percent is no easy work. The
dramatic decline in poverty rate has contributed significantly to
the drastic improvement of the economy. During the 1992-1997
period, the poverty rate declined from 56 percent to 46 percent,"
he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
However, he confessed that in spite of the progress, Uganda
still has a long way to go in economic development and fighting
against corruption.
</P>
<P>
"We are concerned about corruption. We do not give checks to
the government and go back to Washington. We monitor how the money
is used by the government. We work closely with the government to
ensure that the government deal with the corrupt officials
harshly," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The WB is one of the key donors in Uganda, funding projects
ranging from infrastructure to information dissemination.
</P>
<P>
The two-day conference is aimed at reviewing the outcomes of
Uganda's economic performance since the National Resistance
Movement came to power in 1986 so that lessons can be drawn for
future development.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Appeals for 199 Million Dollars for East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Wednesday launched an appeal for 199 million U.S. dollars to meet
the urgent humanitarian needs of the affected population in East
Timor through June 2000.
</P>
<P>
The appeal, known as the Consolidated Inter-Agency Appeal for
East Timor Crisis, was contained in a press release issued here
and in Geneva at the same time by the U.N. Office for the
Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
</P>
<P>
"During the past two weeks of violence following the popular
consultation in East Timor, more than 75 percent of the population
was displaced and 70 percent of homes and public buildings
destroyed," the press release said.
</P>
<P>
With the support of the International Force for East Timor,
humanitarian agencies have worked to meet the acute needs of the
displaced.
</P>
<P>
At present, some 40 humanitarian agencies are active in East
Timor, and some 15 are in West Timor.
</P>
<P>
"To date, humanitarian daily rations have been airdropped in
areas of East Timor, and food and shelter assistance provided to
more than 64,000 people returning to Dili," capital of East Timor,
the press release said.
</P>
<P>
More than 60 convoys of food and non-food aid were sent to
displaced populations throughout East Timor, and mobile health
clinics were set up in 20 locations in the eastern sector.
</P>
<P>
The present appeal has been formulated to cover emergency and
transitional programs for a nine-month period, to be carried out
by the World Food Program, the World Health Organization, the
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the
United Nations Children's Fund, the United Nations Development
Program, the United Nations Population Fund, the Food and
Agriculture Organization and the Office of Humanitarian Affairs.
</P>
<P>
It contains 48 projects costed at 183 million U.S. dollars
for East Timor and 16 projects at 16 million U.S. dollars for
West Timor.
</P>
<P>
An earlier preliminary assessment of priority needs had been
prepared in September based on the assumption gained from aerial
surveys and projections, U.N. officials said.
</P>
<P>
The main aim of humanitarian agencies over the next nine months
in East Timor is to assist population through the emergency stage
as quickly as possible, while laying the groundwork for full-scale
reconstruction and development.
</P>
<P>
Basic services will be provided while a new civil
administration is established under the auspices of the U.N.
Transitional Administration for East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council Monday unanimously approved a force
of nearly 11,000 troops and police and thousands of civilian
administrators to lead devastated East Timor to independence in
two or three years.

<P>
LONDON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. mediator George Mitchell
returned to Northern Ireland's capital of Belfast Wednesday to
make one last push to cement peace between the feuding communities
in the British province.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell, in the eighth week of a bid to revive the Good Friday
accord signed in April last year, was set to resume negotiations
as pressure mounted on politicians to strike a deal to end a
19-month stalemate.
</P>
<P>
He was expected to put forward fresh proposals later to
pro-British unionist and Irish republican parties.
</P>
<P>
In London, Peter Mandelson, Britain's Northern Ireland
secretary, warned the rival parties that they must deliver peace
and stability if the province was to prosper after 30 years of
strife.
</P>
<P>
The deadlocked negotiations appeared to be dragging to a close
last Saturday. Mitchell kept slim hopes alive however by
announcing he would keep them going this week.

<P>
Framework
</P>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government has
vowed to strengthen the Comprehensive Development Framework (CDF)
to further reduce the country's poverty rate in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
Tumusiime Mutebile, Permanent Secretary to the Ministry of
Finance and Secretary to the Treasury, made the remarks in a
speech here Wednesday evening at the end of a two-day conference
on the CDF organized by the World Bank in conjunction with the
Ugandan government.
</P>
<P>
He said the conference has highlighted a considerable amount
of valuable data and the government would use the information
constructively.
</P>
<P>
The permanent secretary gave five areas on which the
government should concentrate its efforts, including increased CDF
recognition, comprehensive information, improved information
flows, budget discipline and increasing capacity.
</P>
<P>
"Government must define national and sectoral priorities in
dialogue with the donors and other stakeholders. Once the partners
have agreed on shared objectives, they must commit themselves to
the major policy and resource actions that are essential to the
achievement of the agreed objectives," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the CDF process in Uganda has been steadily
improving over recent years, assisted by the participatory
approach to the development of a national strategy on poverty
eradication.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the government to strengthen the transparency
and accountability of the planning and budgetary process.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has registered a rapid economic growth in recent years
due to liberalization and privatization. However, nearly half of
its population is still facing starvation. Natural disasters,
coupled with rampant corruption among senior officials, are still
hampering the development of its national economy.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President Names Referendum Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni has named the national referendum committee of the ruling
National Resistance Movement (NRM) and submitted the list to the
national electoral commission.
</P>
<P>
The referendum committee, composed of 19 members, is led by NRM
Vice Chairman Moses Kigongo, according to a press release issued
by the President's Office Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
"In accordance with Section 13(3) of the Referendum and Other
Provisions Act, 1999, President Yoweri Museveni, in his capacity
as Chairperson of the National Conference of the Movement, has
submitted the list to Chairman of the Electoral Commission Aziz
Kasujja," the press release said.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Museveni has appointed 19 people as
members of an advisory committee which will advise the NRM organs
during the referendum process. Museveni will head the advisory
body himself.
</P>
<P>
Under Uganda's Constitution, a referendum would be held in
June of 2000 to decide on which political system the country
should adopt. Although some multipartyists are crying loudly for a
multi-party system, the NRM is widely expected to be the winner of
the referendum.
</P>
<P>
Uganda claims to be a "no party" country and the Constitution,
 enacted in 1995, bans all official activities of political
parties. The NRM, though ruling the African country for more than
13 years, denies being a political party.

<HEADLINE> Oslo Summit Aims to Boost Peace Process: U.S. Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 27 (Xinhua) -- A three-way summit between
Israeli, Palestinian and U.S. leaders in Oslo, Norway, next week
aims to move the Mideast peace process forward, U.S. peace envoy
Dennis Ross said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ross said the summit will be an opportunity for Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak, Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Chairman
Yasser Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton to meet together to
discuss how to advance the final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
Ross made the remarks after separate meeting with Barak and
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy. The envoy, who is on a visit
to prepare for next week's summit, had held talks with Arafat
Tuesday night soon after his arrival.
</P>
<P>
The three leaders are to meet in Oslo to mark the fourth
anniversary of the assassination of Israeli late Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin, who signed the historic Oslo Accord with Arafat in
1993.
</P>
<P>
The current peace process is expected to be one of the main
topics in the summit.
</P>
<P>
The latest Israeli-Palestinian interim agreement inked in Sharm
el-Sheikh, Egypt, early last month has been relatively going well
so far despite some setbacks.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have kicked off the long-overdue final-status
talks to deal with the thorniest issues like the status of the
Palestinian entity, the fate of Palestinian refugees and the
future of the contested Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Ross urged the two sides to move quickly in order to meet the
target they set for the talks.
</P>
<P>
Barak appointed veteran diplomat Oded Eran head of the Israeli
negotiating team to the final status talks only on Monday, more
than one month after the talks were started.
</P>
<P>
The PNA formed its negotiating team soon after the talks
began. PNA Information Minister Yasser Abed Rabbo will be head of
the team.
</P>
<P>
Eran, who is currently ambassador to Jordan, drove from Amman
to take part in the meeting between Ross and Barak. He will also
accompany Barak for the summit in Norway.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Levy will leave for Washington Wednesday night for a
previously unannounced meeting with U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the visit is aimed at coordinating Israeli
and U.S. stances ahead of the summit.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Posts Record Budget Surplus in Fiscal 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The federal government
posted a record budget surplus of 123 billion U.S. dollars in
fiscal 1999 ending September 30, recording the first back-to-back
surpluses in more than 40 years, the White House announced
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The surplus for the fiscal year followed a surplus of 69.2
billion dollars in 1998, the first time the government had
finished in the black since 1969.
</P>
<P>
The two consecutive budget surpluses marked the first time the
government has managed that feat since 1956 and 1957 when Dwight
Eisenhower was the president.
</P>
<P>
Despite the surpluses, the government still has a debt of 5
trillion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart disclosed the figures in
advance of a formal White House event where President Bill Clinton
was to talk about the administration's economic accomplishments
later in the day.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart called the 1999 surplus the largest in U.S. history in
total dollar terms. As a percentage of the total economy, it is
the largest surplus since 1951, Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton last month said the administration was looking for a
surplus of at least 115 billion dollars. That figure was up from a
98.8 billion dollar projection the administration had made in its
mid-session budget review in June.
</P>
<P>
The Social Security Trust Fund had a surplus of 124 billion
dollars last year, Lockhart said. But 1 billion dollars of that
surplus was spent on federal programs; both Democrats and
Republicans have promised not to spend any of the trust fund
surplus this year.
</P>
<P>
"We have done an enormous amount of work to turn this economy
around, turn our fiscal picture around," Lockhart said. "But there
is still a lot of work to do."

<P>
ATHENS, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Greek Parliament President
Apostolos Kaklamanis warned Wednesday that the continuing ethnic
cleansing policy against the Serbs in Kosovo will endanger peace
and stability in the Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a Western European Union (WEU) conference on the
security in southeastern Europe in the southern Greek island of
Crete, Kaklamanis said that this policy is not only dangerous for
peace and stability in the region but it is in total conflict with
the NATO declarations which were supposed to seek the solution of
the crisis, the semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
This policy places in dispute the effectiveness of the European
Union foreign policy as well as the prestige and the reliability
of international organizations, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The security status of countries in southeastern Europe and
particularly the vulnerable region of the Balkans and Yugoslavia
and their repercussions for world peace are the focus of the
three-day conference, which was organized by the political and
defense committees of the WEU.
</P>
<P>
Greece's Deputy Defense Minister Dimitris Apostolakis also said
that Europe has showed itself to be lacking a defense policy and
this is an issue that has to be tackled and effectively dealt with
with the requisite means and willingness.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The United States on
Wednesday welcomed Iranian President Mohammad Khatami's visit to
France, but expected France to bring up U.S. concerns about
Iranian policies.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome Iran's interest in rejoining the community of
nations and becoming a responsible member of the international
community," State Department spokesman James Rubin said at a
briefing.
</P>
<P>
The United States has been seeking official talks with the
Iranian government for years.
</P>
<P>
And Rubin again on Wednesday offered face-to-face and
unconditional negotiations between Washington and Tehran to forge
"more normal" relations after the two decades of hostilities.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian government rejected the U.S. initiative, saying
Washington should first unfreeze assets and lift sanctions before
any talks are possible.
</P>
<P>
The United States, however, held its ground that those would
depend upon what steps Iran would take.
</P>
<P>
And the United States continues to object to Tehran's weapons
programs, and Iran's opposition to Middle East peace agreements.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the United States expected that "the international
community, including France, is equally concerned about all of
these issues and committed to urging Iran to change its policies."
</P>
<P>
"We Expect the government of France as a member in good
standing of the international community to raise the issues," he
said.

<P>
HAVANA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Governor George Ryan
of U.S. Illinois state on Wednesday said he came to Cuba for
building bridges between the peoples of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He made the speech in front of Cuban President Fidel Castro and
students at the University of Havana, just before ending his
five-day visit to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Ryan, who gave a conference on " Relations between Illinois and
Cuba", arrived in Havana last Saturday on an official visit to the
island, the first one of a U.S. governor in office since the
victory of Cuban revolution in 1959.
</P>
<P>
Ryan said he hoped his visit would lead to future exchanges
between Illinois and Cuba in the areas of sports, medicine,
education and trade. He said he plans to create a Cuban-Illinois
exchange council.
</P>
<P>
"Our languages are different, out cultures and economies are
different and our philosophies of government are different," he
said. "But that does not mean that Cuba and Illinois are not
compatible. There is a strong bond that draws us together," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official met with Fidel Castro for seven hours on

<P>
LISBON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President Jiang
Zemin met here Wednesday with Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio
Guterres.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister said that China is one of the most ancient
countries of civilization in the world. China and European Union
are important forces in current world.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister said that one important content of
Portugal's foreign policy is to push forward actively the
development of economic and political relations between China,
Portugal and EU, which, he said, is important for correcting the
unbalance in the process of globlization and curbing some kind of
force becoming hegemonist in the world.
</P>
<P>
Guterres, reaffirming that Portugal and EU support China's
accession to the World Trade Organization as soon as possible,
promised that Portugal will exert its effort in strengthening the
cooperation in all fields between EU, Portugal and China when
Portugal will be the rotating chairman of EU in the first half of
next year.
</P>

Macao SAR will become a bridge linking the relationship between
Portugal, EU and China.
</P>

The Chinese President said that since diplomatic ties were
established, both sides have promoted exchange and cooperation in
all fields according to the principle of mutual respect and mutual
benefit, and bilateral relationship has enjoyed continuous
development.
</P>

High level contacts have increased especially in recent years,
which has made important contributions to deepen mutual
understanding and expand cooperation, Jiang said.

<HEADLINE> Volcano Arenal Registers Eruption in Costa Rica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The volcano Arenal, some 120
kilometers to the north of San Jose, has registered a new
eruption.
</P>
<P>
The eruption on Tuesday evening follows that of last May, which
caused alarm in the vicinity, said the Physical Geographer from
the Volcanological and Seismological Observatory of Costa Rica
(OVSICORI), Erick Fernandez on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Volcano Arenal, on the shores of the lake with the same name,
is an active volcano, and some of its eruptions have caused
deaths, he added.
</P>
<P>
The authorities are requesting people not to go near the
north-east area of the volcano, where the eruption sent lava
flowing down the sides of the volcano. However the lava did not
pass the perimeter of the lava beds of the national park.
</P>
<P>
When it is possible to watch the night-time activity of the
volcano, it presents a majestic spectacular, which has attracted a
vast tourist complex around it.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the eruptions, Fernandez said that "They are very
superficial events, very difficult to predict".
</P>
<P>
The OVSICRI watches the volcanic activity, such as earthquakes,
the deformation of the cone, gas, ash and rock emanations, and
also examines the composition of the chemicals released.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese Opposition Leader Praises Egyptian-Libyan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 27 (Xinhua) -- A visiting Sudanese opposition
leader on Wednesday praised the Egyptian-Libyan peace initiative
as a framework for the realization of peace in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian-Libyan peace plan is "the only comprehensive
framework designed to help end the civil strife in Sudan," said Al
Sadeq al Mahdi, a leading member of the National Democratic
Alliance (NDA).
</P>
<P>
The NDA is the umbrella group of the northern Muslim opposition
parties and the southern rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army
(SPLA).
</P>
<P>
The northern political parties want to share power with Sudan's
Islamic government while the SPLA has been fighting since 1983 for
greater autonomy for the mostly Christian south, Egypt's Middle
East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The 16-year-old civil war and the ensuing famine have claimed
nearly 2 million lives in the poor African state.
</P>
<P>
Egypt that lies on the lower reaches of the Nile River has been
making efforts to help achieve national reconciliation in Sudan
because it fears the war in the state that is located on the upper
reaches can block the smooth flow of the water.
</P>
<P>
"What is important about the initiative is that it has placed
the future of rule in Sudan on the agenda of discussions," said al
Mahdi.
</P>
<P>
In August, Egypt and Libya initiated a five-point peace plan,
including calls for a permanent cease-fire and a preparatory
meeting on a comprehensive peace conference for Sudan. The
Sudanese government and the Muslim opposition parties have
accepted the initiative.
</P>
<P>
But the SPLA rejected the plan, saying that it favored the role
played by the Eastern African Inter-Governmental Authority on
Development in mediating a solution to its war with the government.
</P>
<P>
Al Mahdi defended SPLA leader John Garang as pro-unity, saying
that "some of his supporters are not so."
</P>
<P>
The SPLA is believed to be keen on safeguarding the unity of
Sudan, he said.

<HEADLINE> Annan, U.S. Trade Accusations on Iraq Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan has criticized the United States for delaying humanitarian
supplies to Iraq under the U.N. sanctions system.
</P>
<P>
But the United States on Wednesday refused to accept the blame,
saying Annan was ill advised by his aides.
</P>
<P>
Annan told the Washington Post in an interview last Friday that
Washington used its muscle on a U.N. sanctions committee to put
indefinite "holds" on more than 500 million US dollars in
humanitarian goods that Iraq would like to buy.
</P>
<P>
He said Washington was disrupting the system. "I think one
should be transparent and not withhold some of these items
unreasonably because it undermines our professed desire to help
alleviate the suffering of the Iraqi people," he added.
</P>
<P>
But the State Department spokesman James Rubin said on
Wednesday that there were legitimate reasons for the "holds."
</P>
<P>
"The chairman of the sanctions committee has put forward a very
careful report about the holds that have been placed for
legitimate reasons on entities or contracts that we believe have
questionable potential to be misused," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.N. secretary-general was badly advised by his
aide about the humanitarian exports to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"Those was are advising the secretary-general would do better
to focus their attention on the cause of the problem, which is
Iraq's unwillingness to buy the food and medicine that would
make a difference to their people, rather than engaging in
midplaced blame on the United States," Rubin said.

<HEADLINE> UN Tribunal Begins to Try New Rwanda Genocide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The International
Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) Wednesday started the trial of
a new suspect for the 1994 genocide in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Kingsley Moghalu, spokesman for the UN Tribunal based in
Tanzania's northern town of Arusha, said that Ignace Bagilishema,
former Mayor of Mabanza Commune in Rwanda's Kibuye Prefecture was
brought before Trial Chamber I on Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Bagilishema is charged with genocide, complicity in genocide,
crimes against humanity and war crimes, Moghalu said in a press
release available here.
</P>
<P>
"The prosecution delivered its opening statement, during which
it showed videos of Rwanda shortly after the genocide and the
situation there today," Moghalu said, without giving further
details.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Moghalu said that the Trial Chamber will, at the
request by the defense in this case, visit sites in Kibuye where
the crimes in Bagilishema's indictment were allegedly committed
from November 1 to 4.
</P>
<P>
"This is very significant because this is the first time judges
of the ICTR will be visiting Rwanda in a judicial capacity," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman disclosed that the Rwandan authorities are fully
aware of the visit and are cooperating with the Tribunal in
logistical arrangements for this activity.
</P>
<P>
Trial Chamber I is composed of presiding judge Eric Mose
(Norway), judge Asoka de Zoysa Gunarwardana (Sri Lanka) and judge
Mehmet Guney (Turkey).
</P>
<P>
Established on November 8, 1994 by United Nations Security
Council, the ICTR has the mandate to try persons suspected to be
responsible for genocide and other serious violations of the
international humanitarian law committed in the territory of
Rwanda between January 1 and December 31, 1994.
</P>
<P>
It also has the mandate to try Rwandan citizens responsible for
such violations committed in the territory of neighboring states.
</P>
<P>
The ICTR has so far issued 28 indictments against 45
individuals and a total of 38 indicted individuals are in custody.
</P>
<P>
About half a million Rwandans were reportedly killed during the
1994 genocide when the majority Hutus oppressed the minority
Tutsis.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Calls for Establishment of Regional Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) has recommended the immediate
establishment of a community court of appeal that would help
"interpret and apply" various protocols and conventions of the
organization.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen justice ministers of the ECOWAS states made the call
in a statement released Wednesday by the Abuja-based secretariat
of the 16- member regional organization.
</P>
<P>
The court, to be based in a yet to be named member country,
would have a president, a chief registrar and seven judges, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the court would help interpret the ECOWAS treaty
and the various protocols and conventions signed since 1975 when
regional leaders endorsed the treaty for the establishment of the
organization.
</P>
<P>
According to officials at the ECOWAS secretariat, two countries
have offered to host the court, which would also settle disputes
referred to it under article 56 of the treaty and disputes between
states and institutions of the community.
</P>
<P>
"When in force, the court of justice is expected to address
complaints from member states and community citizens as well as
issues relating to default," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Regional leaders signed the protocol for the court in July 1991
but its establishment has been bogged down by disagreements over
whether it should be temporary or permanent, terms of employment
for its staff and funding.
</P>
<P>
The justice ministers agreed that the court should be permanent
with its funding to be decided during the next meeting of the
administration and finance committee of the organization.

<HEADLINE> Air Canada Reveals Breakup Fees in Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Air Canada Wednesday revealed an
additional cost of multi-million dollars in defense against the
proposed merger by the Toronto based buyout specialist Onex Corp.
</P>
<P>
Under a 10-year agreement between Air Canada and its Star
Alliance, the country's largest airline would pay expensive
breakup fees in the event it should shift to the rival Oneworld
alliance under Onex's merger plan.
</P>
<P>
Air Canada would have to pay from a maximum of 250 million
Canadian dollars (about 170 million U.S. dollars) in the first
year to 37 million dollars (about 25 million U.S. dollars) after
January 1, 2009.
</P>
<P>
Onex has already offered 1.8 billion Canadian dollars (about
1.2 billion U.S. dollars) to buy Air Canada and Canadian Airlines
and merge the country's top two airlines into one national
carrier.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Transport Minister David Collenette Tuesday told the
House of Commons that the current 10 percent limit to the
individual ownership of Air Canada should be lifted to pay the way
for a merger.
</P>
<P>
The minister invited the House of Commons to decide on a
change, which could be in favour of Onex, although the minister
tried to avoid taking side.
</P>
<P>
Air Canada made known its agreement on breakup fees a day after
Collenette addressed to the House of Commons, which is still
debating on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Air Canada is teaming up with Lufthansa, United Airlines and
the Canadian imperial Bank Commerce to buy back 35 percent of its
own shares and manage to take over the losing Canadian Airlines.
</P>
<P>
Onex, on its part, is fighting for a two-third majority of Air
Canada's shareholding to finalize its own version of merger.
</P>
<P>
Shareholders are expected to vote on the fate of Air Canada and

"I believe that along with the smooth settlement of the Macao
issue, the friendly relations between the two countries, through joint
efforts of both sides, will surely enjoy sound and stable development
in the next century" Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
After the smooth transition and handover of Macao, Jiang said,
it will definitely play the role of being a bridge for the
relationship between China and Portugal and EU.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said cooperation between the two countries on Macao is
good, and he hopes that the two countries will continue their
efforts to solve remaining issues.
</P>
<P>
"The facts over the past two years of Hong Kong's return are
enough to demonstrate that China will undoubtedly do a good job in
implementing the 'one country, two systems', 'governing Macao by
Macao people' and high level of self administration over Macao,"
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
On relationship between China and Europe, Jiang said, the
development of relationship between China and EU and its member
states has enjoyed a good tendency. Political consultation and
dialogue at all levels are fruitful.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese President said his state visits to Britain, France
and Portugal display the fact that China attaches importance to the
development of relationship with EU nations.
</P>
<P>
China and EU have important influence over international affairs
and China hopes that EU will play a constructive role in
safeguarding world peace and promoting common development, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese President pointed out that his three-nation
European visit makes him feel deeply that next century will
undoubtedly be one of multi-polarization, which is beneficial to
guaranteeing world peace, stability and development.
</P>
<P>
He called on far-sighted politicians in the world to make
positive efforts for the realization of this goal.

<HEADLINE> Crude Oil Drift Lower with US Stocks Data </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Crude oil prices drifted lower
on Wednesday against the backdrop of newly released U.S. petroleum
inventory statistics and progress made in repairs at a big North
Sea oilfield.
</P>
<P>
International benchmark Brent crude last traded 10 cents lower
at 22.60 U.S. dollars a barrel on Wednesday, about 1.70 U.S.
dollars or seven percent off a 33-month high of 24.30 U.S. dollars
touched on September 29, according to a Reuters report.
</P>
<P>
Market sentiment was apparently hurt by a hefty 3.4 million
barrel rise in weekly crude stocks in the United States, world's
largest energy market, which was reported by the Washington-based
American Petroleum Institute (API) industry group.
</P>
<P>
In the last two weeks, sentiment has been propped up by signs
that world oil producers are seriously considering extending
supply curbs beyond their expiry at the end of March.
</P>
<P>
Producers from in and outside the Organisation of the Petroleum
Exporting Countries have said they were worried that inventories
are not falling fast enough.
</P>
<P>
OPEC and a handful of non-OPEC states agreed last March to
remove some five million barrels a day from the 75 million barrels
daily world market for a year in an effort to lift prices from
below 10 U.S. dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
Brent has averaged 16.65 U.S. dollars a barrel so far this year,
well above 1998's average of 13.34 U.S. dollars due to a rally
based supply restraint by key exporters and recovering Asian
demand.

<P>
WASHINGTON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) announced Wednesday the approval of 196
million U.S. dollars in financing to Brazil to support programs
aimed to improve professionalization of nursing services and
promote sustainable ecotourism in the Amazon basin.
</P>
<P>
A loan of 185 million dollars will finance a training program
for nursing aides, the Washington-based IDB said.
</P>
<P>
The health project is especially focused on improving the
quality of service to low-income sectors that are covered by the
Unified Health System.
</P>
<P>
The project has two components: schooling and
professionalization of nursing personnel, and institutional
strengthening of the agencies that regulate human resources and
technical training for the Unified Health System.
</P>
<P>
In a separate program, the IDB will provide 11 million dollars
to help the country prepare the groundwork for a major effort to
promote ecotourism in Amazon as a way to conserve natural
resources, protect the environment, and encourage sustainable
economic activities.
</P>
<P>
IDB resources will be used for establishing the appropriate
framework for developing ecotourism in the Amazon project area
that is shared by nine Brazilian Amazonian states.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Talks Adjourned until Thursday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland peace talks
adjourned in Belfast on Wednesday without any sign of a
breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
U.S. mediator George Mitchell is expected to resume
negotiations on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell is in the eighth week of a mission to try to break a
deadlock over guerrilla disarmament between politicians from the
British province's Protestant majority and Roman Catholic
minority.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell has signalled he expects to wrap up his mission in the
next few days, effectively putting pressure on the two sides to
strike a deal, the Reuters reported.
</P>
<P>
The long-running disarmament impasse has held up implementation
of last year's Good Friday peace accord for the province,
particularly the establishment of a power-sharing provincial
executive.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell, who brokered the Good Friday accord, is expected to
table proposals soon in an effort to bridge the gulf between the
main Protestant political group, the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP),
and the Irish Republican Army's political ally Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
Political sources said they did not expect the talks to go
beyond the weekend. But Mitchell's spokesman denied any deadline
had been set.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson warned the
parties they must deliver peace and stability if the province was
to prosper after 30 years of strife.

<HEADLINE> Activists Ask U.S. to Rescind Amnesty to Japan's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- A group of Jewish and
Asian-American activists on Wednesday asked Pentagon officials
to rescind the amnesty given to Japanese war criminals who
conducted gruesome medical experiments mainly on Chinese
citizens during the World War II.
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Abraham Cooper, associate dean of the Simon Wiesenthal
Center in Los Angeles, said after meeting with the Pentagon
officials, "We would like to see the United States take care of
its historic error."
</P>
<P>
He said the request involved Lt. Gen. Shiro Ishii, the
commander of unit 731, a special military unit that conducted
numerous medical experiments manily on Chinese citizens from
1932 through 1945.
</P>
<P>
Many of Ishii's experiments, conducted with the knowledge of
the Japanese Emperor, were aimed at testing chemical warfare and
biological agents, Cooper told reporters after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He said the experiments affected tens of thousands of Chinese
citizens, and whole villages were exposed to anthrax. "Ishii's
work treated humans like guinea pigs... There were horrific
experiments on babies and pregnant mothers," he said.
</P>
<P>
After the World War II, the United States gave Ishii and
about two dozen of his associates amnesty from prosecution to
get information about the experiments and to keep it from the
Soviet Union, which had indicted Ishii, Cooper said.

<HEADLINE> Armenian PM, Speaker Killed, 15 Held Hostage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Four gunmen stormed into the
Armenian parliament Wednesday, killing the country's prime
minister, parliament speaker and two deputies as well as a
government minister.
</P>
<P>
The bodies of Prime Minister Vazgen Sarkisyan, Parliament
Speaker Karen Demirchyan, his deputies Yuri Bakhshyan and Ruben
Miroyan and Minister for Emergencies Matters Leonard Petrosyan
were taken out of the government building at about 1750 GMT, the
Itar-Tass news agency quoted the Armenian presidential press
service as saying.
</P>
<P>
The death toll is expected to rise as more people had been
gravely wounded in the attack, which took place when the
government officials and lawmakers were in a plenary session.
</P>
<P>
The attack was likely to plunge Armenia into a major political
crisis. The country, which became independent in 1991 following
the collapse of the Soviet Union, has been beset by political and
economic turmoil for the past decade.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen, led by 34-year-old Nairi Hounanyan, are still
holding 15 people hostage and demanding a helicopter to transport
them to an unspecified location, Tass reported,
</P>
<P>
Armenian President Robert Kocharyan is negotiating with
Hounanyan, an extreme nationalist and former journalist, Tass
said, quoting Pavel Khachaturyan, an aide to Armenia's security
minister.
</P>
<P>
Khachaturyan termed the incident as a terrorist act rather
than a coup as the gunmen had earlier claimed.
</P>
<P>
According to Armenian National Television, Hounanyan, a
graduate of the Yerevan State University's Philology Department.
From 1988, he was an active participant of the National Liberation
Movement and one of the founders of The Union of Armenian
students.
</P>
<P>
He was a member of Armenian Dashnaktsoutyoun Party but was
expelled from the party for bad behavior, the TV station said in a
bulletin on its website.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen also included Hounanyan's younger brother and uncle.
The identity of the fourth gunman is not immediately known.

WASHINGTON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Russia's economic decline
poses one of the biggest potential threats to allies in Europe,
U.S. Air Force Gen. Joseph Ralston, nominated to be the next NATO
supreme commander, said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Senate Armed Services Committee, Ralston said
that the U.S. should do everything it can to prevent Russia from
failure in economic reform.

Voicing support for increased international security assistance
to Russia, Ralston said the current situation in Russia is
impairing the nation's military readiness, morale, discipline and
cohesion

<P>
Worsening conditions in Russia could pose "the added dilemma
that as conventional capabilities erode, they will rely more on
their nuclear forces," he said.

General Wesley Clark is due to resign from the top military
post of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in April.

If confirmed by the Senate, Ralston, currently vice chairman of

<HEADLINE> Study: U.S. Internet Economy to Top $500 Billion This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The booming Internet
economy has grown 68 percent since last year and is on track to
generate 507 billion U.S. dollars in revenue this years, according
to a research report released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
University of Texas researchers based their estimates on the
worldwide Internet-related sales of U.S.-based companies. While
the Internet makes up only a small part of the U.S.
8-trillion-dollar economy, their study suggests it has surpassed
such traditional sectors as automobiles, telecommunications and
utilities.
</P>
<P>
The researchers at the university's Graduate School of Business
compiled their results by observing 3,400 U.S. companies that
generate all or part of their revenues from Internet products or
services. Some of their data was gleaned using reports from
research companies, financial reports and the Web sites of 350 of
the largest firms.
</P>
<P>
According to the study, the rapid rise was led by electronic
commerce -- sales made directly over the Internet, whose revenues
rose 127 percent from 16.5 billion dollars in the first quarter of
1998 to 37.5 billion dollars in the same quarter this year.
</P>
<P>
The study also found that the Internet accounted for 2.3
million jobs in the first quarter of 1999, up from 1.5 million a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
As defined by the researchers, the Internet economy is made up
of companies directly generating all or part of their revenues
from Internet-related products and services, such as Cisco
Systems, Dell Computer Corp. and IBM Corp.
</P>
<P>
The researchers divided the Internet into four layers, namely,
infrastructure, applications, intermediaries and commerce. They
view the interplay of these layers as the Internet "ecosystem."
</P>
<P>
The Internet economy has a major impact on U.S. economic
growth, the research report said. U.S. GDP is projected to grow
340 billion dollars in 1999. The projected growth of 200 billion
dollars in the Internet economy in 1999 plays a significant role
in the health of the economy, the report said, although
differences between GDP and revenues make a precise comparison
difficult.

<HEADLINE> Ghanaian Govt. Beefs Up Efforts to Keep Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The Ghanaian government has
stepped up its efforts to keep the economy moving in face of rough
times ahead, the Ghana News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We need to adopt measures to arrest the decline in revenue and
its impact on planned expenditures," Deputy Finance Minister
Victor Selormey Wednesday told parliament on the state of the
country's economy.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that all sectors of the economy would be adversely
affected by the unfavorable world market at least over the next 12
to 18 months.
</P>
<P>
For instance, he said, real gross domestic product (GDP)
projection which was to hit 5.5 percent has to be revised downward
to 4.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Selormey said that taxes may have to go up to help meet the
shortfalls in the revenue earnings.
</P>
<P>
However, the financial official ruled out the possibility of
further borrowing substantially to cover the shortfall in
revenues, saying that the government does not believe in unduly
increasing the debt burden.
</P>
<P>
Ghana's external debts stood at 5.551 billion U.S. dollars at
the end of June this year. The figure was 283.2 million dollars
lower than that at the end of last December.
</P>
<P>
During the first half of 1999, Ghana's debt service payments
through the central bank amounted to 261.7 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Selormey said the nation cannot continue to rely on
aid from donor agencies, stressing the need for self-reliance.
</P>
<P>
The Ghanaian government has shown restraint in its expenditures
and has been able to keep the macro situation relatively stable by
prudently managing its finances, he added.

<HEADLINE> Annan Unveils U.N. "Starvation Diet" Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 27 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Wednesday proposed what he called a U.N. "starvation
diet" budget of 2.535 billion U.S. dollars for the two years
beginning in 2000, saying that any further cut would harm the
performance of the 188-member world body.
</P>
<P>
"For five years, the United Nations has had absolutely no
increase in budget, even in nominal terms," he told the General
Assembly's Fifth Committee, which is in charge of administrative
and budgetary affairs.
</P>
<P>
In each of those years spending had been reduced to cover the
cost of inflation, involving a total of 350 million U.S. dollars
in cuts since 1994, Annan said. More than 100 million U.S. dollars
more had been absorbed to pay for special missions.
</P>
<P>
"There comes a point, however, at which further cuts would
seriously compromise our ability to deliver the services that
member states have mandated and expect from the Secretariat," he
said.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.N. chief did not refer to the United States,
which has long insisted on tight U.N. budgets and stringent
reforms but owes some 1.7 billion U.S. dollars in arrears.
</P>
<P>
"Looking around the world, from East Timor to Sierra Leone." he
told the committee, referring to only the latest U.N. peacekeeping
missions. He also referred to General Assembly's speeches calling
fro action in such areas as disarmament, development and
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
Describing his budget proposals as "solid, reasonable and
rational," Annan said, "They represent value for money. They will
help us in our efforts to build a strong United Nations and a
peaceful, more humane world as we move into the 21st century."

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Global Perspective in Globalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 27 (Xinhua) -- China Wednesday called
for "a global perspective", rather than a Western one, in the
global governance in the globalization process.
</P>
<P>
The statement came as Shen Guofang, deputy Chinese permanent
representative to the United Nations, took the floor at the Second
Committee of the 54th General Assembly session.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that global governance needs a global perspective,
not a Western one," Shen said.
</P>
<P>
"The globalization process so far has advanced on the basis of
market economy and been driven by profits," he said. "It is
inequitable by its very nature."
</P>
<P>
"The government of one country can redress market-born domestic
inequality through domestic policies and regulations," he said.
"Likewise, global inequality should be redressed through effective
global governance, instead of being allowed to go unchecked."
</P>
<P>
Shen made the remarks as the Second Committee, in charge of
economic and financial affairs, was in the process of a discussion
on the globalization and interdependence. It is the first time for
the Second Committee to discuss this issue under a separate item
at a time when globalization has now become topic of the day
around the world.
</P>
<P>
The rapid development of the globalization process "has raided
new questions, brought about many uncertainties and given people
much to think about," he said.
</P>
<P>
The world macroeconomic policy and rules of game directly
affect developing countries' growth and development, but these
policies and rules are basically laid down at will by developed
countries with the concerns of developing countries being left
aside, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Such policies and rules can hardly be fair," he said. "This
must not be allowed to continue any longer."
</P>
<P>
"When macroeconomic policies and rules are being formulated,
there must be full participation by the majority of countries," he
said. "Their views must be heeded and their interest given due
consideration."
</P>
<P>
A program that will bring real benefit to developing countries
can only be worked out in light of the actual conditions of
developing countries, instead of being decided by a small number
of countries and then imposed on developing countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Globalization has raised another question, that is, will the
future world be a uniform one or diversified one?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
"We maintained that a uniform world is not only out of the
question but also in contravention of objective principles," he
said. "Only parallel development of diversification and
globalization can bring out the diversity and democratic spirit of
the world."
</P>
<P>
"We hope that global governance will fully embody fairness,
equality, democracy and diversification and will promote common
prosperity and development throughout the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
The globalization is a process, he said, "The United Nations
should conduct in-depth study and discussion on this issue and
make it a priority in its work in the months and years to come."
</P>
<P>
"To promote healthier and more balanced development of
globalization, the United Nations should keep globalization's
impact on developing countries under constant monitoring, come up
with policies and measures in response to such impact and appraise
the effectiveness of these policies and measures," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Asian financial crisis sounded the alarm that our global
governance mechanism lags far behind our time," he said. "The
inequalities brought about by globalization needs to be corrected
through reform of global governance mechanism."
</P>
<P>
"In today's world of globalization, governance on the national
level could hardly be meaningful without effective global
governance," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Cuban President Fidel Castro on
Wednesday praised Illinois governor of the United States George
Ryan for his braveness to visit Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Fidel Castro gave an impromptu press conference at the end of
Ryan's conference in the University of Havana on the topic of
relations between Cuba and Illionois.
</P>
<P>
Surrounded by almost 100 reporters, Castro said that Ryan's
visit "has been very important, interesting and constructive", and
Ryan had left a very good impression on him.
</P>
<P>
The president praised the Illionois governor, the first U.S.
state executive to visit the island since the victory of Cuban
revolution 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that the Cuban authorities placed no conditions on
Ryan's visit to the island, whom he said, was free to meet with
whom he wanted and do whatever he wanted.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The alliance forged between
Italian airline of Alitalia and Dutch airline of KLM will shift up
a gear on November 1 when two joint ventures take control of the
airlines' combined passenger and cargo business, it was announced
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The two joint ventures, one named Passengers, the other Cargo,
will operate under a single committee for the alliance uniting
Alitalia executives with their colleagues at KLM, a statement
said.
</P>
<P>
"This committee will determine the guidelines, policies and
joint strategies and will act as an interface between the two
managing directors," it continued.
</P>
<P>
The mega-airline due to take off next Monday will be a colossus
with annual sales of about 12 billion U.S. dollars, transporting
39 million passengers and with a fleet of 267 airplanes.
</P>
<P>
Including Northwest Airlines, the U.S. group which is
strategically allied to Alitalia and KLM, sales rise to about 21
billion U.S. dollars, passengers to 89 million and planes to 672.

companies," said Alitalia Managing Director Domenico Cempella and
his Dutch counterpart Leo van Wijk in a letter to employees.

The alliance, denoted in flight information by code AZ/KL,
marks the creation of what the executives called a "megastore for
European air travel."

<HEADLINE> FSA Consults On Future Regulation Of Professional Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The Financial Services Authority
(FSA) Thursday published a Consultation Paper outlining proposals
for the future regulation of professional firms of solicitors,
accountants and actuaries carrying on investment business.
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 professional firms in Britain provide investment
business services such as giving advice on investment products,
discretionary investment management or corporate finance services
of a significant type.
</P>
<P>
They are currently regulated by their professional bodies for
such business but once the Financial Services and Markets Act comes
into force, they will be regulated by the FSA, according to the
Consultation Paper.
</P>
<P>
The paper outlines key features of the future regulatory regime
for those professional firms which will be authorized by the FSA
and gives them an opportunity to play a part in shaping the
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launching of the paper, Michael Folger,
director of investment business at FSA, said, "The aim is to
ensure an appropriate level of consumer protection by requiring
professional firms doing business similar to others in the
investment community to meet comparable standards."

<HEADLINE> Somali Islamic Courts Kill Eight Bandits in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Somali Islamic courts
launched major security operations along the 120 kilometer road
between Mogadishu and the port town of Merca on Thursday, killing
eight bandits and wounding six others.
</P>
<P>
According to court officials, several battle wagons and
hundreds of heavily armed militiamen left the capital early in the
morning to the road which has lately been almost impassable
because of banditry and illegal roadblocks.
</P>
<P>
A battle wagon and a dozen armed militiamen were met with
stiff resistance when advanced to a place 60 kilometers south of
Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim Omar Sabriyeh, head of the operation, said that during
what he called the sweep operation against the illegal roadblocks
in between Mogadishu and Merca town, 50 outlawed bandits were
arrested.
</P>
<P>
During the exchange of gunfire, two of the militiamen were
killed and another one wounded, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the militiamen have taken control of the natural port
of Merca town, which had once been used by local contractors of
World Food Program for delivery of food aid targeting the famine
stricken Somalis in Bay, Bakol and Lower Shabelle regions and has
been closed for more than two years. The ordinary businessmen had
long ago refrained from using the port owing to serious banditry
along the road towards Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
During the decisive operation, three battle wagons belonging to
those outlawed militiamen were seized.
</P>
<P>
Businessmen have offered money, weapons, ammunition and some
other logistics to enable the courts to take control of Merca town
and its port. In return, the Islamic courts would collect tariffs
from the commercial ferries using the port and facilitate the
smooth flow of business activities towards the capital, sources
said.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the businessmen have been using the natural
port of El-Ma'an, some 30 kilometers northeast of Mogadishu for
goods delivery, but growing insecurity in the region prompted them
to search for an alternative port so as to continue their business
activities free from danger and banditry.

<HEADLINE> HK's External Trade Continues Rising In September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's total exports and
imports continued to pick up in September, according to the trade
figures released Thursday by the HK Census and Statistics
Department.
</P>
<P>
The value of total exports, comprising re-exports and domestic
exports, increased by 5.9 percent over a year earlier to 121
billion HK dollars (15.5 billion U.S. dollars). Within this total,
the value of re-exports rose by 8.3 percent to 106.3 billion HK
dollars (13.6 billion U.S. dollars), while that of domestic
exports decreased by 8.4 percent to 14.7 billion HK dollars (1.88
billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Concurrently, the value of imports in September increased by 7.
9 percent over a year earlier to 124.8 billion HK dollars (16
billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
For the first nine months of 1999 as a whole, the value of
total exports was lower by 3.3 percent over a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Comparing the third quarter of 1999 with the second quarter on
a seasonally adjusted basis, the value of total exports had an
increase of 4.9 percent. Within the total, the value of re-exports
and domestic exports rose by 5.4 percent and 1.2 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
A Government Secretariat spokesman noted that the growth in
Hong Kong's total exports in recent months had continued to
benefit from the strong rebound in import demand in the region,
sustained robust consumer spending in the United States, as well
as improved economic performance in the European Union. The marked
upturn in the Chinese mainland's overall exports also helped.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also noted that apart form the acceleration in re-
export growth, a greater intake of imports for local use as
domestic demand strengthened in line with the economic recovery
likewise contributed to the increased total imports.

<HEADLINE> Solution of Cyprus Issue Not Precondition for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair has reconfirmed that the political solution of the Cyprus
issue is not a precondition for Cyprus' accession to the European
Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a Labour Party meeting in London, Blair also
promised that his government will give more time for the solution
of the Cyprus issue, the Cyprus News Agency (CNA) reported on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Blair said Cyprus' accession to EU is not dependent on the
success of negotiations for a settlement of the division issue of
the island.
</P>
<P>
He said "so far as we are concerned, anything we can to bring
about a solution to the problem of Cyprus we will do it."
</P>
<P>
Blair also said he supports Turkey's candidacy to the EU,
despite Ankara's negative attitude regarding the effort for the
solution of the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
"That means the same rules apply to Turkey as they apply to any
other country," Blair said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that "it is in the interests of the EU as a whole
that in enlarging itself over the next few years we open up
toward Turkey on the basis of the EU rules. So that there is no
discrimination against (Turkey) and no special favors."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus applied for EU membership in 1990 and started
substantive accession negotiations with the EU in November
1998. It hopes to be admitted as an EU member by January 2003.
</P>
<P>
International efforts to reunite the divided island through a
bicommunal settlement were stalled due to the demands of the
Turkish Cypriots and Ankara that the breakaway Turkish Cypriot
state, backed by Ankara, be recognized and talks with Nicosia be
held on a state-to state basis.

<HEADLINE> Violators of Village Autonomy Law Will Be Punished: Legislators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Violation of villagers' right
to autonomy, which means direct elections of village heads, will
be punishable according to penal codes as the code is now being
revised, legislators Gu Jinchi and Zhao Cong said here today.
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise, the most needed additions will be further delayed
for years if it fails this time," said Gu when discussing an
amendment draft on the 1997 Criminal Law. Gu is member of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, China's top
legislative body.
</P>
<P>
The Law on the Organization of Villagers' Committees which was
installed in 1986 and revised two years ago have been embraced by
rural residents with warm welcome, said Zhao Cong, member of the
NPC Internal and Judicial Affairs Committee.
</P>
<P>
"However, instances of violation of the law have been rather
frequent," he said, noting some local government have been found
to illegally meddle in and manipulate elections of village heads
or dismiss legitimate village heads out of direct villagers'
voting.
</P>
<P>
"Such illegal practices are hard to be redressed for there is
no specific punishment in the penal code," he said.
</P>
<P>
Legal experts pointed out that the existing criminal law covers
the election of deputies to people's congresses at various levels
and heads of governments but stops short of the election of
village heads.
</P>
<P>
Due to this laxation, public complaints on village autonomy
topped the number of all complaints handled by the civil affairs
departments of the government this year.
</P>
<P>
The amendment draft tabled with the top legislature on Monday
proposed additions to and intensified crackdowns on dishonest
accountants, vicious futures traders and officials who are
unreasonably irresponsible and cause extremely serious
consequences.
</P>
<P>
Most legislators agree with the proposed revisions and
suggested that they be adopted as soon as possible for early
implementation.

<HEADLINE> Romania Counts on 1 Billion Dollar Foreign Loans in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Romania is counting on one
billion U.S. dollars in foreign loans next year to avert the
effects of a rise in budget deficit and public debt, Romanian
National Bank (BNR) governor Mugur Isarescu told the local daily
Curentul on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, Romania's budget deficit is estimated at 3.9 percent
of gross domestic product (GDP) while the public debt stands at
some 3.6 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
BNR chief economist Valentin Lazea said recently that Romania's
foreign debt accounts for less than 25 percent of the GDP, which
enables Romania to contract more loans on the foreign market,
providing it heeds the deadlines and repays interests in time.
</P>
<P>
The bank governor pointed out that right after passing the peak
of its 2-billion-dollar foreign debt repayment for this year,
Romania has built up its foreign reserves to the current 1.5
billion dollars through constant foreign currency purchases.
</P>
<P>
He commented that the reserves building-up is likely to render
credibility in contracting fresh loans, adding that the BNR
foreign reserves are expected to exceed 2 billion dollars next
year.
</P>
<P>
Isarescu also insisted that the fiscal deficit and public debt
continue to be the most serious problems likely to afflict Romania
next year.
</P>
<P>
However, the deficit and debt may be avoided by enacting a
proper strategy and contracting major foreign loans, he said.
</P>
<P>
Given the present high interest rates for credits on the
foreign market, a rush to acquire loans on the foreign market is
unfounded, he added.

<HEADLINE> Visitor Arrivals Show Major Rebound In HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Visitors to Hong Kong from
all major markets recorded a healthy growth in September, with
long-haul markets in particular showing a major rebound, according
to figures released Thursday by the Hong Kong Tourist Association
(HKTA).
</P>
<P>
Total visitor arrivals for September reached 829,541, up 13
percent on September 1998 while the cumulative figure is 7,727,874,
representing a growth rate of 11.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Business traffic to Hong Kong increased due to the return of
investor confidence in Asia, and there were also increases in the
numbers of visitors from long-haul markets attending major trade
fairs, conferences and exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
Trade and consumer promotional activities held in most markets
earlier in the year and highly competitive air fares and packages
also played important roles in lifting arrivals figures for the
start of Hong Kong's traditional peak tourism season.
</P>
<P>
Visitor arrivals from Australia, New Zealand and the South
Pacific rose by 13.8 percent; Europe, Africa and the Middle East,
by 9.2 percent; and the Americas by 8.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The short-haul markets continue to perform well, with Southeast
Asia showing a 22.9-percent growth and China's mainland and North
Asia 15.1 percent and 7.6 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
HKTA Executive Director Amy Chan said these most encouraging
results at the start of the third quarter prompted the HKTA to
comfortably adjust its 1999 forecast to 10.4 million visitor
arrivals.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea to Play Maverick Midfielder Against China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 28 (Xinhua) -- South Korean coach Huh Jung-
Moo threw down the gauntlet to his Chinese counterpart Bobby
Houghton by declaring midfield wonder boy Go Jung-Su will be
called to action for Friday's second leg Olympic qualifying
showdown with the home side.
</P>
<P>
"Yes, he will play," said an ever terse Huh. "But beyond that
I have nothing else to tell you."
</P>
<P>
Go, who had the experience of participating in last year's
World Cup finals with the senior South Korean team and even scored
a goal, is widely tipped as the most talented attacking midfielder
in the country and being the South Korean answer to Manchester
United and England midfielder David Beckham.
</P>
<P>
Like Beckham off the field, Go had a much-publisized private
life for which a disciplinarian Huh had dispelled him from the
team claiming the national heartthrob would never return under his
coaching term.
</P>
<P>
But Huh went back on his words one week ago by calling him up
to an Olympic squad which has been critisized as "being short of
sparkles up front" despite winning both of the two previous games,
and receded even further Thursday at a news conference saying Go
would definitely play -- though not necessarily crack into the
start line-up-- Friday night.
</P>
<P>
It was reported in the South Korean that Huh once said the
introduction of Go who has yet to fully recover from a knee injury
would be a psychlogical move rather than a tactical one.
</P>
<P>
"It would be great if he can be fit enough for the match, even
if only for a couple of minutes, but if not, it would be good all
the same from the psychological point of view," Huh was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Go himself considered he has not been ready for an entire 90-
minute match but that would not foil him leading his fellow South
Koreans to an away victory which will literally book them a berth
in next year's Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"As far as my health is concerned, I'm only fit for a half game,
" he said. "But we can still win even on the Chinese home turf
since we're the stronger side."

<HEADLINE> Zyuganov Confident in Winning Presidential Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Russian Communist leader
Gennady Zyuganov Thursday expressed his confidence in winning next
summer's presidential elections at a news conference, according to
reports from Interfax.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov did not say it explicitly but hinted that "the
elections will be won by a patriot from the People's Patriotic
Union".
</P>
<P>
When asked "Whether the winner would be himself", Zyuganov
nodded, but said nothing.
</P>
<P>
"This dragon (the ruling party) has three heads already. They
are now mainly fighting among themselves," said Zyuganov.
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, it is our job to persuade the citizens to form a
strong team, to create a realistic program, to do everything to
work effectively," he said.
</P>
<P>
As the largest opposition movement in Russia, the People's
Patriotic Union currently holds the majority in State Duma, the
lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
The Union was established on August 7, 1996, when it elected
its governing bodies and a 150-member coordinating council led by
Zyuganov and other four co-chairmen from left-wing parties.
</P>
<P>
In 1996's presidential elections, Zyuganov was the strongest
rival to President Boris Yeltsin.

SEOUL, October 28 (Xinhua) -- South Korea has decided to set up
early next year a large scale free trade zone in Kunjang,
southwest of the country, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean Commerce, Industry and Energy Ministry said

information, communications, aircraft parts and new material.
</P>
<P>
Of the total designated area, 1.15 million square meters will
be used as factories and the rest for housing, schools and other
public facilities.

LONDON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Manchester United will not

having already qualified for the last 16 of Europe's Champions

<HEADLINE> U.S. Economy Increases 4.8 Percent in Third Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economy increased
at an annual rate of 4.8 percent in the third quarter of 1999, the
fastest pace since a 5.9 percent surge in the final three months
of last year, the Commerce Department reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The department also revised up the growth rate of the second
quarter to 1.9 percent from the previous estimation of 1.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
Even though the trade deficit worsened further in the third
quarter, it was offset by strength in most other categories,
including robust consumer spending and a strong buildup in
inventories held by businesses.
</P>
<P>
The consumer spending, which accounts for two thirds of the
U.S. economy, rose at a solid annual rate of 4.3 percent in the
third quarter, down slightly from 5.1 percent growth in the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
Businesses, confident that consumers will keep spending,
increased their stockpiles by 14.1 billion U.S. dollars in the
third quarter. A slowdown in inventory building and the worsening
trade deficits were the major factors holding back growth in the
second quarter.
</P>
<P>
Real business investment increased 14.9 percent in the third
quarter, compared with an increase of 7 percent in the previous
quarter. Equipment and software increased 21.7 percent, compared
with an increase of 11.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
America's swelling trade deficit subtracted 343 billion dollars
from GDP in the third quarter at an annual rate, an even bigger
drag than in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
An inflation gauge tied to the gross domestic product (GDP), a
measure of the total output of goods and services, also showed
modest price pressures, rising at an annual rate of 1.6 percent in
the third quarter. That was even better than the tiny 1.9 percent
increase for the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
In a separate report, the Labor Department said American
workers' wages and benefits rose by 0.8 percent in the third
quarter, slightly lower than the 0.9 percent increase many
economists were expecting, indicating little inflationary
pressures coming from rising wages. In the past 12 months,
employment costs rose a moderate 3.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
In a third report, the government said that the number of
Americans filing for unemployment benefits last week fell by
15,000 to 278,000, indicating that the labor market remains
exceptionally tight.
</P>
<P>
All of Thursday's figures reflected a comprehensive overhaul in
the way the government calculates the GDP, making changes in the
figures back to 1959. The GDP revisions showed the economy grew at
a significantly faster rate in recent years with an increase in
1998 of 4.3 percent and an even bigger 4.5 percent rise in 1997,
the fastest surge in economic activity in 13 years.
</P>
<P>
The changes also show lower inflation and Americans saving more
than previously thought.
</P>
<P>
The other major change the government made in its GDP
calculations was a redefinition of how to account for business
spending on computer software. Previously, these purchases were
considered a raw material and not counted as part of GDP. Under
the new approach, business purchases of software are considered an
investment and do add to the GDP totals.
</P>
<P>
The government in its overhaul also changed the base year for
prices from 1992 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
All the various changes show the GDP growing at an annual rate
of 8.88 trillion dollars in inflation-adjusted dollars in the
third quarter of the year. Before adjusting for inflation, GDP in
the third quarter totaled 9.28 trillion dollars.

<HEADLINE> EU, China to Start Program of Legal Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
Thursday that it has selected a European consortium led by the
British Council to implement a legal and judicial cooperation
program between the European Union (EU) and China.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive arm said in a statement that the 13.2-million-
euro (about 14 million U.S. dollars) program, which was subject to
an open tender procedure, aims to support efforts to strengthen
the rule of law in China.
</P>
<P>
The program, which begins in March 2000, will involve training
and awareness raising activities for Chinese legal workers.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, selected lawyers, judges and prosecutors
from China will be exposed to key areas of EU and national laws
such as civil and criminal procedure, administrative law, consumer
protection, competition law, and intellectual property rights, it
said.
</P>
<P>
The EU-China legal and judicial cooperation program will also
improve the environment for European business and investment in
China, it added.
</P>
<P>
This program will be the largest and most far-reaching
international cooperation project of its kind in China, the EU
statement said.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese English coach Bobby
Houghton, in a rare move, declined to name the start line-up for
Friday's must-win Olympic qualifier against South Korea.
</P>
<P>
"I can't give you the team for the time being, " Houghton said
Thursday. "It would be a very bad policy to name the team before
the last training session."
</P>
<P>
The injury problem has improved but there are still one or two
doubts which stopped him from announcing the first-choice eleven
at the pre-match press conference as he usually did, Houghton said.
</P>
<P>
But no surprises should be anticipated, an ever cautious
Houghton warned: "I have no magic strokes to pull. "
</P>
<P>
The Chinese 23 Thursday night have the last chance to show
their stuff to the Englishman in a close door practice ahead of
Friday's showdown with South Korea which they could not afford to
lose.
</P>
<P>
Despite having some statistic advantages over their east Asian
neighbours in their first leg encounter in Seoul on October 3, the
Chinese Olympic side lost 0-1 and now face an up-hill battle to
qualify for next year's Sydney Olympics in a tournament where only
top finishers from three groups advance.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, keeping perfect record with two modest wins --
over China and Bahrain by the same 1-0 scoreline -- seems to be
the answer from Asian Group B while China, on a 1-1 record and
three points, could only count on a big win Friday night to turn
around the tide.

<HEADLINE> National Legislature Urged to Curb Police Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese lawmakers today urged
the establishment of a mechanism under which police corruption and
malpractice can be monitored and curbed.
</P>
<P>
The National People's Congress (NPC), China's highest
legislative body, has worked out a provisional draft on related
regulations giving itself and local legislatures jurisdiction over
major misjudged cases and illegal activities of judges and law
enforcement officers.
</P>
<P>
But some legislators are still dissatisfied because the police
authority has not been included in the supervision scheme.
</P>
<P>
"Nowadays the people not only complain about judicial
corruption, but also are angry with some misbehavior by the police,
such as overcharging, illegally imposing fines, and inquisition by
torture to extort a confession," Song Qingwei, member of the
Foreign Affairs Committee of the NPC Standing Committee, said at
the ongoing 12th meeting of the NPC Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
Some NPC Standing Committee members argued that public security
departments, together with courts and procuratorates, are judicial
organs and should be under supervision of the People's Congress
according to China's Constitution.
</P>
<P>
"Supervision will enable the police themselves to discover
wrong deeds more efficiently, thus negative impacts on society can
be reduced," said Wu Zengrong.
</P>
<P>
Wu added that the people's expectations for the People's
Congress at all levels is growing higher.
</P>
<P>
The members agreed that drawing up a Supervision Law will be
the legislature's next powerful measure to oversee government and
judicial organs, and the experience nowadays should be valuable
for legislation in the future.

<HEADLINE> Survey Says European Firms Not Ready For E-Commerce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Large European Companies have
recognized the long-term potential of electronic commerce but have
not invested sufficient funds to reap the benefits, according to a
study published recently by Pricewaterhouse, an international
consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
In the title of "Competing in the Internet Age - Challenges for
Incumbents", the study said only four percent of European
companies surveyed invest more than 10 percent of their turnover
in the development of on-line commerce, while a half of the
companies are not involved in electronic commerce and have no
plans at present to move into the area.
</P>
<P>
Only 11 percent of the firms questioned have implemented
complete Internet solutions, and more than a third acknowledge
that they lack the necessary expertise to develop an Internet
strategy. About 26 percent of the companies expressed desire to
reach more than 90 percent of their clients via the Internet, but
only one percent are able to do so, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, one company in four believes that firms operating on
the Internet will pose a serious threat to their activities within
three years. The majority of the companies surveyed therefore
regarded electronic commerce primarily as a defense strategy.
</P>
<P>
Companies trading with other businesses invest less than those
serving private clients, the European Report, one of the European
Union publications, quoted the survey as saying.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that European Companies are lagging well
behind their American counterparts, the European Report said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it reveals that most companies are adopting a
defensive stance on the issues of electronic commerce, showing an
interest in the Internet but failing to maximize its potential.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Hold Presidential Poll on December 21 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka will hold the
presidential poll on December 21, more than 10 months ahead of the
scheduled November next year, elections chief said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The poll will take place between 7:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. on
December 21, 1999 at 9897 polling stations," said acting
Commissioner of Elections M.C. Arunthavachelvam in a press
release.
</P>
<P>
Arunthavachelvam said, "nominations will be received during the
period 9:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. on November 16, 1999 at the
Elections Secretariat."
</P>
<P>
He said a sum of 50,000 rupees (697 U.S. dollars) each on
behalf of candidates of a recognized political party and 75,000
rupees (1,046 dollars) in respect of any other candidate should be
deposited, according to the Presidential Elections Act by noon
November 15.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga declared on October
20 that the presidential election will be held in two to three
months.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, people expressed worries that the polling date might
clash with students' ordinary level examination scheduled to be
held from December 11 to 24 and the holy month of fasting for
Muslims which begins on December 10.
</P>
<P>
School buildings are usually used as examination centers and as
polling booths, meaning that both cannot be held at the same time.
</P>
<P>
Although the Education Ministry said on Wednesday the students'
examination has been brought forward and will be held from
December 6 to 17, the presidential election is set to clash with
the Muslim Ramadan fast which might provoke angry reactions from
Muslims which make up eight percent of the population of 18.5
million.
</P>
<P>
About 11.8 million electors are expected to vote at the
election.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that the main battle will be fought
between President Kumaratunga and the leader of the main
opposition United National Party Ranil Wickremesinghe although the
JVP or People's Liberation Front, Sri Lanka's third largest party,
also nominated a candidate.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's NPLs Likely to Fall to 15 Pct Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Non-performing loans (NPLs) in
the Thai banking system is likely to fall to 15 percent of total
loans in the first quarter of next year, against 46 percent at the
present, due to improved economy and corporate debt restructuring,
a senior Thai banking executive said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar on "Prospects of the Thai Economy in the
Year 2000," Staporn Chinajitr, a senior executive of Siam
Commercial Bank, arrived at that rough estimate by expecting that
doubtful debts will fall by 10 percent of total loans from the
present more than 40 percent to 30 percent and that debt
restructuring will bring down the NPLs from 30 percent to 15
percent.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is still plagued by the persistently high NPLs level,
which stalls full economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
Of the 5.5 trillion baht (141 billion U.S. dollars) loans in
the Thai banking system, about 2.7 trillion baht (69.2 billion
U.S. dollars) is classified as NPLs.
</P>
<P>
Staporn expected that one third of the NPLs, which is
equivalent to 18 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP), will
be lost or be written off.
</P>
<P>
However, he said if the economy recovers by five to six percent
in annual growth, it will help absorb the damage from the NPLs in
four years.
</P>
<P>
In the latest letter of intent to the International Monetary
Fund, the Thai government has pledged to reduce the NPLs by
encouraging banks to set up their own asset management companies.
The government will remove tax and other legal obstacles that
stand in the way of corporate debt restructuring.

<HEADLINE> Australian Sharemarket Closes Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The Australian sharemarket
rallied almost 1 percent Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark All Ordinaries Index finished 25.9 points or 0.92
percent higher at 2,855.4, led by the Industrials Index which
gained 57.4 points to 4,952.9.
</P>
<P>
The market was encouraged by the remarks of the Reserve Bank's
Governor Ian MacFarlane that policy changes will be a good deal
smaller than in the past. This indicated that a rise in interest
rates would be smaller than earlier expected.
</P>
<P>
Banks are nearly all keeping up strongly with regard to
interest rates. The National Australia Bank jumped 44 cents to
14.97 U.S. dollars. On Wednesday, the bank announced an alliance
with two of the world's biggest telecommunications companies, AT&AMP;T
and BT. The Commonwealth surged 53 cents to 16.35 U.S. dollars,
Westpac bank jumped 22.1 cents to 6.42 U.S. dollars and the ANZ
bank leapt 30 cents to 6.7 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Telecommunication stocks also fared well with Telstra ordinary
shares rising 7 cents to 4.55 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
National turnover was 513.41 million shares worth 904 million
U.S. dollars with rises outpacing falls by 765 to 589 while 524
others remained steady.

<HEADLINE> Manila Moves to Boost Mindanao's Rural Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
identifying critical rural infrastructure projects to help
transform Mindanao into the country's food basket, a senior
official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The government has directed fund injection to finance the
conduct of studies for projects critical to improving the
agricultural industry in the area, Philippine News Agency quoted
Agrarian Reform Secretary Horacio Morales as saying.
</P>
<P>
Morales said the government wants Mindanao to become a modern,
self-reliant island economy, instead of being a mere supplier of
food and raw materials to other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
"We want to see a modernized and diversified Mindanao so that
it can become a strong and independent regional economy," Morales
said.
</P>
<P>
With its rich natural resources and ideal climate for
agriculture, Mindanao has the brightest future for agri-industrial
development. But for now, he said, it must have improved
infrastructure, particularly irrigation and farm-to-market roads.
</P>
<P>
Morales noted that Mindanao has only 30 percent of the
country's irrigation infrastructure although the island accounts
for 44 percent of the nation's total food trade.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the government has put in place a particular
program, which involves farm production services and construction
of new and rehabilitation of old irrigation facilities.
</P>
<P>
The program is also aimed at improving the rural credit program
and providing marketing support services and policy reform to
increase investments in the Philippines' second largest island, he
added.

"No, there has been no such agreement," Mutawakil told the

Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia and a third Islamic country decide the
fate of bin Laden.

Accusing the Saudi dissident of sponsoring terrorist attacks on
U.S. interests worldwide, Washington has kept pressing the Taliban

However, the Taliban have consistently rejected the U.S.
demands, saying Washington failed to provide evidence of bin

Manila, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada on Thursday sternly warned developers against committing
any kind of anomaly in the government's socialized housing
program, said reports reaching here form the Visayas.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony of the Chamber of Real Estate
and Builders Association Convention (CREBAC) held in Iloilo City,
the Visayas, Estrada said the government will not tolerate any
irregularity in the program and will mete out stiff punishment to
those who will shortchange the masses.
</P>
<P>
"I know that among the problems of our housing program are the
crooked acts of some of the developers. I am not accusing everyone
but to those who will commit such acts, watch out," Philippine
News Agency quoted Estrada as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Don't ever forget that my administration will not let any
anomaly in the housing program go unpunished, especially if it
will inflict harm on the poor," he added.
</P>
<P>
The president also reminded the CREBAC of the heavy
responsibility they face in helping the people achieve their
aspirations to live in dignity in their own homes.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said he made mass housing a centerpiece program of his
pro-poor and pro-business administration, adding that the target
for next year is to build 350,000 housing units.
</P>
<P>
The president said the program will be carried out with efforts
focused on providing housing for the bottom, accounting for 30
percent of the nation's total population.

<HEADLINE> Indian Government Introduces Reform Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government
Thursday took the first major step toward further economic reform
by introducing two major economic bills in Lok Sabha, the lower
house of the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The two bills were the Security Law Amendment Bill to allow
derivatives in the stock exchange and the Insurance Regulatory
Authority and Development Bill to open up the insurance sector.
</P>
<P>
However, a few opposition parties described the insurance bill
as "anti-national and a sell-out to multinationals" and staged a
protest walkout from the legislature after nearly 100 minutes of
procedural wrangles and other objections to the bill's
introduction by Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha.
</P>
<P>
Sinha explained that there was a 26-percent foreign equity cap
as recommended by the Parliament Standing Committee on Finance.
</P>
<P>
The bill provides for phased reduction in the equity of private
domestic players from 74 percent to 26 percent in 10 years, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Sinha made it clear that there was no move to privatize Life
Insurance and General Insurance Corporations as alleged by some
opposition parties and asserted that the bill did not provide for
any dilution of 100-percent government equity in the two premier
companies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Congress-affiliated All India National Life
Insurance Employees Federation will stage a one-day strike Friday
to protest against the introduction of the insurance bill.
</P>
<P>
"The introduction of the bill is a blatant submission of the
government to pressure of multinational companies and their
respective governments of affluent western countries," the
federation said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Foreign-Funded Ventures Help Shanghai's Foreign Trade Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai today reported a year-
on-year growth of nearly 24 percent in its import and export
business for the first eight months this year, 16 percentage
points higher than the national average.
</P>
<P>
At today's policy consulting meeting of foreign businesses'
Shanghai representative offices, Wu Chenglin, deputy director in
charge of Shanghai's foreign economic and trade commission,
attributed the sharp increase of 23.72 percent to the good
performance of foreign-funded enterprises in the city.
</P>
<P>
Customs figures show that during the eight-month period,
foreign-funded enterprises in Shanghai exported 6.48 billion U.S.
dollars worth of goods and imported 7.15 billion, rising 32.74
percent and 16.78 percent, respectively, from a year earlier, and
accounting for 56.44 percent and 61.93 percent of Shanghai's total
for the same period.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that high-tech and high value-added products had the
highest growth rate in export and import. Export of such products

<HEADLINE> China to Build First Underground Gas Storage Facility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 28 (Xinhua)-- China will build its first
underground natural gas storage facility in north China's Dagang
Oilfield, the country's sixth-largest oil production base, in a
bid to adjust the seasonal gas supply for Beijing, according to
the China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC).
</P>
<P>
The project consists of an underground gas storage, an above
ground gas treatment plant and compression plant, as well as gas
pipelines, with an investment of 1.3 billion to 1.5 billion yuan,
said Zhang Yu, manager of the Underground Storage Division under
Beijing Gas Transmission Co.
</P>
<P>
Gas pipelines between Beijing and the underground storage
facility are under construction and will be completed by this
December, while the entire project will be put into operation by
November next year, he added.
</P>
<P>
The underground facility, actually not a man-made underground
gas tank but a gas-bearing stratum, covers an area of 5.7 square
kilometers at a depth reaching 2,650 meters, said He Xian, vice-
dean of the Drilling and Exploitation Institute of the Dagang
Oilfield.
</P>
<P>
Dagang is suitable as a site for underground storage thanks to
its stable geologic structure and large storage volume, he added.
</P>
<P>
The underground storage will hold about 1.6 billion cubic
meters of gas, some one billion cubic meters of which will act as
an air bed to provide enough pressure for exploitation, he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that with this underground facility, at least
600 million cubic meters of gas, which remains idle in summer, can
be stored there and exploited again in winter when needed.
</P>
<P>
According to the official source, Beijing consumed only 270,000
cubic meters of gas daily between April and June in 1998, while
its highest daily gas consumption in winter topped 3.22 million cu
m.
</P>
<P>
Underground storage has proved to be an efficient way to adjust
the seasonal gas supply for big cities and is widely used in many
countries, while underground storage in Dagang is the first of its
kind in China.

<HEADLINE> Large Relics Park to be Built in Henan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, October 28 (Xinhua) -- A large relics park will be
built on the ruins of a Shang Dynasty (16th BC - 11th BC) city
within three years in central China's Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
The Yanshi Shang City, also known as "China's Troy", was
discovered in 1983 and listed as one of the year's 17 major
discoveries by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization.
</P>
<P>
Experts have proved that Yanshi was the first capital city of
the Shang Dynasty, and the ruins of palaces in the city are the
only imperial palaces of the Xia, Shang and Zhou dynasties -- the
first three dynasties in Chinese history, that have been found.
</P>
<P>
The excavation and protection of the ruins has made good
progress during the past 16 years. But the rapid development of
urban construction has nibbled away the area of the precious
cultural heritage, and about half of the ruins have been occupied
by new factories, shops, restaurants and residences.
</P>
<P>
To better protect the relics, experts at the Institute of
Archeology under the Chinese Academy of Sciences designed a park
on the ruins, which was approved by the State Administration of
Cultural Heritage.
</P>
<P>
According to the design, the modern structures will be cleared
out from the ruins, and some ancient palaces and other ruins will
be excavated by next year. In 2001, all the residences and other
structures will be removed 50 meters way from the ancient city,
and greenery and other infrastructure needed for the protection of
the relics will be created in their stead.

<HEADLINE> Better Way to Write Chinese Characters Developed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 28 (Xinhua) -- A more efficient way to write
Chinese characters with computers using numbers has been developed,
making it easier for most Chinese to use computers to type Chinese
characters electronically.
</P>
<P>
Wang Songping, who developed the Chinese Keyed Entry (CKE)
method, said the new method will make personal computers more user-
friendly for ordinary Chinese, thus removing one of the major
obstacles to using computers in ordinary Chinese households.
</P>
<P>
Fewer than five percent of Chinese households now have personal
computers because it is time-consuming for people to learn the use
of English keyboards and other traditional ways of typing Chinese
characters electronically.
</P>
<P>
The new method generally uses only three or four digits to type
a Chinese character or phrase by using the numbers on the keyboard,
Wang said during a demonstration on Thursday in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"It takes only half an hour for people to learn to write
Chinese characters electronically this way," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
It usually takes several months for Chinese people who do not
know how to use English-language keyboards to learn how to write
Chinese characters electronically.
</P>
<P>
Based on this new method, a new micro-chip has been developed
for use in mobile phones to display short Chinese phrases on the
liquid screen, which is expected to be marketed by the end of this
year by Xiamen Overseas Electronics Co and Zhongxin
Telecommunications Co, two Chinese state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The new method for mobile phone use is more efficient than the
one used by United States electronics giant Motorola.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Motorola marketed the world's first mobile
phone able to display short Chinese phrases on the screen.
</P>
<P>
Wang's method can also be used in other electronic and
telecommunications products, such as video compact disc players
and electronic notebooks.
</P>
<P>
About 100,000 copies of the software developed by Wang Songping
have been sold overseas and in China so far.

BAGHDAD, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Trade Ministry on
Thursday accused the U.S. and British representatives at the
U.N. Sanctions Committee of blocking its six new contracts
with foreign companies under the oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
An unnamed spokesman for the ministry said the six contracts
were put on hold by the U.S. and British envoys during the recent
sessions of the Sanctions Committee.
</P>
<P>
Those six contracts were signed under the fifth and sixth
phases of the oil-for-food deal with companies from France,
Russia, Italy, Vietnam and India for the purchases of medical
spare parts and pumps, he added.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food deal now in its sixth phase which
expires in November, Iraq is allowed to sell a limited amount of
oil in every six months to buy food, medicine and other
humanitarian supplies for its 24 million people.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has long accused the U.S. and British envoys in the

arguing that the oil-for-food deal has failed to alleviate the

<HEADLINE> Arafat's Top Aid Rebukes Death Sentence Verdict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat's top aid in Lebanon Sultan Abul-Ainayn Thursday rebuked a
death sentence given him by a Beirut military court.
</P>
<P>
"It is not a judicial verdict. It has political motives behind
it that target the entire Palestinian people and their cause,"
said Abul-Ainayn at a news conference in Rashidieh Palestinian
camp, near Lebanon's southern-most port city of Tyre.
</P>
<P>
The court Wednesday night sentenced Abul-Ainayn to death in
absentia on charges of forming and heading an armed gang with the
purpose of committing crimes against the people and their
properties and to defy the authority of the Lebanese state.
</P>
<P>
He was also convicted of possessing and trafficking in
unlicensed weapons, for which he was given an extra one-year jail
term.
</P>
<P>
Abul-Ainayn is the secretary general of the Palestinian
Liberation Organization in Lebanon and also heads the Lebanon
branch of Arafat's mainstream faction Fatah Movement.
</P>
<P>
The Beirut press said the surprise move against Abul-Ainayn
might have been motivated by the recent re-emergence of Fatah at
the Ein El-Hilweh camp near the southern port city of Sidon.
</P>
<P>
The Ein El-Hilweh camp is the biggest among the 12 shantytowns
that house an estimated 360,000 Palestinian refugees in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In the past, the Ein El-Hilweh camp was dominated by the rival
Syrian-backed Palestinian factions, which are opposed to Arafat's
peace process with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Syria, a undisputed powerbroker in Lebanon, has been a foe of
Arafat since he unilaterally concluded the Oslo peace accords with
the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Abul-Ainayn said that he was not prepared to turn himself over
to the Lebanese authorities, which are controlling all entrances
to the Rashidieh camp.
</P>
<P>
There is no indication that Lebanese troops or police would try
to flush out Abul-Ainayn from the camp.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese authorities have long abstained from entering any
Palestinian refugee camp to avoid possible bloodshed, leaving the
shantytowns to be administrated by local Palestinian factions.

<TEXT>
<P>
ZHONGSHAN, Guangdong Province, China, October 28 (Xinhua) --
Belgium's Jean-Michel Saive, who cut short his vacation to accept
a surprise invitation to the World Cup table tennis tournament,
upset Chinese Liu Guoliang in his first group match of the annual
event here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Saive, a late replacement of defending champion Jorg Rosskopf
of Germany who opted out of the World Cup to recover from a
shoulder surgery, clinched his third career win over reigning
world champion, 17-21, 21-12, 21-15.
</P>
<P>
"I will have a vacation before every major event," joked the
Belgian, who was jumping and hugging his coach after the hard-
fought victory.
</P>
<P>
"Saive got used to my service and he played a very aggressive
game," said Liu, the only second player after Sweden's Jan-Ove
Waldner to have won a "Grand Slam" of the Olympic, world
championships and World Cup singles titles.
</P>
<P>
World No. 5 Waldner easily overcame Austrian Qian Qianli 21-18,
21-11, while world No. 1 Vladimir Samsonov suffered a stunning 17-
21, 21-12, 21-18 loss to Werner Schlager, also of Austria.
</P>
<P>
Asian champion Wang Liqin was chopped down by the Japanese
defensive player Koji Matsushita, 21-14, 14-21, 21-15.
</P>
<P>
"Wang is too stupid to change tactics during the game," said
angry Chinese head coach Cai Zhenhua.
</P>
<P>
In the day's other games, 1995 world championships and World
Cup winner Kong Linghui from China nipped Argentina's Liu Song 21-
13, 21-17; Asian Games champion Kim Taek Soo downed Peter Jackson

PARIS, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammed
Khatami met French business leaders and visited the Pantheon
museum in Paris on Thursday, the second day of his three-day visit
to France.
</P>
<P>
Khatami had a breakfast meeting with the chiefs of some 40
French enterprises, including those of oil, automobile and
transport industries, at the Matigny state guest house.
</P>
<P>
He then paid a visit to Pantheon in the Latin university
district of Paris, in which the ashes of some prominent Frenchmen,
such as Voltaire, Rousseau and Zola, were sheltered.
</P>
<P>
Khatami is likely to make a speech at the general assembly of
the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO) later on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He failed to pay the visit on Wednesday because of disagreement
between UNESCO and the Iranian government over security measures
to be deployed at the UNESCO headquarters.
</P>
<P>
He held talks with President Jacques Chirac and met Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Khatami was the first Iranian head of state to visit France
since the 1979 Islamic revolution.

TEHRAN, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Three Afghan drug traffickers
were hanged on Thursday in Karaj, about 100 kilometers west of the
Iranian capital Tehran, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.

<P>
NANJING, October 28 (Xinhua) -- China's traffic police are
applying various means, including lifters, to ease burdensome
traffic problems.
</P>
<P>
Shijiazhuang, the capital of Beijing's neighboring province of
Hebei, applied lifters traffic posts so that police can stand at a
much higher position to oversee rush-hour traffic.
</P>
<P>
Nanjing, capital city of east China's Jiangsu Province, spent
more than 20 million yuan (about 2.4 million U.S. dollars) to
renovate its traffic control system. Traffic police in the city
are now on motorcycle patrol rather than stationary for better
traffic control enforcement.
</P>
<P>
Local residents also find billboards in their communities
posted with traffic tips on how to walk in traffic and ride a bike
safely.
</P>
<P>
Three months of intensive management of city traffic began in
July and has resulted in fewer traffic accidents and traffic jams,
according to a seminar on city traffic management which closed
here today.
</P>
<P>
Participants in five groups spent nine days inspecting traffic
in 17 provinces and municipalities prior to the seminar.

HEBEI, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The Hebei Provincial Art Center
in north China was completed today, and is ready to accommodate
acrobatics, circus, opera and symphony performances, or fashion
shows.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming 7th International Wuqiao Acrobatics Festival of
China will be held in the new art center, starting on October 30.
</P>
<P>
Located on Yuhua Road in Shijiazhuang, capital of Hebei
Province, the art center looks like a flower in full bloom,
symbolizing the blossoming of Hebei.
</P>
<P>
The Acrobatic Hall with 2,800 seats is the main hall of the
center. The stage inside the hall is 32 meters long and 25 meters
wide, the largest of its kind in China.
</P>
<P>
The International Wuqiao Acrobatics Festival of China is the
third largest in the world, next to the troupes from Monte Carlo
and Paris.
</P>
<P>
In China, acrobatic festivals are often held in gymnasiums,
making some programs very difficult to perform. The newly
completed art center has solved this problem and all kinds of
programs from all over the world are possible there.
</P>
<P>
The 2.3-hectare art center began construction in 1997 with an
investment of 200 million yuan (about 24 million US dollars).

<HEADLINE> Canadian Professor Converts Food Grease into Fuel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- A Canadian professor has created
a new technology that converts food grease into usable fuel, The
Globe and Mail reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The innovation could help restaurants deal with some of their
most revolting wastes while providing a low-polluting source of
energy, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Chemical engineer David Boocock of University of Toronto is to
hop on a grease-powered tractor at the university's downtown
campus Thursday, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
While most diesel engines spew sooty clouds of smoke, a grease
mobile emits an odor resembling the smells from a fast-food
restaurant, Dr. Boocock was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, we'll be getting this french-fry aroma coming out
of the exhaust," he said.
</P>
<P>
The new technology uses solvents to break down the large
molecules of oil in grease into smaller compounds that can be
burnt in a diesel engine.

<HEADLINE> Prospect of Japan-China Relations Bright, Noted Japanese Statesman (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 28 (Xinhua)-- Japan-China relations will enjoy
a bright future in the 21st century, said Koichi Kato, former
secretary-general of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) of Japan
here today in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The visiting Japanese statesman said the Japan-China
relationship is developing "upward" generally, although the past
27 years have witnessed "ups and downs" in bilateral ties since
the normalization of diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
Problems prop up sometimes in bilateral relations, but the two
countries have learned to face up to and handle them properly, and
through problem-solving, the two sides have built confidence to
further develop friendship, noted Koichi.
</P>
<P>
"Now Japan-China relations have entered a phase in which we do
not talk about friendship only, but we are making endeavors, and
what we are doing is itself a symbol of friendship," he said.
</P>
<P>
As a noted statesman in Japan, he values the role of political
figures in developing bilateral relations, and said that a major
part of the ties between the two countries was economic in recent
years, but the role of statesmen should not be neglected.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the statesmen of the two countries should do
more to enhance direct dialogue and engagement.
</P>
<P>
Mutual confidence should be the prerequisite for engagement and
the confidence between the two countries is largely based on
correct understanding of historical problems.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, the former general-secretary reiterated that
the Japanese stance on historical problems was clearly stated in
the joint communique for the normalization of diplomatic relations
between the two countries in 1972, and that former Japanese Prime
Minister Murayama Tomiichi also made it clear in his August 15
speech of 1995.
</P>
<P>
We should have a strong recognition of history based upon
sincere remorse for our aggression in the past, and I think this
policy is supported by the majority of Japanese people, he said,
adding that "I don't think that kind of basic recognition will be
altered in the future."

<HEADLINE> Angolan Opposition Appeals for Political Solution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- An Angolan opposition party
leader has called on the government to take advantage of a recent
military victory to find political solution to the long-term civil
war in the southwest African country.
</P>
<P>
Nzau Puna, president of the Tendency of Democratic Reflection
(TRD), was quoted by official sources as saying on Thursday, "if
the victory is not consubstantiated and accompanied with a
political action, the peace will still be long way off," said
</P>
<P>
Puna said the recentnce of Angola (UNITA) and a good
opportunity for political actions.
</P>
<P>
But Puna said that it was necessary for the government to
prevent the rebels from re-organizing which would lead to the
troublesome guerrilla war.
</P>
<P>
After conquering the two headquarters of UNITA, the Angolan
government troops have been ordered to pursue the rebels until an
overall victory.

<HEADLINE> Macao Economy Improves As Return Approaches (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The economy of Macao is
witnessing signs of improvement as it braces for its forthcoming
return to the Chinese motherland on December 20 of this year.
</P>
<P>
After five years of economic restructuring and the test of the
Asian financial storms, some pillar industries in Macao are
showing bright spots.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months this year, Macao received a total of 3.
6 million visitors, up six percent over the same period last year,
and completely reversing the falling trend over the last two years.
Its imports and exports also recorded sharp increases.
</P>
<P>
This and more have strengthened Macao's confidence in the
future. As long as it seizes the opportunity and speeds up
industrial restructuring, Macao will have a brighter future when
it returns to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Macao, like Hong Kong, has been a free port with free economic
policies.
</P>
<P>
In the past, Macao was one of the largest trading centers in
the Orient, and a transfer station between Europe and east Asia.
</P>
<P>
Its recent economic prime began in the early 1960s and lasted
till the early 1990s, when Macao enjoyed one of the world's
highest economic growths and established trade ties with over 100
countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
It was also during this period that Macao achieved a "micro-
economic miracle," created four pillar industries -- tourism and
gambling, exports and processing, finance and insurance, and real
estate.
</P>
<P>
At present, Macao's per capita gross domestic production (GDP)
stands at 16,000 U.S. dollars, ranking high among the countries
and regions of Asia.
</P>
<P>
Beginning in 1993, Macao's economy began to slow down. It saw
negative growths in both 1996 and 1998, and all of its pillar
industries encountered hard times.

<HEADLINE> S. African Govt Denies idea of Castration of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 28 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy
President Jacob Zuma's office Thursday denied media reports that
the government is considering chemical castration of repeat sexual
offenders.
</P>
<P>
It said the reports were without substance and misleading.
</P>
<P>
No such proposal had been tabled for consideration, Zuma's
spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
On whether Zuma was opposed to chemical castration, Mamoepa
told South African Press Association: "In his response to the
interpellation, the deputy president has not given his express
support for castration of rapists."
</P>
<P>
He was referring to Wednesday's interpellation debate in the
National Assembly, in which Inkatha Freedom Party parliamentarian
Sue Vos called for chemical castration to be considered for repeat
rapists.
</P>
<P>
In his reply, Zuma said the South African Law Commission (SALC)
was currently investigating the viability of chemical castration
for repeat offenders, and that government would study its report.
</P>
<P>
Zuma had indicated that the SALC -- acting within its
jurisdiction -- was investigating harsher sentences for repeat
sexual offenders, Mamoepa said.
</P>
<P>
The SALC was considering all relevant aspects and "appropriate
sentences within the human rights context".
</P>
<P>
"One of the issues the commission is investigating is the human
rights implications and feasibility of chemically castrating
repeat sexual offenders," Mamoepa said.
</P>
<P>
The SALC had not made any recommendations regarding possible
castration, and it was therefore incorrect to suggest that
government was considering this.
</P>
<P>
The defining feature of the Constitution was a strict adherence
to the rule of law, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government was confident that the commission would make
recommendations in line with the letter and spirit of the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
It remained committed to zero-tolerance of sexual offenders and
would ruthlessly deal with this scourge through long sentences of
imprisonment, Mamoepa said.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has the highest rape rate in the world.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Rural Women Involved in Socioeconomic Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Some 210 million rural women
have increasingly involved themselves in the country's economic
and social development to improve their social status, said vice
president of the All-China Women's Federation, Gu Xiulian ,at
today's press conference held by the Information Office of the
State Council.
</P>
<P>
She pointed that the image of most Chinese rural women has
changed from someone only concerned about household chores and a
belief in fate, to a new generation of women who care about
society and believe in science.
</P>
<P>
Gu said China is an agricultural country, and among the 320
million agricultural workers, women are 60.5 per cent. A great
number of males have moved to cities or township enterprises as
the result of agriculture restructuring, and Chinese rural women
are now shouldering a bigger role.
</P>
<P>
"The output value of agriculture the rural women create makes
up 50 to 60 percent of the total, and they have invented a
courtyard economy by planting crops in their courtyards," said she,
adding that this new economy now accounts for one-third of all
rural household income.
</P>
<P>
"The rural people are also striving to upgrade their education
while participating in production," said the vice president.
</P>
<P>
Twenty million illiterate rural women have learned how to read
and write and near 100 million women have mastered at least one
practical skill. Moreover, 15 million women have attended
correspondence colleges and schools, she said.
</P>
<P>
The rural women also show great interest in social activities.
They have donated to education, provided relief materials to
disaster areas, and helped support the poor. They also formed "the
Women's Society for Prohibiting Gambling" and "the Women's Society
for Prohibiting Drugs," she said.
</P>
<P>
A commending conference and an exhibition of the achievements
of rural women will be held in November, she added.

<HEADLINE> Macao Economy Improves As Return Approaches (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some economists attributed these economic problems to
simplistic economic structure and heavy independence upon a few
special industries.
</P>
<P>
For instance, gambling dominates Macao's economy, accounting
for over 25 percent of the GDP, and gambling income represent
about 40 percent of the government's revenues, while manufacturing
accounts for only about 20 percent of the GDP.
</P>
<P>
The recent worsening of social order, along with the impact of
Asia financial crisis, dealt a blow to the tourism and gambling
industries, which further exposed the irrationality of Macao's
industrial structure.
</P>
<P>
However, citizens in Macao are confident about its future
economic development.
</P>
<P>
Macao has many advantages and great potentials for further
economic development, such as a favorable geographic location,
close ties with the European Union and the United States, free
port status, and low tariffs.
</P>
<P>
More important is that Macao, after its return to China, will
enjoy the strong backing of the motherland, when the "China
elements" are expected to give a huge impetus to Macao's economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
Already, close economic cooperation has formed between Macao
and the inland areas, and Macao now ranks 10th among the largest
investors in the inland areas and the inland areas are playing an
important role in Macao's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Now, local people are seizing the opportunity of Macao's coming
return to the motherland, and promoting Macao to the rest of the
world as an ideal tourist destination.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the future Macao Special Administrative Region
government, led by Edmund Ho Hau Wah, is actively working on
blueprints for the region's long-term development.
</P>
<P>
People in Macao have every confidence that as long as they
unite as one and work hard, the region will complete its economic
restructuring at an earlier date.

<HEADLINE> Africa Needs for New Strategies to Combat AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 28 (Xinhua) (C Zambian Deputy Minister of
Health Ernest Mwansa has called for a revisit of the existing
strategies of combating the HIV/AIDS pandemic in the Central and
Southern African region, amid growing concern over the
devastating impact of the problem in the region.
</P>
<P>
He told the ongoing 30th Conference of Health Ministers of
East, Central and Southern Africa on Wednesday in Seychelles
that after 15 years of applying a number of strategies to fight
the pandemic without much success, a review of the strategies
should take into account the African Regional context, the
Zimbabwe News Agency reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said, "The situation is desperate and a desperate situation
demands us to quickly sit down and re-articulate our
interventions."
</P>
<P>
Major strategies being used in the region since the onset of
AIDS included condom promotion, behavioral change promotion,
minimizing risk of HIV transmission through blood transfusion and
detection as well as treatment of curable Sexually Transmitted
Diseases within primary health care.
</P>
<P>
Of the estimated 33.4 million people worldwide infected with
HIV virus that causes AIDS, nearly 23 million live in sub-Saharan
Africa.
</P>
<P>
About half of those infected in Africa live in the 14 countries
that are members of the Commonwealth regional health community
for East, Central and Southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
They are Botswana, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius,
Mozambique, Namibia, Seychelles, South Africa, Swaziland,
Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Outlining the government response to the pandemic in various
parts of Africa, Ugandan Minister of State for Health Beatrice
Wabudeya noted that it was unfortunate that the HIV/AIDS problem
was riding on the back of already existing problems of poverty
and disease.
</P>
<P>
She said one of the strategies that the governments in the
region could adopt to respond to this pandemic was total
political commitment and support by making HIV/AIDS a priority on
the national agenda, providing resources for implementers of AIDS
health promotion programs.
</P>
<P>
She said, "In Africa most programs on HIV/AIDS do not reach
groups with high risk behavior and rural areas, especially the
youth out of school and women. Governments in Africa must
therefore provide resources and build the capacity within their
countries to sustain and expand response."
</P>
<P>
The conference was being held simultaneously with the 25th
anniversary of the Commonwealth regional health community
established in 1974 in member states and governments.

<P>
BEIJING, October 28 (Xinhua) -- One of Japan's favorite
performing companies, Takarazuka, will make its China debut this
evening at Beijing's Century Theater.
</P>
<P>
Although similar to the U.S. Broadway style, Takarazuka, with
85 years of history, has extremely delicate costumes, beautiful
stage sets, and is a splendid extravaganza.
</P>
<P>
The Takarazuka Revue Company, with 400 unmarried young women,
claims that it might be the busiest group in the world.
</P>
<P>
The company director, Shinji Ueda, said the troupe gives an
average of more than 1,000 performances a year throughout the
world.
</P>
<P>
Similar to the Shaoxing Opera which prevails in some areas of
eastern China, all Takarazuka's opera parts are performed by women.
</P>
<P>
Only after eight to ten years of diligent training can young
women who want to join Takarazuka have an opportunity to sign a
contract with the company.
</P>
<P>
All the 40 charming women visiting China this time, including
leading stars Tsubasa Makoto, Jun Shibuki and Rei Dan, will
display their rhythmic singing and dancing.
</P>
<P>
In addition, they will regale audiences with a famous Chinese
folk song.
</P>
<P>
After the six performances in Beijing, Takarazuka is scheduled
to play at The First Shanghai International Festival of Arts which
opens on November 2.

<HEADLINE> EU Ministers Meet on Artists'Right Over Resale Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, October 28 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) ministers
responsible for the internal market met in Luxembourg Thursday to
discuss artists' right to claim part of the resale price of their
works.
</P>
<P>
The ministers are also expected to adopt a position on
takeovers to ensure interests of shareholders and market
transparency, EU sources said.
</P>
<P>
Finland, which is holding EU presidency, expressed its hope to
secure a common position on a proposed directive harmonizing the
resale rights in the EU. But the 15 EU member states have so far
not agreed on how to regulate an artist's right to claim a
percentage of his or her work's resale price when it is sold.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the 15 ministers are trying to make a final
compromise over a proposal to modernize rules on takeover
procedures. The main objective of the proposal is to protect the
interests of shareholders, in particular minority holders, in case
of a takeover bid on a listed company.
</P>
<P>
The proposal would also ensure greater transparency in
attempted cases of takeovers, the European Report said.
</P>
<P>
However, the 13th Company Law Directive harmonizes only the
essentials of national takeover regulations in the EU and has "
considerable scope for EU member states to adopt more stringent
rules and to implement the Directive according to their national
systems," the Report added.

HONG KONG, October 28 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for the Office of
the Commissioner of China's Foreign Affairs Ministry in the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Thursday refuted
remarks made recently by the U.S. Consul General on Hong Kong's
rule of law and press freedom.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Consul General for Hong Kong and Macao Michael Klosson

Asked about comments on the matter, the spokesman said that "we
have noted the remarks made by the U.S. Consul General to the

</P>
<P>
"The internal affair of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region is entirely an internal matter of China, and any foreign
nation has no rights to interfere," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"Accordingly, it is inappropriate for the U.S. Consul General
to make irresponsible remarks on the internal affairs of HKSAR,
and it is even more unjustifiable to interfere in the internal
affairs of the HKSAR by taking the so-called Hong Kong Policy Act,
which is an American domestic law, as the legal pretext, " he

in a two-day professional development workshop designed to give a
quick taste of the Silicon Valley experience.
</P>
<P>
"Quite a number of companies which we have approached have
expressed an interest in joining the community," said Kwong.
</P>
<P>
"In addition to these companies, we have also received positive
responses from our industrial support bodies," Kwong added.

<P>
The secretary outlined a comprehensive package of initiatives
formulated by the government under a strategy to make Hong Kong a
leading digital city in the globally connected world of the 21st
century.

Fu, also a member of the Central Military Commission, added the

Fu also warned against "a dangerous trend in the development of
the global situation," despite peace and development being the
major themes of the time. The two countries should work together
to contribute to a peaceful, safe and stable world.
</P>
<P>
Guthrie agreed that Jiang's visit to Britain was "very

<HEADLINE> Procuratorial Organs Promote SOE Reform in China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 28 (Xinhua) -- China's procuratorial organs
today vowed to crack down on crimes hindering the development of
state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and create a better legal
environment for them.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Qiong, deputy procurator-general of the Supreme People's
Procuratorate (SPP), made public today a SPP proposal for serving
the SOEs in line with the spirit of the fourth plenum of the 15th
Communist Party of China Central Committee held a month ago.
</P>
<P>
"Procuratorial organs across the country will make special
efforts to tackle SOE-related crimes in four areas," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
First, it is imperative to investigate and resolutely deal with
economic crimes within the SOEs, such as graft, bribery, and
embezzlement of public funds in order to prevent the loss of state
assets, the SPP proposal says.
</P>
<P>
Second, procuratorial organs should cooperate closely with
public security departments and people's courts to crack down on
smuggling, shoddy goods production, and taxation cheating to
safeguard the security of the state sector of the economy and
market order.
</P>
<P>
Third, efforts should be made to strike hard against the
looting and stealing of SOE properties and create a good public
order for their development.
</P>
<P>
Fourth, it is vital to investigate and deal with bribery,
corruption, misuse of power and dereliction by administrative and
law-enforcement personnel, says the proposal.
</P>
<P>
It asks procuratorial organs across the nation to step up their
supervision according to the law, strengthen crime-prevention, and
safeguard state assets and the legitimate rights and interests of
SOEs.

<HEADLINE> New Rules Produce More Challenges to Defending Champions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The overwhelming powerhouse
Bayi Rockets are facing an ever-hardest title reigning campaign
when the new 1999-2000 season of the Chinese first-division league
to be kicked off next month.
</P>
<P>
The modified rules give more playing times to foreign players
as each team is allowed to field two of overseas players in one
quarter, and one player in every other three quarters in a game,
one more quarter available to foreigners compared to the past
seasons.
</P>
<P>
The change could be proved to be a big setback in the new
season starting November 21 to the Rockets, who marked maximum
achievements of four straight championships. The army clubs are
not allowed to sign foreigners due to military rules. The Nanjing
Bolt is the other army club in this season.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Sharks will be the Bayi's one of biggst blocks for
their defending after they signed top Chinese Taipei player Zheng
Zhilong, who spearheaded the Chinese Taipei team to fourth place
in the Asian Championships last month.
</P>
<P>
Zheng, the ever-best player of the Taiwanese professionals and
the former Asian All-Round Player, has become a crucial part of
the Sharks.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Aoshen and Vanguard Huandao are trying to combine
and re-assemble to boost the Aoshen's chance for a more successful
season.
</P>
<P>
Aiming at replacing the Bayi Rockets as the league's No. one,
the Aoshen, fourth place who defeated the Rockets in a game of the
regular last season, signed three top players of Ding Wei, Yuan
Zhinan and Miao Yuan from the Vanguard.
</P>
<P>
However, Wang Zhizhi, who was drafted American NBA Dallas at
the second round 36th pick this summer but didn't sign because of
his Bayi team not to release, still is confident to defend their
title.
</P>
<P>
"We are glad to be challenged," the 2.12 meter giant said. "We
need challenges which can boost our trainning and level and make
us better play."
</P>
<P>
Twelve teams will start the new season with head-to-head
openers in six cities and counties through the country.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Charges Against China's Dealing with Falun Gong Slammed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 28 (Xinhua) -- China today expressed strong
resentment over U.S. charges against China's dealing with the
Falun Gong cult.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on U.S. Department of State spokesman James Rubin's
remarks on the matter on October 27, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman
Zhang Qiyue said that Rubin has made gratuitous charges against
the Chinese government's settlement of the Falun Gong issue by
distorting facts, and the Chinese side expressed strong resentment
over that.
</P>
<P>
It must be pointed out, Zhang said, that China is a country
ruled according to law, and China's laws not only protect the
freedoms of association, speech, assembly and religious belief of
its citizens, but also brook no abuses of these freedoms by anyone.
</P>
<P>
Facts have shown that the Falun Gong cult harms the physical
and mental health of the people, and undermines normal public
order, Zhang said, adding that it is an anti-science, anti-
humanity and anti-society cult.
</P>
<P>
"No responsible government will ever allow cults to harm the
people's safety, or undermine public order and social stability,"
the spokeswoman said, adding that accommodation of cults is in
itself trampling on the basic human rights of the citizens.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government settles the Falun Gong issue according
to laws, and by doing so it is protecting the basic human rights
and the freedoms of citizens and safeguarding China's Constitution
and laws, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
"What the Chinese government has done has won firm support from
the entire Chinese people," she said, adding that in this issue
the Chinese government firmly opposes any irresponsible remarks on
and interference in China's internal affairs.

<HEADLINE> Procuratorial Organs Promote SOE Reform in China (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a meeting with the press, Zhang stressed that the country's
procuratorial organs should pay more attention to their
supervision over civilian trials and lawsuits against
administrative departments.
</P>
<P>
As for wrong rulings resulting from local protectionism or
corruption by law-enforcement departments and personnel,
procuratorates have the duty to make protests to stem the loss of
state assets, the deputy procurator-general said.
</P>
<P>
When the interests of the SOEs are infringed upon, this should
be dealt with by law-enforcement departments, and procuratorates
should deal with these events according to law.
</P>
<P>
The proposal also asks procuratorial organs to study problems
existing in SOE production, operation and management, and offer
their suggestions to the SOEs to prevent potential economic crimes.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, procuratorial organs should exercise great
caution in dealing with new problems that appear during SOE
restructuring and transition.
</P>
<P>
Zhang stressed that SOE reform and development represents both
a major economic issue and a political issue.
</P>
<P>
"To safeguard and standardize SOE reform and development
according to law is a long-term strategic task of China's law-
enforcement departments, including the procuratorial organs," he
noted.

BANGKOK, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai returned home earlier Thursday after a four-day visit to
Japan, during which he asked the host country to extend aid to
small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Akapol Sorasuchart briefed the prime
minister's meeting with his Japanese counterpart Keizo Obuchi in
Tokyo Wednesday, saying they discussed efforts to address economic
problems in Asia, human resource development and bilateral

<P>
The Japanese leader pledged to continue to help revive the Thai
economy through support of goods manufacturing and technological

February next year to help improve and develop Thailand's
manufacturing process and transfer advanced technology to the

Obuchi also said that Tokyo was willing to extend additional

the Thai government's efforts to resolve difficulties in the
country's banking sector.

Chuan, in return, assured that Thailand had made the best use
of Japan's financial assistance under the Miyazawa Plan to
stimulate the Thai economy.

<HEADLINE> World Horticulture Expo Widely acclaimed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Visitors from both at home and
abroad are still coming in streams to visit the World Horticulture
Exposition which will close in three days in this capital city of
southwest China's Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
They cannot contain their excitement when they are in the sea
of beautiful flowers and plants.
</P>
<P>
"The beauty here is priceless, and I can feel the harmonious
coexistence of man and nature. I am going to take lots of pictures
and bring this beauty home," said Li Shicheng, a worker from
northeast China's Heilongjiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Lam Mei Fun, a lady from Hong Kong, told Xinhua that she rushed
to the expo when she learned it will soon close.
</P>
<P>
"The expo is just like a big class, where you get to know
various kinds of rare plants and ways to protect the environment,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
Over 90 countries and international organizations are
participating in the expo which opened on May 1, and it has
attracted some 9.3 million people from all over the world.
</P>
<P>
Li Jiating, governor of Yunnan, said the record attendance
shows that the event has been very successful and has boosted
social and economic developments in the province.
</P>
<P>
With the theme "Man and Nature -- Marching into the 21st
Century," the expo was the first of its kind ever held in a
developing country, and China invested at least 13 billion yuan (
about 1.5 billion U.S. dollars) to make it a success.
</P>
<P>
President of the International Expositions Bureau, Ole
Philipson, said the expo is an international and multicultural
event and its success is a reflection of the rapid development of
the Chinese economy since the country initiated reform and opening
up policies 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Joaquin Romero, deputy chief of the expo's Spanish Hall, said
it is marvelous of China to have successfully organized such a
huge event which gathered 94 exhibitors from all over the world.

<HEADLINE> FM Spokeswoman Condemns "Taiwan Security Enhancement Act" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 28 (Xinhua)-- The revised version of "the
Taiwan Security Enhancement Act" passed by a U.S. House Committee
is a gross infringement on Chinese sovereignty, said Foreign
Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue at today's press conference.
</P>
<P>
The act, passed by the International Relations Committee of the
U.S. House of Representatives, seriously violates the three Sino-U.
S. Joint Communiques and interferes in China's internal affairs,
said Zhang, venting China's strong indignation at and firm
opposition to it.
</P>
<P>
It needs to be pointed out, she said, that efforts by a small
group of U.S. congressmen to get the act passed was actually an
attempt to provide a "legal basis" for strengthening U.S. high-
tech arms shipment to Taiwan, and for expanding the direct liaison
between the two militaries, thus obstructing the cause of
reunification of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
This action poses a severe threat to peace of the Taiwan
Straits and even the Asia-Pacific Region, said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang, the Chinese government and people have
expressed their vehement condemnation and resolute opposition to
the act from the very beginning, and have repeatedly lodged solemn
representations to the U.S. side.
</P>
<P>
China has noted that the United States government opposes
passage of the act, she said.
</P>
<P>
China strongly demands that the U.S. congressmen terminate
their erroneous acts of interfering in China's internal affairs by
making use of the Taiwan issue, and that the U.S. government
strictly abide by the three Sino-U.S. Joint Communiques, honor its
commitments, be fully aware of the serious harm of the act, and
take effective measures to stop it from becoming law to ensure
that no serious harm befalls the Sino-U.S. relationship, the
spokeswoman said.

<HEADLINE> Sino-African Dialogue To Further Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The proposed ministerial
seminar on Sino-African cooperation will not only push forward
bilateral cooperative ties, but also contribute to world peace and
development.
</P>
<P>
So said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue here
today at a regular press conference when questioned about the
seminar.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government proposes to hold such a seminar in
Beijing next October, and Chinese President Jiang Zemin has sent
letters to African leaders in this regard.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of equal consultation, enhancing understanding,
expanding common ground, cementing friendship and promoting
cooperation, China and African countries are expected to discuss
the establishment of a just and reasonable new international
political and economic order, as well as the cementing of Sino-
African trade, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Since the end of the Cold War, great changes have taken place
in the international situation, but peace and development remain
the primary themes, she said, adding that multi-polarization and
the establishment of a new international political and economic
order are strongly demanded by the international community,
especially the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Zhang cited the African countries as an important force for
furthering peace and development in the world. She said that China
has always valued Africa, and strengthening cooperation with
African countries constitutes an important part of China's
diplomatic policy of peace and independence.
</P>
<P>
She noted that furthering Sino-African consultation and mutual
understanding and cooperation will benefit not only the legitimate
interests of the developing countries, but also the peace,
stability and development of the world.

<HEADLINE> China's Farmland No Longer Decreasing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The decade-long decrease in
China's farmland acreage is expected to end this year.
</P>
<P>
 During the period from November last year and June this year,
98,600 ha of farmland were used for industrial and real estate
projects. However, the country developed 166,460 ha of new
farmland through the cultivation of wasteland, according to
statistics of the Ministry of Land and National Resources,
resulting in a net increase of 67,800 ha of farmland.
</P>
<P>
An official from the ministry said that 19 provinces and
autonomous regions have ended the trend toward decreasing farmland,
and the remaining eight provinces and municipalities will not find
it difficult to find new sources of land to compensate for the
amount of farmland used for non-agricultural purposes.
</P>
<P>
The official attributed this turnaround to the implementation
of a land management law which became effective on January 1 this
year.

LAGOS, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Solomon Lar, chairman of
Nigeria's ruling People's Democratic Party (PDP), has offered his
resignation in a party meeting in the capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
Lar, who assumed office only a year ago, Wednesday said he was
not seeking re-election despite pressures to the contrary because
he had finished his mission for the party, the Guardian newspaper
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said he had realized the biggest dream of his life -- the
entrenchment under his chairmanship of a sustainable and enduring
democratic system in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
With the solid foundation he helped lay, what needs to be done
is to continue to put building blocks on the structure of the
party to make it stronger, said the renown politician at the
party's National Executive Council meeting.
</P>
<P>
"A strong and united PDP is imperative for the unity, progress
and prosperity of our great country," he said.
</P>

"I opt to follow the tradition of distinguished African leaders
like late Mwalimu Julius Nyerere and Madiba Nelson Mandela, who

<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and overseas people
participating in the '99 Kunming International Horticulture
Exposition, which is due to close here Sunday, claim that the expo
is a great success and is very significant.
</P>
<P>
The expo in Kunming, capital of southwest China's Yunnan
Province, showed the achievements China has scored since it
introduced reform and opening-up policy in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Since its opening on May 1, the expo, which is participated by
95 countries and international organizations, has received 9.3
million visitors by September 27. About 2,511 kinds of trees and
plants from across the world are displayed at the expo gardens
covering an area of 218 hectares.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the success of the big event, the central government
has spent 13 billion yuan to improve infrastructure facilities in
the province. Investment on the expo gardens alone amounted to 2
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
It is "unimaginable" for Yunnan, a less developed area in China,
to hold such a big event, claimed some overseas participants. They
noted that the expo has helped them understand China better.
</P>
<P>
During the expo, many countries signed cooperation agreements
or letters of intent with China, with a contractual volume of
investment totaling 14 billion yuan.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar fell within the
lower 104 yen level Thursday in Tokyo, but was limited by worries
over market intervention by the Bank of Japan.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. currency was quoted at 104.05-08 yen at 5 p.m., down
from 104.41-44 yen at 9 a.m. in Tokyo, and from 104.30-40 yen late
Wednesday in New York.
</P>
<P>
The dollar briefly touched a low of 103.88 yen in the morning,
after marking a high of 104.45 yen, but stayed mostly in the lower
104 yen level during the day, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
The market still has a downside bias, willing to test the lower
limit again, they said, adding that the next target level for the
dollar is the lower 103 yen level.
</P>
<P>
On the Tokyo Stock market, stock prices closed slightly higher,
supported by Wednesday's upturn in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average in New York.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose 31.35 points, or 0.18
percent from Wednesday's close to end at 17,413.71.
</P>

The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, gained 3.72 points, or 0.24 percent to 1,527.

Turnover on the major section went up to 534.44 million shares
from 517.56 million Wednesday, with losers outnumbering gainers
706 to 470, while 159 issues ending unchanged.
</P>

Upward momentum was not strong, as investors remained hesitant
to actively buy stocks ahead of Thursday's release of U.S. gross
domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter of this year,
traders said.

The yen's strength against the dollar also prevented share

<HEADLINE> Israeli Airline Splits Order Between Boeing, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 28 (Xinhua) -- In a surprise move, Israel's
national carrier El Al has decided to split its order between
Boeing Co. and Airbus Industrie, ending a bitter competition
between the two giant aircraft manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
An El Al spokesman said the board of directors decided
Wednesday night to buy three Boeing 777s, the newest passenger
plane currently produced by the American manufacturer, and three
or four Airbus 330s of the European consortium.
</P>
<P>
Originally, El Al had planned to buy three 777s or two A330s
and two A340s, which triggered a fierce competition between Boeing
and Airbus.
</P>
<P>
Airbus, eager to break Boeing's monopoly in the fleet of El Al,
accused Boeing of conducting a unfair competition by using
government intervention. But Boeing said the Airbus enjoys
government subsidies in order to compete in international markets.
</P>
<P>
El Al has postponed its decision, originally scheduled in
September, several times to hear the improved offers by the
two companies.
</P>
<P>
In its latest bid, Airbus said it would channel 35 percent of
the value of the order, which is estimated at 350-400 million
U.S. dollars, back to Israeli economy. Boeing offered value
offset of 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
Both companies appeared happy with the El Al's decision.
</P>
<P>
Tom Basacchi, Boeing's senior vice president for sales in
Europe and Russia, said that the decision is an expression of
continued confidence by El Al in Boeing and its products, The
Jerusalem Post reported.
</P>
<P>
Airbus senior vice president Tom Leahy said the company is
very happy about the decision and especially happy to start doing
business with El Al.
</P>
<P>
The 777s are to be delivered in 2001, the A330s in 2002, the
newspaper said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Air Zimbabwe has banned smoking
on all its flights with effect from November 1.
</P>
<P>
The airline said in a statement that it had come to the
decision as it was concerned about the health of some of its
passengers, the daily Herald reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The another reason for its smoking ban was that "Air Zimbabwe
was one of the only two airlines in Africa that still allowed
smoking on some of its flights," it said.
</P>
<P>
Most airlines in the world have introduced non-smoking on all
flights for health reasons, it said.
</P>
<P>
So the new ban, which follows the airline's 1993 tobacco ban on
all domestic flights, is in line with international trends.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian airline is another one in Africa, which still
allows its passengers to smoke on flights.

According to a press release by the Foreign Office, the
four-member Commonwealth mission, which arrived here late
Wednesday night on a two-day visit, appreciated that Chief
Executive General Pervaiz Musharraf had pledged to return to
genuine democracy as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
However, the mission emphasized the need for a timeframe for
the restoration of democracy in Pakistan and that the required
process should be initiated.
</P>
<P>
The mission led by Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axeworthy
called on Pakistani President Rafiq Tarar and held talks with
Foreign Minister Abdul Sattar on Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
"The meetings were held in a cordial and constructive
atmosphere," said the press release.
</P>
<P>
The mission noted that Pakistan's suspension from participation
in the Councils of the Commonwealth was "unavoidable" in
accordance with the political principles and the defined rules of
the Commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
However, Pakistan's membership in the Commonwealth has not been
suspended.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with the Commonwealth mission, Foreign
Minister Sattar expressed the hope that they would be able to gain
a good understanding of the objective realities necessitating the
new political dispensation in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that there was no martial law in Pakistan, civil
liberties were preserved, freedom of the press was upheld, human
rights were protected, and the judiciary was functioning normally
in accordance with the civil laws.
</P>
<P>
Sattar also laid out the details of the priorities set by Chief
Executive Musharraf and his agenda for elimination of
mismanagement and corruption.

<P>
A reform process has been initiated for the welfare of the
people in accordance with their wishes and aspirations, said the
foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth mission will meet a cross section of people in

<P>
JERUSALEM, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. has expressed its concern that Israel's sale of
advance weaponry to New Delhi is disrupting the sensitive arms
balance between India and Pakistan, U.S. officials told The
Jerusalem Post. U.S. officials accompanying Defense Secretary
William Cohen have raised the issue with their Israeli
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has focused considerable attention on the arms
balance in the Asian subcontinent. The recent coup in Pakistan
has heightened America's desire to stabilize the region.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. Senate majority leader Trent Lott promised
Wednesday to lend his support to pushing through a 1.6 billion
U.S. dollars aid package to implement the Wye River agreement
between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
His comment, as well as remarks by other leading congressmen
and administration officials, has increased chances that the aid
will come through by year's end. Israel is to receive 1.2 billion
U.S. dollars and the Palestinians 400 million.
</P>

prohibits Prime Minister Ehud Barak from delivering a speech at a
memorial rally in Tel Aviv on November 4 to mark the four years

<HEADLINE> Zambia Sells 3 Big Copper Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- A new deal has been struck
between the Zambian government and the Anglo-American Corporation
(AAC) from South Africa on the sale of three big mines of the
state-owned Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM).
</P>
<P>
The government, the ZCCM and Zambia Copper Investment (ZCI), a
subsidiary of AAC, said in a joint statement issued Wednesday that
ZCI and partners would purchase 80 percent of Konkola, Nchanga and
Nampundwe mines through a new company to be formed by the end of
January next year, "Times of Zambia" newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, ZCCM will receive 30 million U.S. dollars
payable at close, a deferred consideration of 60 million dollars
and benefit of cobalt and copper prices with a cap of 125 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the mining conglomerate will get a five percent
free and 15 percent repayable carried interest in the new company
yet to be named.
</P>
<P>
In a parallel transaction, ZCI has agreed to sell its 27.3
percent interest in ZCCM to the government for 30 million dollars
on a deferred payment basis.
</P>
<P>
The new company will, subject to the terms of the Development
Agreement to be concluded, be committed to capital expenditure of
208 million dollars during the first three years.
</P>
<P>
The new company will also have an option to acquire the Nkana
smelter, which would be managed by AAC during the option period.
</P>
<P>
The three parties started fresh negotiations on September 16
after the original proposal on privatization of the ZCCM collapsed
when Codelco, a chilean mining company, pulled out of the
partnership.

<HEADLINE> China's Ethnic Groups Examine Past For Cultural Identity (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- After decades of following the
Han Chinese and their ways, many ethnic groups in China have
finally realized that what they inherited from their predecessors
is far from useless.
</P>
<P>
There's no difference between the Tujia people and the Han
these days, according to Zheng Jianhua, a guide at a Tujia Museum
in the scenic spot of Zhangjiajie in western Hunan province. They
look the same and speak the same language.
</P>
<P>
But, Zheng says, after a two-week internship at the museum,
which has handicrafts, traditional clothing, embroidery, antiques,
furniture, and wood carvings, she didn't want to hide her Tujia
origins any more and was overwhelmed with an understanding of the
glory of ethnic culture.
</P>
<P>
She said that she didn't know that the hand-woven cloth that
was used to wrap her up when she was a baby was a treasured bit of
handicraft that is on verge of being lost forever. Nor did she
know that the dusty crockery at home had a beautiful design that
was unique in the world.
</P>
<P>
"In my village, young people are busy finding ways to leave the
mountain area and we no longer wear hand-made clothing," she says,
but wears beautiful Tujia clothing herself with a diagonal collar
and loose sleeves and trousers made by a tailor.
</P>
<P>
The museum work helped her make up her mind to devote her life
to Tujia culture and to show it to the outside world. She says she
admires what the museum's curator, Chen Chuhua, has done to
preserve the cultural heritage and to building the museum. But,
she thinks that her generation can do more to increase ethnic
identity by making the culture a part of their lives.
</P>
<P>
The Tujia are one of the ethnic groups that have had dramatic
changes in their lives in the past several decades, according to
Luo Kanglong of Jishou University, one of only two universities in
China in areas heavily populated by ethnic groups.

<HEADLINE> Arafat's Lebanon Representative Sentenced to Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat's leading representative in Lebanon Wednesday night was
sentenced to death in absentia by a military court in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
The court verdict said that Sultan Abul-Ainayn, whose real name
is Hassan Ahmad Abul-Ainayn, has formed an armed group that seeks
to commit crimes against people and their properties and to
undermine the Lebanese government's authority.
</P>
<P>
In June, Abul-Ainayn, who lives in the Bas refugee camp near
Tyre, Lebanon's southern port city, began restructuring forces
loyal to Arafat's Fatah movement to enhance the group's grip on
three camps in the south against their rival factions, the Daily
Star reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian factions opposed to the Arafat-led Palestinian
National Authority and its peace process with Israel have been
trying to dominate the shantytowns since 1993.
</P>
<P>
Abul-Ainayn had denied that Fatah's restructuring had any goals
other than enhancing security in the camps.
</P>
<P>
He is now sheltering inside the arm-protected camp where
Lebanese security forces are not allowed to enter.
</P>
<P>
A court source said Abul-Ainayn also faces several charges on
murder and arms trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Some 360,000 Palestinians, who fled their homes after the
establishment of Israel in 1948, are living in 12 camps across
Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Houghton Confident about Crucial Battle against S.Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Fine form, previous record and
some "resonable amount of fortune" should combine to take China to
a historic win over South Korea in tomorrow's crucial 2000 Olympic
qualifier, China coach Englishman Bobby Houghton said here today.
</P>
<P>
"The players are in good form; injury situation improved this
week and we have good record here," Houghton told a packed house
of reporters at a news conference this afternoon ahead of an all-
important match against their east Aisan old nemesis which the
Chinese Olympic side could not afford to lose.
</P>
<P>
"We haven't lost here," the former Nottingham Forest coach said.
"I'm quite positive about the result tomorrow."
</P>
<P>
Defeat, or even draw, would dash any hopes for China to reach
their only second Olympic soccer finals when only the three group
leaders should represent Asia in next year's Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Houghton reckoned his charges were "extremely close" to beat
the South Korean side in their first leg encounter on Oct 3rd in
Seoul where China lost to a controversial goal he claimed "very
doubtful".
</P>
<P>
A second-half effort from star striker Sin Byung-Ho which hit
the goalline and then bounced off, and a disallowed offside goal
by the Chinese captain Li Weifeng robbed the visiting China, who
had a better possession of the game, of a rare opportunity to etch
out what would be a first and therefore famous triumph over South
Korea for over a decade.
</P>
<P>
The last time China tasted victory had to date back to January
23, 1986 when they managed a 2-1 win over a largely depleted South
Korean squad in an international friendly in India.
</P>
<P>
"We were very dominant in the Seoul game, even though we lost
statistically," Houghton assured. "I think we were the better side-
-we had shots on goal twice as many as them (South Korea) and we
had three scoring chances against one.
</P>
<P>
"Actually I think if we had had reasonable amount of fortune,
we would had won the game. "
</P>
<P>
That could just happen tommorrow night at the Shanghai Stadium,
which should anticipate an full house of 80,000 vocal fans
including a 5,000-strong visiting South Korean contingent.
</P>
<P>
"It will be an exciting game," Houghton said. "We're looking
forward to it with full confidence. It's a very good opportunity
to top the group."
</P>
<P>
South Korea stood atop in the Asian Group B with two wins out
of two games, China following behind on a 1-1 record and a still
winless Bahrain being virtually out of contention.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Ethnic Groups Examine Past for Cultural Identity(2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He says that Zheng's experience is natural and a good way for
members of ethnic groups to acknowledge their own identity and
that it is not until they see more of the outside world and
realize how glorious their own culture was that they can develop
the self-esteem to adapt that culture to modern life.
</P>
<P>
But, Luo says, many of the old buildings, clothing, and
traditional festivals may not remain as pure as they were because
of the improved standard of living. Nowadays, he says, one has to
go deeper and deeper into a poor part of Hunan to find traditional
Tujia homes built up on stilts or the boat-shaped huts of the Li
ethnic group in Hainan Province.
</P>
<P>
Although they have a beautiful appearance and reflect the
diversity of Chinese structures and uses of wood, straw, and dirt,
they are not very comfortable, Luo points out. But, as people
become more aware, they can apply the unique building styles and
techniques to modern architecture. Many hotels and villas in
tourist resorts have retained the flavor of ethnic traditions.
</P>
<P>
Like many other ethnic groups, the Tujia do not have their own
written language and stories and customs have been passed on
orally for generations. But, one of Luo's colleagues at Jishou
University, Ye Deshu, who is a member of the Tujia group, has
developed a system of Tujia writing using Chinese phonemes for
Tujia pronunciation. The ethnic groups won't let their cultures
pass away, he says, all of the students in his class can speak
both Mandarin and the Tujia language. They are the future hope of
the Tujia, an open-minded and well educated generation, he
concludes.

</P>
<P>
There are other famous art festivals in the world. They include:
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
-- Cervantes International Arts Festival: This event is held
yearly in Mexico to commemorate those who have contributed to the

Mexican tourism has benefited much from this traditional festival
which also stimulates the development of Mexican culture and arts.
</P>
<P>
-- "Memphis in May" International Festival: It began in 1977 as
one of the United States' ten major arts festivals, and it usually
selects a single country as its subject annually. An art troupe
from China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region performed at the
festival in 1977, whose subject was China that year. And
</P>
<P>

festival was first held in 1996 in Alma Ata, capital of Kazakhstan,
sponsored by the Kazakhstan Bobek Children's Fund. It brought
together about 2,000 young artists from nine countries including
China, Russia, Pakistan, Uzbekstan and Kazakhstan. "Ainalaiyn"

city of Chongqing during a holiday trip and bought some shares on
the spot out of curiosity. She was dazzled by the numbers flashing
across the electronic screen showing the stock quotation in China
's two stock exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
Then, she made her first profit from the stock market and, in
January 1994, became one of the first 100 investors in Lhasa,
Tibet's capital, when it opened its first stock company with
technical and financial assistance from Shanghai and Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
Gyasi Ramu seems born for the business. She has never fretted
over the ever-fluctuating market. It's a hobby, she says, and the
rapid modernization of the stock exchange has made it increasingly
easy to do business at home via the computer and phone. So, now
the self-taught investment wizard seldom visits the exchange and
often sits at home and gets information from newspapers, magazines,
radio, and TV.
</P>
<P>
Gyasi Ramu has succeeded in most of her trading so far. Her
secret is to buy in shares in March and sell them by July, then
purchase some stocks in September and hold them until November.
</P>
<P>
And this hobby still uses only a small part of the Tibetan
woman's time. She has made an indoor floral garden and pets:
goldfish, chickens, and a dog, Ding Ding, who was with her for her
TV appearance.

<HEADLINE> China Enhancing Status of Rural Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 28 (Xinhua) -- China will further promote the
social status of rural women by carrying out the basic State
policy of equality between men and women, said Gu Xiulian, vice
president of the All-China Women's Federation (ACWF), at today's
press conference held by the Information Office of the State
Council.
</P>
<P>
Gu said that the basic policy of equality should be publicized
and women's educational level should be improved to expand their
social activities and improve their economic status.
</P>
<P>
Also, measures should be taken to strengthen the rule of law in
the countryside and to fight against domestic violence and
trafficking in women, she added.
</P>
<P>
Gu also said that "although the law ensures equality between
men and women, it is not always the case in practice, and
feudalism still exists in some areas of China's countryside. So it
is of vital importance for us to solve this problem."
</P>
<P>
She listed poor education, domestic violence, and women
trafficking as the main issues awaiting solutions.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-million rural women have become literate and 15 million
attended correspondence colleges and schools thanks to the ACWF's
"Learning and Competing Campaign," and another project initiated
in 1995 has helped 2.4 million rural women out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
The Minister of Finance will allocate 100 million yuan (about
12 million U.S. dollars) to improve rural clinics and train rural
medical staff, according to Liu Hairong, another ACWF vice
president.

<HEADLINE> 80 Million Layoffs Enjoy Unemployment Insurance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Eighty million laid-off Chinese
workers have taken part in the country's unemployment insurance
system, an official with the Ministry of Labor and Social Security
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Some 59 million workers from State-owned enterprises (SOEs)
have also joined this system, which will take responsibility for
their unemployment compensation and job hunting.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in 1998 the government spent about 87
percent of the 6 billion yuan (about 700 million U.S. dollars)
collected for the social unemployment insurance fund.
</P>
<P>
The SOEs' employment service centers received 1.46 billion yuan
of these funds last year to ensure the basic living standards of
laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that China is striving to build its social
security system, which is composed of old-age pensions, medical
insurance, industrial injury insurance and other elements.
</P>
<P>
"The unemployment insurance system will help ease the burden on
enterprises and create a favorable environment for further reform
of SOEs," the official said.

<HEADLINE> Russia's Trade Surplus Hits Ten-year High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Russia's trade surplus for the
first nine months of 1999 hit a ten-year high of 27.1 billion U.S.
dollars except for unofficial trade, said the ministry of economy
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The surplus was 21.2 billion dollars including unofficial trade
in the period and Russia was able to pay its foreign debt and
maintain relative stability on the currency market through foreign
trade, even amid scant foreign investment and virtually no foreign
borrowing, said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show exports in the first nine months totaled 49.5
billion dollars except unregistered exports, 7.9 percent down over
the same period of 1998, while exports including unregistered
trade dropped 7.7 percent to 50.7 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Imports in the first nine months were 22.4 billion dollars not
including unofficial trade and 29.5 billion dollars including it,
down 39.8 and 40.6 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The trade turnover during the period declined 23.3 percent
compared to the same period of last year, said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Exports in September rose 3.4 percent from one year earlier to
an estimated six billion dollars without unofficial trade, and was
up 5.1 percent to 6.2 billion dollars including such trade.
</P>
<P>
The trade surplus in September stood at 3.6 billion dollars
without unofficial trade and 2.9 billion dollars with it, about
the same as a year earlier.

<P>
BEIJING, October 28 (Xinhua) -- China's vocational education
has made big strides in the past several decades, and there are
now 4,400 schools compared with only four in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
About 700,000 students are graduated yearly and are employed in
such industries as machinery, electronics, aviation and railways.
</P>
<P>
The trained technicians are fresh blood injected continuously
into the veins of China's economy, said an official with the
Ministry of Labor and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
Vocational schools also play an important role in helping 10
million laid-off workers from China's State-owned enterprises to
regain employment.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will help train 10 million layoffs in the coming
three years, and at present, 6.09 million laid-off workers thus
trained have been re-employed.
</P>
<P>
The high-quality of the schools' students has caught the
attention of more and more Chinese companies which often sent
their staff to the schools for re-training.
</P>
<P>
In today's market economy, China's vocational schools have
become more responsive to social needs than they were in the
planned economy, the official said.

<HEADLINE> China Strives for Medical Insurance for Urban Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October, 28 (Xinhua) -- A senior official with the
Ministry of Health said today that a medical insurance network
adaptable to China's socialist market economy has come into being
following the reform and trial period of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that by the end of 1998, more than four million
Chinese in-service workers and over one million retirees had
entered the medical insurance system, combining social pools and
individual accounts.
</P>
<P>
This contrasts with the end of the 1970s, when the government
was responsible for the medical payments of more than 75 percent
of China's urban workers, and some 110 million Chinese were the
beneficiaries of free medical service.
</P>
<P>
In 1978, the Chinese government paid more than 2.8 billion yuan
in medical expenses for its citizens, or some 6 percent of the
total wages of the working class.
</P>
<P>
The official said that although free medical services played a
positive role in safeguarding the well-being of urban workers and
social stability in the past decades, it is not adaptable to the
needs of the socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
The flaws of the free medical service system include heavy
burdens on the State and the State-owned enterprises (SOEs), the
rapid growth of medical expenses, and a lack of a restrictive
mechanism on both employees and their bosses.
</P>
<P>
The official said that with the completion of the nationwide
medical insurance network for urban workers before year's end, the
free medical insurance system and labor insurance medical system
are expected to be terminated after more than 40 years of
operation.

COLOMBO, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka has fixed the dates
for the upcoming presidential poll and nominations, official

</P>
<P>
The sources said the presidential poll will be held on December
21 while the nomination for presidency will be made on November
16.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga

November, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, people expressed worries that the polling date might
clash with students' ordinary level examination scheduled to be
held from December 11 to 24 and the holy month of fasting for
Muslims which begins on December 10.
</P>
<P>
School buildings are usually used as examination centers and
polling booths, meaning that both cannot be held at the same time.
</P>
<P>
However, the Education Ministry said on Wednesday for the sake
of the presidential poll the students' examination has been
brought forward and will be held from December 6 to 17.

DHAKA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The Parliamentary by-election in
Faridpur-4 constituency, 150 kilometers west of Dhaka, was held
Wednesday peacefully but lifeless.
</P>
<P>
With the mainstream opposition parties incle with no enthusiasm
among voters.
</P>
<P>
Press reports said Thursday that voters' turnout would be
between 30 to 35 percent. Election Commissioner Abidur Rahman was

votes while her nearest rival Mostafa Amir Faisal of Zaker Party
(a pro-Islamic party) polled 1,488 votes only.

<P>
There was no effective challenge from any quarter. Main
opposition BNP, Jamaat-e-Islami and the Islami Oikya Jote (Islamic
Solidarity Front) boycotted the by-election demanding resignation
of the Chief Election Commissioner and the resignation of the
Awami League government.
</P>
<P>
The opposition alliance also decided to boycott the Upazilla

Manila, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Twenty professors and students
from the Mindanao State University (MSU) were abducted by seven
dismissed university employees in North Lanao province in northern
Mindanao Thursday afternoon, military sources said.
</P>
<P>
The victims were on board a school bus on their way home to
Iligan City, the provincial capital, when they were stopped at
gunpoint by the kidnappers, Philippine News Agency (PNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
It was one of the biggest wholesale kidnappings in North Lanao
for years, the PNA added.
</P>
<P>
They were told to disembark but the driver was allowed to go to

The driver was quoted as saying that the seven kidnappers were
former contractual employees of the MSU who were dismissed without
receiving their four-month salary.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the kidnappers apparently resented their dismissal
and non-payment of their salaries.
</P>
<P>
Police and Army units in both North and South Lanao provinces
were alerted and ordered to conduct blocking positions in all
major thoroughfares in the area.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Global Chip Sales Likely to Grow 21 Percent in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 28 (Xinhua) -- An annual forecast
released Wednesday said the global semiconductor industry is
expected to grow 15 percent in 1999 and 21 percent next year,
fueled by the proliferation of chips for communications and
Internet infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The forecast by U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA)
said that sales of the world chip market will top 144 billion U.S.
dollars in 1999, as the industry enters its first sustained
recovery since 1995.
</P>
<P>
In the year 2000, SIA forecast that the global chip sales will
jump 21 percent to 174 billion dollars, with continued growth of
20 percent in 2001 to 209 billion dollars and reaching a record
high of 234 billion dollars in 2002, with a gain of 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
SIA said this forecast represents the cyclical nature of the
semiconductor business, which emerged last year from the longest-
running downturn in the industry's history.
</P>
<P>
"This is the great year of recovery for the semiconductor
industry," said Brian Halla, chairman, president and chief
executive of National Semiconductor Corp., in a statement. "Demand
for semiconductors will surge due to proliferation of wired and
wireless information appliances as well as Internet infrastructure
products."
</P>
<P>
According to SIA latest forecast, DRAM (dynamic random access
memory) chips will grow more than 30 percent over the next three
years, but then slow to a 5-percent growth in 2002. DRAMs are
expected to increase 31 percent to 18 billion dollars in 1999, 39
percent in 2000 to 25 billion dollars and 44 percent in 2001 to 37
billion dollars. Sales will grow 5 percent in 2002 to 38 billion
dollars, due to the cyclical nature of the DRAM business.
</P>
<P>
SIA forecast said microprocessors will grow 11 percent to 28
billion dollars in 1999, 17 percent to 32 billion dollars in 2000,
14 percent to 40 billion dollars in 2001 and 13 percent in 2002 to
42 billion dollars. Microprocessors were only up 5.6 percent in
1998.
</P>
<P>
SIA also forecast that the microcontroller market will grow 16
percent in 1999 to 14 billion dollars, 27 percent to 18 billion
dollars in 2000, 25 percent to 22 billion dollars in 2001 and 18
percent to 26 billion dollars in 2002.

<HEADLINE> Russian Proton-K Rocket Crashes in Kazakhstan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 28 (Xinhua) -- A Russian Proton booster rocket
carrying a Russian "Express-A1" communications satellite failed to
reach its planned orbit and crashed over Kazakhstan's Karaganda
region Wednesday night, Interfax quoted the Kazakh Emergency
Situations Agency as saying on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The rocket crashed 25 kilometers northeast of the town of Atasu
in the Zhanaarkinsky district at 11:20 p.m. local time, (1720 GMT)
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Interfax reports, the rocket's second stage engine
malfunctioned approximately three and a half minutes after lift-
off, causing the rocket to crash.
</P>
<P>
The Emergency Situations Department for the Karaganda Region
reported that the air-defense units observing the launch saw a
cloud "of unidentified origin" 4-16 kilometers high and with a 15-
20 kilometer radius right after the crash. The cloud could be seen
for 32 minutes, it reported.
</P>
<P>
A 19-member emergency team led by Karaganda region Governor
Kamaltin Mukhamedzhanov set out to the scene to perform radiation
and chemical checks and to find out whether any civilians were
killed or buildings destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Experts from Russia's Khrunichev Center, which manufactures the
Protons, have said that a similar incident occurred on July 5,
1999, when a Proton carrying a "Raduga" military satellite crashed,
also due to second-stage engine failure, noting that the Proton
that crashed was a booster rocket of the same series.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, October 28 (Xinhua) -- A new company, the Guangzhou
Baiyun International Airport Co. Ltd., has been formed to
construct a new international airport for Guangzhou, capital of
south China's Guangdong Province, it was announced here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The company, with asset capital of 5.2 billion yuan (about 627
million U.S. dollars), will be responsible for all affairs related
to the relocation of Baiyun Airport, the existing airport, and
construction of the new international airport.
</P>
<P>
A plan to relocate the existing airport and build a larger,
better-equipped airport was approved by the State Council last
month. The new airport will be constructed in several stages with
designs provided by Parsons Corp. and URS Greiner Corp, two U.S.
firms, and the Guangdong Provincial Architectural Design Institute.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the new airport will be situated in
the city of Huadu, which is under the jurisdiction of Guangzhou,
and will cover an area of 1,456 hectares, about four times the
area of the existing airport.
</P>
<P>
The existing facility is the country's busiest airport, and has
long been overburdened by increasing numbers of passengers and
cargo volume.
</P>
<P>
The new airport will cost about 18.83 billion yuan (about 2.3
billion U.S. dollars), 49 percent of which will be borne by the
Guangzhou Transport Investment Co. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Preparations of the ground for the new airport is almost
finished, and it is expected that construction will begin next May.
By 2010, when the airport is totally complete, it will be able to
handle 25 million arrivals and departures, and one million tons of
cargo annually.
</P>
<P>
The first-phase construction will cost about 10 billion yuan
and will be completed in 2003.

parliament building where the prime minister and seven others were
killed.
</P>
<P>
"I assure you that we are doing all we can for normalizing the
situation and securing the release of the hostages," the Itar-Tass
news agency quoted Kocharyan as saying in an appeal.
</P>
<P>
The president expressed condolences to the families of the
deceased, including Prime Minister Vazgen Sarkisyan, Parliament
Speaker Karen Demirchyan, his deputies Yuri Bakhshyan and Ruben
Miroyan, and Minister for Urgent Matters Leonard Petrosyan.
</P>
<P>
"The authorities are keeping the situation under control,"
Kocharyan said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Armenia's leading political parties have pledged to
"preserve stability in the country," Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement issued following the Wednesday shoot-out
in the parliament building, the parties vowed to work with the
president to "ensure the observance of constitutional order, of
law and order, as well as the normal functioning of the state."
</P>
<P>
The parliament building remained sealed off by law enforcement
units and President Kocharian, who rushed to the scene shortly
after the shooting, is directing negotiations with the gunmen, who
reportedly demanded air time over national television to explain
their action and a helicopter to whisk them to an unspecified
location.
</P>
<P>
There were conflicting reports on the number of gunmen, but
their leader has been identified as 34-year-old Nairi Hounanyan,
at one time a member of a nationalist party but expelled from it
in 1990. The gunmen also included his younger brother and uncle,
the Armenian National Television reported.
</P>
<P>
Hounanyan told Reuters that their main demand was "air time on
national television" to "explain to the nation why this was a
necessary step, out of desperation, to stop the destruction of our
country."
</P>
<P>
He said the killings would serve as a warning to future
leaders that they had to "serve the people."

<HEADLINE> New Zealander Smokers Stub out Third of Cigarettes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- New Zealanders are smoking a
third less tobacco than they did before bans on advertising and
smoking in workplaces were introduced in 1990, the Dominion
Thursday quoted new statistics as showing.
</P>
<P>
The Wellington-based newspaper also quoted the Health Ministry
of New Zealand as saying that smoking levels have taken their
latest dive after the Government increased Tobacco tax last year.
</P>
<P>
The country with a population of about 3.8 million people has
55,000 fewer smokers than in 1990, said Matthew Allen, a senior
analyst of the Health Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The amount of tobacco sold dropped 34 percent between 1990 and
the end of last year, according to a report written by Murray
Laugesen, a public health physician, from figures supplied by
tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
Most of the reduction is due to smokers cutting their daily
consumption, rather than quitting, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The biggest fall was in the sale of manufactured cigarettes,
down 42 percent, it added.
</P>
<P>
Some cigarette smokers have switched to roll-your-own Tobacco,
with sales rising from 229 grams an adult to 247 grams. Cigar
smoking also increased, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand's Trade Deficit at Worst Level for 6 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand suffered a
dismal trade deficit of 544 million NZ dollars (280 million U.S.
dollars) last month.
</P>
<P>
The worse-than-expected figure left the trade deficit of the
third quarter of the year at more than 1.1 billion NZ dollars (567
million U.S. dollars), its worst level for six years.
</P>
<P>
The average monthly deficit for September in the 90s has been
220 million NZ dollars (114 million U.S. dollars), less than half
the latest level, Statistics New Zealand said Thursday in a media
release.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the ongoing failure to export more than
New Zealand imports would probably push the overall current
account deficit to about 6.8 percent of gross domestic product
(GDP) for the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
It is also predicted that the deficit would blowout to 8.3
percent of GDP within the next year.
</P>
<P>
Local economists said the latest trade figures confirm the
stagnant level of the NZ dollar, which weakened about half a cent
to 51.13 cents of the U.S. dollar Wednesday, and higher interest
rates, which rose marginally.
</P>
<P>
In the third quarter, New Zealand's total imports rose nine
percent. Although the trade deficit was disappointing, there were
some encouraging signs of an export pickup. During the same
period, its exports were up 7.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> Indian Truckers Call Off Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Indian truck operators called
off their week-long strike late Wednesday night following
five-hour of talks between the government and the sponsor of the
strike, the All Indian Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC).
</P>
<P>
The transporters gave up their demand for withdrawing the
diesel price hike while the determined government made some
concessions including an assurance that industry status would be
granted to the road transport sector, the Indian Express reported
Thursday,
</P>
<P>
The truckers began "indefinitely suspended operations" on
Thursday last week protesting against the over 35 percent increase
of diesel prices, effective on October 6 in order to, the
government said, partially neutralize the 60 percent increase of
diesel prices in the international market.
</P>
<P>
Truck operators said the hike in diesel price would increase
their operational cost and thus crippling the sector already hit
by recession.
</P>
<P>
AIMTC, apex body of transporters which represents 32
federations operating over 2.2 million trucks in the country,
called on the strike following its failure to reach an agreement
or understanding with the government in its efforts to press for a
roll-back of diesel prices.
</P>
<P>
The government maintained that there were economic reasons for
the hike of the diesel prices.
</P>
<P>
S. Narayan, petroleum secretary in the Ministry of Petroleum
and Nature Gas, said last week the oil pool deficit would shoot up
to a staggering 100 billion rupees (approximately 2.33 U.S.
dollars) by the end of the fiscal year next March "if the diesel
prices are not brought in line with the international prices
import parity".
</P>
<P>
AIMTC and the Ministry of Surface Transport reached an
agreement last night under which the government promised to review
the quantum of tolls collected from selected stretches of national
highways.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from the meeting with representatives of truckers,
Surface Transport Minister Nitish Kumar told reporters that he
would seek cabinet nod for according industry status to the
transport sector.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement reached last night, the government proposed
to withdraw the notification on October 11 which increased various
permit, registration and fitness certificate fees.
</P>
<P>
Though the main demand of the AIMTC was not even considered
during the meeting, the truckers tried to extract some face-saving
concessions from the government, making it to agree on other
issues including toll and fixation of minimum freight rate.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the strike, prices of essential commodities like
fruits and vegetables went up in New Delhi as over 150,000
truckers have kept off roads.
</P>
<P>
Officials in the Delhi government asserted that the effect of
the strike was partial as commodities like vegetables were being
supplied to markets on tempos and tractor trawlers.

<HEADLINE> British Govt Raises Death Gratuity for Gurkhas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The British government has
decided to raise the death gratuity to families of Gurkha soldiers
killed in British service, the Kathmandu Post reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair announced the decision in the
House of Commons in London Wednesday after consultations with the
governments of Nepal and India, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
The decision is in line with the Tri-Partite Agreement among
India, Nepal and the UK signed in 1947. Effective from May 26,
1999, it will bring death payments for Nepalese Gurkha soldiers to
the level of comparable British servicemen.
</P>
<P>
The new rate of death gratuity ranges from 23,406 UK pound (for
rank below Corporal) to 58,674 UK pound (for Major).
</P>
<P>
About 450,000 Gurkha soldiers had fought for British army in
various wars, 15,000 of them have been killed in wars so far. More
than 3,000 Gurkhas are still in active service for Britain.
</P>
<P>
After retirement, a Gurkha soldier receives 32 U.S. dollars for
pension per month, while his British counterpart receives 760 U.S.
dollars per month.
</P>
<P>
Retired Gurkhas and their families are pressing the British
government for equal pensions with their British counterparts.
</P>
<P>
A ministerial-level working group from the British government
is reviewing the issue of Gurkha pensions and is expected to
report on the issue before the end of the year.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Mindanao Peace Talks Head for Rough Sailing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Hopes are still in a dim light
that peace will finally prevail in the southern Philippine island
of Mindanao in the wake of the just opened formal peace talks
between Manila and Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF).
</P>
<P>
The major factor that might block their access to more
achievable agreements lies in their contrasting positions -- the
Moro insurgents demanding an independent Islamic state and
Philippine government's strong opposition to it, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
During the opening ceremony of the peace talks held Monday in
Maguindanao province, southwest Mindanao, Ghadzali Jaafar, chief
MILF negotiator, said they would not settle to anything less than
total independence from the government.
</P>
<P>
"This is an opportune time for the government to show its
sincerity in solving the Mindanao problem," reports here quoted
Jaafar, who is also MILF' political affairs chief, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, the largest remaining Muslim separatist group with an
estimated 15,000 fighters, has been fighting for a separate
Islamic state in Mindanao for the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
It broke away in 1978 from the larger Moro National Liberation
Front (MNLF) which signed a peace accord with the government in
1996, marking the MNLF's formal drop of its demand for
independence and adoption of autonomy in four provinces in
Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The MILF's chief Hashim Salamat was reported to say that the
word "National" was dropped in favor of "Islamic" to emphasize the
group's struggle to form a separate Islamic state in the island.
</P>
<P>
Mindanao has 24 provinces with a total population of more than
16 million. And only six provinces, with a population of 3.3
million, are largely Muslim.
</P>
<P>
Salamat was quoted as saying, just one day after the peace
talks opened, that they would not abandon their demand for
independence since this is what the Muslim people wanted.
</P>
<P>
Jaafar echoed Salamat's claim, saying that the demand "will be
aired 20 years or even 100 years form now because the Muslim
people believe that independence is the ultimate solution to the
Mindanao problem."
</P>
<P>
However, the Philippine government has made it clear that it
would never allow the MILF to establish a separate state.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said Philippine President Joseph Estrada has
reiterated his position that he will never allow the nation to be
dismembered. "We will not compromise our territorial with anyone,"
Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the government would like to focus more on the
economic aspects of the MILF's demand.
</P>
<P>
"We will concentrate on economic development which is our main
thrust in the peace talks," said Orlando Soriano, the government's
chief negotiator.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Orlando, who is also the government's defense
undersecretary, said he hoped the peace talks would lead to a
greater understanding between the government and the MILF.
</P>
<P>
"Leave the past behind and bury our memories of hate and
violence. It is time for us to engage in peace," he said when
addressing the crowd of 20,000 gathered for the opening rites of
the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the two parties have decided not to touch for a
while the "contentious issues," apparently referred to the demand
for independence Islamic state.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, analysts believed that the peace efforts will be
shaky and unstable before the two sides can finally managed to
reconcile their wide apart stands.

NANNING, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region, south China, has reported an aggregate industrial output
value of 65.31 billion yuan from January to September, up 7.7
percent on a yearly basis.
</P>
<P>
Large and medium-sized enterprises reached 647 million yuan in
profits from January to September. The enterprises were running at
a loss in the last three years, a local source said. However, the
number of loss-making enterprises has steadily decreased. Heavy
industries have begun to yield profits for the first time since
1996.
</P>
<P>
Industrial growth of the state-owned enterprises is largely
attributed to the manufacture of new products and product quality.
And the production to sales ratio of industrial goods made in the
region reached 95 percent in the three quarters of this year.

<HEADLINE> China Makes Progress In Controlling Rice Diseases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, October 28 (Xinhua) -- There has been some major
progress in China's research on rice diseases and insect problems
and some were approved by the Ministry of Agriculture recently.
</P>
<P>
The results came from a key State project in the Ninth Five-
year Plan (1996-2000) to find a way to predict outbreaks of
disease and insects and to produce new chemical fertilizers to
deal with them.
</P>
<P>
The China Rice Research Institute reports that China has 31.8
million ha. planted in rice annually, accounting for about 30
percent of its total grain-growing area. Rice output is 200
million tons annually, or some 40 percent of the country's total
amount of grain.
</P>
<P>
Diseases and insects cause the loss of 10 to 15 percent of the
annual rice output and the new developments are expected to help
major rice producers in southern, central, and eastern areas.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the methods helped the disease-plagued areas of
Sichuan province in southwest China cut losses to 3 to 5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bradley Hold First Campaign Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice President Al Gore
held the first debate Wednesday with his campaign rival Bill
Bradley at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire State.
</P>
<P>
In the hour-long debate, the two contenders for next year's
Democratic Party presidential nomination pledged to work for an
overhaul of the campaign finance laws to reduce the role of big
money in politics.
</P>
<P>
When asked about President Clinton's personal behavior, Al Gore
said that he understood the public disappointment and anger and
sought to provide "as much continuity and civility" as possible
during the Monica Lewinsky controversy.
</P>
<P>
In the opening moments of the debate, which was shown
nationwide on television, former Senator Bradley touted his 65
billion dollars plan for universal access to health insurance.
</P>
<P>
He said the 44 million uninsured Americans present "a big
problem and it needs a big solution."
</P>
<P>
But Gore attacked Bradley as fiscally irresponsible, saying his
health insurance would cost as much as 1.4 trillion dollars over
the next 10 years and swallow up the entire budget surplus and
left no money for other programs.
</P>
<P>
Gore has proposed providing all America's children with health
insurance by 2005 but has stopped short of a plan to cover all
those without insurance.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the debate, Beverly Wall, a professor of rhetoric
at Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut, said Bradley
projected a "calm, philosophical image" while Gore was more "
muscular and action-oriented", but neither was a clear winner.
</P>
<P>
The two contenders have agreed to hold at least seven debates
between now and early March, when the nomination could be decided.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Needs Better Security Environment: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia needs to create a
better political environment and strengthen security and social
order for investors, socio-economic development and poverty
alleviation, a senior government official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Sar Kheng, deputy prime minister and minister of interior, made
the commentary on the security situation and social order during
the first nine months of this year on the occasion of the 2nd
meeting of the royal government of Cambodia and donor countries.
</P>
<P>
He said "over the period of the past 10 months, the new royal
government has been successful to a great extent in implementing
the five-year policy."
</P>
<P>
However, he acknowledged that "at present there are still many
problems left behind causing domestic insecurity such as thefts,
robberies, homicides, kidnappings, anarchic and quasi-ubiquitous
use of illegal weapons and ordinances, and the exodus and staying
of illegal immigrants, etc. Such problems affect the stability of
cultural-economic politics, social security and the daily life of
the people."
</P>
<P>
According to figures offered by the Ministry of Interior, 3,304
instances of offenses took place in the first nine months of this
year, among them 1,594 were criminal acts and 1,710 were moderate
offenses. 558 people were killed and 1,024 injured in various
offenses.
</P>
<P>
It was noted that the number of offenses in the third quarter,
jumping 35 percent compared with the second quarter. From June 1
to September 30, 1,536 crimes were reported, compared with 1,132
offenses in the period between March 1 to May 31.
</P>
<P>
Armed robberies accounted for 955 instances, while 334
instances took place in Phnom Penh. Kidnapping for ransom took
place in 56 instances, among them 24 instances in Phnom Penh.
Homicide accounted for 438 instances.
</P>
<P>
National police investigated 56 percent of the cases in the
third quarter and arrested 1,305 suspects, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
Sar Kheng pointed out a number of underlying causes that allow
the continuation of offenses, including the lack of an adequate
legal system, the lack of technical materials and equipment, and
the technologies which affect the effectiveness of operation.
</P>
<P>
To curb crime, the government plans to continue its crackdown
on illegal weapons, Sar Kheng said. As of late September, the
number of confiscated weapons includes 16,412 short rifles, 11
mines, 345 hand grenades. An additional 5,655 rifles were turned
in voluntarily, as well as 190 hand grenades and 332 land mines.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of
Interior are in the process of drafting a new law penal code and a
subdecree to limit the number of bodyguard for the high-ranking
national officials, he added.

SLA Chairman S.K. Wickremesinghe by Airbus Industrie Chief
Operation Officer Dietrich Russel at a simple official ceremony on
Tuesday in Toulouse.
</P>
<P>
Wickremesinghe was quoted as saying that with the airbus's
outstanding passenger comfort, economy and range, the warmth of
the service and the country's geocentric position between East and
West and an increase of tourists to Sri Lanka could be expected.
</P>
<P>
It will also help build a world class network of business
travelers, Wickremesinghe said.
</P>
<P>
About 60 Sri Lanka invitees who were flown to Toulouse earlier,
will be among the first passengers to fly the new SLA aircraft,
arriving in Colombo Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Waives Some Sanctions on India, Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
on Wednesday lifted economic sanctions against India and Pakistan,
imposed last year for their nuclear tests in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
The action, a continuation of last year's waiver, would restore
economic programs of the Export-Import Bank, Overseas Private
investment Corp. and the Trade and Development Agency in India.
</P>
<P>
White House National Security Council spokesman Mark Hammer
said Clinton decided to waive only two sanctions on Pakistan --
the bans on U.S. commercial lending and on agricultural credit
guarantees.
</P>
<P>
That means Pakistan is ineligible for loans from the Export-
Import Bank, unable to participate in an international military
education and training program, and the Trade Development Agency
is not able to operate there.
</P>
<P>
"The different treatment of the two countries reflects the
reality that things have changed for the worse in Pakistan. But we
hope that Pakistan will return to democracy soon," Hammer said.
</P>
<P>
"Basically, we have made it clear from the start that there can
be no business as usual with Pakistan until an elected government
is restored," he added.

<HEADLINE> Germany Confirms Help to Turkey in Chemical War Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The German Defense Ministry on
Wednesday confirmed that Germany is helping Turkey establish a lab
on chemical war research.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on media report on the matter, the ministry stressed
that Germany's assistance to Turkey in the field is "absolutely
defensive".
</P>
<P>
"Turkey asked Germany to help it establish a lab on checking up
and analyzing chemical doses," so that it could gain the ability
to develop anti-atomic, biology-proof and chemical-proof equipment,
the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
However, the lab "could only help Turkey get the ability to
defend the country from chemical weapons attack and protect
soldiers and civilians from being hurt."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the accusation that the assistance has violated
the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production,
Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction,
the ministry explained that the assistance is only to guard the
safety of an alliance partner and its people.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the German authorities have also been puzzled by the
issue whether a German firm should be allowed to deliver a "
Leopard-II" battle tank to Turkey for testing. The Turkish
government has been planning to purchase 1,000 tanks for its army.

<HEADLINE> Castro Meets U.S. Illinois Governor in Havana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Fidel Castro, the Cuban
President of the Council of State and the Council of Ministers,
met with visiting U.S. Illinois Governor George Ryan here and held
talks for six hours running from Tuesday evening to small hours
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, attended by part of Ryan's 45-member
delegation, both sides agreed that the United States should cancel
its 40-year-long economic blockade against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Castro discussed with Ryan, the first U.S. state governor to
visit Cuba in 40 years, issues on building links for the future of
both countries and explored trade possibilities between the island
country and the state of Illinois after economic sanctions are
lifted.
</P>
<P>
The United States imposed economic sanctions on Cuba 40 years
ago in the wake of the Cuban revolution and tightened sanctions
in 1996 under the Helms-Burton law.
</P>
<P>
Castro and his guest also discussed issues regarding
cooperation in the fields of education, sports, culture, medicine
and agriculture between Cuba and the state of Illinois. Ryan
promised to create an Illionois-Cuba Commission to develop
cooperation in those areas.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Ryan wrapped up his five-day visit to Cuba with a
speech at the University of Havana, where he discussed his
personal views concerning U.S.-Cuban relations.
</P>
<P>
Castro and other dignitaries from the government were also
present while the U.S. official gave his speech to an auditorium
filled with students.
</P>
<P>
Ryan said that he was leaving with "the knowledge that (the
bridges) are in their proper place," and expressed his confidence
that in the future others may make the same journey.
</P>
<P>
"There are differences between the language, culture, economy
and philosophy, but this does not signify that Cuba and Illinois
are incompatible," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ryan received a commemorative plaque for the 270th anniversary
marking the founding of the University of Havana.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, which was approved by the U.S. government,
the governor also met with other Cuban officials.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Information Minister
Goran Matic Wednesday condemned NATO for launching a special war
against the country by smuggling in fake dinars.
</P>
<P>
Matic told reporters that police unearthed an organized crime
group Wednesday and arrested eight suspects, which have smuggled
up to 5-6 millions of forged dinars into the country from
neighboring Hungary.
</P>
<P>
The seized fake notes were displayed at the press conference.
They are of good quality, which must have been printed by
professionals in an organized way, he said, adding that the
quality of the paper used for printing the fake notes is even
higher than that for the real Yugoslav dinar.
</P>
<P>
The move aims to destroy Yugoslavia's economic and monetary
system, which will result in inflation and depreciation of the
dinar, further threatening the stability of the country, the
minister pointed out.
</P>
<P>
At present, NATO is carrying on a war of aggression against
Yugoslavia by imposing political, diplomatic and economic pressure
on the country, he said.

BEIJING, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Highlights of today's major
Beijing-based newspapers:
</P>
<P>
 "People's Daily"
</P>
<P>
-- The paper front-pages a commentary saying that there's
plenty of evidence to prove that rather than an ordinary illegal
organization, Falun Gong is a truly heretic cult.
</P>
<P>
A prominent feature of a cult is its hierarchical structure,
through which practitioners strictly follow the instructions of
their senior members and are willing to sacrifice themselves for
this spiritual leader. Li Hongzhi, founder of the Falun Gong cult,
demands that his disciples think, act and even give their lives at
his command, it says.
</P>
<P>
-- Visiting Chinese President Jiang Zemin met in Lisbon
Wednesday with Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Guterres.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister said that China is one of the most ancient

<HEADLINE> Bank Indonesia to Issue New Bank Note </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Bank Indonesia will issue
100,000 rupiah (about 14 U.S. dollars) bank notes starting
November 1 to anticipate an increased demand for cash as a result
of worries about the Year 2000 computer bug.
</P>
<P>
"This is to anticipate soaring public demand for cash ahead of
the Millennium Bug or Y2K," Bank Indonesia Deputy Governor Aulia
Pohan said.
</P>
<P>
Pohan said the Y2K World Committee required all central banks
to increase their cash supplies by five times the normal level as
part of the contingency plan to deal with Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
The Y2K bug stems from computer programs which use only two
digits to denote the year. Older computers could mistake 2000 for
1900 and crash at the beginning of the new year.
</P>
<P>
Non-Y2K-compliant computers could fail and disrupt the banking
system.
</P>
<P>
Pohan urged the public not to panic as 2000 approaches.
</P>
<P>
He said the country's 20 largest banks, which handle 80 percent
of banking transactions, were 100 percent Y2K compliant.
</P>
<P>
Smaller banks which were not fully Y2K compliant had prepared
contingency plans, including preparing for manual operation.
</P>
<P>
Pohan also said the issuance of the new 100,000 rupiah notes
was aimed at facilitating cash transaction.
</P>
<P>
The hyperinflation which hit the country last year caused the
50,000 rupiah note, currently the largest denomination in
circulation, to become less valuable.
</P>
<P>
Inflation has plagued Indonesia since the economy suffered
hyperinflation of more than 77 percent last year. However,
inflation seems to have been controlled, with inflation for 1999
predicted to come in at about 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Pohan said the central bank would print up to 50 trillion
rupiah of the new 100,000 rupiah notes before the new year.
</P>
<P>
He, however, dismissed concerns printing the new notes would
spark inflation.
</P>
<P>
The central bank would control the money supply and issue the
new notes gradually, according to demand, Pohan was quoted by the
Jakarta Post Thursday as saying.

earthquakes and reduce the impact of such disasters.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday and Wednesday, the delegation will go to Tangshan to
collect information on how to undertake post-quake reconstruction.
</P>

WASHINGTON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Center Matt Geiger will be
sidelined four to six weeks with an injured left knee, leaving the
Philadelphia 76ers without two frontcourt starters to open the

Ratliff already is sidelined for at least three weeks with a

<HEADLINE> Hornets' Coleman Arrested After Traffic Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Charlotte Hornets forward
Derrick Coleman was charged with driving while intoxicated early
this morning in an auto accident that left teammate Eldridge
Recasner hospitalized with a partially collapsed lung in North
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
Coleman was arrested and charged with DWI after his car,
containing Recasner and a female friend, collided with a tractor-
trailer.
</P>
<P>
According to the Charlotte-Mecklenburg police, Coleman said he
was trying to make a left turn at a green light when his vehicle
was struck.
</P>
<P>
The driver of the tractor-trailer, Andrew Peter Roe, told
authorities he was trying to go through the intersection when
Coleman pulled his truck directly in front of him.
</P>
<P>
A witness corroborated Roe's claim and Coleman was arrested for
DWI. Coleman was questioned by police at the scene but was not
brought to Mecklenburg Jail Central. His blood-alcohol level could
not be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
Coleman, Recasner and Ebony Kimbrough were taken to Carolinas
Medical Center. Coleman was treated for cuts on his nose and
forehead and released, while Recasner is expected to remain in the
hospital for a few days, a team spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Recasner, a reserve guard, also sustained a badly bruised chest
and shoulder, while Kimbrough was released after being treated for
facial lacerations.
</P>
<P>
In April, Coleman was arrested in Detriot on a misdemeanor
charge of interfering with a police officer outside of a nightclub.
Last month, owners of a Detriot restaurant sued him over an
allegation Coleman urinated in the dining room in front of
customers.
</P>
<P>
Coleman signed a five-year, $40 million deal with the Hornets
before the lockout-abbreviated 1999 season. He averaged 13.1
points in 37 games and led the team with 8.9 rebounds a contest.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
may visit India and Bangladesh next February or March but will
skip Pakistan because of its military coup, a U.S. official said
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We haven't come to a final decision," the official said.
"Things seem to have settled down in India, but obviously Pakistan
has become a real problem."
</P>
<P>
Clinton has long wanted to visit India and Pakistan but his
plans have been thrown in disarray by their tit-for-tat nuclear
tests in May 1998 and by the military coup in Pakistan on Oct. 12
that ousted Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials have previously suggested that Washington
might use the threat of Clinton visiting India but skipping
Pakistan as a way to try to nudge Pakistan's military leader
Pervez Musharraf to move toward returning to civilian rule.

<HEADLINE> Algeria's President to Visit Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Algerian President Abdelaziz
Bouteflika will be in Italy on November 15-17 to strengthen
friendship and cooperation between the two Mediteranean countries,
making his first to a European country since his election in
April, which was marked by a cooling in relations with France.
</P>
<P>
According to Italian news agency Ansa, French officials were
critical of the fact that, when it came to the vote, Bouteflika
was the only candidate left in the running since all his rivals
withdrew.
</P>
<P>
Italian President Ciampi met Bouteflika and invited him to
visit Italy when they were both in Rabat on July 25 for the
funeral of Morocco's King Hassan II.
</P>
<P>
They also had a telephone conversation described by
presidential sources as "cordial" when Bouteflika was in Rimini on
a private visit on August 23.
</P>
<P>
Ciampi's invitation was accepted on that occasion, and Ciampi
also voiced appreciation for Bouteflika's efforts to achieve
national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Both statesmen also urged a strengthening of bilateral
cooperation and consolidation between Algeria and the EU, a factor
that the Italian president considers as fundamental for progress,
stability and peace in the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
Bouteflika's election was seen by many analysts as marking the
beginning of the end for Algeria's 7-year domestic terrorism
crisis pitting Islamic fundamentalist guerrillas against the then
military-led government.
